chapter one on on the whole were a murderous race according to genesis it took as few as four people to make the planet too crowded to stand and the first murder was a fratricide genesis says that in a fit of jealous rage the very first child born to mortal parents cain snapped and popped the first metaphorical cap in another human being the attack was a bloody brutal violent reprehensible killing cains brother abel probably never saw it coming as i opened the door to my apartment i was filled with a sense of empathic sympathy and intuitive understanding for freaking cain my apartment isnt much more than a big room in the basement of a centuryold wooden boardinghouse in chicago theres a kitchen built into an alcove a big fireplace almost always lit a bedroom the size of the bed of a pickup truck and a bathroom that barely fits a sink toilet and shower i cant afford really good furniture so its all secondhand but comfortable i have a lot of books on shelves a lot of rugs a lot of candles it isnt much but at least its clean or used to be the rugs were in total disarray exposing bare patches of stone floor one of the easy chairs had fallen over onto its back and no one had picked it up cushions were missing from the couch and the curtains had been torn down from one of the sunken windows letting in a swath of lateafternoon sunshine all the better to illuminate the books that had been knocked down from one of my shelves and scattered everywhere bending paperback covers leaving hardbacks all the way open and generally messing up my primary source of idle entertainment the fireplace was more or less the epicenter of the slobquake there were discarded clothes there a couple of empty wine bottles and a plate that looked suspiciously cleandoubtless the cleanup work of the other residents i took a stunned step into my home as i did my big grey tom mister bounded down from his place on top of one of the bookshelves but rather than give me his usual shoulderblock of greeting he flicked his tail disdainfully at me and ghosted out the front door i sighed walked over to the kitchen alcove and checked the cats bowls of food and water were both empty no wonder he was grumpy a shaggy section of the kitchen floor hauled itself to its feet and came to meet me with a sheepish sleepy shuffle my dog mouse had started off as fuzzy little grey puppy that fit into my coat pocket now almost a year later i sometimes wished id sent my coat to the cleaners or something mouse had gone from fuzz ball to fuzz barge you couldnt guess at a breed to look at him but at least one of his parents must have been a wooly mammoth the dogs shoulders came nearly to my waist and the vet didnt think he was finished growing yet that translated into an awful lot of beast for my tiny apartment oh and mouses bowls were empty too he nuzzled my hand his muzzle stained with what looked suspiciously like spaghetti sauce and then pawed at his bowls scraping them over the patch of linoleum floor dammit mouse i growled cainlike its still like this if hes here im going to kill him mouse let out a chuffing breath that was about as much commentary as he ever made and followed placidly a couple of steps behind me as i walked over to the closed bedroom door just as i got there the door opened and an angelfaced blonde wearing nothing but a cotton tshirt appeared in it not a long shirt either it didnt cover all of her rib cage oh she drawled with a slow and sleepy smile excuse me i didnt know anyone else was here without a trace of modesty she slunk into the living room pawing through the mess near the fireplace extracting pieces of clothing from the languid satisfied way she moved i figured she expected me to be staring at her and that she didnt mind it at all at one time i would have been embarrassed as hell by this kind of thing and probably sneaking covert glances but after living with my half brother the incubus for most of a year i mostly found it annoying i rolled my eyes and asked thomas tommy shower i think the girl said she slipped into jogging wearsweatpants a matching jacket expensive shoes do me a favor tell him that it i interrupted her in an impatient voice that it was a lot of fun youll always treasure it but that it was a onetime thing and that you hope he grows up to find a nice girl or be president or something she stared at me and then knitted her blond brows into a frown you dont have to be such a bast then her eyes widened oh oh im sorryoh my god she leaned toward me blushing and said in a betweenusgirls whisper i would never have guessed that he was with a man how do the two of you manage on that tiny bed i blinked and said now wait a minute but she ignored me and walked out murmuring he is such a naughty boy i glared at her back then i glared at mouse mouses tongue lolled out in a doggy grin his dark tail waving gently oh shut up i told him and closed the door i heard the whisper of water running through the pipes in my shower i put out food for mister and mouse and the dog partook immediately he could have fed the damned dog at least i muttered and opened the fridge i rummaged through it but couldnt find what i was after anywhere and it was the last straw my frustration grew into a fire somewhere inside my eyeballs and i straightened from the icebox with mayhem in mind hey came thomass voice from behind me were out of beer i turned around and glared at my half brother thomas was a shade over six feet tall and i guess now that id had time to get used to the idea he looked something like me stark cheekbones a long face a strong jaw but whatever sculptor had done the finishing work on thomas had foisted my features off on his apprentice or something im not ugly or anything but thomas looked like someones painting of the forgotten greek god of body cologne he had long hair so dark that light itself could not escape it and even fresh from the shower it was starting to curl his eyes were the color of thunderclouds and he never did a single moment of exercise to earn the gratuitous amount of ripple in his musculature he was wearing jeans and no shirthis standard household uniform i once saw him answer the door to speak to a female missionary in the same outfit and shed assaulted him in a cloud of forgotten copies of the watchtower the tooth marks she left had been interesting it hadnt been the girls fault entirely thomas had inherited his fathers blood as a vampire of the white court he was a psychic predator feeding on the raw life force of human beingsusually easiest to gain through the intimate contact of sex that part of him surrounded him in the kind of aura that turned heads wherever he went when thomas made the effort to turn up the supernatural comehither women literally couldnt tell him no by the time he started feeding they couldnt even want to tell him no he was killing them just a little bit but he had to do it to stay sane and he never took it any further than a single feeding he could have those the white court chose as their prey became ensnared in the ecstasy of being fed upon and became increasingly enslaved by their vampire lover but thomas never pushed it that far hed made that mistake once and the woman he had loved now drifted through life in a wheelchair bound in a deathly euphoria because of his touch i clenched my teeth and reminded myself that it wasnt easy for thomas then i told myself that i was repeating myself way too many times and to shut up i know theres no beer i growled or milk or coke um he said and i see that you didnt have time to feed mister and mouse did you take mouse outside at least well sure he said i mean uh i took him out this morning when you were leaving for work remember thats where i met angie another jogger i said once more cainlike you told me you werent going to keep bringing strangers back here thomas and on my freaking bed hells bells man look at this place he did and i saw it dawn on him as if he literally hadnt seen it before he let out a groan damn harry im sorry it was angie is a really really intense and uh athletic person and i didnt realize that he paused and picked up a copy of dean koontzs watchers he tried to fold the crease out of the cover wow he added lamely the place is sort of trashed yeah i told him you were here all day you said youd take mouse to the vet and clean up a little and get groceries oh come on he said whats the big deal i dont have a beer i growled i looked around at the rubble and i got a call from murphy at work today she said shed be dropping by thomas lifted his eyebrows oh yeah no offense harry but im doubting it was a booty call i glared would you stop it with that already im telling you you should just ask her out and get it over with shed say yes i slammed the door to the icebox it isnt like that i said yeah okay thomas said mildly it isnt we work together were friends thats all right he agreed i am not interested in dating murphy i said and shes not interested in me sure sure i hear you he rolled his eyes and started picking up fallen books which is why you want the place looking nice so your business friend wont mind staying around for a little bit i gritted my teeth and said stars and stones thomas im not asking you for the freaking moon im not asking you for rent it wouldnt kill you to pitch in a little with errands before you go to work yeah thomas said running his hand through his hair um about that what about it i demanded he was supposed to be gone for the afternoon so that my housecleaning service could come in the faeries wouldnt show up to clean when someone could see them and they wouldnt show up ever again if i told someone about them dont ask me why theyre like that maybe theyve got a really strict union or something thomas shrugged a shoulder and sat down on the arm of the couch not looking at me i didnt have the cash for the vet or the groceries he said i got fired again i stared at him for a second and tried to keep up a good head of steam on my anger but it melted i recognized the frustration and humiliation in his voice he wasnt faking it dammit i muttered only partly to thomas what happened the usual he said the drivethrough manager she followed me into the walkin freezer and started ripping her clothes off the owner walked through on an inspection about then and fired me on the spot from the look he was giving her i think she was going to get a promotion i hate gender discrimination at least it was a woman this time i said weve got to keep working on your control his voice turned bitter half of my soul is a demon he said it cant be controlled its impossible i dont buy that i said just because youre a wizard doesnt mean you know a damned thing about it he said i cant live a mortal life im not made for it youre doing fine fine he demanded voice rising i can disintegrate a virgins inhibitions at fifty paces but i cant last two weeks at a job where im wearing a stupid hairnet and a paper hat in what way is that fine he slammed open the small trunk where he kept his clothes seized a pair of shoes and his leather jacket put them on with angry precision and stalked out into the gathering evening without looking back and without cleaning up his mess i thought uncharitably then i shook my head and glanced at mouse who had lain down with his chin on his paws doggy eyes sad thomas was the only family id ever known but that didnt change the truth thomas wasnt adjusting well to living life like normal folks he was damned good at being a vampire that came naturally but no matter how hard he tried to be something a little more like normal he kept running into one problem after another he never said anything about it but i could sense the pain and despair growing in him as the weeks went by mouse let out a quiet breath that wasnt quite a whine i know i told the beast i worry about him too i took mouse on a long walk and got back in as lateoctober dusk was settling over chicago i got my mail out of the box and started for the stairs down to my apartment when a car pulled in to the boardinghouses small gravel lot and crunched to a stop a few steps away a petite blonde in jeans a blue buttondown shirt and a satin white sox windbreaker slipped the car into park and left the engine running as she got out karrin murphy looked like anything but the head of a division of law enforcement in charge of dealing with everything that went bump in the night in the whole greater chicago area when trolls started mugging passersby when vampires left their victims dead or dying in the streets or when someone with more magical firepower than conscience went berserk chicago pds special investigations department was tasked to investigate of course no one seriously believed in trolls or vampires or evil sorcerers but when something weird happened si was in charge of explaining to everyone how it had been only a man in a rubber mask and that there was nothing to worry about si had a sucky job but the men and women who worked there werent stupid they were perfectly aware that there were things out there in the darkness that were beyond the scope of conventional understanding murphy in particular was determined to give the cops every edge they could get when dealing with a preternatural threat and i was one of her best weapons she would hire me on as a consultant when si went up against something really dangerous or alien and the fees i got working with si paid the lions share of my expenses when mouse saw murphy he made a little huffing sound of greeting and trotted over to her his tail wagging if i had leaned back and kept my legs straight i could have gone skiing over the gravel but other than that the big dog left me with no option but to come along murphy knelt down at once to dig her hands into the fur behind mouses floppy ears scratching vigorously hey there boy she said smiling how are you mouse slobbered several doggy kisses onto her hands murphy said yuck but she was laughing while she did she pushed mouses muzzle gently away rising evening harry glad i caught you i was just getting back from my evening drag i said you want to come in murphy had a cute face and very blue eyes her golden hair was pulled back into a ponytail and it made her look a lot younger than usual her expression was a careful maybe even uncomfortable one im sorry but i cant she said ive got a plane to catch i dont really have time ah i said whats up im going out of town for a few days she said i should be back sometime monday afternoon i was hoping i could talk you into watering my plants for me oh i said she wanted me to water her plants how coy how sexy yeah sure i can do that thanks she said and offered me a key on a single steel ring its the backdoor key i accepted it where you headed the discomfort in her expression deepened oh out of town on a little vacation i blinked i havent had a vacation in years she said defensively ive got it coming well sure i said um so a vacation by yourself she shrugged a shoulder well thats sort of the other thing i wanted to talk to you about im not expecting any trouble but i wanted you to know where i was and with who in case i dont show up on time right right i said doesnt hurt to be careful she nodded im going to hawaii with kincaid i blinked some more um i said you mean on a job right she shifted her weight from one hip to the other no weve gone out a few times its nothing serious murphy i protested are you insane that guy is major bad news she glowered at me weve had this discussion before im a grownup dresden i know i said but this guy is a mercenary a killer hes not even completely human you cant trust him you did she pointed out last year against mavra and her scourge i scowled that was different oh she asked yeah i was paying him to kill things i wasnt taking him to buh to the beach murphy arched an eyebrow at me you wont be safe around him i said im not doing it to be safe she replied her cheeks colored a little thats sort of the point you shouldnt go i said she looked up at me for a moment frowning then she asked why because i dont want to see you get hurt i said and because you deserve someone better than he is she studied my face for a moment more and then exhaled through her nose im not running off to vegas to get married dresden i work all the time and life is going right by me i just want to take the time to live it a little before its too late she pulled a folded index card out of her pocket this is the hotel ill be at if you need to get in touch or anything i took the folded index card still frowning and full of the intuition that i had missed something her fingers brushed mine but i couldnt feel it through the glove and all the scars you sure youll be all right she nodded im a big girl harry im the one choosing where were going he doesnt know where i figured he couldnt set anything up ahead of time if he had any funny business in mind she made a vague gesture toward the gun she carried in a shoulder holster under her jacket ill be careful i promise yeah i said i didnt even try to smile at her for the record this is stupid murph i hope you dont get killed her blue eyes flashed and she frowned i was sort of hoping youd say something like have a good time yeah i said whatever have fun leave me a message when you get there yes she said thanks for looking out for my plants no problem i said she nodded at me and lingered there for a second more then she scratched mouse behind the ears again got in her car and drove off i watched her go feeling worried and jealous really really jealous holy crap was thomas right after all mouse made a whining sound and pawed at my leg i sighed stuck the hotel information in a pocket and led the dog back to the apartment when i opened my door my nose was assaulted with the scent of fresh pinenot pine cleaner mind you real fresh pine and nary a needle in sight the faeries had come and gone and the books were back on the shelves the floor scrubbed curtains repaired dishes done you name it they may have weird bylaws but faerie housecleaning runs a tight ship i lit candles with matches from a box i had sitting on my coffee table as a wizard i dont get on so well with newfangled things like electricity and computers so i didnt bother to try to keep electric service up and running in my home my icebox is a vintage model run on actual ice theres no water heater and i do all my cooking on a little woodburning stove i fired it up and heated some soup which was about the only thing left in the house i sat down to eat it and started going through my mail the usual the marketing savants at best buy continued in their unabated efforts to sell me the latest laptop cell phone or plasma television despite my repeated verbal and written assurances that i didnt have electricity and that they shouldnt bother my autoinsurance bill had arrived early two checks came the first a token fee from chicago pd for consulting with murphy on a smuggling case for an hour the previous month the second was a much meatier check from a coin collector who had lost a case of cash from dead nations over the side of his yacht in lake michigan and resorted to trying out the only wizard in the phone book to locate them the last envelope was a big yellow manila number and i felt a nauseating little ripple flutter through my guts the second i saw the handwriting on it it was written in soulless letters as neat as a kindergarten classroom poster and as uninflected as an english professors lecture notes my name my address nothing else there was no rational reason for it but that handwriting scared me i wasnt sure what had triggered my instincts unless it was the singular lack of anything remarkable or imperfect about it for a second i thought i had gotten upset for no reason that it was a simple printed font but there was a flourish on the last letter of dresden that didnt match the other ns the flourish looked perfect too and deliberate it was there to let me know that this was inhuman handwriting not some laser printer from walmart i laid the envelope flat on my coffee table and stared at it it was thin undeformed by its contents which meant that it was holding a few sheets of paper at the most that meant that it wasnt a bomb well more accurately it wasnt a hightech bomb which was a fairly useless weapon to use against a wizard a lowtech explosive setup could have worked just fine but they wouldnt be that small of course that left mystical means of attack i lifted my left hand toward the envelope reaching out with my wizards senses but i couldnt get them focused with a grimace i peeled the leather driving glove off of my left hand revealing my scarred and ruined fingers id burned my hand so badly a year before that the doctors id seen had mostly recommended amputation i hadnt let them take my hand mostly for the same reason i still drove the same junky old vw beetlebecause it was mine by thunder but my fingers were pretty horrible to look at as was the rest of my left hand i didnt have much movement in them anymore but i spread them as best i could and reached out to feel the energies of magic moving around the envelope once more i might as well have kept the glove on there was nothing odd about the envelope no magical booby traps right then no more delays i picked up the envelope in my weak left hand and tore it open then upended the contents onto the coffee table there were three things in the envelope the first was an eightbyten color photo and it was a shot of karrin murphy director of chicago pds special investigations division she wasnt in uniform though or even in business attire instead she was wearing a red cross jacket and baseball hat and she was holding a sawedoff shotgun an illegal model in her hands it was belching flame in the picture you could also see a man standing a few feet away covered in blood from the waist down a long black steel shaft protruded from his chest as if hed been impaled on it his upper body and head were a blur of dark lines and red blobs the shotgun was pointing right at the blur the second was another picture this one was of murphy with her hat off standing over the mans corpse and i was in the frame with her my face in profile the man had been a renfield a psychotically violent creature that was human only in the most technical sensebut then the camera shot of his murder was a most technical witness murphy and i and a mercenary named kincaid had gone after a nest of vampires of the black court led by a deadly vampire named mavra her minions had objected pretty strenuously id gotten my hand badly burned when mavra herself took the field against us and i had been lucky to get away that lightly in the end wed rescued hostages dismembered some vampires and killed mavra or at least wed killed someone we were meant to think was mavra in retrospect it seemed odd that a vampire known for being able to render herself all but undetectable had lurched out at us from the smoke and ash of her ruined stronghold to be beheaded but id had a full day and i had been ready to take it on faith we tried to be as careful as we could during the attack as a result we saved some lives we might not have if wed gone in hellforleather but that renfield had come damn close to taking my head off murphy killed him for it and shed been photographed doing it i stared at the photos the pictures were from different angles that meant that someone else had been in the room taking them someone we hadnt even seen the third item that fell to the coffee table was a piece of typewriter paper covered in the same handwriting as the address on the envelope it read dresden i desire a meeting with you and offer a truce for the duration bound by my word of honor to be upheld meet with me at seven pm tonight at your grave in graceland cemetery in order to help me avoid taking actions that would be unfortunate to you and your ally in the police mavra the final third of the letter had a lock of golden hair taped to it i held the picture up next to the letter the hair was murphys mavra had her number with pictures of her committing a felony and with me aiding and abetting no less mavra could have her out of the cops and behind bars in hours but even worse was the lock of hair mavra was a skilled sorceress and might have been as strong as a fullfledged wizard with a lock of murphys hair she could do virtually anything she pleased to murph and there wouldnt be squat anyone could do about it mavra could kill her mavra could worse than kill her it didnt take me long to make up my mind in supernatural circles a pledge of truce based upon a word of honor was an institution especially among the oldworld types like mavra if she was offering a truce so that we could talk she meant it she wanted to deal i stared down at the pictures she wanted to deal and she was going to be negotiating from a position of strength it meant blackmail and if i didnt play along murphy was as good as dead chapter two the dog and i went to my grave graceland cemetery is famous you can look it up in just about any chicago tour bookor god knows probably on the internet its the largest cemetery in town and one of the oldest there are walls substantial ones all the way around and it has far more than its share of ghost stories and attendant shades the graves inside range from simple plots with simple headstones to lifesized replicas of greek temples egyptian obelisks mammoth statueseven a pyramid its the las vegas of boneyards and my grave is in it the cemetery isnt open after dark most arent and theres a reason for it everybody knows the reason and nobody talks about it it isnt because there are dead people in there its because there are notquitedead people in there ghosts and shadows linger in graveyards more than anywhere else especially in the older cities of the country where the oldest biggest cemeteries are right there in the middle of town thats why people build walls around graveyards even if theyre only two feet highnot to keep people out but to keep other things in walls can have a kind of power in the spirit world and the walls around graveyards are almost always filled with the unspoken intent of keeping the living and the unliving seated at different sections of the community dinner table the gates were locked and there was an attendant in a small building too solid to be called a shack and too small to be called anything else but id been there a few times and i knew several ways to get in and out after dark if need be there was a portion of the fence in the northeast corner where a road construction crew just outside had left a large mound of gravel and it sloped far enough up the wall that even a man with one good hand and a large and ungainly dog could reach the top we went in mouse and i mouse might have been large but he was barely more than a puppy and he still had paws that looked too big for his lean frame the dog had been built on the scale of those statues outside chinese restaurants thoughbroad chested and powerful with that same mountainous strength built into his muzzle his coat was a dark and almost uniform grey marked on the tips of his fuzzy ears his tail and his lower legs with solid black he looked a little gangly and clumsy now but after a few more months of adding on muscle he was going to be a real monster and damned if i minded the company of my own personal monster going to meet a vampire over my grave i found it not far from a rather famous grave of a little girl named inez who had died a century before the little girls grave had a statue mounted on it id seen it often and it looked mostly like carrolls original alice a cherub in a prim and proper victorian dress supposedly the childs ghost would occasionally animate the statue and run and play among the graves and the neighborhoods near the graveyard id never seen her myself but hey the statue was missing my grave is one of the more humble ones there its standing open toothe vampire noble who bought it for me had set it up to be that way shed gotten me a coffin on permanent standby too sort of like the president gets air force one only a little more morbid dead force one my headstone is simple white marble a vertical stone but its engraved in bold letters inlaid with gold harry dresden then a goldinlaid pentacle a fivepointed star surrounded by a circlethe symbol of the forces of magic contained within mortal will underneath it are more letters he died doing the right thing its a sobering sort of place to visit i mean were all going to die we know that on an intellectual level we figure it out sometime when were still fairly young and it scares us so badly that we convince ourselves were immortal for more than a decade afterward death isnt something anyone likes to think about but the fact is that you cant get out of it no matter what you do how much you exercise how religiously you diet or meditate or pray or how much money you donate to your church there is a single hard cold fact that faces everyone on earth one day its going to be over one day the sun will rise the world will turn people will go about their daily routinesonly you wont be in it youll be still and cold and despite every religious faith the testimony of neardeath eyewitnesses and the imaginations of storytellers throughout history death remains the ultimate mystery no one truly definitively knows what happens after and thats assuming there is an after we all go there blind to whatever is out there in the darkness beyond death you cant escape it you will die thats a bitter hideously concrete fact to endurebut believe me you get it in a whole new range of color and texture when you face it standing over your own open grave i stood there among silent headstones and memorials both sober and outrageous and the lateoctober moon shone down on me it was too cold for crickets but the sound of traffic sirens car alarms overhead jets and distant loud music the pulse of chicago kept me company mist had risen off of lake michigan like it did a lot of nights but tonight it had come on exceptionally thick and tendrils of it drifted through the graves and around the stones there was a silent crackling tension in the air a kind of muted energy that was common in late autumn halloween was almost here and the borders between chicago and the spirit world the nevernever were at their weakest i could sense the restless shades of the graveyard most of them too feeble ever to manifest to mortal eyes stirring in the roiling mist tasting the energyladen air mouse sat beside me ears forward and alert his gaze shifting regularly eyes focused his attention obvious enough to make me think that he could literally see the things i could only vaguely feel but whatever was out there it didnt bother him he sat beside me in silence content to leave his head under my gloved hand i wore my long leather duster its mantle falling almost to my elbows along with black fatigue pants a sweater and old combat boots i carried my wizards staff with me in my right hand a length of solid oak handcarved with flowing runes and sigils all up and down its length my mothers silver pentacle hung by a chain around my neck my scarred flesh could barely feel the silver bracelet hung with tiny shields on my left wrist but it was there several cloves of garlic tied together in a big lump lay in my dusters pocket and brushed against my leg when i shifted my weight the group of odd items would have looked innocuous enough to the casual eye but they amounted to a magical arsenal that had seen me through plenty of trouble mavra had given me her word of honor but i had plenty of other enemies who would love to take a shot at me i wasnt going to make myself an easy target but standing around in the haunted graveyard in the dark started to make me nervous fast come on i muttered after a few minutes whats taking her so long mouse let out a growl so low and quiet that i barely heard itbut i could feel the dogs sudden tension and wariness quivering up through my maimed hand shaking my arm to the elbow i gripped my staff checking all around me mouse was doing much the same until his dark eyes started tracking something i couldnt see whatever it was judging from mouses gaze it was getting closer then there was a quiet rushing sound and mouse crouched nose pointed at my open grave his teeth bared i stepped closer to my grave patches of mist flowed down into it from the green grounds i muttered under my breath took off my amulet and pushed some of my will into the fivepointed star causing it to glow with a low blue light i draped the amulet over the fingers of my left hand while i gripped the staff in my right and peered down into the grave the mist inside it suddenly gathered congealed and flowed into the form of a withered corpsethat of a woman emaciated and dried as though from years in the earth the corpse wore a gown and kirtle medieval style the former green and the latter black the fabric was simple cottonmodern manufacture then and not actual historic dress mouses snarl bubbled up into a more audible rumbling snarl the corpse sat up opened milkwhite eyes and focused on me it lifted a hand in which it held a white lily and held it toward me then the corpse spoke in a voice that was all rasp and whisper wizard dresden a flower for your grave mavra i said youre late there was a headwind the vampire answered she flicked her wrist and the lily arched up out of the grave and landed on my headstone she followed it out with a similar uncannily smooth motion that reminded me of a spider in its eerie grace i noted that she wore a sword and a dagger on a weapons belt at her waist they looked old and worn and i was betting that they were not of modern make she came to a halt and faced me from across my grave her face turned very slightly away from the blue light of my amulet her cataract eyes steady on mouse you kept your hand after those burns i would have thought you would have amputated it its mine i said and its none of your business and youre wasting my time the vampires corpse lips stretched into a smile flakes of dead flesh fell down from the corners of her mouth brittle hair like dried straw had mostly been broken off to the length of a finger but here and there longer strands the color of bread mold brushed the shoulders of her dress youre allowing your mortality to make you impatient dresden surely you want to take this opportunity to discuss your assault on my scourge no i slipped my amulet on again and rested my hand on mouses head im not here to socialize youve got dirt on murphy and you want something from me lets have it her laugh was full of cobwebs and sandpaper i forget how young you are until i see you she said life is fleeting dresden if you insist on keeping yours you ought to enjoy it funny thing is trading insults with an egotistical super zombie just isnt my idea of a good time i said mouse punctuated the sentence with another rumbling growl i turned my shoulders from her starting to turn away if thats all you had in mind im leaving she laughed harder and the sound of it spooked the hell out of me maybe it was the atmosphere but something about it the way that it simply lacked anything to do with the things that should motivate laughter there was no warmth in it no humanity no kindness no joy it was like mavra herselfit had the withered human shell but underneath it all was something from a nightmare very well mavra said we shall embrace brevity i faced her again wary something in her manner had changed and it was setting off all my alarm bells find the word of kemmler she said then she turned dark skirts flaring one hand resting negligently upon her sword and started to leave hey i choked thats it thats it she said without turning wait a minute i said she paused what the hell is the word of kemmler a trail leading to what i asked power and you want it yes and you want me to find it yes alone tell no one of our agreement or what you are doing i took in a slow breath what happens if i tell you to go to hell mavra silently lifted a single arm there was a photo between two of her desiccated fingers and even in the moonlight i could see that it was of murphy ill stop you i said and if i dont ill come after you if you hurt her ill kill you so hard your last ten victims will make miraculous recoveries i wont have to touch her she said ill send the evidence to the police the mortal authorities will prosecute her you cant do that i said wizards and vampires may be at war but we leave the mortals out of it once you get mortal authorities involved the council will do it as well and then the reds you could escalate matters into global chaos if i intended to employ the mortal authorities against you perhaps mavra said you are white council my stomach twisted with sudden sickened understanding i was a member of the white council of wizards a solid citizen of the supernatural realms but murphy wasnt the protector of the people mavra all but purred the defender of the law will find herself a convicted murderer and her only explanation would make her sound like a madwoman she is prepared to die in battle wizard but i wont merely kill her i will unmake her i will destroy the labor of her life and her heart you bitch i said of course she looked at me over her shoulder and unless you are prepared to unmake mortal civilizationor at least enough of it to impose your will upon itthere is nothing you can do to stop me fury exploded somewhere in my chest and rolled out through my body and thoughts in a red fire mouse rolled forward toward mavra a step shaking the mist around us with a rising growl and i didnt realize at first that he was following my lead like hell there isnt i snarled if i hadnt agreed to a truce i would mavras corpseyellow teeth appeared in a ghastly smile kill me in my tracks wizard but it will do you no good unless i put a halt to it the pictures and other evidence will be sent to the police and i will do so only once i am satisfied with your retrieval of the word of kemmler find it bring it to me before three midnights hence and i will turn over the evidence to you you have my word she dropped the photo of murphy and some kind of purple nauseating light played over it for a second as it fell to the ground there was the acrid smell of scorched chemicals when i looked back up at mavra there was no one there i walked slowly over to the fallen photo struggling to slap my anger aside quick enough to reach out with my supernatural senses i didnt feel any of mavras presence anywhere near me and over the next several seconds my dogs growls died down to low wary sounds of uncertainty and then to silence while i wasnt quite certain of the all the details mouse wasnt your average dog and if mouse didnt sense lurking bad guys it was because there werent any bad guys lurking the vampire was gone i picked up the photo murphys picture had been marred the dark energy had left scorch marks in the shape of numbers over murphys face a phone number cute my righteous fury kept on fading and i missed it once it was gone there was going to be only sick worry and fear left in its place if i didnt work for one of the worst of the bad guys ive ever dealt with murphy would get hung out to dry said bad guy was after powerand was on a deadline to boot if mavra needed something that soon it meant that some kind of power struggle was about to go down and three midnights hence meant halloween night aside from ruining my birthday it meant that black magic was going to be brought into play sometime soon and at this time of year that could mean only one thing necromancy i stood there in the boneyard staring down at my grave and started shivering partly from the cold i felt very alone mouse exhaled a breath that was not quite a whimper of distress and leaned against me come on boy i told him lets get you home no sense in more than one of us getting involved with this chapter three i needed some answers time to hit the lab mouse and i returned to my apartment in the blue beetle the beatup old volkswagen bug that is my faithful steed blue is kind of a metaphorical description the car has had various doors and panels replaced with white yellow red and green my mechanic mike had managed to pound the hood more or less back into its original condition which id bent out of shape while ramming a bad guy but i hadnt had the money to repaint so now the car had primer grey added to its ensemble mouse had been growing too quickly to be very graceful about getting out of the car he filled up most of the backseat and when climbing from there to the front and then out the driversside door he reminded me of some footage ive seen of an elephant seal flopping through a new zealand parking lot he emerged happily enough though panting and waving his tail contentedly mouse liked going places in the car that the place had happened to be a clandestine meeting in a freaking graveyard didnt seem to spoil anything for him it was all about the journey not the destination a very zen soul was mouse mister hadnt come back yet and neither had thomas i tried not to think too hard about that mister had been on his own when i found him and he frequently went rambling he could take care of himself thomas had managed to survive for all but the last several months of his life without me he could take care of himself too i didnt have to worry about either of them right yeah right i disarmed my wards the spells that protected my home from various supernatural intrusions and slipped inside with mouse i built up the fire a bit and the dog settled down in front of it with a pleased sigh then i ditched my coat grabbed my thick old flannel robe and a coke and headed downstairs i live in a basement apartment but a trapdoor underneath one of my rugs opens up on a folding wooden stair ladder that leads down to the subbasement and my lab its cold down there yearround which is why i wear the heavy robe its one more drop of romance sucked out of the wizarding mystique but i stay comfortable bob i said as i climbed down into the pitchdark lab warm up the memory banks ive got work to do the first lights in the room to flicker on were the size and goldenorange color of candle flames they shone out from the eye sockets of a skull slowly growing brighter until i could see the entire shelf the skull rested upona simple wooden board on the wall covered in candles romance novels a number of small items and the pale human skull about time the skull mumbled its been weeks since you needed me tis the season i said most of the halloween jobs start looking the same after a few years no need to consult you when i already know the answers i need if you were so smart bob muttered you wouldnt need me now thats right i told him i pulled a box of kitchen matches out of my robes pockets and began lighting candles i started with a bunch of them on a metal table running down the center of the small room youre a spirit of knowledge whereas i am only human right said bob drawing out the word are you feeling all right harry i continued on lighting candles on the white wire shelves and workbenches on the three walls in a c shape around the long steel table my shelves were still crowded with plastic dishes lids coffee cans bags boxes tins vials flasks and every other kind of small container you can imagine filled with all kinds of substances as mundane as lint and as exotic as octopus ink i had several hundred pounds worth of books and notebooks on the shelves some arranged neatly and some stacked hastily where theyd been when last i left them i hadnt been down to the lab for a while and i dont allow the faeries access so there was a little bit of dust over everything why do you ask i said well bob said his tone careful youre complimenting me which is never good plus lighting all of your candles with matches so i said so you can light all the candles with that stupid little spell you made up bob said and you keep dropping the box because of your burned hand so its taken you seven matches now to keep lighting those candles i fumbled and dropped the matchbox again from my stiff gloved fingers eight he said i suppressed a growl struck a fresh match and did it too forcefully snapping it nine bob said shut up i told him you got it boss im the best at shutting up i lit the last few candles and bob said so did you come down here to get my help when you start working on your new blasting rod no i said bob ive only got the one hand i cant carve it with one hand you could use a vise grip the skull suggested im not ready i said my maimed fingers burned and throbbed im just not youd better get ready bob said its only a matter of time before some nasty shows up and i shot the skull a hard look all right all right bob said if he had hands the skull would have raised them in a gesture of surrender so youre telling me you still wont use any fire magic stars and stones i sighed so im using matches instead of my candle spell and im too busy to get the new blasting rod done its not a big deal theres just not much call for blowing anything up or burning it to cinders on my average day harry bob asked are your feet wet and can you see the pyramids i blinked what earth to dresden bob said you are standing kneedeep in de nile i threw the matchbook at the skull it bounced off halfheartedly and the few matches left in tumbled out at random keep your inner psychoanalyst to your damned self i growled weve got work to do yeah bob said youre right harry what do i know about anything i glowered at bob and pulled up my stool to the worktable i got out a notebook and a pencil the question of the hour is what do you know about something called the word of kemmler bob made a sucking sound through his teeth which is fairly impressive given that hes got no saliva to work with or maybe im giving him too much credit i mean he can make a b sound with no lips too can you give me a reference point or anything not for certain i said but i have a gut instinct that says it has something to do with necromancy bob made a whistling sound i hope not why i asked because that kemmler was a certifiable nightmare bob said i mean wow he was sick harry evil that got my attention bob the skull was an air spirit a being that existed in a world of knowledge without morality he was fairly fuzzy on the whole goodevil conflict and as a result he had only vague ideas of where lines got drawn if bob thought someone was evil well kemmler must have really pushed the envelope whatd he do i asked what made him so evil he was best known for world war one bob said the whole thing i demanded mostly yeah bob said there were about a hundred and fifty years of engineering built into it and he had his fingers into all kinds of pies he vanished at the end of hostilities and didnt show up again until he started animating mass graves during world war two went on rampages out in eastern europe where things were pretty much a nightmare even without his help nobody is sure how many people he killed stars and stones i said why would he do something like that a wild guess he was freaky insane plus evil you say was i said past tense very bob said after what the guy did the white council hunted him down and wiped his dusty ass out in you mean the wardens i mean the white council bob said the merlin the whole senior council the brute squad out of archangel the wardens and every wizard and ally the wizards could get their hands on i blinked for one man see above regarding nightmare bob said kemmler was a necromancer harry power over the dead he had truck with demons too was buddies with most of the vampire courts every nasty in europe and some of the uglier faeries too plus he had his own little cadre of baby kemmlers to help him out apprentices and thugs of every description damn i said doubtless he was bob said they killed him pretty good a bunch of times hed shown up again after the wardens had killed him early in the nineteenth century so they were real careful the second time and good riddance to the psychotic bastard i blinked you knew him didnt i ever tell you bob asked he was my owner for about forty years i stared you worked with this monster i do what i do bob said proudly how did justin get you then justin dumorne was a warden harry back at kemmlers last stand he pulled me out of the smoldering ruins of kemmlers lab sort of like when you pulled me out of the smoldering ruins of justins lab when you killed him circle of life like that elton john song i felt more than a little tiny bit cold i chewed on my lip and laid my pencil down i had the feeling the rest of this conversation was not going to be something i wanted to create a written record of so what is the word of kemmler bob not a clue bob said i glowered what do you mean not a clue i thought you were his skull friday well yeah bob said his eyelights nickered suddenly a nervous little dance i dont remember very much of it i snorted out a laugh bob you never forget anything no bob said his voice shrank into something very small unless i want to harry i frowned and took a deep breath youre saying that you chose to forget things about kemmler or was compelled to bob said um harry can i come out just inside the lab you know while we talk i blinked a couple of times bob was full of mischief on the best of days i didnt let him out except on specific intelligencegathering missions anymore and while he often pestered me to let him out on one of his perverted minirampages he had never asked permission to leave his skull for the duration of a chat sure i told him stay inside the lab and be back in the skull at the end of this conversation right bob said a small cloud of glowing motes of light the size of campfire sparks came sailing out of the skulls eyes and darted to the far corner of the lab so anyway when are we going to work on the new blasting rod bob i said were talking about the word of kemmler the lights shot restlessly over to the other side of the lab swirling through the steps on my stair ladder in a glowing helix youre talking about the word of kemmler bob said the glowing cloud stretched motes now spiraling up and down the stairs simultaneously im working on my vegas act lookit im dna would you stop goofing around can you remember anything at all about kemmler bobs voice quavered the motes becoming a vague cloud again i can then tell me what you know is that a command i blinked do i have to make it one you dont want to command me to remember harry why not i demanded the cloud of lights drifted in vague loops around the lab because knowledge is what i am losing my knowledge of what i knew of kemmler took away a a big piece of my existence like if someone had cut off your arm whats left of what i know of kemmler is close to the missing pieces i thought i started to understand him it hurts the lights swirled uncertainly it also hurts its more than that if it hurts i said ill stop and you can forget it again when were done talking but bob said its a command bob tell me bob shuddered it was a bizarre sight the cloud of lights shivered for a second as if in a trembling breath of wind and then abruptly just shifted flickering to one side as quickly as if i had been looking at it with one eye closed and suddenly switched to the other kemmler bob said right the lights came to rest on the other end of the table in the shape of a perfect sphere what do you want to know wizard i watched the lights warily but nothing seemed all that wrong other than the fact that bob was suddenly calm and geometric tell me what the word of kemmler is the lights pulsed scarlet knowledge truth power uh i said a little more specific the master wrote down his teachings wizard so that those who came after him could learn from him could learn about the true power of magic you mean i said so that they could learn about necromancy bobs voice took on the edge of a sneer what you call magic is nothing but a mound of parlor tricks beside the power to master life and death itself thats an opinion i guess i said more than that bob said it is a truth a truth that reveals itself to those who seek it out what do you mean i said slowly there was a flash and a pair of white eyes formed in the glittering cloud of red points of light they werent pleasant shall i show you the start of the path bobs voice said death dresden is a part of you it is woven into the fabric of your being you are a collection of pieces each of them dying and in turn being reborn and remade the white lights were cold not mountainspring cold either graveyardmist cold but id never seen anything quite like them before and there was no sense interrupting bob when he was finally spilling some information besides fascinating light dead flesh adorns you even now nails hair you tend them and caress them like any other mortal your women decorate them entice with them death is not a thing to be feared boy she is a lover who waits to take you into her arms you can feel her if you know what her touch is like cold slow sweet he was right a cold tingling nonfeeling was glittering over my fingernails and my scalp for a second i thought that it hurt but then i realized that it was only a shivering sensation where that cold energy brushed close to the blood pulsing beneath my skin it was where they met that it felt uncomfortable without the blood the cold would be a pure endless sweetness take a little of death inside boy and it will lead you to more open your mouth i did i was staring at the light in any case and it was amazing enough to merit a bit of gaping i barely noticed a frozen mote of dark blue light like the corpse of a tiny star that appeared from one of the spirits white eyes and began drifting toward my mouth the cold sensation grew and it hit my tongue like a thermonuclear peppermint freezing hot searingly bitter and sweet and and wrong i spat it out recoiling throwing my arms up in front of my face i fell to the floor numbness spreading too late crowed the spirit it shot into the air swirling around over me gloating whatever you have done to my thoughts the master will not be pleased that you have meddled with his servant the cold started spreading and it wasnt purely physical there was an empty heartless void to it a starless frozen quality that raked at me not just my body but mewith a mindless hunger and i could feel it sending tendrils out through me slowing my heartbeat making it impossible to breathe do you know how long ive been waiting for that the spirit purred drifting back and forth over me sitting there locked behind my own thoughts waiting for the chance to fight free finally you thickwitted ogre i get to leave your stupidity behind bob i choked out this conversation is over the spirits scarlet lights flared to sudden incandescent rage and it screamed a wailing sound that rattled my shelves and felt like it was splitting my head then the cloud was ripped backward across the room sucked into the eyeholes of the skull as though down a hellish drain once of the last of the motes went flickering back into the skull the horrible cold faltered a little and i curled up focusing my will and trying to push it away it took me a while and that hideous voidpresence lingered against my fingernails even after i could feel my fingers again but after a little while i was able to sit up after that i just curled up my knees against my chest shocked and scared half out of my mind i had always known that bob was an incredibly valuable asset and that no spirit with as much knowledge as he had could be weak but i had not been at all prepared for the sheer power he had wielded or for the malice with which he did it bob wasnt supposed to be a sleeping nightmare waiting to wake up bob was supposed to be my wisecracking portageek good lord i couldnt remember the last time id confronted a demon with that much raw psychic power if id been a second slower or stars and stonesif i hadnt remembered the condition that would banish bob back to the skull and once again remove the dark memories id be dead now or maybe dead and then some and it would have been my own stupid fault too harry bob said i flinched and let out a small squeaking sound then i got hold of myself and blinked up at the skull it rested on its shelf and its orangegold eye lights were back to their usual color oh hey bobs voice was very quiet your lips are blue yeah what happened bob asked it got kind of cold in here me yeah im sorry harry bob said i tried to tell you i know i said i had no idea kemmler was bad harry bob said he he took what i was and he twisted it i destroyed most of my memories of my time with him and i locked away everything i couldnt because i didnt want to be like that you wont i told him quietly now hear this bob i command you never to recover those memories again never to let them out again never to obey any command to unleash them again from here on out they sleep with the fishes understand me if i do bob said carefully i wont be able to do much to help you harry youll be on your own let me worry about that i said its a command bob the skull let out a slow sigh of relief thank you harry dont mention it i said literally right he said okay lets see i said can you still remember general information about kemmler nothing you couldnt find in other places but general knowledge i learned when justin was with the wardens yes all right then youthat is that other yousaid that kemmler had written down his teachings when i asked him what the word of kemmler was so i figure its a book maybe bob said council records stated that kemmler had written three books the blood of kemmler the mind of kemmler and the heart of kemmler he published them self published bob said he started spreading them around europe resulting in what way too many pennyante sorcerers getting their hands on some real necromancy i nodded what happened the wardens put on their own epic production of fahrenheit bob said they spent about twenty years finding and destroying copies they think they accounted for all of them i whistled so if the word of kemmler is a fourth manuscript that could be bad bob said why because some of kemmlers disciples escaped the white councils dragnet bob said theyre still running around if they get a new round of necroathome lessons to expand their talents they could use it to do fairly horrible things theyre wizards black wizards yes bob said how many four or five at the most but the wardens information was very sketchy doesnt sound like anything the wardens cant handle i said unless whats in the fourth book contains the rest of what kemmler had to teach them bob said in which case we might end up with four or five kemmlers running around holy crap i said i plunked my tired ass down on my stool and rubbed at my head and its no coincidence that its almost halloween the season when the barriers between the mortal realm and the spirit world will be weakest bob said like when that asshole the nightmare was hunting down my friends i said i peered at bob but for him to do that he had to weaken the barriers even more he and bianca had tormented all those ghosts to start making the barriers more unstable would it have to be ghosts to stir up the kind of turbulence youd need for big magic no bob said but thats one way otherwise youd have to use some rituals or sacrifices of one kind or another you mean deaths i said exactly i frowned nodding theyd have to invest some energy early to get things moving for a big necromantic working like bouncing on a diving board a couple of times before you jump an accurate if crude aphorism bob said youd have to do a little prework if you wanted to start working kemmlerlevel necromancy even on halloween he sighed though that doesnt really help you much i got up and headed for the stepladder it helps more than you know man im getting you new romances the skulls eye lights brightened you are i mean of course you are but why because if someones setting up for big bad juju theyll have left bodies if theyve done that then i have a place to start tracking them and finding out whats going on harry bob called up as i left the lab where are you going i stuck my head back down the trapdoor and said the morgue chapter four chicago has a bitchin morgue you cant call it a morgue anymore because its the forensic institute now it isnt run by a coroner either because now its a medical examiner its on west harrison street which is located in a fairly swanky industrial park mostly specializing in various biotech industries its pretty there are wide green lawns carefully kept and trimmed complete with sculpted trees and bushes a fantastic view of the citys skyline and quick access to the freeway its upscale sure but its also very quiet despite the gorgeous landscaping and a more antiseptic naming scheme its where they bring the dead to be poked and prodded i parked the blue beetle in the visitors parking lotof the complex next door the morgue had more than average security and i didnt want to advertise my presence i grabbed my bribe from the backseat and headed for the front door of the office of the medical examiner i knocked flashing my little laminated card i got from the police that makes me look like an official policelike person the door buzzed and i went in nodding to a comfortably heavyset security guard reading a magazine behind a nondescript desk to one side of the entry area phil i said evening dresden he said official i held up the wooden box packed with mcanallys microbrew unofficial hosannah drawled phil i like unofficial better he put his feet back up on the desk and opened up his magazine again i left the beer on the floor next to the desk where it would be out of sight from the door how come i never heard of this bar just a little local tavern i said i didnt add that caters to the supernatural community and doesnt exactly try to attract the attention of locals ill have to get you to take me by sometime sure i said is he here back in the slabs he said reaching down for one of the ales phil opened the lid with a thumb and took a swig eyes on his magazine again ahhhhh he said his tone philosophical you know if anyone had come through that door id tell him to get his ass going before someone drives up or something gone i said and hurried back into the hallways behind the entry area there were several slabsi mean examination roomsin the morguethat is in the forensic institute but i knew that the guy i was looking for would be in the smallest crummiest room the one farthest away from the entrance waldo butters other than having the extreme misfortune of being born to parents with little to no ability to bestow a manly name upon their son had also been cursed with a sense of honesty a measure of integrity and enough moral courage to make him act on them when hed examined the corpses of a bunch of things id burned mostly to briquettes hed pronounced them humanlike but definitely nonhuman in his report it was a fair enough description of the remains of a bunch of batlike red court vampires but since everyone knew that there were no such things as humanlike nonhumans and the remains were obviously human corpses that had been horribly twisted by intense heat butters wound up sitting in a psych ward for ninety days for observation after that he had been forced to wage a legal battle just to keep his job his superiors didnt want him around and they handed him the worst parts of the job they could come up with but butters stuck it out he mostly worked the overnight shift and weekends it had the happy side effect of producing an me who regarded the establishment with the same sort of cheerful disrespect i myself occasionally indulged in which was damned handy when for example one needed a bullet removed from ones arm without intruding upon the law enforcement communitys busy schedule the doctor was in i heard polka music oompahing cheerfully through the hall as i approached the room but the music was off somehow butters normally played his polka records and cds loud and i had gotten used to hearing the elite performers of the polka universe whoever he was playing now sounded admirably energetic but lumpy and uneven there were odd jerks and breaks in the music though the whole of it somehow managed to hang on the rhythm of a single bass drum on the whole it made the music happy lively and somehow misshapen i opened the door and regarded the source of the quasimodo polka butters was a little guy maybe fivefootthree in his shoes maybe pounds soaking wet he was dressed in blue hospital scrubs and hiking boots he had a shock of wiry black hair that gave him a perpetual look of surprise that stopped just short of being a perpetual look of recent electrocution he was wearing tom cruise sunglasses and had transformed himself into polkastein a bass drum was strapped to his back and a couple of wires ran to his ankles from a pair of beaters mounted on the frame the drum beat in time to stomps of his feet a small but genuine tuba hung from his slender shoulders and there were more strings attached to his elbows which moved back and forth in time to oom and pah respectively he held an accordion in his hands strapped to the harness on his chest a clarinet had been clamped to the accordion so that the end was near his mouth and there was i swear to god a cymbal on a frame held to his head butters marched in place redfaced sweating and beaming as he thumped and oompahed and blared accordion music i just stood there staring because while i have seen a lot of weird things i hadnt ever seen that butters wrapped up the polka and energetically banged his head against the tuba producing a deafening clash from the cymbal the motion brought me into his peripheral vision and he jumped in surprise the motion overbalanced him and he fell amidst a clatter of cymbal a honk of tuba a fitful stutter of drum and then lay on the floor while his accordion wheezed out butters i said harry he panted from the pile of polka cool pants i can see youre busy he missed the sarcasm heck yeah gotta get set oktoberfest battle of the bands tomorrow night i thought you werent going to enter after last year hah butters said sneering defiantly im not going to let the jolly rogers laugh at me like that i mean come on five guys named roger how much polka can be in their souls i have no freaking clue i answered truthfully butters flashed me a grin ill get them this year i couldnt help it i started smiling need any help getting out of there nah i got it he said brightly and started unstrapping himself surprised to see you your checkup isnt until next week hand bothering you not really i said wanted to talk to you about oh he said he hopped up from the stuff and left it on the floor so that he could scamper toward a desk in the corner before you get started i found something interesting butters i said id like to chat man but im in a pretty big hurry he paused crestfallen really yeah its a case and i need to find out if you know anything that could help me oh he said well you have cases all the time this is important ive been doing a lot of research since you started seeing me about your hand and the conclusions ive been able to extrapolate from butters i sighed look im in a huge hurry five words or less okay he leaned his hands on his desk and regarded me eyes sparkling i know how wizards live forever he paused for a thoughtful second and then said wait thats six words never mind then what did you want to talk about my mouth fell open i shut it and glared at him no one likes a wiseass butters he grinned i told you it was important wizards dont live forever i said just a really long time butters shrugged and kept pulling out file folders he flicked on a backlight for reading xray films and started pulling them from the folders and putting them on the light hey im still not sure i buy into this whole hiddenworldofmagic thing but from what youve told me wizards can live five or six times as long as the average human thats closer to forever than anyone i know and what ive seen makes me think there must be something to it come here i did frowning at the xrays hey arent these mine yep butters confirmed after i switched to one of the older machines i got about fifteen percent of them to come out he said and there are three or four from your records that managed to survive whatever it is about you that screws up xrays ugh this is that gunshot wound i got in michigan i said pointing at the first it showed a number of fracture lines in my hip bone where a smallcaliber bullet had hit me i had barely avoided a shattered pelvis and probable death they got this one after they got the cast off right butters said and here this is one from a couple of years ago he pointed at a second shot see the fracture lines theyre brighter where the bone refused leaves that signature right i said so so butters said look at this one he flipped up a third xray it was much like the others but without any of the bright or dark lines he flicked it with a finger and looked at me eyes wide what i asked he blinked slowly then he said harry this is an xray i took two months ago notice the lack of anything wrong so i asked it healed right he made an exasperated sound harry you are dense bones dont do that you carry marks where they refused for the rest of your life or rather i would you dont i frowned whats that got to do with wizard life span butters waved his hand impatiently here here are some more he slapped up more xrays this is a partial stress fracture to the arm that didnt get shot you got it in that fall from the train a couple nights after we met he said it was just a crack you didnt even know you had it and it was mild enough that it just needed a splint for a few days it was off before you were ambulatory whats so odd about that nothing butters said but look here it is again theres a fuse marker and in the third one poof its gone your arm is back to normal maybe i just drink too much milk or something i said butters snorted harry look youre a tough guy youve been injured a lot he pulled out my medical file and thumped it down with a grunt of effort granted there are phone books smaller than my hospital file and im willing to bet youve had plenty of booboos you never saw a doctor about sure i said youre at least as battered as a professional athlete butters said i mean like a hockey player or football player maybe as much as some racecar drivers they get battered i asked when you go around driving half a ton of steel at a third the speed of sound for a living you get all kinds of injuries he said seriously even the crashes that arent spectacular are pretty vicious on the human body at the speeds theyre going ever been in a lowspeed accident yeah sore for a week exactly butters said multiply that these guys and other athletes take a huge beating right they develop a mental and physical toughness that lets them ignore a lot of pain and overcome the damage but the damage gets done to their bodies nonetheless and its cumulative thats why you see football players boxers a lot of guys like that all beat to hell by the time theyre in their thirties they regain most of the function after an injury but the damage is still there and it adds up bit by bit again i ask whats that got to do with me you arent cumulative butters said eh your body doesnt get you functional again and then leave off butters said it continues repairing damage until its gone he stared at me do you understand how incredibly significant that is i guess not i said harry thats probably why people age to begin with he said your body is a big collection of cells right most of them get damaged or wear out and die your body replaces them its a continual process but the thing is every time the body makes a replacement its a little less perfect than the one that came before it that copyofacopy thing i said ive heard about that yeah right butters said thats how youre able to heal these injuries its why you have the potential to live so long your copies are perfect or at least a hell of a lot closer to it than most folks i blinked youre saying i can heal any injury well he said not like mutant xfactor healing if someone cuts an artery youre gonna bleed out but if you survive it given enough time your body seems to be able to replace things almost perfectly it might take you months even several years but you can get better when other people wouldnt i looked at him and then at my gloved hand i tried to talk but my throat wouldnt work yeah the little doctor said quietly i think youre going to get your hand back at some point it didnt mortify or come off theres still living muscle tissue there given enough time i think youll be able to replace scar tissue and regrow the nerves that i said and choked up i swallowed that would be nice we can help it along i think butters said physical therapy i was going to talk to you about it next visit we can go over it then butters i said uh wow man this is really exciting he said eyes gleaming i was going to say amazing i said quietly and then i was going to say thankyou he grinned and twitched a shoulder in a shrug i calls them like i see them i stared down at my hand and tried to twiddle my fingers they sort of twitched why i asked why what why am i able to make good copies he blew out a breath and pushed his hand through his wiry hair grinning i have no freaking clue neat huh i stared down at the xray film for a moment more then put my hand in my dusters pocket i hoped you could help me get some information i said sure sure butters replied he went to his polka suit and started taking it apart is something going on i hope not i said but lets just say ive got a real bad feeling i need to know if there have been any odd deaths in the area in the past day or two butters frowned odd how unusually violent i said or marks of some kind of murder method consistent with a ritual killing hell ill even take signs of torture prior to death doesnt sound like anyone ive met butters said he took off his sunglasses and put on his normal blackrimmed glasses though im not done for tonight let me check the records and see whos in the hizouse thank you i said butters knocked a few flyers off his chair and sat down he dragged a keyboard out from under a medical magazine and gave me a significant look oh right i said i backed away from his desk to the far side of the room proximity to me tended to make computers malfunction to one degree or another murphy still hadnt forgiven me for blowing out her hard drive even though it had happened only the once butters got on his computer no he said after a moments reading and key thumping wait heres a guy who got knifed but it happened way up in the northwest corner of the state no good i said it would have to be local within a county or three of chicago hmph butters said you investigative types are always so picky about this kind of thing he scanned over the screen driveby shooting victim definitely no i said for a ritual killing it would be a lot more intimate think youre out of luck then harry he said there were some highprofile stiffs that came in and the day crew took them all hmm tell me about it i got stuck with a wino and some poor bastard who got caught under a tractor and had to be tested for drugs and booze earlier tonight but thats he paused hello hello thats odd that perked up my ears metaphorically speaking whats odd my boss dr brioche passed over one of his subjects it got moved to my docket but i didnt get a memo about it not even an email the bastard i frowned that happen a lot attempts to make it look like im neglecting my job so he can fire me butters said that ones new but its in the spirit of my whole history here maybe he was just busy today and maybe liv tyler is waiting in my bedroom to rub my feet butters responded heh whos the stiff a mr eduardo anthony mendoza butters read he was in a headon collision with a buick on the expressway only he was a pedestrian butters scrunched up his nose looks like it will be a nasty one no wonder highandmighty brioche didnt want to handle it i mused it wasnt what i was looking for but there was something about the situation around that corpse that set off my internal alarm bells mind if i ask you to indulge an intuition sure im as polka empowered as im going to get anyway lemme break out my gear and well take a looksee at the late eddie mendoza cool i said i leaned against the wall and folded my arms preparing to settle in for a while the door to the examination room slammed open and phil the security guard walked in with a businesslike stride except phils throat had been slit open from ear to ear and blood covered his upper body in a sheet of ugly splatters his face was absolutely white there was no chance whatsoever that poor phil was alive that didnt stop him from striding into the room seizing butterss desk and throwing it computer heavy file cabinet and all into the far wall of the room where it shattered with a thunderous sound of impact butters stared at phil with horror then let out a somewhat rabbitlike shriek and scurried back from him dont move thundered a deep resonant voice from the hallway outside dead phil froze in his tracks a big man in a khaki trench coat and i swear to god a dark fedora strode into the room intent on butters and he didnt see me against the wall i hesitated for a second still shocked at the suddenness of it all three other men in coats all grey of face and purposeful of motion flanked him dont hurt the little coroner gentlemen the man said well need him for a little while chapter five the man in the fedora took a step toward butters drumming a slender book against his thigh with one hand stand aside he muttered and dead phil sidestepped butters had scrambled back into a corner his eyes the size of glazed doughnuts behind his glasses wow he babbled great entrance love the hat the guy in the fedora took a step forward and reached out with his other hand at which point i decided to act a raised hand isnt much in the regular world but from a guy in a long coat with his own flock of zombies it had to be at least as menacing as pointing a gun that will be enough i said and i said it loud enough to hurt ears i stepped away from the wall with my left hand extended my silver bracelet of heatwarped shields hung on my wrist and i readied my will pushing enough power into the bracelet to prepare a shield to leap up immediately the bracelet was still pretty bangedup from the beating it had taken the last time id used it and id only barely gotten it working again as a result it channeled the energy pretty sloppily and bluewhite sparks leaped out and fell to the floor in a steady drizzle put your hand down and step away from the coroner the man turned to face me book thumping steadily against his leg for a second i thought he was another dead man himself his face was so palebut spots of color appeared high on his cheeks faint but there he had a long face and though it was pale it was leathery as if hed spent years in the blowing desert wind and sand without seeing the sun he had dark eyes thick grey sideburns no beard and a scar twisted his upper lip into a perpetual sneer who said the man his accent thick and british are you the great pumpkin i responded ive risen from the pumpkin patch a bit early because butters is just that nifty and you are the man studied me in silence for a long second eyes focused on my sparking wrist then on my throat where my mothers silver pentacle amulet was probably lying outside my shirt you may call me grevane walk away boy or what i said grevane gave me a chilly little smile thumping his book and nodded at his unmoving companions theres room in my car for one more ive got a job already i said but theres no reason for this to get nasty youre going to stand right there while butters and me leave and i he said his voice annoyed whats that butters and i fool do you seriously think that a defensive shield barely held together by a clumsy crude little focus will intimidate me into allowing you to leave no i said and drew my revolver from my dusters pocket i pointed it at him and thumbed back the trigger thats why i brought this he lifted his eyebrows you intend to murder me in cruor gelidus no ill do it right here i said butters get up come over here to me the little guy hauled himself to his feet shaking and edged around the empty staring gaze of the late phil good i said this is moving along nicely grevane keep it up and i wont need to make forensics pick your teeth out of that wall behind you butters scuttled over to me while grevane thumped his book on his leg the necromancer stared at me barely sparing a glance for butters then a slow and fairly creepy smile spread over his face you are not a warden i flunked the written his nostrils flared not one of the councils guard dogs you are in fact more of my own persuasion i really doubt that i said grevane had narrow yellow teeth and a crocodiles smile dont play games i can smell the true magic on you the last person to talk about true magic had been necrobob i had to fight off a shiver uh i guess thats the last time i buy generic deodorant perhaps we can make an arrangement grevane said this need not end in bloodshedparticularly not now so close to the end of the race join me against the others a living lieutenant is far more useful to me than a dead fool tempting i told him in the voice i usually reserved for backedup toilets butters got to me and i bumped him toward the door with my hip he took the hint instantly and i sidestepped to the door of the room with him i kept my eyes and my gun on grevane my readied bracelet drizzling heatless sparks to the floor but i dont think i like your management technique butters check the hall butters bobbed his head out and looked nervously around i dont see anyone can you lock that door keys rattled yes he said get ready to do it i said i stepped out in the hall slammed the door shut and snapped lock it hurry butters fumbled with a key he jammed one in the door and turned it heavy security bolts slid to with a comfortably weighty snap an instant before something heavy and solid hit the door hard enough for me to feel the floor rattle through my boots a second later the door jumped again and a fistsized dent mushroomed half an inch out of its center oh god butters babbled oh god that was phil what is that what is happening right there with you man i said i grabbed him and started walking down the hall as quickly as i could drag the little guy who else has keys to the door what butters blinked for a second uh uh the other doctors day security and phil the door rattled again dented again and then went silent grevanes figured that out too i said come on before he finds the right key do you have your car keys with you yes yes wait oh yes right here butters said his teeth were chattering together so loudly that he could barely speak clearly and he stumbled every couple of steps god oh god its real in the halls behind us metal clicked and scraped on metal someone was trying keys in a lock butters i said i grabbed his shoulders and had to resist the urge to slap him in the face like in the movies do what i tell you stop thinking think later move now or there wont be a later he stared at me and for a second i thought he was going to throw up then he swallowed nodded once and said okay good we run to your car come on butters nodded and took off for the front of the building at a dead sprint he accelerated a lot faster than i did but i have long legs and i caught up pretty quickly butters stopped to hit the buzzer at the guard station and i held the door open wide enough to let him out first he turned right and ran for the parking lot and i was only a couple of feet behind him we rounded the corner of the building and butters dashed toward a pintsized pickup truck parked in the nearest space i followed him and after the silence of the morgue the night sounds of the city were a blaring music traffic hissed by in an automotive river on the highway sirens sounded in the distance ambulance rather than patrol car somewhere within a twohundredmile radius one of those enormous thumping bass stereos pounded out a steady beat almost too low to hear the light in the parking lot was out making everything dark and hazy but the scent of gasoline came sharp to my nose and i seized butterss collar and pulled the little guy choked and all but fell down but stopped dont i said and slipped my fingers under the pygmy trucks hood it flipped up already open the engine had been torn apart a snapped drive belt hung out like the tongue of a dead steer wires were strewn everywhere and fingersized holes had been driven into plastic fluid tanks coolant and windshield cleaner still dribbled to the parking lots concrete and from the smell of it they were mixing with whatever gasoline had been in the tank butters stared at it with wide eyes panting my truck they killed my truck looks like i said sweeping my gaze around why did they kill my truck that heavy bass stereo kept rumbling through the october night i paused for a second focusing on the sound it was changing getting a little bit higher pitched with each beat i recognized what that meant and panic slammed through my head for a second doppler effect the source of the rumbling bass was coming toward us in the darkness of the industrial parks lanes a pair of headlights flashed on revealing a car accelerating toward the forensic institute the lights were spaced widely apartan older car and judging by the sound of the engine some kind of gasguzzling dinosaur like a caddy or a big olds come on i snapped to butters and started running to the lot next door back to the blue beetle wed already been spotted obviously so i fired up my shield bracelet again so that my hand looked like it had been replaced with a small comet butters followed and i had to give the little guy credithe was a good runner there i shouted get to my car i see it behind us the rumbling cadillac swerved into the institutes parking lot and lurched over a concreteencased grassy median sparks flying from its undercarriage the car roared up onto the grass and skidded to a broadside stop the door flew open and a man got out i got a halfdecent glance at him in the backwash of the caddys headlights medium height at most long thinning hair and pale loose skin with a lot of liver spots he moved stiffly like someone with arthritis but he hauled a long shotgun out of the car with him and raised it to his shoulder with careful deliberation i juked to one side so that i was directly between the driver and butters twisted at the hips extended my arm behind me and raised my shield it flickered to life in a ghostly half dome just a second before one barrel of the shotgun bloomed with light and thunder the shield flashed and sent off a cloud of sparks the size of a small house i felt it falter through the damaged bracelet on my wrist but it solidified again in time to catch the second blast from the guns other barrel the old man with the shotgun howled in wordless outrage broke the barrel and started loading in fresh shells butters was screaming and i was yelling right along with him we got to the beetle and piled in i stomped the engine to life and the beetle sputtered once and then gamely took off at its best clip i screeched out of the parking lot and onto the road started to skid turned into it fishtailed once and then shot off down the street look out butters screamed pointing i snapped a glance over my shoulder and saw phil and the other three dead men from the examination room sprinting across the grounds at us i dont mean they were running it was a fullout sprint faster than phil could have done even in the prime of his life i stomped on the gas and kept my eyes on the road the beetle lurched and butters cried out holy crap i looked back again and saw dead phil clinging to the back of the car he had to have been standing on the rear bumper the other three dead men werent far behind him keeping up with the car dead phil drove his hand down at the back of the beetle and there was a wrenching sound of impact then a series of snaps and squeals as he tore the back cover from the car exposing the engine take the wheel i shouted to butters he reached over and seized the steering wheel i twisted and thrust my right hand at dead phil i focused my attention on the plain silver ring on my middle finger it was another focus like the shield bracelet one designed to store back a little kinetic energy every time i moved my arm i focused on the ring clenched my hand into a fist and shoved it directly at dead phil releasing the energy within dead phil had raised his arm again this time to tear apart the beetles engine but i beat him to the punch the unseen force unleashed from the ring hit him at the top of his thighs kicking his whole lower body out straight the force tore his grip loose from the car and he tumbled away hitting the street with heavy crunching sounds of impact arms and legs splayed the other dead men ran past him one leaping clear over and dead phil lay twitching on the ground like a broken toy i got back to the wheel and shifted the car into the next gear in my rearview mirror i saw the leading dead man spring at us again but he missed the car by a couple of feet and i left the rest of them behind in the darkness scooting out of the industrial park and onto public streets i drove for a while taking a lot of unnecessary turns i didnt think anyone was pursuing us but i didnt want to take the chance that the old man might have gotten back into his caddy and onto our tails maybe ten minutes went by before i started breathing easier and i finally felt safe enough to pull over into a welllit conveniencestore parking lot i started shaking as soon as i set the parking brake adrenaline does that to me i usually get along just fine when the actual crisis is in progress but after its over my body makes up for the lost terror i closed my eyes and tried to keep my breathing slow and calm but it was a fight to do it there wasnt anything i could do about the trembling it had been getting harder and harder to maintain my composure ever since the battle where i nearly lost my hand the emotions id always felt seemed to be hitting me harder and harder lately and sometimes i had to literally close my eyes and count to ten to keep from losing control right then i wanted to scream and howlpartly in joy at being alive and partly in rage that someone had tried to kill me i wanted to call up my power and start laying waste with it to feel the raw energy of creation scorching through my thoughts and body mastered by raw will i wanted to cut loose but i couldnt do that even among the strongest wizards on the planet im no lightweight i dont have the finesse and class and experience that a lot of the older practitioners do but when it comes to raw metaphysical muscle i rank in the top thirty or forty wizards alive i had a ton of strength but i didnt always have the fine control to go with it thats why i had to use specially prepared articles such as my bracelet and my ring to focus that power even with them it wasnt always easy to be precise the last time i had surrendered my selfcontrol and really cut loose with my power i burned as many as a dozen people to scorched skeletons i had a responsibility to keep that destructive strength in check to use it to help people to protect them it didnt matter that i still felt terrified it didnt matter that my hand was screaming with pain it didnt matter that my car had been mutilated yet again or that someone had tried to kill one of the few people in town i considered a real friend i had to hold back be careful think clearly harry butters asked after a minute are you okay yeah just give me a minute i dont understand this he said his voice didnt sound any too steady either what just happened you dont want to know i said yes i do trust me i said you dont want to be involved in this kind of business why not youll get hurt or killed dont go looking for trouble he let out a frustrated neighing sound those people came for me i didnt go looking for them they were looking for me he had a point but even so butters was not someone i would want to see involved in a conflict between people like grevane and his dead men and his liverskinned partner mortals usually didnt fare too well when it came to tangling with preternatural bad guys in my day id seen dozens of men and women die from it despite everything i did to help them this is unreal butters said i know you and murphy have talked about this blackmagic supernatural stuff a lot and ive seen some things that are tough to explain but i never imagined something like this could happen youre happier that way i said hell if i could do it i might want to forget i ever found out about any of it im happier being scared he asked almost timidly im happier wondering if maybe my bosses were right the whole time and i really am insane im happier being in danger and having no idea what to do about it i didnt have a quick answer for that one i stared at my hands the trembling had almost stopped help me understand this harry he said please well dammit i raked the fingers of my right hand through my hair grevane had been after butters specifically he had backup waiting outside and he trashed butterss truck to make sure the little guy couldnt escape he openly said that he needed butters and needed him in one piece to boot all of which meant that butters was in very realand very serious danger and by now ive learned that i cant always protect everyone i screw up sometimes like everyone else i make stupid mistakes if i kept quiet if i forced butters to wear blinders he wouldnt be able to do jack to protect himself if i made a bad call and something happened to him it would be my fault that he didnt have every chance to survive his blood would be on my hands i couldnt take that choice away from him i wasnt his father or his guardian angel or his sovereign king i wasnt blessed with the wisdom of solomon or with the foresight of a prophet if i chose butterss path for him in some ways it would make me no different from grevane or any number of other beings human and nonhuman alike who sought to control others if i tell you this i said quietly it could be bad for you bad how it could force you to keep secrets that people would kill you for knowing it could change the way you think and feel it could really screw up your life screw up my life he stared a me for a second and then said deadpan im a fivefootthree thirtysevenyearold single jewish medical examiner who needs to pick up his lederhosen from the dry cleaners so that he can play in a oneman polka band at oktoberfest tomorrow he pushed up his glasses with his forefinger folded his arms and said do your worst the words were light but there was both fear and resolve just under the surface of them butters was smart enough to be scared but he was also a fighter i could respect him for both okay i said lets talk chapter six butters hadnt taken time to collect his coat when he left and the last time the beetles heater had worked was before the demolition of the berlin wall i ducked into the store got us each a cup of coffee then untwisted the wire that holds down the lid of the storage trunk i dug out a worn but mostly clean blanket that i kept in the trunk to cover the shortbarreled shotgun i stored in the event that i would ever need to give napoleons charging hordes a taste of the grape given the way the night was going i got the shotgun too and slipped it into the backseat butters accepted the blanket and the coffee gratefully though he shivered hard enough to slop a little of the drink over the side of the cup i sipped a little coffee slipped the cup into the holder id rigged on the cars dashboard and got moving again i didnt want to wait around in the same place for too long all right i told butters there are two things you have to accept if you want to understand whats going on hit me first the tough one magic is real i could feel him looking at me for a moment what do you mean by that theres an entire world that exists alongside the everyday life of mankind there are powers nations monsters wars feuds alliances everything wizards are a part of it so are a lot of other things youve heard about in stories and even more youve never heard of what kind of things vampires werewolves faeries demons monsters its all real heh butters said heh heh youre joking right no joke come on butters you know that there are weird things out there youve seen the evidence of them he pushed a shaking hand through his hair well yes some but harry youre talking about something else entirely here i mean if you want to tell me that people have the ability to sense and affect their environment in ways we dont really understand yet i can accept that maybe you call it magic and someone else calls it esp and someone else calls it the force but its not a new idea maybe there are people whose genetic makeup makes them better able to employ these abilities maybe it even does things like make them reproduce their dna more clearly than other people so that they can live for a very long time but that is not the same thing as saying that theres an army of weird monsters living right under our noses and we dont even notice them what about those corpses you analyzed i said humanoid but definitely not human well butters said defensively its a big universe i think its sort of arrogant to assume that were the only thinking beings in it those corpses were the bodies of vampires of the red court and you dont want to meet a living one there were a lot of them in town at one point there arent so many now but there are plenty more where they came from theyre only one flavor of vampire and vampires are only one flavor of supernatural predator its a jungle out there butters and people arent anywhere near the top of the food chain butters shook his head and youre telling me that nobody knows about it oh lots of people know about it i said but the ones who are in the know dont go around talking about it all that much why not because they dont want to get locked up in a loony bin for three months for observation for starters oh butters said flushing yeah i guess i can see that what about regular people who see things like sightings and close encounters and stuff i blew out a breath thats the second thing you have to understand people dont want to accept a reality that frightening some of them open their eyes and get involvedlike murphy did but most of them dont want anything to do with the supernatural so they leave it behind and dont talk about it dont think about it they dont want it to be real and they work really hard to convince themselves that it isnt no butters said im sorry i just dont buy that you dont need to buy it i said its true as a race were an enormous bunch of idiots were more than capable of ignoring facts if the conclusions they lead to make us too uncomfortable or afraid wait a minute youre saying that a whole world multiple civilizations of scientific study and advancement and theory and application all based around the notion of observing the universe and studying its laws is what in error about dismissing magic as superstition not just in error i said dead wrong because the truth is something that people are afraid to face theyre terrified to admit that its a big universe and were not he sipped coffee and shook his head i dont know come on butters i said look at history how long did the scholarly institutions of civilization consider earth to be the center of the universe and when people came out with facts to prove that it wasnt there were riots in the streets no one wanted to believe that we all lived on an unremarkable little speck of rock in a quiet backwater of one unremarkable galaxy the world was supposed to be flat too until people proved that it wasnt by sailing all the way around it no one believed in germs until years and years after someone actually saw one biologists scoffed at tales of wild beastmen living in the mountains of africa despite eyewitness testimony to the contrary and pronounced them an utter fantasyright up until someone plopped a dead mountain gorilla down on their dissecting table he chewed on his lip and watched the streetlights time after time history demonstrates that when people dont want to believe something they have enormous skills of ignoring it altogether youre saying that the entire human race is in denial he said most of the time i replied its not a bad thing its just who we are but the weird stuff doesnt care about thatit keeps on happening every familys got a ghost story in it most people ive talked to have had something happen to them that was impossible to explain but that doesnt mean they go around talking about it afterward because everyone knows that those kinds of things arent real if you start saying that they are you get the weird looks and jackets with extralong sleeves for everyone he said voice still skeptical every time they just keep quiet and try to forget it tell you what butters lets drive down to cpd and you can tell them how you were just attacked by a necromancer and four zombies how they nearly outran a speeding car and murdered a security guard who then got up and threw your desk across the room i paused for a moment to let the silence stretch what do you think theyd do i dont know he said he bowed his head unnatural things happen all the time i said but no one talks about it at least not openly the preternatural world is everywhere it just doesnt advertise you do butters said but not many people take me seriously for the most part even the ones who accept my help just pay the bill then walk out determined to ignore my existence and get back to their normal life how could someone do that butters asked because its terrifying i said think about it you find out about monsters that make the creatures in the horror movies look like the muppets and that theres not a damned thing you can do to protect yourself from them you find out about horrible things that happen things you would be happier not knowing so rather than live with the fear you get away from the situation after a while you can convince yourself that you must have just imagined it or maybe exaggerated it in the remembering you rationalize whatever you can forget whatever you cant and get back to your life i glanced down at my gloved hand and said its not their fault man i dont blame them maybe he said but i dont see how things that hunt and kill human beings could be there among us without our knowing how big was your graduating class in high school butters blinked what just answer me uh about eight hundred all right i said last year in the us alone more than nine hundred thousand people were reported missing and not found are you serious yeah i said you can check with the fbi thats out of about three hundred million total population that breaks down to about one person in three hundred and twentyfive vanishing every year its been almost twenty years since you graduated so that would mean that between forty and fifty people in your class are gone just gone no one knows where they are butters shifted uncomfortably in his seat so i arched an eyebrow at him so theyre missing where did they go well theyre missing if theyre missing then nobody knows exactly i said he didnt say anything back i let the silence stretch for a minute just to make the point then i started up again maybe its a coincidence but its almost the same loss ratio experienced by herd animals on the african savannah to large predators butters drew his knees up to his chest huddling further under the blanket really yeah i said nobody talks about this kind of thing but all those people are still gone maybe a lot of them just cut their ties and left their old lives behind maybe some were in accidents of some kind with the body never found the point is people dont know but because its an extremely scary thing to think about and because its a lot easier to just get back to their lives they tend to dismiss it ignore it its easier butters shook his head it just sounds so insane i mean theyd believe it if they saw it if someone went on television and did what i asked bent spoons maybe made the statue of liberty disappear turned a lady into a white tiger hell ive done magic on television and everyone not screaming that it was a hoax was complaining that the special effects looked cheap you mean that clip that wgn news was showing a few years back with you and murphy and the big dog and that insane guy with a club it wasnt a dog i said and shivered a little myself at the memory it was a loupgarou kind of a superwerewolf i killed him with a spell and a silver amulet right on the screen yeah everyone was talking about it for a couple of days but i heard that they found out it was a fake or something no someone disappeared the tape oh i stopped at a light and stared at butters for a second when you saw that tape did you believe it no why not he took a breath well because the picture quality wasnt very good i mean it was really dark where most scary supernatural stuff tends to happen i said and the picture was all jumpy the woman with the camera was terrified also pretty common butters made a frustrated sound and there was an awful lot of static on the tape which made it look like someone had messed with it sort of like someone messed with almost all of my xrays i shook my head smiling and theres one more reason you didnt believe it man its okay you can say it he sighed theres no such things as monsters bingo i said and got the car moving again look butters you are your own ideal example youve seen things you cant explain away youve suffered for trying to tell people that you have seen them for gods sake twenty minutes ago you got attacked by the walking dead and youre still arguing with me about whether or not magic is real seconds ticked by because i dont want to believe it he said in a quiet numb voice i exhaled slowly yeah dead silence drink some coffee i told him he did scared yeah good i said thats smart well then he murmured i mmust be the smartest guy in the whole world i know how you feel i said you run into something you totally dont get and its scary as hell but once you learn something about it it gets easier to handle knowledge counters fear it always has what do i do butters asked me im taking you somewhere youll be safe once i get you there ill figure out my next move for now ask me questions ill answer them butters took a slower sip of his coffee and nodded his hands looked steadier who was that man he goes by grevane but i doubt thats his real name hes a necromancer whats a necromancer i rolled a shoulder in a shrug necromancy is the practice of using magic to muck around with dead things necromancers can animate and control corpses manipulate ghosts access the knowledge stored in dead brains butters blurted out thats impos then he stopped himself and coughed oh right sorry they can also do a lot of really freaky things involving the soul i said even in the weird circles it isnt the kind of thing you talk about casually but ive heard stories that they can inhabit corpses with their consciousness possess others ive even heard that they can bring people back from the dead jesus butters swore i kinda doubt they had anything to do with that one no no i meant i know what you meant it was a joke butters oh right sorry he swigged more coffee and started looking around at the streets again but bringing the dead to life that doesnt sound so bad youre assuming that what the necromancer brings them back to is better than death from what ive heard they dont generally do it for humanitarian reasons but that might be a load of crap like i said no one talks about it why not butters asked because its forbidden i told him the practice of necromancy violates one of the laws of magic laid down by the white council capital punishment is the only sentence and no one wants to even come close to being suspected by the council why who are they theyre me i said sort of the white council is a well most people would call it a governing body for wizards all over the world but its really more like a masonic lodge or maybe a frat ive never heard of a fraternity handing out a death sentence yeah well the council has only seven laws but if you break them i drew my thumb across my neck by the way they arent fond of regular folks knowing about them so dont talk about them to anyone else butters swallowed and touched the fingers of one hand to his throat oh so this guy grevane he was like you hes not like me i said and it came out in a snarl that surprised even me butters twitched violently i sighed and made an effort to lower my voice again but hes probably a wizard yeah who is he what does he want i blew out a breath hes most likely a student of this badass black magic messiah named kemmler the council burned kemmler down a while back but several of his disciples may have escaped i think grevane is looking for a book his teacher hid before he died a magic book i snorted nah trinkets arent too hard to come by if my guess is correct this book contains more of the knowledge and theory kemmler used in his most powerful magics butters nodded so if grevane gets hold of the book and learns he gets to be the next kemmler yeah and he mentioned that there were others involved in this business too i think word of the presence of kemmlers book came up and his surviving students are showing up to grab it before their fellow necromancers do for that matter just about anyone involved in black magic might want to get their hands on it so why doesnt the council just grab them and he drew his thumb across his throat theyve tried i said they thought the disciples had all been accounted for butters frowned then he said i guess wizards can go into denial about uncomfortable things too huh i barked out a laugh people are people man but now you can tell this council about grevane and this book right my stomach quivered a little no why not because if i did mavra would destroy my friend the thought screamed across my brain in a blaze of frustration that i tried to keep concealed long story the short version is that im not real popular with the council and theyre pretty busy right now with what he asked a war he scrunched up his nose and tilted his head studying me thats not the only reason you arent calling them is it butters said egad holmes i told him no it isnt dont push sorry he finished the coffee then made a visible effort to cast around for a new conversational thread so those were actual zombies never seen one before i said but that seems like a pretty good guess poor phil butters said not a saint or anything but not a bad guy he have a family i asked no butters said single thats a mercy he was silent for a second then said no i guess it isnt yeah if those guys were zombies how come they didnt want brains butters said he held both arms stiff out in front of him rolled his eyes back in his head and moaned braaaaaaaaaaaains i snorted he gave me a weak smile seriously butters said these guys were more like the terminator whats the use of a foot soldier who cant do anything but hobble along and moan about brains good point butters said he scrunched up his nose in thought dont i remember something about sewing a zombies lips shut with thread to kill them does that work no clue i said but you saw those things if you want to get close enough to find out be my guest but ill be observing it through a freaking telescope no thank you butters said but how do we stop them i sighed theyre tough but theyre still flesh and bone massive trauma will do it sooner or later how massive i shrugged run them over with a truck chop them to bits with an ax burn them to ashes a gun or a baseball bat wont do it this may come as a shock to you harry but i dont have an ax with me is there something else maybe something that isnt so bunyanesque plenty i said if you can cut off the flow of energy into them theyll drop how do you do that youd have to ground them out running water is the best way but there needs to be a lot of it a small stream at least i could also probably trap one in a magic circle and cut off any energy from getting to it either way theyd just fall over plop magic circles butters shook his head and nothing else keep in mind that they arent intelligent i said zombies follow orders but they dont have much more intellect than your average animal you have to outthink themor the necromancer who is giving them orders you could also cut off the necromancers control of them how kill their drum uh what i shook my head sorry a zombie well it isnt really a person with thoughts and feelings and such but the corpse is used to being a person to eating breathingand to a beating heart thats how the necromancer controls them he plays a beat or some kind of rhythmic music and uses magic to substitute his beat for the zombies heartbeat he links himself to the beat the beat to the zombies heart and when the necromancer gives a command as far as the zombie is concerned its coming from inside him and he wants to do it thats how they can control them so completely that book butters said grevane kept drumming it against his leg and then outside that huge bass woofer in that cadillac exactly make the beat stop or get the zombies out of earshot and he loses control of them but thats really dicey why because it wont destroy the zombie it just frees it from the necromancers control anything could happen it could just shut down or it could start killing everyone it sees totally unpredictable if id stopped him from drumming in the exam room they might have killed us all or run off in different directions to hurt other people we couldnt afford to take the chance butters nodded absorbing this for a minute then he piped up with grevane said you werent a warden what is a warden wardens are the white councils version of cops i said they enforce the laws of magic bring criminals in for a trial and then they chop off their heads sometimes they get enthusiastic and just skip to the chopping well that doesnt sound so bad in theory i said but theyre so paranoid that next to them joe mccarthy looks like a friendly puppy they dont ask many questions and they dont hesitate to make up their minds if they think youve broken a law you might as well have thats not fair butters said no it isnt im not real popular with the wardens im not sure theyd come out to help me if i asked them what about other wizards on the council i sighed the white council is already at the limits of its resources even if they werent the council really really likes to not get involved he frowned could the cops stop grevane no way i said not a chance in hell are any of them prepared to handle him and if they tried a whole lot of good people would die butters sputtered theyll just sit there and let people like phil get killed he demanded his voice outraged if regular people cant do it and the council wont get involved who the hell is going to stop him i am i said chapter seven we went back to my apartment and i wasted no time getting butters inside and behind the protection of my wards mouse loomed up from little kitchen alcove and padded over to me tail wagging holy crap butters said you have a pony heh i said mouse sniffed at my hand and then walked over to snuffle around butterss legs with a certain solemn ceremony then he sneezed and looked up at butters wagging his tail can i pet him butters said if you do he wont leave you alone i went into my room to pick up a few things from my closet and when i came back out butters was sitting on the hearth poking the fire to life and feeding it fresh wood mouse sat nearby watching with patient interest what breed is he butters asked half chow and half wooly mammoth a wooly chammoth mouses jaws opened in a doggy grin wow some serious teeth there butters said he doesnt bite does he only bad guys i told him i grabbed mouses lead and clipped it to his collar im going to take him outside for a bit ill bring him back in then i want you to lock up and stay put he hesitated in midpoke youre leaving its safe i said ive got measures in place here that will prevent grevane from finding you by magical means you mean with a spell or something yeah i said my spells should counter grevanes and keep him from locating you while i get some things done you wont be here butters said he didnt sound too steady grevane wont find you i said but what if he does it anyway he wont sure sure he wont i believe you butters swallowed but what if he does i tried to give him a reassuring smile there are more wards in place to stop someone from coming in mouse will keep an eye on you and ill leave a note for thomas and ask him to stay home tonight just in case whos thomas roommate i said i dragged a piece of paper and a pen out of a cabinet in the base of the coffee table and started writing the note thomas bad guys from my end of the block are trying to kill the little guy in the living room his name is butters i brought him here to get him off the radar while i negotiate with them do me a favor and keep an eye on him until i get back harry i folded the note and stuck it up on the mantel hes smart and fairly tough im not sure when hell be back when he does tell him i brought you here and give him the note you should be okay butters exhaled slowly all right where are you going to the bookstore i said why there grevane was reading a copy of a book called die lied der erlking i want to know why butters stared at me for a second and then said in all of that with threats and guns and zombies and everything you noticed the title of the book he was holding yeah damn im good what do i do he asked get some sleep i waved a hand at my bookshelves read help yourself to anything in the kitchen oh one more thing do not open the door for any reason why not because the spells on it might kill you oh he said of course the spells no joking butters theyre meant to keep things out but if you open the door you could get caught in the backwash thomas has a talisman that will let him in safely so do i anyone else will be in for a world of hurt so stand clear he swallowed right okay what if the dog has to go i sighed he cant mess the place up any worse than thomas come on mouse lets make sure youll be settled mouse seemed to have a sixth sense about when not to take his time making use of the boardinghouses yard and we went to our little designated area and back with no delays i got him back inside with butters revved up the beetle and headed for bock ordered books artemis bock proprietor of chicago s oldest occult shop had been a fixture near lincoln park for years before i had ever moved to town the neighborhood was a bizarre blend of the worst a large city had to offer marching side by side with the erudite academia of the university of chicago it wasnt the kind of place i wanted to walk around after dark wizard or no but there wasnt much choice i parked the beetle a block down from the shop across the street from cheap apartments that were flying gang colors on the windows nearest the doors i wasnt too worried that someone was going to steal the blue beetle while i was in the shop the car just wasnt sexy enough to warrant stealing but to be on the safe side i made no pretense whatsoever of hiding my gun as i left the car and slipped it into a shoulder holster under my duster i had my staff with me too and i took it firmly into my right hand as i shut the car door and started down the street with a purpose my expression set and cold i didnt have a concealedcarry permit for the gun so i could wind up in jail for toting it along with me on the other hand this part of town was a favorite spot for some of the nastier denizens of the supernatural community between them and the very real prospect of your everyday urban criminal i could wind up in my grave for not toting it id err on the side of survival thank you very much on the short walk to the store i stepped over a pair of winos and tried to ignore a pale and toothin woman with empty eyes who staggered by in leopardprint tights a leather coat and a bra her pupils had dilated until her blue eyes looked black and she was nearly too stoned to walk she probably wasnt old but life had used her hard she saw me and for a second looked like she was going to display her wares but she got a closer look at my face and skittered to one side and tried to become invisible i went by her without comment the night was very cold in a few more weeks it would get cold enough that people like the two drunks and the stoned girl would start freezing to death someone would see a body and eventually someone would call the police the cops would show up and fill out on the police report that the body had been found and presumed accidentally frozen to death sometimes it wasnt an accident the weather was a convenient way for a dealer or for the outfit to kill someone who had gotten on their nerves something to knock them out a removal of a bit of clothing and leave them for the night to devour most of those bodies were found within a few blocks of where i was walking maybe thirty yards short of the shop i crossed some kind of invisible line where the oppressive dangerous atmosphere of the bad part of town lessened by several degrees a few steps later i caught my first glance of a u of c campus building far down the block i felt myself relax a little in response but that unspoken promise of safety and the rule of law was only an illusion the closer you got to campus the less crime occurred but there was nothing other than convention and slightly more frequent police patrols to keep the darker elements of the city from pushing the boundaries well there was one more thing but i couldnt afford to get involved with it mavras prohibition against involving anyone else meant that even if i wanted extra help i didnt dare ask for it i was on my own and if trouble came looking id have to handle it alone predators respond to body language i walked like i was on my way to rip someones face off until i made it to the shop and entered the store artemis bock proprietor sat behind a counter facing the door he was a bear of a man in his late fifties broadshouldered unshaven and heavyset with weathered muscle under a layer of comfortable living he had knuckles the size and texture of golf balls marked with old scars from whatever career hed pursued before hed become a storekeeper he wasnt anything so strong as a wizard but he knew his way around chicago around basic magical theory and his shop was protected with half a dozen subtle wards that did a lot to encourage people looking for trouble to look elsewhere the door chimes tinkled as i came in and there was a deeper chime from somewhere behind the counter bock had one arm on the counter and one out of sight under it until he peered over his reading glasses at my face and nodded he folded his arms onto the counter again hunched over what looked like an auto magazine and said mister dresden bock i replied with a nod his eyes flickered over my staff and i got the impression that he noticed or sensed the gun under the jacket i need to get into the cage i told him his shaggy eyebrows drew together the wardens were here not a month ago i run a clean shop you know that i lifted my gloved hand in a pacifying gesture this isnt an inspection tour personal business he made a rumbling sound in his throat something halfway between a sound of acknowledgment and one of apology he reached behind him without looking and snagged a key from where it hung on a peg on the wall behind him he flicked it at me i had to let my staff fall into the crook of my left arm so that i could use my right hand to catch the key i doubt it looked graceful but at least i didnt drop the staff and the key both which would have been more my speed you want to come along i asked him bock didnt let customers peruse the books in the cage without supervision what am i going to tell you he said and turned the page in his magazine i nodded and started for the back of the store mister dresden bock said hmm word is on the street that theres dark business afoot will was through here today said things were getting nervous i paused billy borden was the leader of a gang of genuine werewolves who called themselves the alphas and lived in the neighborhood around campus about four years before the alphas had learned how to shapeshift into wolves and had declared the campus area a monsterfree zone they backed it up by ripping monsters to shreds and they did it well enough that the local underworld of vampires ghouls and various other nasties found it easier to hunt elsewhere the magical community of chicago of people i meanwas centered around a number of different neighborhoods in town the clump around campus was the smallest but probably the most informed of them word has a way of getting around the occult crowd when something vicious is on the warpath and sends them hurrying to seek shelter or keep their heads down it was a survival instinct on behalf of those who were blessed with one form or another of talent for magic but who didnt have enough power to be a credible threat and one that i heartily encouraged things were bad enough without some amateur onetrick willy deciding he was going to hat up and take on the bad guys of course that was precisely what billy borden had done billy and company were not up to taking on people on grevanes level dont get me wrong they were a real threat to your average dark whatever especially working together but they werent used to dealing with someone in grevanes weight class billy needed to keep his head down but i couldnt contact him to tell him that hell even if i did hed just stick his jaw out at me and tell me he could handle it so i had to play another angle to get him to lie low if you see him again i told bock let him know that id appreciate it if hed keep his head down his eyes open and to get in touch with me before he moves on anything somethings happening bock said his eyes nickered over to his calendar i suddenly became conscious of the eyes of three or four other customers in the store it was late true but the occult community doesnt exactly keep standard hours and halloween was only two days off scratch that it was almost one am tomorrow was halloween that meant trickortreating for some people but it meant sacred samhain for others and there were a number of other beliefs attached to the day in the occult circles there was shopping to be done it might be i told bock you might want to be behind a threshold after dark for the next day or two just to be careful bocks expression told me that he thought i wasnt telling him everything i gave him a look that told him to mind his own damned business and headed for the back of the store bocks shop was bigger than youd have expected from the outside it had been a speakeasy back in the day fronting as a neighborhood grocery the front of the store offered a browsing area for customers interested in purchasing everything from crystals to incense to candles to oils to wands and other symbolic instruments of ritual magicyour typical new agey stuff there were various statues and idols for personal shrines meditation mats bits of furniture and other decoration for any alternative religion youd care to name including some figures of buddha and ghanesh behind the occult area were several rows of bookshelves holding one of the largest selections in town of books on the occult the paranormal and the mystical most of the books were chockfull of philosophy or religionpredominantly wiccan of one flavor or another but there were several texts slanted toward hindu beliefs drawn from the kabbalah voodoo and even a couple grounded in ancient beliefs in the norse or greek gods i steered clear of the whole mess myself magic wasnt something you needed god a god or gods to help you with but a lot of people felt differently than i did even some wizards of the council held deep religious convictions and felt that they were bound intricately to their magic of course if they believed it it was as good as true magic is closely interwoven with a wizards confidence some would say that it is bound up with a wizards faith and it would mean practically the same thing you have to believe in the magic for it to worknot just that it will happen but that it should happen thats what makes people like grevane so dangerous magic is essentially a force of creation of life grevanes necromancy made a mockery of life even as he used it to destroy besides being murderous and extremely icky there was something utterly profane about using magic to create a rotting semblance of a human life my stomach turned a little just thinking about what it might be like to work a spell like that and grevane believed in it which really seemed to make him look more and more like some kind of wacko a deadly powerful calm and intelligent lunatic i shook my head how do i get myself into this kind of crap i walked through the bookshelves to a door in the back wall while it wasnt precisely hidden the door had no frame and was set flush with the wall around it and was covered with the same paneling as the wall once it had opened to allow customers to slip into a private area to drink illegal booze now it was locked i used bocks key to open it and let myself into the back of the store the rear area wasnt largenothing more than a single room with an office built into one corner and a pair of long bookshelves set behind a heavy iron grille on the wall opposite the room was full of boxes shelves tables where bock would keep his spare inventory if any and where he handled his mailorder business there were a couple of safety lights glowing on outlets on the walls the office door was partly open and the light was on i heard the office radio playing quietly on a classicrock station i went to the door set in the iron grille and unlocked it then rolled open the cage door bock kept all of his valuable texts in the cage he had an original first printing of through the looking glass by lewis carroll autographed on the highest shelf carefully sealed in plastic and several dozen other rare books some of them even more valuable the remaining shelves were filled with serious texts on magic theory a lot of them were almost as occluded with opinion and philosophy as their more modern counterparts on the shelves in the front of the store the difference was that most of them were written by members of the council at one time or another there were very few volumes that addressed magic in its most elemental sense as a pure source of energy the way id been taught about it one of the notable exceptions was elementary magic by ebenezar mccoy it was the first book most wizards ever handed an apprentice it dealt with the nuts and bolts of moving energy around and stressed the need for control and responsibility on behalf of the wizard though now that i thought about it ebenezar hadnt handed me a copy of the book when hed been teaching me he hadnt even lectured me more than a couple of times he told me what he expected and then he lived it in front of me damned effective teaching method to my way of thinking i drew out a copy of his book and stared at it for a moment my stomach fluttered a little of course hed been lying to me too or at least not telling me the whole truth and the whole time hed been teaching me hed been under orders from the council to execute me if i wasnt perfectly behaved i hadnt been perfect the old man didnt kill me but he didnt trust me enough to come clean either he didnt tell me that he was in charge of dirty jobs for the council that he was their wetworks man the one who broke the laws of magic with their blessing who betrayed the same responsibility he wrote about talked about and had apparently lived he was trying to protect you harry i told myself that didnt make it right he never tried to be your hero your role model you did that that didnt change a damned thing he never wanted to hurt you he had the best intentions and the road to hell is paved with them you need to get over it you need to forgive him i slammed the book back onto the shelf hard hello called a womans voice from behind me i nearly jumped out of my skin my staff clattered to the ground and when i spun around my shield bracelet was up and spitting sparks and my was in my right hand pointing at the office she was young midtwenties at most she was average height dressed in a long wool skirt a turtleneck and a cardigan sweater all in colors of grey she had hair of medium brown held up into a bun with a pair of pencils wore glasses and had a heartshaped face that was more attractive than beautiful her features soft and appealing she had a smudge of ink on her chin and on the fingers of her right hand and she wore a name tag that had the store logo at the top and hi my name is shiela below it oh she said and stiffened becoming very pale oh um just take what you want i wont do anything i let out my breath between my teeth and slowly lowered the gun for crying out loud i had nearly started shooting tense much harry i let go of the energy running through the shield bracelet and it dimmed as well excuse me miss i said as politely as i could manage you startled me she blinked at me for a second confusion on her features oh she said then you arent robbing the store no i said thats good she put a hand to her chest breathing a little quickly it had to be a fairly generous chest given that i could notice the curves of her breasts even through the cardigan ah trusty libido even when i am up to my ears in trouble you are there to distract me from such trivial matters as survival oh then youre a customer i suppose may i help you i was just looking for a book i said well she said with businesslike cheer flick on that lamp next to you to begin with and well find what youre looking for i did and shiela smoothed her skirts and walked over to me she was average height maybe fivesix which made her approximately a foot shorter than me she paused as she got closer and peered up at me youre him she said youre harry dresden thats what the irs keeps telling me i said wow she said her eyes bright she had very dark eyes that went well with skin like cream and as she got closer i saw that her outfit did a lot to conceal some pleasant curves she wasnt going to be modeling bikinis anywhere but she looked like shed be very pleasant to curl up with on a cold night man i needed to date more or something i rubbed at my eyes and got my mind back on business ive wanted to meet you she said ever since i came to chicago you new in town i havent seen you here before six months she said five working here bock works you pretty late i said she nodded and brushed a curl of hair away from her cheek leaving a smudge of dark ink on it end of the month im doing books and inventory then she looked stricken and said oh i didnt even introduce myself shiela i guessed she stared at me for a second and then flushed and said oh right the name tag i stuck out my hand im harry she shook my hand her grip was firm soft warm and tingled with the energy of someone who had some kind of minor talent to practice id never really considered what it might be like for someone to sense my own aura shiela drew in a sharp breath and her arm jumped her inkstained fingers squeezed tight for a second and smudged my hand oh sorry sorry i rubbed my hand on my fatigue pants ive seen worse stains tonight i said which brings me to the books you stained a book she said her face and voice distressed no that was just a bad segue oh oh right she said nodding she absently rubbed her hands together youre here for a book what are you looking for a book called die lied der erlking oh ive read that one she scrunched up her nose eyes distant for a second then said two copies righthand shelf third row from the top eighth and ninth books from the left i blinked at her then went to the shelf and found the book where shed said wow good call eidetic memory she said with a pleased smile its sort of my talent she gestured vaguely with the hand shed touched me with must come in handy during inventory i checked the shelf theres only one copy though she frowned then shrugged mister bock must have sold one this week i bet he did i said troubled it bothered me to think about grevane standing in a store speaking to people like bock or shiela i pulled the cage closed and started slowly for the front of the store i opened the book id heard it referenced before in other works it was supposed to deal with the lore around the erlkoenig or elfking he was supposed to be a faerie figure of considerable power maybe a counterpart to the queens of the faerie courts the book had been compiled by wizard peabody early last century from the collected notes of a dozen different crusty wizards most of them dead at the time and was considered to be a work of nearly pure speculation how much i asked should be on an index card inside the cover shiela said walking politely beside me i looked the book was worth half a months rent no wonder id never bought a copy business hadnt been bad lately but between handling all of mouses licensing and shots and the trucks of food he ate and thomass job troubles i didnt have anything to spare maybe bock would let me lease it or something shiela and i walked out of the back room and started toward the front of the store as we came out of the book areas she said well i think you know the way from here it was a pleasure meeting you harry you too i said smiling hey she was a woman and pretty enough her smile was simply adorable maybe ill bump into you again sometime id like that only next time without the gun one of those oldfashioned girls huh i said she laughed and walked back toward the rear of the store find what you needed bock asked there was an edge to his voice something i couldnt quite place he was definitely uncomfortable i hope so i said uh about the price bock looked at me hard from under his thick eyebrows uh would you take a check he looked around the store and then nodded sure from you thanks i said i wrote out a check hoping it wouldnt bounce before i got to the door and sneaked my own glance around the shop did i run out your customers maybe he said uncomfortably sorry i said it happens might be better for them to be home you too in fact he shook his head i have a business to run he was an adult and hed been in this town longer than i had all right i said i handed him the check did you sell the other copy you had in inventory he put the check in the register and put the book into a plastic bag zipped it shut then put that in a paper sack two days ago he said after a moments thought do you remember to whom he puffed out a breath that flapped his jowls old gentleman long hair thinning liver spots real loose skin i asked moved kind of stiff bock looked around again nervous yeah thats him look mister dresden i just run the shop okay i dont want to get involved with any trouble i had no idea who the guy was he was just a customer all right i told him thanks bock he nodded and passed over the book i folded the sack book and all into a pocket on my duster and fished my car keys out of my pocket harry came shielas voice low and urgent i blinked and looked up at her yeah she nodded toward the front of the store her face anxious i looked out on the street outside the shop stood two figures they were dressed more or less identically long black robes long black cape big black mantles big black hoods that showed nothing of the faces inside one was taller than the other but other than that they simply stood on the sidewalk outside waiting i told these guys last week i didnt want to buy a ring i said i glanced at shiela see that witty under pressure that was a tolkien joke ha said bock more than a little uneasy i dont want any trouble here mister dresden relax bock i said if they wanted trouble theyd have kicked down the door theyre here to talk to you shiela asked probably i said of course if they were more of kemmlers knitting circle they might just walk up and try to kill me grevane had i drummed my fingers thoughtfully along the solid wood of my wizards staff bock looked at me his expression a little queasy he wasnt an easy man to frighten but he was no fool either i had wrecked three no wait four no at least four buildings during my cases in the last several years and he didnt want bock ordered books to be appended to the list that hurt a little normals looked at me like i was insane when i told people i was a wizard people who were in the know didnt look at me like i was insane they looked at me like i was insanely dangerous i guess at least four buildings later theyve got reason to think so maybe youd better close up shop for the night i told bock and shiela ill go out and talk to them chapter eight i paused just before i opened the shops door and walked outside it was one of those moments that would have had dramatic music if my life were a movie but instead i got a radio jingle for some kind of submarine sandwich place blaring over the stores ambient stereo the movie of my life must be really lowbudget the trick was to figure out which movie i was in if this was a variant on high noon then walking outside was probably a fairly dangerous idea on the other hand there was always the chance that i was still in the opening scenes of the maltese falcon and everyone trying to chase down the bird still wanted to talk to me in which case this was probably a good chance to dig for vital information about what might well be a growing storm around the search for the word of kemmler but just in case i shook out my shield bracelet to the ready i took my staff in hand and settled my fingers around it in a solid grip curling them to the sigilcarved surface of the wood one by one then i called up my power like i said magic comes from life and especially from emotions theyre a source of the same intangible energy that everyone can feel when an autumn moon rises and fills you with a sudden sense of bonedeep excitement or when the first warm breeze of spring rushes past your face full of the scents of life and drowns you in a sudden flood of unreasoning joy the passion of mighty music that brings tears to your eyes and the raw bubbling infectious laughter of small children at play the bellowing power of a stadium full of football fans shouting hey in time to that damned songtheyre all charged with magic my magic comes from the same places and maybe from darker places than that fear is an emotion too so is rage so is lust and madness im not a particularly good person im no charles manson or anything but im not going to be up for canonization either though in the past i think maybe i was a better person than i am today in the past i hadnt seen so many people hurt and killed and terrorized by the same kind of power that damn well should have been making the world a nicer place or at the least staying the hell away from it i hadnt made so many mistakes back then so many shortsighted decisions some of which had cost people their lives i had been sure of myself i had been whole my stupid hand hurt like hell i had half a dozen really gutwrenchingly good reasons to be afraid and i was worst of all if i made any mistakes murphy was going to be the one to pay for it if that happened i didnt know what i would do i drew it all in the good the bad and the crazy a low buzz that coursed through the air and rattled the idols and candles and incense holders on their shelves in the store around me in the glass door of the shop i saw my left hand vanish replaced with an irregular globe of angry blue light that trailed bits of heatless fire to the floor i pulled in the energy from all around me readying myself to defend to attack to protect or to destroy i didnt know what the two cloaked figures wanted but i wanted them to know that if theyd come looking for a fight id be willing to oblige them i held my power around me like a cloak and slipped out to face the pair waiting for me on the sidewalk i took my time every step unhurried and precise i kept an eye on them but only in my peripheral vision otherwise i left my eyes on the ground and walked slowly until the blue glow of my shield light fell on their dark robes making the black look blue darkening the shadows in the folds to hues too dark to have names then i stopped and lifted my eyes slowly daring them to meet my gaze it might have been my imagination but i thought the pair of them rocked back a little swaying like reeds before an oncoming storm october wind blew about us freezingcold air that took its chill from the icy depths of lake michigan what do you want i asked them i borrowed frost from the wind and put it in my voice the larger of the pair spoke the book but which book i wondered uhhuh youre a schubert fan boy arent you youve got the look goethe actually he said give it to me he was definitely after a copy of der erlking then his voice was odd male certainly but it didnt sound quite human there was a kind of quavering buzz in it that made it warble somehow made the words slither uncertainly the words were slow and enunciated they had to be in order to be intelligible bite me i answered him get your own book kemmlerite i have nothing but disdain for the madman kemmler he spat have a care what insults you offer this need not involve you at all dresden that gave me a moments pause as they say taking on arrogant powerful dark wizards is one thing taking on ones who have done their homework and who know who you are is something else entirely it was my turn to be rattled the dark figure noted it his nothuman voice swayed into the night again in a low laugh touche o dark master of evil bathrobes i said but im still not giving you my copy of the book i am called cowl he said was there amusement in his voice maybe and i am feeling patient this evening again i will ask it give me your copy of the book die lied der erlking bumped against my leg through the pocket of my duster and again do i answer thee bite me thrice will i ask and done said the figure warning in its tone gee let me think how am i gonna answer this time i said planting my feet on the ground cowl made a hissing sound and spread its arms slightly hands still low by its hips the cold wind off the lake began to blow harder thrice i ask and done cowl said his voice low hard angry give me the book suddenly the second figure took a step forward and said in a female version of cowls weird voice please there was a second of shocked silence and then cowl snarled kumori mind your tongue there is no cost in being polite said the smaller of the two kumori the robes were too thick and shapeless to give any hint at her form but there was something decidedly feminine in the gesture she made with one hand a roll of her wrist she faced me again and said the knowledge in der erlking is about to become dangerous dresden she said you need not give us the book simply destroy it here that will be sufficient i ask it of you please i looked between the two of them for a moment then i said ive seen you both before neither of them moved at biancas masquerade you were there on the dais with her as i spoke the words i became increasingly convinced of them the two figures id seen back then had never shown their faces but there was something in the way that cowl and kumori moved that matched the two shadows back then precisely you were the ones who gave the leanansidhe that athame perhaps said kumori but there was an inclination to her head that ceded me the truth of my statement that was such an amazingly screwedup evening its been coming back to haunt me for years i said and will for years to come said cowl a great many things of significance happened that night most of which you are not yet aware hells bells i complained im a wizard myself and i still get sick of that iknowandyoudont shtick in fact it pisses me off even faster than it used to cowl and kumori exchanged a long look and then kumori said dresden if you would spare yourself and others grief and pain destroy the book is that what youre doing i asked going around trashing copies there were fewer than a thousand printed kumori confirmed time has taken most of them over the past month we have accounted for the rest but for two here in chicago in this store why i demanded cowl moved his shoulders in the barest hint of a shrug is it not enough that kemmlers disciples could use this knowledge for great evil are you with the council i responded obviously not kumori replied from the depths of her hood uh huh i said seems to me that if you were on the upandup youd be working with the council rather than running around reinterpreting fahrenheit from a ringwraith perspective and it seems to me kumori answered smoothly that if you believed that their motives were as pure as they claim you would already have notified them yourself hello now that was a new tune someone suggesting that the council was bent and i was in the right i wasnt sure what kumori was trying to do but it was smartest to play this out and see what she had to say who says i havent this is pointless cowl said kumori said let me tell him pointless it costs nothing kumori said its going to if you keep dawdling i said im going to start billing you for wasting my time she made a weird sound that i only just recognized as a sigh can you believe at least that the contents of the book are dangerous grevane had seemed fond enough of his copy but i wouldnt know for sure what the big stink was about until i had time to read the book myself for the sake of expediency lets say that i do if the knowledge inside the book is dangerous cowl said what makes you think that the wardens or the council would use it any more wisely than kemmlers disciples because while they are a bunch of enormous assholes they always try to do the right thing i said if one of the wardens thought he might be about to practice black magic hed probably cut off his own head on pure reflex all of them kumori asked in a quiet voice are you sure i looked back and forth between them are you telling me that someone on the council is after kemmlers power the council is not what it was said cowl it has rotted from the inside and many wizards who have chafed at its restrictions have seen the war with the red court reveal its weakness it will fall soon perhaps before tomorrow night oh i drawled well gee why didnt you say so ill just hand you my copy of the book right now kumori held up a hand this is no deception dresden the world is changing the councils end is near and those who wish to survive it must act now before it is too late i took a deep breath normally im the first one to suggest we tp the councils house i said but youre talking about necromancy black magic you arent going to convince me that the council and the wardens have suddenly gotten a yen to trot down the lefthand path they wont touch the stuff ideally cowl said you are young dresden and you have much to learn you know what young me has learned not to spend too much time listening to the advice of people who want to get something out of me i said which includes car salesmen political candidates and weirdos in black capes who mug me on the street in the middle of the night enough cowl said anger making his voice almost unintelligible give us the book bite my ass cowl kumoris hood twitched back and forth between cowl and me she took three steps back just as well cowl murmured i have wanted to see for myself what has the wardens so nervous about you the cold wind rose again and the hairs on the back of my neck rose up stiffly a flash of sensation flickered over me as cowl drew in power a lot of power dont i said i lifted my shield bracelet weaving defensive energy before me with my thoughts i solidified my hold on my own power wrapping my fingers tight around my staff and then slammed it down hard on the concrete the cracking sound of it echoed back and forth from darkened buildings and the empty street walk away im not kidding dorosh he snarled in reply and extended his right hand he hit me with raw invisible forcepure will focused into a violent burst of kinetic energy i knew it was coming my shield was ready and i braced myself against it in precisely the correct way my defense was perfect it was all that saved my life ive traded practice blows with my old master justin dumorne himself at one time a warden i fought him in earnest too and won ive tested my strength in practice duels against the mentor who succeeded him ebenezar mccoy my faerie godmother the leanansidhe has a seriously nasty right hook metaphysically speaking and ive even gone up against the least of the queens of faerie throw in a couple of demons various magical constructs a thirteenstory fall in a runaway elevator half a dozen spellslingers of one amount of nasty or another and ive seen more sheer mystic violence than most wizards in the business ive beaten them all or at least survived them and ive got the scars to show for it cowl hit me harder than any of them my shield lit up like a floodlight and despite all that i could do to divert the energy he threw at me it hit me like a professional linebacker on an adrenaline frenzy if i hadnt been able to smooth it out and take the blow evenly across the whole front of my body it might have broken my nose or ribs or collarbone depending on where the energy bled through instead it felt like the jolly green giant had slugged me with a familysized beanbag if there had been any upward force on it it would have thrown me far enough to make me worry about the fall but the blow came headon driving me straight back i flew several yards in the air hit on my back scraped along the sidewalk and managed to turn the momentum into a roll i staggered to my feet leaning hard against a parked car i must have clipped my head at some point because stars were swirling around in my vision by the time i got myself upright again the panic had set in no one had ever thrown power like that at me stars and stones if i hadnt been absolutely prepared for that blow i swallowed id be dead or at best broken bleeding and utterly at the mercy of an unknown wizard one who was still nearby and probably getting ready to hit me again i forced thoughts and doubts from my mind and readied my shield my bracelet already grown so warm that i could feel it through the ugly scars on the skin of my wrist i couldnt even think about hitting back because if my shield wasnt back up and ready for another blow i wouldnt live long enough to get the chance cowl walked slowly toward me down the sidewalk all cloak and hood and shadows disappointing he said i hoped you were ready for the heavyweight division he flicked his wrist and the next blow howled at me in the freezing wind blowing off the lake this one came in at an angle and i didnt even try to stop it cold i sidestepped like a nervous horse angling my shield to deflect the blow again energy leaked through but this time it only shoved me across the sidewalk my shoulder hit the building and it drove the breath out of me ive had shoulder injuries before and it probably made it feel worse than it was i bounced off the building and kept my feet but my legs wobbled not from the effort of holding me up but from the energy id had to expend to survive the attacks cowl kept walking toward me hells bells it didnt even look like he was trying all that hard i got a cold feeling in my chest this man could kill me the book boy cowl said now what rose up in me then wasnt outrage or terror it wasnt righteous wrath it wasnt confidence or surety or determination to protect a loved one it was percent pure contrary stubbornness chicago was my town i didnt care who this joker was he wasnt going to come gliding down the streets of my town and push in my teeth for my milk money i dont get pushed around by anyone cowl was strong but his magic wasnt inhuman it was huge and it was different from what i worked with but it didnt have that nauseating greasy somehow empty feel that id come to associate with the worst black magic no that wasnt entirely true there was a lingering sense of black magic involved in his power then again theres a little of it in mine too the point being that cowl wasnt some kind of demon he was a wizard human and behind the magic just as fragile as me i poured power down my arm whirled my staff pointed it at the car on the street beside him and snarled forzare the sigils on the staff burst into sudden hellish scarlet light as bright as the blaze of my shield and shimmering waves of force flowed out from me they flooded out over the sidewalk under the toyota parked on the street nearest cowl i snarled with effort and the hellfire force abruptly lashed up underneath the street side of the car the car flipped up as lightly and quickly as a man overturning a kitchen chair cowl was under it there was a crash and hells bells it was loud glass shattered everywhere and sparks flew out in every direction the cars alarm went off warbling drunkenly and alarms started going off all up and down the street in apartment windows lights started blinking on i fell to one knee suddenly exhausted the light from staff and shield both dwindling to nothing and vanishing i had never moved that much mass before that quickly with nothing but raw kinetic energy and i could hardly find enough energy to focus my eyes if i hadnt had the staff to lean on id have been hugging the sidewalk there was the sound of metal grating on concrete oh come on i said panting the car shuddered then slid a few inches to one side cowl straightened slowly hed gotten back to the very rear of the cars impact area somehow and he must have been able to shield himself from the partial impact as he straightened he wavered then braced himself against a streetlight with one blackgloved hand i felt a surge of satisfaction take that jerk a low growling sound came warbling out of the black hood the book bite i panted me but he hadnt been talking to me kumori stepped out of the shadows of a doorway and gestured with a whispered word i felt a sudden strong tug at my dusters pocket the flap covering it flew up and the slender book in its paper bag started sliding out ack i managed which was all the repartee i was up for at the moment i rolled and trapped the book between my body and the ground kumori extended her hand again and more forcefully i slid two feet over the concrete until i braced a boot against an uneven joint in the sidewalk and saw movement behind the two figures game over i said stop it or what cowl demanded ever see wolfen i spat wolves appeared just freaking appeared out of the chicago night big wolves refugees from a previous epoch huge stronglooking beasts with white fangs and savage eyes one was crouched on the wrecked buick within an easy leap of cowl bright eyes fastened on him another had appeared behind kumori and a third leapt lightly down from a fire escape landing in a soundless crouch in front of her one appeared on either side of me and snarls bubbled out of the night more lights were coming on a siren wailed in the night what big teeth they have i said you want to keep going until the cops show up im game there wasnt even a pause for the two cloaked figures to look significantly at each other kumori glided to cowls side cowl gave me a look that i felt even if i couldnt see his face and he growled this isnt oh shut up i said you lost go cowls fingers formed into a rigid claw and he snarled a word i couldnt quite hear slashing at the air there was a surge of power darker this time somehow more nebulous the air around them blurred there was the sudden scent of mildew and lightless waters a sighing sound and as quickly as that they were simply gone billy i said a second later angry what the hell are you doing those people could have killed you the wolf crouching on the wrecked car looked at me and dropped its mouth open into a lolling grin it leapt over the broken glass to land beside me shimmered and a second later the wolf was gone replaced by a naked man crouching beside me billy was a little shorter than average and had more muscle than a bowflex commercial medium brown hair matching eyes and he wore a short beard now that made him look a lot older than when id met him years ago of course he was older than when id met him years ago this is my neighborhood he said quietly cant afford to let anyone make me look bad here he moved with quick efficiency getting a shoulder under one of mine and hauling me to my feet by main strength how bad are you hurt bruises i said the world spun a little as he hauled me up and i wasnt sure i could have stood on my own little wobbly out of breath cops will be here in about seventy seconds he said like someone who knew come on georgia s in the car at the other end of this alley no i said look just get me to my car i cant be i couldnt be seen with him if mavra was watching me or having me tailed it might mean that she would release the dirt she had on murphy but i damn sure couldnt just explain everything to him billy wasnt the sort to stand by when he saw a friend in trouble and i was damned lucky he wasnt i hadnt had much left in me but some hot air when cowl had stood up again no time billy said look well get you back here after things calm down later christ harry you crushed that car like a beer can i didnt know you were that strong me neither i said i couldnt get to my car on my own i couldnt afford to be seen with billy and the alphas but i couldnt allow myself to get detained or thrown into jail either never mind that if cowl and his sidekick had found me there might be other interested parties after me too if i kept showing my face on the streets someone would tear it off for me i had to go with billy i would cut things as short as i could i didnt want them involved in this business any more than they already were anyway as much to protect them as murphy dammit mavra would just have to show some freaking understanding maybe if i said please yeah right i might already have blown it and doomed murphy but i didnt have much choice i leaned on billy the werewolf and did the best i could to hobble along with him down the alley and off the street chapter nine billy probably could have picked me up and carried me at a flat run if he needed to but we had to cross only about fifty yards of alley and darkened street before an expensive suv its lights out cut over to the curb and made a swift stop in front of us quick i said still panting to the woof mobile billy helped me into the backseat followed me in and before the door was even shut the suv began accelerating smoothly and calmly from the scene the interior smelled like newcarscented air freshener and fast food what happened asked the driver she was a willowy young woman about billys age somewhere around six feet tall her brown hair was pulled into a severe braid and she wore jeans and a denim jacket hello harry evening georgia i replied slumping back against the headrest are you all right nothing a nice long nap wont fix he was attacked billy supplied answering the first question he tugged sweats and a tshirt out of an open gym bag and hopped into them with practiced motions the vampires again georgia asked she turned on the headlights and joined other traffic reflected streetlights gleamed off the diamond engagement ring on her left hand i thought the reds were staying out of town not vampires i said my eyelids started increasing their mass and i decided not to argue with them new friends i think they must have been other wizards billy said quietly big black cloaks and hoods i couldnt see their faces what set the police off she asked harry flipped a car over on top of one of them i heard georgia suck in her breath through her teeth yeah and im the one who lost the fight i muttered barely even rattled his cage my god georgia said is everyone all right yeah i replied the bad guys got away if the alphas hadnt come along when they did im not sure i would have everyone else scattered and theyll meet us back at the apartment billy said who were those guys i cant tell you that i said there was an empty second and then billys voice turned cautious why is it some kind of secret needtoknow wizard thing no i just have no freaking clue who it was oh what did they want billy asked i only showed up at the end i picked up a rare book at bocks apparently they wanted it i could have sworn i heard his brow furrow is it valuable something in it must be i answered i fumbled at my pocket and drew out the book to make sure it was still there the slender volume looked innocent enough and at least it wouldnt take too long to read through i appreciate the assist but i cant stay sure sure billy said what can we do to help dont take me to your apartment for one i said somewhere you dont go as much why not billy asked please man just do it and let me think for a minute i said and closed my eyes again i tried to work out how best to keep the alphas from getting involved in this business but my weary aching body betrayed me i dropped into a sudden darkness too black and silent to allow for any dreams when i jerked awake my neck was aching from being bent forward my chin on my chest we werent driving anymore and i was alone in the suv the hollow weariness had abated significantly and i didnt feel any trembling in my limbs i couldnt have been out for very long but even a little sleep can do wonders sometimes i got out and found myself in a garage big enough to house half a dozen cars though the suv and a shiny black mercury were the only two vehicles in it i recognized the place georgia s parents house an upperend place on the north side of town the alphas had brought me here once before when they helped rescue me from the lair of a gang of psychotic lycanthropes susan had been with me i shook my head took up my staff and the little book and walked toward the door to the house i paused just before i opened it and heard voices speaking in quiet tones i closed my eyes and focused on my sense of hearing head tilted to one side and the sound of the voices became clear and distinct enough for me to understand its a useful skill listening though i couldnt tell you exactly how to do it there was the sound of a phone being returned to its cradle theyre all fine billy said good georgia replied somethings going on did you see his face he looked tired billy said he looked more than just tired hes afraid maybe billy said after a second of hesitation so what if he is so how bad must things be if he is afraid georgia asked and theres more billy exhaled his hand you saw it then yeah after he nodded off hes not supposed to have any movement in it she said her voice growing more worried youve seen him on gaming nights he can barely cup his fingers to hold chips i heard the wood of his staff creaking under them tonight i thought he would crush it i blinked at that news and looked down at my gloved hand i tried to wiggle my fingers they sort of twitched hes been a little different since he got burned billy said its been longer than that georgia said its been since the year before remember when he showed up to gaming with all those bandages under his sweater he never would talk about what happened it was a week after that murder at the docks and that big terrorist scare at the airport its been since then hes been distant more all the time you think he had something to do with that murder billy asked of course not georgia said but i think he might have been working on a case and gotten involved with the victim in some way you know how he is he probably blames himself for her death i swallowed and tried not to think of a pretty darkhaired woman bleeding to death while the hold of her boat slowly filled with water shed made enough bad choices to get herself into trouble but i hadnt been able to protect her from the creature that had taken her life if hes in trouble were going to help him billy said yes georgia replied but think about this billy getting involved might not be the best way to do it what do you mean i mean that he didnt want us to take him to the apartment georgia said do you know why no i dont neither do you she made a disgusted sound billy hes afraid the apartment is being watched by who by what georgia said we havent seen or heard or scented anything if theres magic at work here it could be more than we know how to handle so what are you saying billy said that we should just abandon him if hes in trouble no she sighed but billy you saw what he was capable of doing we saw him mow through an army at the faerie battleground and you tell me tonight that he flipped a car onto one of these other wizards and that the man blew it off i dont think were weak but running off ghouls and trolls and the occasional vampire is one thing mixing it up with wizards is something else youve seen what kind of power they have im not afraid billy said then youre stupid georgia replied her voice blunt but not cruel harry isnt what he used to be hes been hurt and i dont care what he says his injured hand bothers him more than he lets on he doesnt need any more handicaps you want to just leave him alone billy asked i dont want to weigh him down you know him hell protect other people before he takes care of himself if hes operating so far out of our league we might not be anything but a distraction to him we have to understand our limits there was a long silence i dont care billy said then im not just going to stand by if hes in trouble all i want georgia said is for you to listen to him if he doesnt want our support or if he thinks it is too dangerous for us to be involved we have to trust that he knows what hes doing he knows things that we dont hes trusted us before and hes never led us wrong just promise me that youll return the compliment i cant just turn away billy said i wouldnt want you to georgia said but sometimes you think with your fangs and not with your head will there was the soft sound of a kiss i love you well help him however we can i just wanted you to consider the idea that he might not need us for violence billy took a couple of heavy steps one of the kitchen chairs creaked i dont know what else we can do well georgia said she opened the fridge what about these masked wizard types did you get close enough to scent them i tried billy said and i was closest to them but but i couldnt get a scent harry did something he flipped the car over there was a flash of red light and after that all i could smell was i heard georgia take a couple of steps maybe to touch him what did you smell sulfur billy said his voice a little weak i smelled brimstone there was silence what does it mean georgia asked that im worried about him billy said you should have seen the look on his face the rage ive never seen anyone look that angry you think hes what unstable georgia asked youre the psych grad billy said what do you think i put my hand on the door i hesitated for just a second and then pushed it open billy and georgia both sat in a rather roomy kitchen at a small table with two bottles of beer set open but untouched on the table they blinked and straightened staring up at me in surprise what do you think i asked georgia quietly id like to know too harry georgia said im just a grad student i went to the fridge and got myself a cold beer it was an american brand but ive got no palate in any case i like my beer cold i twisted the cap off then walked over to the table and sat down with them im not looking for a therapist youre a friend both of you are i swigged beer tell me what you think georgia and billy traded a look and billy nodded harry georgia said i think you need to talk to someone i dont think its important who it is but you have a lot of pressures on you and if you dont find some way to let them out youre going to hurt yourself billy said people talk to their friends man no one can do everything alone you work through it together i sipped some more beer georgia and billy did too we sat in silence for maybe four or five minutes then i said about two years ago i exposed myself to a demonic influence a creature called lasciel a fallen angel the kind of being that turns people into into real monsters georgia watched me her eyes focused intently on my face why did you do that it was in a silver coin i said whoever touched it would have been exposed there was a child who had no idea what it was i didnt think i just slapped my hand over it before the child could pick it up georgia nodded what happened i took measures to contain it i said i did everything i could think of and for a while i thought id been successful i sipped more beer then last year i realized that my magic was being augmented by a demonic energy called hellfire thats what you smelled tonight billy when i flipped the car why do you use it billy asked i shook my head it isnt my choice it just happens georgia frowned im not an expert on magic harry but from what ive learned that kind of power doesnt come for free no it doesnt then what was the price she asked i drew in a deep breath then i started peeling the leather glove off my scarred hand i wondered that too i said i slid the glove off and turned my hand over the scarring was the worst on the insides of my fingers and over my palm it looked more like melted wax than human flesh all white with flares of blue where some of the veins still survivedall except for the exact center of my palm there three lines of pink healthy flesh formed a sigil vaguely suggestive of an hourglass i found this there when i got burned i said its an ancient script its the symbol for the name of lasciel georgia drew in a slow breath and said oh billy looked back and forth between us oh what oh georgia gave me a bepatient look and turned to billy its a demon mark like a brand yes she looked at me for confirmation i nodded hes worried that this demon lasciel might be exerting some kind of control on him in ways that he cannot detect right i said everything i know tells me that i should be cut off from lasciel that i should be safe but the power is still there somehow and if the demon is influencing my thoughts pulling my strings i might not even be able to feel it happening georgia frowned do you believe that to be a probability its too dangerous to assume anything else i said i held up a hand thats not hubris its just a fact i have power if i use it unwisely or recklessly people could get hurt they could die and if lasciel is somehow influencing me who knows what could happen billy finished his tone sober yeah damn billy said we all took a sip of beer im worried i said i havent been able to find any answers ive gone through spell after spell rites ceremonies ive tried everything it wont go away jesus billy breathed an influence like this is detectable and against the laws of magic if the wardens found out and pushed a trial on me it might be enough to get me executed and if i get near the knight of the cross i told you about hell be able to feel it on me i dont know how hed react what he would think i swallowed im scared georgia touched my arm briefly then said you shouldnt be so hard on yourself harry i know you well enough to know that you would never want that kind of power much less abuse it if some part of me didnt want it i asked why didnt i pick up the kid instead of lasciels coin a heavy silence settled over the kitchen youve been friends to me stuck it out by me when times were rough i said a moment later youve made me welcome in your home in your life youre good people im sorry i havent been more open with you is that what tonight was about billy asked the demon no i said tonight was different and i cant tell you about it if youre trying to protect us billy began im not protecting you i said im protecting someone else if im seen with you it could get them badly hurt maybe even killed i dont understand i want to help billy said georgia put her hand over billys he glanced at her flushed and then closed his mouth i nodded and finished the beer i need you to trust me for a little while im sorry but the faster im out of here the better how can we help georgia asked just knowing that you want to is a help i told her but thats almost the only thing you can do for now at least almost the only thing i nodded if i could get something to eat and maybe a ride back to my car id be obliged we can do that billy said thank youi said chapter ten i raided the refrigerator and divested it of a small plate of cold cuts while billy made a call to his apartment moments later one of the other alphas called back confirming that the furor around bock ordered books had begun to die down only one patrol car still there billy reported plus the guys with the wrecker we shouldnt wait any longer i said with cops around any neighborhood monsters will lie low for a while to be careful i want to be back there and gone before they get moving again eat in the car georgia suggested and we all piled back into her suv georgia parked on the curb behind the beetle and let me out i had my keys in my hand ready to get in and get gone but when i saw the car i stopped someone had smashed out the remaining windows in the car glass littered the street and the cars interior parts of the windshield were missing and the rest clung together in a mass of fracture lines that made the whole mess opaque the back window had already been broken when i used my force ring on that zombie earlier in the evening the doors and the hood were dented in dozens of places and the door handles had been entirely smashed off the tires sagged limply and i could see long neat slashes in them without difficulty i approached the car slowly the wooden handle of a louisville slugger baseball bat protruded from the gaping driversside window the cardboard tag from the store still dangling from its string billy leaned out the suv window and let out a low whistle wow but on the upside i said now all the windows match what a mess georgia said i went around to the front of the car and opened the trunk it hadnt been tampered with my sawedoff shotgun was still in the backseat billy and georgia got out and walked over to me gang georgia asked gang wouldnt have left the gun i said the guys in the hoods billy guessed didnt strike me as the baseballbat type i reached in and picked up the bat with just my forefinger and thumb near the middle where it wouldnt mar any fingerprints left on it i showed it to them cowl would have used his magic to smash the car up not a club i walked around to the back of the car and frowned down at the engine it looked intact i leaned in the window and tried my key the engine turned over without any trouble huh billy said who completely ruins a car but doesnt touch the engine someone sending me a message i said billy pursed his lips what does it say that i need to rent a car apparently i said i shook my head i dont have time for this billy and georgia traded a look and georgia nodded she came over to me took my car keys where i held them in my cupped left hand and replaced them with her own oh hell no i said dont do that its not a big deal she told me look you still take your car to mikes garage right well yeah but but nothing billy said were only a couple of blocks from the apartment well get your car towed to mikes georgia nodded firmly just bring back the suv whenever the beetle is ready i thought it over seeing my car torn up was actually a hell of a lot more distressing than i thought it would be it was only a machine but it was my machine some part of me felt furious that someone had done this to my ride my first instinct was to refuse their offer get the beetle to the shop and use cabs until thenbut that was the anger talking i forced myself to apply my brain to it and figured that given how much running around i might need to do in the near future i couldnt afford it i couldnt afford the time that public transportation would cost me either assuming i could use it at all damn but i hate to swallow my pride its a new car something will blow out its still under warranty georgia said billy gave me a thumbsup good hunting harry whatever youre after i nodded back to him and said thanks i got into the suv and headed out to speak to the only person in chicago who knew as much about magic and death as i did mortimer lindquist had done pretty well for himself over the past couple of years and hed moved out of the little californiaimport stucco ranch house hed been in the last time id gone to visit him now he was working out of a converted duplex in bucktown mort leased both halves of the duplex and ran his business on one side with his home on the other there were no cars in the business driveway though he mostly operated at night he must have already wrapped up for the evening he had abandoned the fauxgothic decor that had previously graced his place of business which was a hopeful sign i needed the help of someone with real skill not a charlatan with a batch of gimmicks i parked the suv in the business driveway mowing down a patch of yellow pansies as i did i wasnt used to driving something that big the beetle might be small and slow but at least i knew exactly where its tires were going to go the lights were all out i availed myself of the brass knocker hung on the residential door fifteen minutes later a blearylooking little man answered he was short twenty or thirty pounds overweight and had given up trying to conceal his receding hairline in favor of shaving his scalp completely bald he was wrapped in a thick maroon bathrobe and wore grey slippers on his feet its three oclock in the morning mort complained what the hell do you he saw my face and his eyes widened in panic he hurried to shut the door i stabbed my oak staff into the doorway and stopped him from closing it hi mort got a minute go away dresden the little man said whatever it is you want i dont have it i leaned on my staff and put on an affable smile mort after all weve been through together i cant believe youd speak to me like that mort gestured furiously at a pale scar on his scalp the last time i had a conversation with you i wound up with a concussion and fifteen stitches in my head i need your help i said ha mort said thank you but no you might as well ask me to paint a target on my chest he kicked at my staff but not very hard those slippers wouldnt have protected his foot very well get out before something sees you here cant do that mort i said theres black magic afoot you know that dont you the little man stared at me in silence for a moment then he said why do you think i want you gone i dont want to be seen with you im not involved you are now i said i kept smiling but all i really wanted to do was throw a jab at his nose i guess my feelings must have leaked through into my expression because mort took one look at my face and blanched people are in trouble im helping them now open this damned door and help me or i swear to god i am going to come camp out on your lawn in my sleeping bag morts eyes widened and he looked around outside the house nervous energy making his eyes flick back and forth rapidly you son of a bitch he said believe it he opened the door i stepped inside and he shut it behind me snapping several locks closed the interior of the house was clean businesslike the entry hall had been converted into a small waiting room and beyond it lay the remainder of the first floor a richly colored room lined with candles in sconces now unlit featuring a large table of dark polished wood surrounded by matching handcarved chairs mort stalked into his seance room picked up a box of kitchen matches and started lighting a few candles well he asked going to show me how allpowerful you are call up a gale in my study maybe slam a few doors for dramatic effect would you like me to he threw the matches down on the table and took a seat at its head maybe i havent been clear with you dresden mort said im not a wizard im not with the council i have no interest in attracting their attention or that of their enemies i am not a participant in your war with the vampires i like my blood where it is this isnt about the vampires i said mort frowned no are things dying down then i grimaced and took a seat a few chairs down there was a nasty fight in mexico city three weeks ago and the wardens bloodied the red court s nose pretty well seems to have thrown a wrench in their plans for some reason getting ready to hit back mort said everyone figures that i said we just dont know where or when mort exhaled and leaned his forehead on the heel of one hand did you know i found someone theyd killed a couple of years ago young boy maybe ten years old a ghost i asked mort nodded little guy had no idea what was going on he didnt even know he was dead they cut his throat with a razor blade you could barely see the mark unless he turned to look over his right shoulder thats what they do i said how can you see things like that and not want to fight them bad things happen to people dresden mort said im sorry as hell about it but im not you i dont have the power to change it like hell you dont i said youre an ectomancer one of the strongest ive met youve got access to all kinds of information you could do a lot of good information doesnt stop fangs dresden if i start using what i know against them id be a threat five minutes after i get involved ill be the one with his throat cut better them than you huh he looked up and spread his hands i am what i am dresden a coward i dont apologize for it he folded his fingers and regarded me soberly whats the fastest way for me to get you away from my home and out of my life i leaned my staff against the table and slouched into my chair what do you know about whats been happening in town lately black magic mort asked not much ive had nightmares which is unusual the dead have been nervous for several days its been difficult to get them to answer a summons even with halloween coming up has that happened before i asked not on this scale mort said ive asked but they wont explain to me why theyre afraid in my experience its one way that spiritual entities react to the presence of dark powers i nodded frowning its necromancy i said you ever heard about a guy named kemmler morts eyes widened oh god his disciples i think so i said a lot of them morts face turned a little green that explains why theyre so afraid why he waved a hand the dead are terrified of whatever is moving around out there necromancers can enslave them control them even destroy them so they can feel their power i asked absolutely good i said i was counting on that mort frowned and arched an eyebrow im not sure how many of them are in town i said i need to know where they areor at least how many of them are here i want you to ask the dead to help me locate them he lifted both hands they wont ill tell you that for certain you couldnt get a ghost to willingly appear within screaming distance of a necromancer come on mort dont start holding out on me im not he said and held up two fingers in a scouts hand signal my pledge of honor upon it i exhaled frustrated what about residual magic what do you mean whenever these necromancers work with dark magic it leaves a kind of stain or footprint i can sense it if i get close enough so why dont you do it its a big town i said and whatever these lunatics are up to its got to happen by midnight halloween i dont have time to walk a grid hoping to get close and you think the dead will i think the dead can move through walls and the floor and that there are a whole lot more of them than there are of me i said if you ask them they might do it they might attract attention to themselves you mean mort said no they may be dead but that doesnt mean that they cant get hurt i wont risk that for council infighting i blinked for a second a few years ago mort had barely been able to crawl out of his bottle long enough to coldread credulous idiots into believing he could speak to their dead loved ones even after he had gotten his life together and begun to reclaim his atrophied talents he had never displayed any particular indication that he wanted anything more than to turn a profit on his genuine skills rather than with fraud mort always looked out for number one but not tonight i recognized the quiet steady light in his eyes he was not going to be pushed on this issue maybe mort wasnt willing to go to the wall for his fellow human beings but apparently with the dead it was different i hadnt expected the little ectomancer to grow a backbone even if it was only a partial one i weighed my options i could always try to lean harder on mort but i was pretty sure that it wouldnt do me much good i could try contacting the ghosts of chicagoland myselfbut while i knew the basic theory of ectomancy i had no practical experience with it i had no time to waste floundering around like a clueless newbie in an area of magic totally outside my practical experience mort i said look if you mean it ill respect that ill go right now he frowned his eyes wary but this isnt about wizard politics i said kemmlers disciples have already killed at least one person here in town and theyre going to kill more he slumped a little in his chair and closed his eyes bad things happen to people dresden thats not my fault please i said mort i have a friend involved in this if i dont deal with these assholes shes going to get hurt he didnt open his eyes or answer me dammit i couldnt force him to help me if he wasnt going to be moved he wasnt going to be moved thanks for nothing then mort i told him my voice sounded more tired than bitter keep on looking out for number one i rose picked up my staff and walked toward the door i had it unlocked and halfopen when mort said whats her name i paused and inhaled slowly its murphy i said without turning around karrin murphy there was a long silence oh mort said then you should have just said so ill ask them i looked over my shoulder the ectomancer stood up and walked over to a low bureau he withdrew several articles and started laying them out on the table i shut the door and locked it again then went back to the ectomancer mort unfolded a paper street map of chicago and laid it flat on the table then he set candles at each of its corners and lit them finally he poured red ink from a little vial into a perfume atomizer after watching him for a moment i asked why i knew her father mort said i know her father shes a good person i said thats what i hear he closed his eyes for a moment and took a deep breath dresden i need you to be quiet for a while i cant afford any distraction all right i said im going to ask them mort said you wont hear me but they will ill spray the ink into the air over the map and theyll bring it down wherever they find one of your footprints you think it will work i asked he shrugged maybe but ive never done this before he closed his eyes and added shhh i sat waiting and tried not to fidget mort was completely still for several minutes and then his lips started moving no sound came from them except for the quiet sighs of breathing when he inhaled he broke out into a sudden and heavy sweat his bald head gleaming in the candlelight the air suddenly vibrated against my face and flashes of cold raced over my body at random a second later i became acutely conscious of another presence in the room then another and a third seconds after that though i could see or hear no one i became certain that the room was packed with people and an accompanying sense of claustrophobia made me long to get outside into fresh air it was definitely magic but different from any i had felt before i fought the trapped panicked sensation and remained seated still and quiet mort nodded sharply picked up the atomizer and sprayed a mist of red ink into the air over the map i held my breath and leaned closer the mist drifted down over the map but instead of settling into an even spread the fine droplets began to swirl into miniature vortexes like tiny bloody tornadoes sweeping over the map scarlet circles formed at the base of the minitornadoes until the whirling cones spiraled down into vertical lines then vanished mort let out a grunt and slumped forward in his chair gasping for breath i stood up and examined the street map by candlelight did it work mort rasped i think it did i said i put my finger beside one of the larger red circles this is the forensic institute one of them created a zombie there earlier tonight mort sat up and leaned forward over the map his eyes glazed with fatigue he pointed at another bloody dot that one its the field museum i traced my finger to another one this one is in a pretty tough neighborhood i think its an apartment building i moved on to the next a cemetery and what the hell at ohare mort shook his head the inks darker than the others i think that means its beneath the airport in undertown uh huh i said that makes sense two more an alley down by burnham park and a sidewalk on wacker six mort said six i agreed six necromancers like grevane and cowl and only one of me hells bells chapter eleven i clipped my old iron mailbox with the front fender of the stupid suv as i pulled into the driveway at my apartment the box dented one corner of the vehicles hood and toppled over with a heavy clang i parked the suv and shoved the pole the mailbox was mounted on back into the ground but the impact had bent the pole my mailbox leaned drunkenly to one side but it stayed upright good enough for me i gathered up my gear including the sawedoff shotgun id removed from the beetle and got indoors in a hurry i set things down and locked up my wards and the heavy steel door id had installed after a big bad demon had huffed and puffed and blown down the original it wasnt until i had them all firmly secured that i let out a slow breath and started to relax the living room was lit only by the embers of the fire and a few tiny flames from the kitchen alcove i heard the soft thumping sound of mouses tail wagging against the icebox thomas sat in the big comfy recliner next to the fire absently stroking mister my cat curled up on thomass lap watched me with heavylidded eyes thomas i said all quiet on the basement front thomas murmured once butters wound down he just about dropped unconscious i told him he could sleep in the bed fine i said i took my copy of erlking lit a few candles on the end table and flopped down onto the couch thomas arched an eyebrow oh i said sitting up sorry didnt think you probably want to sleep not especially he said someone should keep watch anyway you all right i asked him i just dont feel like sleeping right now you can have the couch i nodded and settled down again you want to talk if i did id be talking he went back to staring at the fire and stroking the cat he was still upset obviously but id learned that it was pointless to start pushing thomas no matter how wellintentioned i might be hed dig in his heels from sheer obstinacy and the conversation would get nowhere thanks i said for looking out for butters for me thomas nodded we fell into a relaxed silence and i started reading the book a while later i fell asleep i dreamed almost immediately threatening trees mostly evergreens rose up around a small glade in its center a modest neat campfire sparked and crackled i could smell a lake somewhere nearby moss and flowers and dead fish blending in with the scent of mildewed pine the air was cold enough to make me shiver and i hunched a little closer to the fire but even so i felt like my back was to a glacier from somewhere overhead came the wild honking screams of migrating geese under a crescent moon i didnt recognize the place but it somehow seemed perfectly familiar a camping rig straddled the fire holding a tin coffee mug and a suspended pot of what smelled like some kind of rich stew maybe venison my father sat across the fire from me malcolm dresden was a tall spare man with dark hair and steady blue eyes his jeans were as heavily worn as his leather hiking boots and i could see that he was wearing his favorite redandwhite flannel shirt under his fleecelined hunting jacket he leaned forward and stirred the pot then took a sip from the spoon not bad he said he picked up a couple of tin mugs from one of the stones surrounding the fire and grabbed the coffeepot by its wooden handle he poured coffee into both cups hung the coffeepot back over the fire and offered me one of them you warm enough i accepted the mug and just stared at him for a moment maybe i had expected him to look exactly like i remembered but he didnt he looked so thin he looked young maybe even younger than me and so very very ordinary you go deaf son my father asked grinning or mute i fumbled for words its cold out here it is that he agreed he pulled a couple of packs of powdered creamer from a knapsack and passed them over to me along with a couple of packs of sugar we prepared the coffee in silence and sipped at it for a few moments it filled me with an earthy satisfying warmth that made the terrible chill along my spine more bearable this is a nice change of pace from my usual dream i said how so my father asked fewer tentacles fewer screams less death just then out in the blackness beneath the trees something let out an eerie wailing alien cry i shivered and my heart beat a little faster the night is young my father said dryly there was a rushing sound out in the woods and i saw the tops of several trees swaying in succession as something something big moved among them from tree to tree the unseen threat moved circling the little glade i looked down and saw ripples on the surface of my coffee my hand was trembling what is that i asked beware the jabberwock my son he said he took a sip of his coffee and regarded the motion in the trees without fear you know what it is you know what it wants i swallowed the demon he nodded blue eyes on mine i dont suppose im fresh out of vorpal swords my father said he reached into the pack and tossed me a miniature candy bar the closest i can get is a snickers snack you call that a funny line i asked look whos talking so i said why havent i dreamed about you before because i wasnt allowed to contact you before my father said easily not until others had crossed the line allowed i asked what others what line he waved a hand it isnt important and we dont have much time here before it returns i sighed and rubbed at my eyes okay im done with the stupid nostalgia dream why dont you go back to wherever you came from and ill have a nice soothing dream of going to work naked he laughed thats better i know youre afraid son afraid for your friends afraid for yourself but know this you are not alone i blinked at him several times what do you mean i mean that im not a part of your own subconscious son im me im real no offense but of course the dream version of you would say that i said he smiled is that what your heart tells you i am a dreamed shadow of memory i stared at him for a minute and then shook my head it cant be you youre dead he stood up walked around the fire then dropped to one knee beside me he put his hand on my shoulder yes im dead but that doesnt mean that im not here it doesnt mean that i dont love you boy the light of the fire blurred in front of my eyes and a horrible pang went through my chest dad his hand squeezed tighter im here i dont understand it i said why am i so afraid because youve got more to lose than you ever have before he said your brother your friends youve opened yourself up to them loved them you cant bear the thought of someone taking them away from you its getting to be too much i said my voice shook i just keep getting more wounded and tired they just keep coming at me im not some kind of superhero im just me and i didnt want any of this i dont want to die he put his other hand on my other shoulder and faced me intently i met his eyes while he spoke that fear is natural but it is also a weakness a path of attack for what would prey upon your mind you must learn to control it how i whispered no one can tell you that he said not me not an angel and not a fallen angel you are the product of your own choices harry and nothing can change that dont let anyone or anything tell you otherwise but my choices havent always been very good i said whose have he asked he smiled at me and rose im sorry son but i have to go wait i said he put his hand on my head and for that brief second i was a child again tired and small and utterly certain of my fathers strength my boy theres so much still ahead of you so much i whispered pain joy love death heartache terrible waters despair hope i wish i could have been with you longer i wish i could have helped you prepare for it for what i asked him shhhhh he said sleep ill keep the fire lit until morning and darkness and deep silent blissfully restful night swallowed me whole chapter twelve the next morning my brain was throbbing with far too many thoughts and worries to allow for any productive thinking i couldnt afford that until i knew exactly what was going on and how to stop it the most important weapon in my arsenal was reason i needed to clear my head i got my running clothes on as quietly as i could but as tired as butters looked i could probably have decked myself in a full suit of renaissance plate armor without waking him i took mouse on his morning walk filled up a plastic sports bottle with cold water and headed for the door thomas stood waiting for me at the suv dressed as i was in shorts and a tshirt only he made it look casually chic whereas i looked like i bought my wardrobe at garage sales wheres the beetle he asked shop i said someone beat it up why not sure yet i said feel like a run why he asked my heads full need to move thomas nodded in understanding where beach sure he said he hooked a thumb at the suv whats with the battleship billy and georgia loaned it to me that was nice of them nice and stupid it wont last long with me driving it i sighed but i need the wheels come on its after dawn but i still dont want to leave butters alone for long he nodded and we got into the suv you want to tell me whats going on god not until i can blow off some steam running i hear you he said and we remained silent all the way to the beach north avenue beach is one of the most popular spots in town in the summer on a cloudy morning at the end of october though not many folk were about there were two other cars in the parking lot probably belonging to the two other joggers moving steadily on the running trail i parked the suv and thomas and i got out i spent a couple of minutes stretching though it probably wasnt as thorough as it should have been thomas just leaned against the suv watching me without comment from what ive seen vampires dont seem to have a real big problem with pulled muscles i nodded to him and we both hit the running trail starting off at the slowest jog i could manage i ran like that for maybe ten minutes before i felt warm enough to pick up the pace thomas matched me the whole time his eyes halfclosed and distant my breathing hit a comfortable stride hard but not labored thomas didnt breathe hard at first either but my legs are a lot longer than his and id developed a taste for running as exercise over the past few years i shifted into a higher gear and finally made him start working to keep up with me we ran down the beach past the beach housea large structure built to resemble the top few decks of an old riverboat giving the impression that the vessel had sunk into the sand of the beach at the far end of the beach we would turn and come back we went all the way down and back three times before i slowed the pace a little and said so you wanna hear whats going on yeah he said okay there was no one nearby and by now the sun had risen enough to be peeking through the chicago skyline mavra couldnt have been listening in herself and it was unlikely any mortal accomplice could either it was as close to ideal privacy as i was likely to get i started with the arrival of mavras package and told thomas of the events of the entire evening you know what we should do thomas asked when i was finished we should kill mavra we could make it a family project no i said if we take her out murphy will be the one to suffer for it yeah yeah thomas said im pretty sure i know what murphy would have to say about that i dont want it to come to that i said besides whatever this word of kemmler is there are some seriously nasty people after it its probably a good idea to make sure they dont get it right thomas said so you keep it away from the nasty people so you can give it to the nasty vampire not if i can help it i said so murphy gets burned anyway he asked i narrowed my eyes not if i can help it how are you going to manage that im working on it i said the first step is to find the word of kemmler or the whole thing is a bust how do you do that the map i said i dont think these guys are running around working the major black magic for no reason i need to check out where theyve been and figure out what they were doing what about butters thomas asked for now we keep him behind my wards i dont know why grevane wanted him and until i figure it out hes got to keep his head down i doubt grevane was looking for a polka afficionado thomas said i know its got something to do with one of the bodies at the morgue so why not go there thomas asked because the guard was killed there theres blood all over the place maybe the guards body and god only knows what grevane did to the place after we left the cops will have it locked down hard by now and theyll definitely want to have a nice long talk with anyone who might have been there i cant afford to spin my wheels in an interrogation room right now neither can butters so ask murphy to look around thomas said i ground my teeth together for a few steps i cant murphys on vacation oh he said im watering her plants right while shes in hawaii uh huh he said with kincaid thomas stopped running i didnt he caught up to me a hundred yards later well thats a bitch i grunted i think she wanted me to tell her not to go i said i think thats why she came to see me so why didnt you he asked didnt realize it until it was too late besides shes not my girlfriend or anything not my place to tell her who she should see i shook my head besides i mean if it was going to be right with murphy it would have been right before now right if we got all involved and it didnt work out it would really screw things up for me i mean most of my living comes from jobs for si thats real reasonable and mature harry thomas said its smarter not to try to complicate things thomas frowned at me for a moment then he said youre serious arent you i shrugged i guess so yeah little brother he said i simply cannot get over how stupid you are at times stupid you just told me it was reasonable your excuses are thomas said but love isnt were not in love never gonna be thomas said if you keep being all logical about it like youre one to talk thomass shoes hit the trail a little more sharply i know what its like to lose it dont be an idiot harry dont lose it like i did i cant lose what i havent ever had you have a chance he said a snarl in his words and i had the sudden sense that he had come precariously close to violent action and thats more than ive got i didnt push him we got to the end of the trail and moved off it slowing to walk down the beach winding down thomas i said whats wrong with you today man im hungry he said his voice a low growl we can hit a mcdonalds or something on the way home i suggested he bared his teeth not that kind of hunger oh we walked awhile more and i said but you fed just yesterday he laughed a short and bitter sound fed no that woman that wasnt anything she looked like shed just run a marathon you took from her i took he spat the words but theres no substance to it i didnt take deeply from her not from anyone anymore not since justine but food is food right i said no he said it isnt why it isnt like that then what is it like theres no point in telling you he said why not you couldnt understand he said not if you dont tell me dolt i said thomas im your brother i want to understand you i stopped and put my hand on his shoulder shoving him just hard enough to make him turn to face me look i know its not working out the way we hoped but dammit if you just go storming off every time you get upset about something if you dont give me the chance to understand you were never going to get anywhere he closed his eyes frustration evident on his face he started walking down the beach just at the edge of what passed for surf in lake michigan i kept pace he walked all the way down the beach then stopped abruptly and said race me back beat me there and ill tell you i blinked what kind of kindergarten crap is that his grey eyes flashed with anger you want to know what its like beat me down the beach of all the ridiculous immature nonsense i said then i hooked a foot behind thomass calf shoved him down to the sand and took off down the beach at a dead sprint theres an almost primal joy in the sheer motion and power of running a race children run everywhere for a reasonits fun grownups can forget that sometimes i stretched out my legs still loose from the longer jog and even though i was running across sand the thrill of each stride filled my thoughts behind me thomas spat out a curse and scrambled to his feet setting out after me we ran through the grey light the morning had dawned cold and even at the lakeside the air was pretty dry thomas got ahead of me for a couple of steps looked back and kicked his heel flinging sand into my face and eyes i inhaled some of it started gasping and choking but managed to hook my fingers in the back of thomass tshirt i tugged hard as he stepped and i outweighed thomas considerably he stumbled again and choking and gasping i got ahead of him i regained my lead and held it the last hundred yards were the worst the cold dry air and sand burned at my throat that sharp painful dryness that only a long run and hard breathing can really do to you i swerved off the sand toward the parking lot thomass footsteps close behind me i beat him back to the suv by maybe four steps slapped the back of the vehicle with my hand then leaned against it panting heavily my throat felt like it had been baked in a kiln and as soon as i could manage it i took the keys out of my black nylon sports pouch there were several keys on the ring and i fumbled at them one at a time after the third wrong guess i had a brief sharp urge to break the window and grab the bottle of water id left sitting in the drivers seat i managed to force myself to try the keys methodically until i found the right one i opened the door grabbed the bottle twisted off the cap and lifted it to ease the parched discomfort in my throat i took my first gulp and the water felt and tasted like it had come from gods own water cooler it took the harshest edge off the burning thirst but i needed more to ease the discomfort completely before i could swallow again thomas batted the water bottle out of my hand it arched through the air and landed on the sand spilling uselessly onto the beach i spun on thomas staring at him in surprised anger he met my gaze with weary grey eyes and said its like that i stared at him its exactly like that his expression didnt change as he went around and got into the suv on the passenger side i stayed where i was for a moment trying to ignore my thirst it was all but impossible to do so i thought about living with that discomfort and pain hour after hour day after day knowing that all i had to do was pick up a vessel filled with what i needed and empty it to make me feel whole would i be able to content myself with a quick splash of relief now and then would i be able to take enough to keep me alive for a time perhaps but time itself would make the thirst no easier to bear time would inevitably weigh me down it would become more difficult to concentrate and to sleep which would in turn undermine my selfcontrol which would make it more difficult to concentrate and sleepa vicious cycle how long would i be able to last thomas had done it for most of a year i wasnt sure i would have done as well in his place i got into the suv closed the door and said thank you my brother nodded what now we go to eleven i said drinks are on you he smiled a little and nodded then what i took a deep breath the run had helped me clear some of the crap out of my head talking to my brother had helped a little more understanding him a little better made me both more concerned and a bit more confident i had my head together enough to see the next step i needed to take the apartment you keep an eye on butters i said im hitting these spots on the map to see what i can find if i cant turn up anything on my own i might have to go to the nevernever for some answers thats dangerous isnt it he said i started the car and shrugged my shoulder its a living chapter thirteen i took a shower got dressed and left thomas behind with the stillsleeping butters thomas settled down on the couch with a candle a book and an old us cavalry saber hed picked up in an estate sale and honed to a scalpels edge i left the sawedoff shotgun on the coffee table within arms reach and thomas nodded his thanks to me keep an eye on him i asked thomas turned a page nothing will touch him mouse settled down on the floor between butters and the door and huffed out a breath i got into the suv and got out morts map i headed for the nearest magical hot spot marked in bloody ink on the mapthe spot of sidewalk on wacker it was a bitch to find a parking place its never easy in chicago and i had a shot at a pretty good spot on the street but while the beetle would have managed just fine the ss loaner would have had to smash the cars on either side a few inches apart to fit i wound up taking out a mortgage to pay for a parking space at a garage walked a couple of city blocks and proceeded down the street with my wizards senses alert feeling for the dark energy that the citys dead had found i found the spot on the sidewalk outside of a corner pharmacy it was so small i had walked almost completely through it before i felt it it felt almost like walking into airconditioning the residual magic felt cold like the other dark power id touched terribly cold and my skin erupted in goose bumps i stopped on the spot closed my eyes and focused on the remaining energy it felt strange somehow dawn had dispersed most of the energy that had been there but even as an aftertaste of the magic that had been worked there the cold was dizzying id felt dark power similar to this before todaysimilar but not identical there was something about this that was unlike the horrible aura surrounding grevane or that i had sensed from wielders of black magic in my past this was undeniably the same power but it somehow lacked the greasy nauseating sense of corruption id felt before that was all i could sense i frowned and looked around there was a spot on the sidewalk that might have been a halfcleaned bloodstain or might have been spilled coffee around me businessday commuters came and went some of them pausing to give me annoyed glares cars purred by on the street i checked at the pharmacy but the place had been closed the night before and no one had been there or heard about anything out of the ordinary i checked the neighboring places of business but it was a part of town where not much was open after six or seven in the evening and no one had seen or heard about anything out of the ordinary most of the time the investigation business is like that you do a lot of looking and not finding the cure for it is to do more looking i walked back to the suv and went to the next spot on the map at the field museum the field museum is on lake shore drive and occupies the whole block north of soldiers field i felt a brief flash of gratitude that things usually went to hell during the workweek if this had been a sunday with the bears at home id have had to park and then backpack in from outer mongolia as it was i got a spot in the smaller parking lot in the same block as the museum which cost me only a portion of the national gross income i walked to the entrance from the parking lot and slowed my steps for a few strides there were two patrol cars and an ambulance parked outside the field museum s main entrance ah hah this stop looked like it might be a bit more interesting than the last one the doors had just opened for normal visiting hours and it cost me yet more of my money to get a ticket my wallet was getting even more anorexic than usual at this rate i wouldnt be able to afford to protect mankind from the perils of black magic hells bells that would be really embarrassing i went in the front entrance its impressively big the first thing my eyes landed on was the crown jewel of the field museum sue the largest most complete and most beautifully preserved skeleton of a tyrannosaurus rex ever discovered theyre the actual petrified bones toonone of this cheap plastic modeling crap for the tourists the museum prided itself on the authenticity of the exhibit and with reason theres no way to stand in sues shadow to see the bones of the enormous hunter its size its power its enormous teeth without feeling excruciatingly edible late october is not the museums high traffic season and i saw only a couple of other visitors in the great entrance hall museum security was in evidence a couple of men in brown quasiuniforms and an older fellow with greying hair and a comfortablelooking suit the man in the suit stood next to an unobtrusive doorway talking to a couple of uniformed police officers neither of which i recognized i moseyed over closer to the three of them casually browsing over various exhibits until i could get close enough to listen in damnedest thing the old security chief was saying never would have figured that this kind of business would happen here people are people said the older of the two cops a black man in his forties we can all get pretty crazy the younger cop was a little overweight and had a short haircut the color of steamed carrots sir do you know of anyone who might have had some kind of argument with mister bartlesby doctor the security man said dr bartlesby right said the younger cop writing on a notepad but do you know of anyone like that the security man shook his head dr bartlesby was a crotchety old bastard no one liked him much but i dont know of anyone who disliked him enough to kill him did he associate with anyone here he had a pair of assistants the security chief replied grad students i think young woman and a young man they a couple the younger cop asked not that i could tell the security chief said names the older cop asked alicia nelson was the girl the guy was chinese or something lee shawn or something does the museum have records on them the cop asked i dont think so they came in with dr bartlesby how long have you known the doctor the older cop asked about two months the security chief said he was a visiting professor doing a detailed examination of one of the traveling exhibits its already been taken down and packed up he was due to leave in a few more days which exhibit the young cop asked one of the native american displays the security man supplied cahokian artifacts ka what the older cop asked cahokian the security chief said amerind tribe that was all over the mississippi river valley seven or eight hundred years ago i guess were these artifacts valuable asked the older cop arguably the security chief said but their value is primarily academic pottery shards old tools stone weapons that kind of thing they wouldnt be easy to liquidate people do crazy things the young cop said still writing if you say so the security chief said look fellas the museum would really like to get this cleared up as quickly as possible its been hours already cant we get the remains taken out now sorry sir the older cop said not until the detectives are done documenting the scene how long will that take the security chief asked the older cops radio clicked and he took it off his belt and had a brief conversation sir he told the security chief theyre removing the body now forensics will be over in a couple of hours to sweep the room why the delay the chief asked the cop answered with a shrug but until then im afraid well have to close down access to the crime scene there are a dozen different senior members of the staff with offices off of that hallway the security chief protested im sure theyll finish up as quickly as they can sir the cop said though his tone brooked no debate told my boss id give it a try the chief sighed you want to come explain it to him glad to the cop said with a forced smile lead the way the two cops and the security chief strode off together presumably to talk to somebody with an office a receptionist and an irritatingly skewed perspective on the importance of isolating a crime scene i chewed on my lip i was pretty sure that the apparent murder the cops were talking about and my hot spot of dark magic had to be related to each other but if the hot spot was located on a murder site it would be shut away from any access forensics could spend hours even days going over a room for evidence that meant that if i wanted to get a look around i had to move immediately from what the cops had said forensics wasnt there yet the men moving the body were part of the new civilian agency the city government was employing to transport corpses around town judging from the ambulance outside both cops were with the security chief which would mean that at most there was maybe a detective and a cop at the crime scene there might be a chance that i could get close enough to see something it took me about two seconds to make up my mind the minute the security chief was out of sight i slipped through the nondescript doorway down a flight of stairs and into the plain and unassuming hallways meant for the field museum s staff instead of its visitors i passed a small alcove with a fridge a counter and a coffee machine i picked up a cup of coffee a bagel a newspaper and a spiral notebook someone had left there i piled up everything in my arms and tried to look like a bored academic on his way to his office i had no clue where i was going yet but i tried to walk like i knew what i was doing reaching out with my arcane senses in an effort to feel where the remnants of the hot spot might be i chose intersections methodically left each time i hit a couple of dead ends but tried to keep close track of where i was going the complex of tunnels and hallways under the field museum could swallow a small army without needing a glass of water and i couldnt afford to get lost down there it took me fifteen minutes to find it one hallway had been marked with crimescene tape and i homed in on it even before i turned down the hall my senses prickled with uneasy cold id found my hot spot of necromantic energy and there was a murder scene at its center i heard footsteps and slipped to one side remaining still as a pair of cops in suits came out arguing quietly with each other about the shortest path outside so that they could smoke theyd been cooped up with the body taking pictures and documenting the scene since before anyplace had been open for breakfast and neither one of them sounded like he was in a good mood rawlins said one of them into his radio where the hell are you talking to some administrator came the reply the voice of the older cop from upstairs how soon can you get down here to watch the site give me a few minutes dammit cursed the other detective bastard is doing this on purpose the one with the radio nodded screw this ive been on duty since noon yesterday weve got the scene documented itll keep for two minutes while he walks his slow ass down here the other detective nodded his agreement and they left i set my props aside and slipped under the tape and down the hallway there were office doors every couple of steps all closed at the end of the hall a door stood open the lights on i might have only a few minutes and if i was going to learn anything it had to be now i hurried forward there might not have been a body there anymore but even before i saw it the room stank of death its an elusive scent something that you get as a bonus to other smells rather than a distinctive smell of its own the thick sweet odor of blood was in the air mixed in with the faint stench of offal there was the musty moldy smell of old things long underground too as well as a few traces of something spicier maybe some kind of incense the death scent was mixed all through it something sharp and unnerving halfway between burned meat and cheap ammoniabased cleaner my stomach rolled uncomfortably and the rising sense of dark energy didnt help me keep it calm the office was a fairly large one shelves and filing cabinets lined the walls three desks sat clumped together in the middle of the room a small refrigerator sat in the corner near an old couch and a coffee table littered with mostly empty boxes of chinese takeout and a laptop computer books and boxes filled the shelves the desks were cluttered with books notebooks folders and a few personal articlesa novelty coffee mug a couple of picture frames and some recent popular novels everything had been splattered with blood and dark magic the blood had dried out and most of it was either redblack or dark brown there was a large pool on the floor between the door and the nearest desk dried into a sticky sludge a sharp almost straight line marked where the corpse had been lifted probably peeling up the hem of a jacket or coat from where it had been stuck to the floor droplets had splattered the walls the desk the photographs the novels and the novelty mugs i hated blood as a decorating theme it left something to be desired and it smelled horrible my stomach twisted again and i fought to keep down the doughnuts id grabbed at the convenience store i closed my eyes and then forced myself to open them again to look the only way to avoid more scenes like this was to look at this one figure out who had done it and then to go stop them from doing it again i pushed my revulsion away and focused on the scene searching for details there were a few smears of blood on the floor but none on the sides surface or edge of the nearest desk that meant that the victim hadnt moved much after hed gone down either hed been held down or hed bled out so quickly that he hadnt had time to crawl toward the nearest phone on the desk to call for help i looked up there wasnt much blood on the ceiling that didnt prove anything but if someone had opened his throat there would almost certainly have been blood sprayed all over it any other kind of bleeding wound would probably have left the victim evidently dr bartlesby able to function at least for a couple of minutes hed probably been held down i looked down there was part of a footprint in blood on the floor leading away it looked like part of the heel of an athletic shoeand not a large one either probably a womans shoe or a large childs for the sake of my ability to sleep at night i hoped it was an adults shoe children shouldnt see such things then again who should on an entirely different level the room was even more disturbing the dark power here was not the pure silent cold id felt on the sidewalk on wacker it felt corrupt dark somehow mutilated there was a sense of malicious glee to the residue of whatever magic had been worked here someone had used their power to murder a manand they had loved doing it worse it was a distinctly different aura than i had felt near either cowl or grevane magical workings didnt leave behind an exact fingerprint that could be traced to a given wizard but intuition told me that this working had been sloppier and more frenetic than something grevane would have done and messier than cowl would prefer but it was strongstronger magic than almost anything i had ever done whoever was behind the spell that had been wrought here was at least as powerful as i was maybe stronger heh drawled a voice from behind me i thought that was you i stiffened and turned around the older of the two cops from upstairs stood ten feet down the hall from me one hand resting casually on the butt of his sidearm his dark face was wary but not openly hostile and his stance one of caution but not alarm the name tag on his jacket read rawlins thought who was me i asked him harry dresden he said the wizard the guy murphy hires for si yeah i said i guess thats me he nodded i saw you upstairs you didnt look like your typical museum patron it was the big leather coat wasnt it i said that helped rawlins acknowledged what are you doing down here just looking i said i havent gone into the room yeah you can tell that from how i havent arrested you yet rawlins looked past me into the room and his expression sobered hell of a thing in there yeah i said something dont feel right about it he said just i dont know sets my teeth on edge more than usual ive seen knifings before this is different yeah i said it is dark eyes flicked back to me and the old cop exhaled this is something from down sis way yeah he grunted murphy send you not exactly i said why you here then because i dont like things that put cops teeth on edge i said you guys have any suspects for someone who just happened to be walking by you got a lot of questions he said for a beat cop in charge of securing the scene you were asking plenty of your own i said upstairs with museum security he grinned teeth very white shoot i been a detective before twice i lifted my eyebrows busted back down both times on account of i have an attitude problem rawlins said i gave him a lopsided smile you going to arrest me depends he said on what on why youre here he met my gaze directly openly his hand still on his gun i didnt meet his eyes for very long i glanced over my shoulder debating how to answer and decided to go with a little sincerity there are some bad people in town i dont think the police can get them im trying to find them before they hurt anyone else he studied me for a long minute then he took his hand off the gun and reached into his coat he tossed me a folded newspaper i caught it and unfolded it it was some kind of academic newsletter and on the cover page was a photograph of a portly old man with sideburns down to his jaw together with a smiling young woman and a young man with asian features the caption under the picture read visiting professor charles bartlesby and his assistants alicia nelson li xian prepare to examine cahokian collection at the fmnh chicago thats the victim in the middle rawlins said his assistants shared the office with him they have not been answering their cell phone numbers and are not in their apartments suspects i asked he shrugged not many people murder strangers he said they were the only ones in town who knew the victim came in with him from england somewhere i looked from the newsletter up to rawlins and frowned why are you helping me he lifted his eyebrows helping you you could have found that anywhere and i never saw you understood i said but why he leaned against the wall and folded his arms because when i was a young cop i went running down an alley when i heard a woman scream and i saw something something that his face became remote something that has given me bad dreams for about thirty years this thing strangling a girl i push it away from her empty my gun into it it picks me up and slams my head into a wall a few times i figured mama rawlinss baby boy was about to go the way of the dodo what happened i asked lieutenant murphys father showed up with a shotgun loaded with rock salt and killed it and when the sun comes up it burns this things corpse like it had been soaked in gasoline rawlins shook his head i owed her old man and i seen enough of the streets to know that shes been doing a lot of good you been helping her with that i nodded thank you i told him he nodded dont really feel like losing my job for you dresden get out before someone sees you something occurred to me you heard about the forensic institute he shrugged at me sure every cop has i mean what happened there last night i said rawlins shook his head i havent heard of anything i frowned at him a grisly murder at the morgue would have been all over the place in police scuttlebutt if not in the newspapers you havent are you sure sure im sure i nodded at him and walked down the hallway hey he said i looked over my shoulder can you stop them rawlins asked i hope so he glanced at the bloodied room and then back at me all right good hunting kid chapter fourteen wow butters said fiddling with the control panel on the suv this thing has everything satellite radio stations and i bet i could put my whole cd collection inside the changer on this player and oh cool check it out its got an onboard gps too so we cant get lost butters pushed a button on the control panel a calm voice emerged from the dashboard now entering helsinki i arched an eyebrow at the dashboard and then at butters maybe the car is lost maybe youre interfering with its computer too butters said you think he smiled tightly checking his seat belt for the tenth time just so were clear i have no problems with hiding harry i mean if youre worried about my ego or something dont im fine with the hiding happy even i pulled off the highway the green lawns and tended trees of the industrial park hosting the forensic institute appeared as the suv rolled up the ramp try to relax butters he jerked his head in a nervous negative shake i dont want to get killed or arrested im really bad at being arrested or killed its a calculated risk i said we need to find out what grevane wanted with you and were taking me to work why think about it what would have happened if theyd found you missing blood all over the place the building ransacked and phils corpse lying in the morgue or on the lawn outside someone would have gotten fired butters said yeah and they would have locked down the building to search for evidence and they would have grabbed you and locked you away somewhere for questioning at least so butters asked if grevane cleaned up what happened at the morgue it means he didnt want too much official attention focused there whatever he wants from you im betting its still in the building i pulled into the industrial park we have to find it eduardo mendoza he asked me offhand i cant think of any other reason for someone to want to grab your friendly neighborhood assistant medical examiner i said grevanes got to be interested in a corpse at the morgue and that one was the only one that seemed a little odd harry butters said if this guy really is a necromancera wizard of the deadthen why the hell would he need a plain old vanilla science nerd like me thats the sixtyfourthousanddollar question i said and we have another reason too the museum doctor guy right butters asked i nodded at him and parked in the lot next to butterss ruined little truck right i need to know what killed him hell any information could be useful butters exhaled well i dont know what ill be able to manage anything is more than i have now he looked around warily do you think do you think grevane or his buddy is out there right now watching for you know me i pulled open my coat and showed butters my shoulder holster and gun then i reached behind me and drew out my staff from the back of the suv if they show up im going to ruin their whole day he chewed on his lip you can do that right i took a look around and said butters trust me if theres one thing im good at its ruining peoples day he let out a nervous little laugh you can say that again if theres one thing im good at i began butters punched me lightly on the arm and i smiled at him well get in and out as quick as we can get you back under cover i think weve got it under control i killed the suvs ignition and pulled out the key the truck shuddered and a warbling wailing sound came from the dashboard for a second i expected someone to shout red alert all hands to battle stations instead there was a hiccup of sound from the truck and then a smooth recorded voice reported warning the door is ajar the door is ajar i blinked at the dashboard it repeated the warning several more times getting a little slower and lower pitched each time then droned into a basso rumble followed by silence that was not an omen i said firmly right butters replied in a faint voice because stuff is always messing up around you exactly i said i tried to think of a way to wring positive spin from that last statement but i wasnt up to the mental gymnastics come on the sooner we get moving the sooner we get you out of here okay he said and the pair of us got out of the suv and headed for the forensic institute as we approached the door i started limping and leaning on my staff a little as if i needed the support butters opened the door for me and i hobbled in with a pained expression on my face as we approached the security desk i didnt know the guard on duty he was in his midtwenties and looked athletic he watched us coming squinting a little and when we were well inside his eyebrows lifted dr butters he said evidently surprised i havent seen you in a while casey butters said giving him a jerky nod of the head hey i like the new haircut is dr brioche in hes working now casey said room one i think what are you doing here hoping to avoid a lecture butters replied dryly he clipped his identification to his coat i forgot to file some forms and if i dont get them done before the mail goes out brioche will scold me until my eyes bleed casey nodded and looked me over whos this harry dresden butters said hes got to sign off on the forms hes a consultant for the police department harry this is casey oroarke charmed i said and handed him the laminated identification card murphy had issued me to get me through police lines to crime scenes as i did i felt another cold pocket of dark energy grevane had murdered and then reanimated phil while the poor guy was sitting at his desk casey examined the card checked my face against the picture on it and passed it back to me with a polite smile you want me to tell dr brioche youre here dr butters butters shuddered not particularly right casey said and waved us past we were almost out of the entry hall when he spoke again doctor did you see phil this morning butters hesitated for a second before he turned around he was there at the desk the last time i saw him but i had to leave for an early dentist appointment why oh he wasnt at the desk when i got here casey said everything was locked down and the security system was armed maybe he had somewhere to be too butters suggested maybe casey agreed there was a faint frown line between his eyes he didnt tell me anything though i mean id have come in early if he had an appointment or something beats me butters said casey squinted at butters and then nodded slowly okay i just wouldnt want him to get in trouble over breaking protocol you know phil butters said casey rolled his eyes and nodded then went back to filling out some kind of paperwork butters and i slipped away from the entry hall and down to butterss usual examination room the place had been put back together his desk rested in its usual spot piled with papers and his computer whoever had cleaned up the room had done a fairly good job of it casey knows something butters said the minute the door was shut he suspects something thats what they pay security to do i said dont let it rattle you butters nodded looking around the examination room he walked over to his polka suit still piled in the corner at least they didnt wreck this he said then he let out a short laugh man are my priorities skewed or what everyone has something they love i said he nodded okay so what do we do now first things first i said can you get a look at bartlesbys corpse butters nodded and walked over to his computer i backed up and stood against the wall butters started the thing up and spent a minute or two waggling a mouse and stabbing at keys with his forefinger then he whistled wow bartlesbys body got here about an hour ago and its been nagged for immediate examination brioche is doing it is that unusual i asked he nodded it means someone really wants to know about the victim someone in government or law enforcement maybe he wrinkled up his nose plus it was pretty horrific brioche will get some press out of it of course he took this one for himself can you get to it i asked butters frowned and tapped a few more keys then he looked up at the clock maybe brioche is working in room one right now but hes got to be almost finished with whatever hes doing bartlesbys corpse is in room two if i hurry he stood up and scurried for the door wait here you sure i asked him he nodded someone really would get suspicious if they saw you roaming around if i need you ill give you a signal what signal ill imitate the scream of a terrified little girl he said with a waggle of his eyebrows he headed out the door back in a minute butters wasnt gone long and he slipped back into the room before five minutes had passed he looked a little shaky you all right i asked he nodded couldnt stay there for long i heard brioche come out of room one you see the body yeah butters said with a shudder it was already stripped and laid out bad stuff harry he had thirty or forty stab wounds in his upper thorax someone carved his face up too his nose ears eyelids and lips were in a sandwich baggie next to his head he took a deep breath someone had sliced off the quadriceps on both legs they were missing and hed been eviscerated i frowned how a big x shaped cut across his abdomen then they peeled him open like a chinese takeout box he was missing his stomach and most of his intestines there might have been other organs gone too ick i said extremely could you see anything else no even if id wanted to there wasnt time for more than a quick look he walked over to a rolling stand of medical instruments why would someone do that to him what possible purpose could it have served maybe some kind of ritual i said youve seen that before butters nodded he went through the motions of pulling on an apron mask gloves capthe works i still dont get it you know i did know butters didnt have it in him to comprehend the kind of violence hatred and bloodlust that had fallen upon the late bartlesby that kind of utter disregard for the sanctity of life simply didnt exist in his personal world and it left him at a total loss when confronted with it facetoface or i said a thought occurring to me it might have been something else anthropomancy he walked over to one of the freezers and cracked it open whats that an attempt to divine the future or gain information by reading human entrails butters turned to me slowly his face sickened youre kidding i shook my head its possible does it work he asked its extremely powerful and dangerous magic i answered anyone who does it has to kill someone and gets an immediate death sentence if the council learns of it if it didnt work no one would bother butterss mouth hardened into a firm line thats really wrong he frowned over the sentence and then nodded wrong i agree he turned back to the freezer checked a toe tag and then hauled a rolling exam table over to it this might take me a little while he said an hour and a half maybe more you want a hand with that i asked i hoped he didnt butters bless him shook his head he walked over to his desk and flicked on his cd player polka music filled the room id really rather do this alone you sure i asked just listen for a girlie scream he said can you wait for me up front i nodded leaned my staff in the corner and left him in the room he locked the door behind me and i wandered up to sit down in the waiting area near the front doors i took a chair that put the wall to my back and where i could see caseys video monitor the front door and the door leading back to the examination rooms i leaned my head back against the wall with my eyes mostly closed and waited over the next hour one doctor came in and another left the mailman showed up with the days deliveries as did the ups truck an ambulance arrived with the cadaver of an old woman that casey rolled away presumably into storage then a young couple came in the girl was about fivesix and pleasantly pretty even without much in the way of makeup she was dressed in sandals a simple blue sundress and a wool jacket her hair was cut into a bob full of unruly brown curls and her eyes were bloodshot with fatigue the young man wore a simple wellcut business suit he was a little under six feet tall had asian features wirerimmed glasses wide shoulders and wore his hair in a long ponytail i recognized them alicia nelson and li xian from the picture on the cover of the newsletter rawlins had given me dr bartlesbys missing assistants had come to the morgue i remained very still and tried to think thoughts that would make me blend in with the wall they walked to the security desk and stood so close to me that i didnt need to bother with listening to them good morning alicia said producing a drivers license and showing it to casey my name is alicia nelson im the late dr bartlesbys assistant i understand that his remains have been brought here casey regarded her without much in the way of expression maam we do not make that kind of information available to the public in order to protect the relatives of the deceased she nodded drew an envelope out of her purse and passed that to casey as well the doctor had no surviving family or next of kin she said but he granted me power of attorney over his estate two years ago the paperwork is all in order casey scanned it frowning mmmmph alicia pushed brown curls wearily from her eyes please sir the doctor had several personal effects which i need to take into custody as soon as possible passwords credit cards keys that sort of thing they were in his wallet whats the rush casey drawled some of his effects could potentially grant a thief access to his accounts and security boxes as you can see in the documents he wanted control of them to pass to me until i could arrange to have them passed on to the charities he patronized casey folded the pages up again and put them back in the envelope maam youre going to have to speak with our director dr brioche im sure hell be happy to help you out all right alicia agreed is he available ill go speak to him casey said if youll wait here please of course the girl replied she waited for casey to go through the security door and then spun on her heel and stalked over to the entrance staring out at the morning sunlight her posture was stiff with anger she leaned her forearm on the glass door and pressed her forehead to it the tall young man li xian had remained silent the whole while he followed her over to the door and spoke in a quiet voice i could scarcely hear i narrowed my eyes and listened back at any moment xian murmured we should sit down dont tell me what to do alicia shot back in a heated whisper im weary not idiotic you should get some rest before you do anything more xian said i dont see why youre playing games you should have let me follow the guard back stop thinking with your stomach the girl growled its bad enough that you lost control without adding a further lack of discipline to the situation we are not here because i stopped to eat xian replied anger of his own in his whisper if you hadnt indulged yourself we wouldnt face this problem the girl spun from the glass facing xian squarely her face contorted with pride and anger your attitude li is making you part of the problem not part of the solution the long haired man went white and cringed back from the girl his face rippled a sort of slithery motion just beneath the surface of his skin that stretched his features grotesquely causing a slight sinking of the eyes a slight elongation of the jaw he let out a gasp and when his mouth opened i could see the teeth of a carnivore it happened for only a second but i averted my eyes before he might have noticed me watching him if he had seen me i would have been in immediate danger id seen a flash of li xians true facehe was a ghoul ghouls are preternatural predators who derive their primary sustenance from devouring human flesh fresh cold rotting they dont care as long as it gets into their bellies my stomach turned butters said that someone had removed bartlesbys quadriceps the long strong muscles on the front of the thigh it had been xian hed carved himself steaks from the old mans corpse if he suspected that i knew what he was he might decide to protect himself with extreme prejudice and that would be bad ghouls are quick strong and harder to kill than a juicy rumor about the president id fought ghouls before and it wasnt something i wanted to repeat if i could avoid it especially given that id left my staff in butterss office xian recovered his normal appearance and lowered his eyes he bowed his head to alicia do i make myself clear the girl whispered yes my lord xian replied lord i thought my mind raced over the possibilities alicia exhaled and pressed her thumb against the spot between her eyebrows dont talk xian just dont talk well all be happier and safer she breezed past him back to the little waiting area and sat down she picked up a copy of newsweek sitting out on an end table and began to flick through it while xian remained standing near the door i pretended to be drowsing casey returned a couple of minutes later and said ms nelson its going to be a while before dr brioche can see you how long she asked smiling an hour or so at least casey said he says that if youd like to make an appointment for this afternoon that he will be glad to no she interrupted him shaking her head firmly some of his business is timecritical and i need to recover his effects at the earliest possible opportunity please tell him that i will wait casey lifted his eyebrows and then shrugged yes maam i blinked my eyes a few times and then sat up straight stretching oh hey casey i mumbled standing i feigned a limp and went to the desk i left my cane in butterss office would it be okay to go back and grab it casey nodded one second he picked up the phone and a second later i heard polka music pumping through the little speaker doctor your consultant friend forgot something in your office you want me to send him back he listened nodding and then waved me at the door buzzing me through i hurried back to butterss examination room and knocked butters unlocked the door to let me in hurry i told him glancing back down the hall weve got to go butters gulped whats going on there are some bad guys here grevane he asked no new bad guys i said more of them butters said thats not fair i know its getting to be like satans reunion tour around here i shook my head is there a back door yes good grab your stuff and lets go butters gestured at the exam table but what about eduardo i chewed on my lip you find out anything not a lot he said a car hit him he suffered some pretty massive blunt impact trauma he died i frowned and took a few steps toward the corpse theres got to be more to it than that butters shrugged if there is i didnt see it i frowned down at the dead man he was a painfully skinny specimen his abdomen had been opened with a neat y incision there was a lot of blood and disgustinglooking greyish flesh broken jagged bone protruded from the skin of one leg one hand had been crushed into pulp and his face looked familiar i recognized him butters i said what was this guys name eduardo mendoza his full name i said oh uh eduardo antonio mendoza antonio i said its him its tony who butters asked bony tony mendoza i said excited hes a smuggler butters tilted his head at me a smuggler not like han solo i guess no hes a ballooner whats that i gestured at his head hed done time in a carnival as a sword swallower when he was a kid he would fill up a balloon with jewels or drugs or whatever other small items he wanted to move around then he swallowed the balloon with a string tied to it check at the back of his mouth hed wedge the string between two of his back teeth and pull the balloon out when the coast was clear thats silly butters said but he went over to the corpse and pried its jaws open he adjusted an overhead work lamp on a flexible stand and peered down past bony tonys teeth holy crap its there he fished around for a few moments while i went back to the door and picked up my staff i looked back to see butters drag from the corpses mouth a yellowwhite condom with its end closed and a heavy piece of kite cord knotted around it whats in it i asked hang on butters sliced the condom open with a scalpel and withdrew a small rectangle of dark plastic about the size of a key chain ornament what is that i asked him its a jump drive he said frowning a what you plug it into your computer so you can store data on it when you want to move files around to other machines information i said frowning bony tony was smuggling information something grevane needed to know maybe the two out front wanted it too maybe thats why he got killed ugh butters said can you read the information i asked him maybe he said i can try another machine not now i said no time we need to get out of here why because things have just become a lot more dangerous they have butters chewed on his lip why because i said bony tony worked for john marcone chapter fifteen gentleman johnnie marcone was the most powerful figure in chicago s criminal underworld if there was an illegal enterprise afoot marcone was either in charge of it or had been paid for the privilege of its operating in his territory bony tony had done most of a dime in a federal penitentiary for trafficking in narcotics and after that hed moved into less politically incorrect areas of the business he mostly dealt in moving stolen goods everything from jewels to hot furniture i wasnt sure exactly where bony tony ranked in marcones criminal hierarchy but marcone wasnt the sort of person who would take the murder of one of his people lightlynot without his approval at any rate marcone would know about bony tonys death soon if he didnt already he was sure to get involved in one fashion or another and the best way for him to get to whoever had killed bony tony would be to get his hands on whatever it was they wanted i had to get butters somewhere safe the quicker the better but until i knew what was on that storage device i couldnt judge what would be safe for him and what wouldnt harry butters said as if he was repeating himself i blinked a couple of times what do you want to hang on to this he said in the same tone he stepped over to me and offered me the little slip of plastic no i snapped and took two steps back butters get that the hell away from me he froze in place staring at me his expression somewhere between confused and wounded im sorry i took in a deep breath where the hell was my concentration this was no time to start spacing out on trains of thought no matter how relevant to the circumstances dont be i said look that thing doesnt have any moving parts right electronic storage yeah then i dont dare touch it i said remember how messed up my xrays were he nodded youre saying that the data on here could get messed up the same way i couldnt ever have cassette tapes after i started working magic i said theyd just fade away into static after a while the magnetic strips on my credit cards stopped working in a day or two butters chewed on his lip and nodded slowly the data on the jump drive would be even more fragile than a magnetic strip it might make sense if it was some kind of erratic electromagnetic field around you every human body gives off a unique field of electromagnetic energy it could be like with your cell replication that your field is more butters i said no time for that now the important thing is that i dont dare touch that toy i frowned thinking out loud or take it back to my place either the wards keep magic out but they keep it in too it would probably fry it to hang around in there for too long even working any heavy energy around it could be dangerous well thats stupid butters said i mean storing important wizard information on something that getting close to a wizard would destroy its not stupid if you want to sell it to a wizard and youre worried the buyer might off you instead of dealing in good faith i said butters looked at the corpse and then back at me you think grevane killed bony tony yeah i said but grevane knew that he couldnt get to the information on that jump drive on his own butters swallowed which explains why he needed me yeah i chewed on my lip for a second and then said get bony tony back in the fridge were leaving butters nodded and went back to the examining table he threw the cloth over the corpse where can you read that thing here no butters said this computer is too old it has the wrong ports we could go to one of the other offices maybe no we need to get out of herenow we could go to my place butters suggested no grevane will definitely have it under surveillance dammit why dammit were short on options and that means we have to go someplace i didnt want to go where he asked a friends come on right butters said and promptly walked over to his polka suit he heaved up a couple of pieces the cymbals clashed tinnily against one another what are you doing i demanded weve got to go im not leaving it here for god knows what to mess with butters said he grunted and threw a strap awkwardly over his shoulder the bass drum rumbled yes you are i said we are not taking it with us we dont have time for this butters turned to face me his expression stricken that stupid polka suit filled up most of the back of the suv it was a pain to move it without making a bunch of noise but in the end we managed to slip out the back door of the forensic institute and make a clean getaway i watched the road behind us carefully until i was sure that i wasnt being followed then i headed for the campus area and billys apartment i pulled into the apartments parking lot leaned out and yelled hey a young man with arms and legs a few sizes too large to match his body appeared from behind the corner of the building frowning he was dressed in sweats a tshirt and boat shoes standard easily discarded werewolf wardrobe for troubled times he flipped an untidy mop of black hair out of his eyes and leaned against the suvs door hey harry kirby i greeted him this is my friend butters kirby nodded to butters and asked me did you spot me no but billy always has someone on watch outside when times are tense kirby nodded his expression serious what do you need park this beast for me i keep running into things sure billy and georgia are upstairs i got out of the car and butters hopped out with me thanks man yeah kirby said he got in the suv and frowned he looked around at all the doors the door is ajar the dashboard said it wont shut up i explained to him it gets sort of zen after a while butters said brightly life is a journey time is a river the door is a jar kirby gave him a skeptical look i grabbed butters by the shoulder and hauled him into the building and up to the apartment billy opened the door before we even got to it and looked out expectantly he stepped a bit to one side holding the door open for us watching up and down the hallway heya harry the apartment was a typical college placesmall a couple of bedrooms nothing permanent on the walls furniture that wasnt too expensive or hard to move and equipped with an expensive entertainment center georgia sat on the couch reading from one of a small mountain of medical books i walked in and introduced everyone i need a computer i told billy he arched an eyebrow at me i waved a hand in a vague motion tell him butters butters pulled the jump drive from his pocket and showed it to billy anything with a usb port georgia frowned and asked whats on it im not sure i said i need to know she nodded better let him use the one on the far wall of the computer room will the farther from harry the better feel the love i sighed i pointed at the little table next to the door and asked can i make a few calls while i wait sure billy turned to butters right this way they went into one of the bedrooms georgia went back to her book i picked up the phone the phone at my place rang a dozen times before it rattled and then thomas slurred what its me i said you all right i was all right i was asleep stupid mouse woke me up to get the phone any sign of visitors calls no and no he said get some more sleep i said he made a grunting noise and hung up i called my answering service next they had recently phased over to stored voice mail i was suspicious of it on general principles from a purely logical standpoint i knew my issues with technology wouldnt extend all the way across town over the phone lines but all the same i didnt trust it i would much rather have dealt with an actual person taking messages but it cost too much now to keep someone manning the phones when voice mail could do all the work i punched the buttons and had to go through all the menus only twice to get it to work beeeeeep harry its murphy we got into hawaii all right and there was no problem with the hotel so you can reach me at those contact numbers ill call in again in a couple of her voice broke off into a sudden highpitched noise would you stop that she demanded with a lot more laughter than anger in her voice im on the phone in a couple of days harry thanks for taking care of my pants er plants plants beeeeeep i wondered what had caused murphy to make a highpitched noise and a big old freudian slip and i wondered what to read into the fact that she had left me a message instead of calling me at home probably nothing she probably didnt want to wake me up or something yeah she was probably only thinking of me beeeeep harry mike the beetle will be ready at noon beeeeep god bless mechanic mike if i heard a car complaining about its closed doors being open one more time i would have to disintegrate something beeeeep oh said a young womans voice mister dresden its shiela starr we met at bock ordered books last night there was the sound of her taking an unsteady breath i wondered if i could ask for a few minutes of your time there have been i mean im not completely certain but i think something is wrong here at the store i mean she let out a snippet of laughter that was half anxiety and half weariness oh hell i probably sound crazy but i would really like to speak to you about it ill be at the shop until noon or you can call my apartment she gave me the number i hope you can come by the store though i would really appreciate it beeeep i found myself frowning shiela hadnt said it outright but she had sounded pretty scared that wasnt terribly surprising given what shed probably seen happening right outside bocks shop the night before but it made me feel uncomfortable to hear fear in her voice or maybe its more correct to say that im not comfortable with fear in any womans voice its not my fault i know its sexist and macho and its retrograde social evolution but i hate it when bad things happen to women dont get me wrong i hate bad things to happen to anyonebut when its a woman thats in danger i hate it with a reflexive bonedeep primal mindlessness that borders on insanity women are beautiful creatures and dammit i enjoy making sure that theyre safe and treating them with oldfashioned manners and courtesy it just seems right id suffered for thinking that way more than once but it still didnt change the way i felt shiela was a girl and she was scared therefore if i wanted to have any peace of mind i was going to have to go talk to her i checked the clock eleven she was still at the store i dialed one more number and got an answering machine with no message only a tone this is dresden i told the machine and we need to talk butters and billy reappeared i hung up the phone and asked them well numbers said billy more specific i asked butters shook his head its hard to be any more specific than that there was only one file on the jump drive and it was empty the only information on it was the file name and it was just a number he offered me a piece of white paper with a string of numerals printed on it in his spidery scrawl i counted there were sixteen of them thats it i took the paper and frowned at the numbers that is spectacularly useless yeah butters said quietly i rubbed at the bridge of my nose okay let me think i tried to prioritize grevane was out there looking for butters maybe marcone was looking for him too maybe the dead professors two assistants to boot butters we have to get you behind my wards again he blinked at me but why i mean they wanted me so that they could get to the information im useless to them now you and i know that they dont oh billy i said could you please take butters over to my place no problem he said what about you wont you need wheels the beetle is ready ill take a cab i can drop you off billy offered no its the opposite way from my apartment and butters needs to get there yesterday go around the block once or twice before you pull in make sure no one is watching the door billy smiled i know the drill dont try to open the door yourself butters knock and wait for thomas to do it right butters fretted at his lip a little what are you going to be doing detective stuff i have places to go and people to see and with a little luck none of them would kill me chapter sixteen billys apartment was only a couple of blocks from bock ordered books and while i could have taken a couple of alleys to make the trip even shorter i kept on the open streets where there were plenty of people i didnt see anyone following me but if there was a good enough team on meor if they were using veils to hide their presence of coursei might miss them i kept my staff in my right hand and made sure my shield bracelet was ready in case anyone tried some kind of variant on the old driveup assassination id survived them before but the classics never go out of style i got to bocks in one piece and no one so much as glared at me i felt sort of rejected but comforted myself with the knowledge that there were at least half a dozen people in town who were sure to keep making my life dangerous more if you counted mavra who technically wasnt a person bock didnt open the doors of his store until eleven so when i went in i was probably the first one to show up for the day i paused outside the door two of the store windows and the glass panel of the door were all gone replaced by rough sheets of plywood bock had gotten off better than the boutique next doorall the glass was gone doubtless shattered by one kind of flying debris or another during my conversation with cowl and his sidekick i went inside bock was at his place behind the counter and looked tired he glanced up at the sound of his door chimes his expression became something closed and cautious when he saw me bock i said you here all night end ofthemonth inventory he said his voice careful and quiet and repairing the windows what do you need i looked around the inside of the store shiela appeared from behind one of the shelves at the back of the store looking anxious she saw me and exhaled a little then gave me a quiet smile just here to talk i told bock nodding toward shiela he glanced at her then back at me frowning dresden theres something i need to say to you i arched an eyebrow at him whats wrong look i dont want to make you upset i leaned on my staff bock come on youve known me ever since i came to town if somethings wrong you arent going to upset me by telling me about it he folded his thick forearms over his paunch and said i dont want you coming into my store anymore i leaned on my staff a little more oh youre a decent enough man youve never jumped down my throat like the other folks from the council youve helped people around here he took a deep breath and made a vague gesture toward the plywood patches on his shop but youre trouble it follows you around which was true enough i didnt say anything not everyone can drop a car on someone who attacks them bock went on ive got a family my oldest is in college i cant afford to have the place wrecked i nodded i could understand bocks position its terrifying to feel helpless in the face of a greater powermore so than it is painful to be told you arent wanted somewhere look if you need anything give me a call ill order it or pull it off the shelves for you will or georgia can come pick it up but okay i said my throat felt a little tight bocks face got red he looked away from me at the ruined door im sorry dont be i said i understand im sorry about your shop he nodded im just here for a minute after that ill go right he said i walked down the aisles back to shiela and nodded to her i got your message shiela was wearing the same clothes as the night before only more rumpled shed pulled her hair back and held it in place with a pair of ballpoint pens thrust through a knot at right angles with her hair like that it showed the pale clean lines of her jaw and throat and i was again struck by the impulse to run my fingers over her skin and see if it was as soft as it looked she glanced at bock then smiled up at me and touched my arm with her hand im sorry he did that it isnt fair of him no its fair enough he has the right to protect himself and his business i said i dont blame him she tilted her head to one side studying my face but it hurts anyway i shrugged some ill survive the chimes rung at the front of the store as another customer came in i glanced back at bock and sighed look i dont want to be here very long what did you need she brushed back a few strands of hair that had escaped the knot i well i had a strange experience last night i lifted my eyebrows go on she picked up a small stack of books and started shelving them as she spoke after all the excitement i went back to the inventory in the back room and mr bock had gone to get the plywood for the windows i thought i heard the chimes ring but when i looked no one was there uh huh i said but she frowned you know how when you go into an empty house you know its empty how it just feels empty sure i said i watched her stretch up onto the tips of her toes to put a book away on the top shelf it drew her sweater up a little and i could see muscles move under a swath of the pale skin of her lower back the store didnt feel empty she said and i saw her shiver i never saw anyone never heard anyone but i was sure someone was here she glanced back at me and flushed i was so nervous i could hardly think straight until the sun came up then what i asked it went away i felt a little silly like i was a scared little kid or one of those dogs thats staring at something growling when nothing is there i shook my head dogs dont just stare and growl for no reason sometimes they can perceive things people cant she frowned do you think something was here i didnt want to tell her that i thought a black court vampire had been lurking unseen in the shop hell for that matter i didnt particularly want to think about it if mavra had been here there wouldnt have been anything shiela or bock could do to defend themselves against her i think you wouldnt be foolish to trust your instincts i said youve got a little talent its possible you were sensing something too vague for you to understand in any other way she put the last book away and turned to face me she looked tired fear made her expression one of sickness an ugly contortion something was here she whispered maybe i said nodding oh god she tightened her arms across her stomach i i might be sick i leaned my staff against the shelf and put a hand on her shoulder steadying her shiela take a few deep breaths its not here now she looked up at me her expression miserable her eyes wet and shining im sorry i mean you dont need this she squeezed her eyes tightly shut and more tears fell im sorry oh hell tears way to go dresden terrify the local maiden you showed up to comfort i drew shiela a little toward me and she leaned against me gratefully i put my arm around her shoulders and let her lean against me for a minute she shivered with silent tears for a little bit and then pulled herself together does this happen to you a lot she asked in a quiet voice sniffling people get scared i murmured theres nothing wrong with that there are scary things out there i feel like a coward dont i told her all it means is that you arent an idiot she straightened and took a step back her face looked a little blotchy some women can cry and look beautiful but shiela wasnt one of them she took off her glasses and wiped at her eyes what do i do if it happens again tell bock get somewhere public i said call the cops or better yet call billy and georgia if what you felt really was some kind of predator they wont want to stick around if they know theyve been spotted you sound as if youve dealt with them before she said i smiled a little maybe a time or two she smiled up at me and it was a grateful expression it must be very lonely doing what you do sometimes i said always being so strong when others cant thats well its sort of heroic its sort of idiotic i replied my voice dry heroism doesnt pay very well i try to be coldblooded and moneyoriented but i keep screwing it up she let out a little laugh you fail to live up to your ideals eh nobodys perfect she tilted her head again eyes bright are you with someone just you not with them with them oh i said no not really if i asked you to come have dinner out with me would it seem too forward and aggressive i blinked you mean like a date her smile widened you do you know like women right what i said oh yes yes im down with the women by coincidence i happen to be a woman she said she touched my arm again and since it seems like i might not get a chance to flirt with you a little more while im at work i thought i had better ask you now so is that a yes the prospect of a date seemed to me like a case of bad timing in several ways but it also seemed like a good idea i mean it had been a while since a girl had been interested in me in a nonprofessional sense well a human girl anyway the only one who even came close was in hawaii with someone else giggling and thinking about pants it might be really nice just to be out talking and interacting with an attractive girl god knows it would beat hanging around my crowded apartment its a yes i said im kind of busy right now but here she said she took a black marker out of a pocket in her sweater and grabbed my right hand she wrote numbers on it in heavy black strokes call me here maybe tonight and well figure out when i let her do it amused all right she popped the cap back on the marker and smiled up at me all right then i picked up my staff shiela look i might not be around this place ill respect bocks wishes but let him know that if theres any trouble all he has to do is call me she shook her head smiling youre a decent person harry dresden dont spread that around too much i said and started for the door and froze in my tracks standing in the little entry area of the bookstore facing bock at his counter were alicia and the ghoul li xian i stepped back to shiela and pulled her around the corner of a shelf what is it she asked quiet i said i closed my eyes and listened a simple question alicia was saying who bought it i dont keep track of my customers bock replied his voice was polite but it had an undertone of granite im sorry but i just dont have that information a lot of people come through here really alicia asked and how many of them purchase rare and expensive antique books from you youd be surprised alicia let out a nasty little laugh you really arent going to volunteer the information are you i dont have it to volunteer bock said both copies of the book were bought yesterday both were men one older and one younger i dont remember anything more than that i heard a couple of footsteps and li xian said perhaps you need help remembering there was the distinct heavy click of a pair of hammers on a shotgun being drawn back son bock said in that same voice youll want to step away from the counter and leave my shop now it would appear that the good shopkeeper has taken sides on this matter alicia said youre wrong miss bock said i run this shop i dont give information i dont take sides if i had a third copy id sell it to you i dont both of you leave please i dont think you understand alicia said im not leaving here until i have an answer to my question i dont think you understand bock replied theres a tengauge shotgun wired under this counter its loaded cocked and pointing right at your bellies oh my alicia said her voice amused a shotgun xian whatever shall we do i ground my teeth bock had asked me to stay away but even so he was standing there protecting my identity even though he knew damned well that the two in front of him were dangerous i checked the door to the back room of the shop was open the back door i said to shiela in a whisper is it locked not from this side go into the back room and get in the office i said get on the floor and stay there now she looked up at me with wide eyes and then hurried back through the open door i gripped my staff and closed my eyes thinking i patted my dusters pocket the book was still there riding along with my ghouls were hard to kill i had no idea what alicia was but i was willing to bet she wasnt a mere academic assistant for her to command the respect of a creature like li xian she had to be majorleague dangerous it would be an extremely foolish idea to assault them but that didnt matter if i didnt do something they were going to get unpleasant at bock bock might not have been a stalwart companion who stuck through thick and thin but he was what he was an honest shopkeeper who wanted neither to become involved in supernatural power struggles nor to compromise his principles if i did nothing he was going to get hurt while protecting me i stepped around the shelf and started walking toward the front of the store bock sat in his spot behind the counter one hand gripping its edge in a whiteknuckled grasp the other out of sight below it alicia and li xian stood in front of it she looked relaxed the ghoul was slouched into an eager stance knees bent a little arms hanging loosely shopkeeper i will ask you one last time alicia said who purchased the last copy of die lied der erlking she lifted her left hand and faint heat shimmers rose from her fingers along with a whisper of dark power tell me his name i drew in my will lifted my staff and snarled forzare the runes on the staff burst into smoldering scarlet light there was a thunderstorms roar and raw power invisible and solid lashed out of the end of my staff it whipped across the shop knocking books from the shelves on the way and hit the ghoul in the chest it lifted him off his feet and sent him smashing into the plywoodcovered door he went through the wood without slowing down out over the sidewalk and into the wall of the building across the street where he hit with a crunch alicia spun toward me her eyes wide and shocked i stood with my feet spread my shield bracelet was on my left hand thrumming with power and drizzling bluewhite sparks my staff smoldered with the scent of freshburned wood and the scarlet runes shone in the darkness at the back of the store i pointed it directly at alicia his name i snarled is harry dresden chapter seventeen you i snarled gesturing at bock with the end of my staff you little weasel you were gonna sell me out i ought to kill you right here from his vantage point above alicias curlyhaired head bock blinked at me in confusion i stared at him hard not daring to leave anything in my expression that the girl would see if id tried to protect bock it would only have made it more likely that she would do something to him by appearing to threaten him it would make him seem more unimportant to the necromancer and her henchman it was the best thing i could do to protect him bock got it his expression flickered through several subtle shades of comprehension fear and guilt he twitched his head at me in a nod of thanks well well alicia said she hadnt moved other than to turn toward me ive never heard of you but i must admit that you know how to make an entrance harry dresden i took lessons i said give me the book she said ha i said why because i want it she said sorry its the hot christmas present this year i said maybe you can find a scalper in a parking lot or something she tilted her head the fingers of her hand still flickering with little shimmers like heat rising from asphalt you refuse yes moppet i told her i refuse i deny thee no already her eyes narrowed in anger and well something happened that i hadnt ever seen before the store got darker i dont mean that the lights went out i mean everything got darker there was a low trembling sensation that seemed to make my eyeballs jiggle a little and the shadows simply expanded up out of the corners and dim areas of the store like timelapse photography of growing molds as they slid over portions of the store that nasty greasy sensation of cold came with them when the shadows washed over an outlet that housed the power cords to a pair of table lamps the lamps themselves went dim and then died out they covered the old radio and aretha franklins voice faded away to a whisper and vanished the shadows got to the register and its lights went out and when they brushed the old ceiling fan it began to whirl down to a stop the shadows crept over bock and he went pale and started shaking he thrust one hand down onto the counter as if he had to do it to keep himself upright the only place the darkness didnt spread was over me the shadows stopped in a circle all around me maybe six inches away from me and the things i was carrying the hellfire smoldering in the runes of my staff glowed more brightly in the darkness and the tiny sparks falling in a steady rain from my damaged shield bracelet seemed to burn away tiny pockets of the darkness where they fell only to have it slide back in once they had burned away this was a kind of power i hadnt felt before normally when someone who can sling major mojo around draws their stuff up around them its something violent and active id seen wizards who charged the air around them with so much electricity it made their hair stand on end wizards whose power would gather light into nearly solid gemshaped clouds that orbited around them wizards whose mastery of earth magic literally made the ground shake wizards who could shroud themselves in dark fire that burned anyone near them with the raw emotional rage of their magic this was different alicias power whatever it was didnt fill the store it emptied it in a way that i didnt think i fully understood utter stillness spread out from hernot peace for that would have been something tranquil accepting this stillness was a horrible hungry emptiness something that took its power from being not it was made of the emptiness at the loss of a loved one of the silence between the beats of a heart and of the inevitability of the empty void that waited patiently for the stars to grow cold and burn out it was power wholly different from the burning fires of life that formed the magic i knewand it was strong god it was so strong i began to tremble as i realized that everything i had wasnt enough to go up against this i dont like your answer alicia said she smiled at me a slow and evil expression she had a dimple on one cheek hells bells an evil dimple my mouth felt dry but my voice sounded steady when i spoke thats too bad if youre so upset about not getting a copy i suggest you take it up with cowl she stared at me with no expression for a moment and then said you are with cowl no i told her i was in fact forced to drop a car on him last night when he tried to take the book from me liar she said had you truly fought cowl youd be dead whatever i replied my tone bored ill tell you what i told him my book you cant have it she pursed her lips thoughtfully wait a moment you were at the mortuary in the entryway we call it the forensic institute now her eyes glittered you found it you succeeded where grevane failed didnt you i turned up one corner of my mouth and said nothing alicia took in a deep breath perhaps we can reach an understanding funny i said grevane said the very same thing alicia took an eager step toward me you denied him i didnt like his hat you have wisdom for one so young she said in the end he is nothing but a dog mourning his fallen master he would turn on you in a moment the gratitude of the capiorcorpus by contrast is an eternal asset capiorcorpus roughly translated the taker of corpses or bodies i suddenly had a better idea of why li xian had referred to alicia as my lord assuming i want that gratitude i said what price would it carry give me the book she said give me the word stand with me at the darkhallow in exchange i will grant you autonomy and the principality of your choice when the new order arises i didnt want her to know that i had no freaking clue what she was talking about so i said thats a tempting offer it should be she said she lifted her chin and her eyes glittered with something bright and utterly confident the new order will change many things in this world you have the opportunity to help shape it to your liking and if i turn you down i asked she met my eyes directly you are young harry dresden it is a great tragedy when a man with your potential dies before his time i shied away from her gaze at once when a wizard looks into another persons eyes for an instant too long he sees into them in a profound and unsettling kind of vision called a soulgaze if id left my gaze on alicias eyes i would get an upclose and personal look at her soul and she at mine i didnt want to see what was going on behind that dimpled smile i recognized that perfect surety in her manner and expression as something more than rampant ego or fanatic conviction it was pure madness whatever else alicia was she was calmly and horribly insane my mouth felt a lot drier my legs were shaking and my feet were advising the rest of me to let them run away ill have to think about it by all means alicia said her face took on an ugly expression and her voice hardened consider it but take a single step from where you stand and it will be your last killing me might get you a copy of the book but it wont get you the word i said or did you think i was carrying both of them around with me her right hand clenched into a slow fist and the room got a couple of degrees colder where is the word wouldnt i like to know i thought wouldnt you like to know i said kill me now and theres no word no new order she uncurled her hand i can make you tell me she said if you could do that youd have done it by now instead of standing there looking stupid she started taking slow steps toward me smiling i prefer to attempt reason before i destroy a mind it is a somewhat taxing activity are you sure you wouldnt rather work with me gulp mental magic is a dark dark dark grey area of the art every wizard who makes it to the white council has received training in how to defend against mental assaults but that was perfunctory at best after all the council made it a special point to wipe out wizards who violated the sanctuary of anothers mind its one of the laws of magic and if the wardens caught someone doing it they killed them end of story there was no such thing as an expert at that kind of magic on the white council and as a result the defense training was devised by relative amateurs something told me that alicia the corpsetaker wasnt an amateur thats close enough i said in a cold voice she kept walking very slowly a sort of sinuous enjoyment in her stride last chance i mean it i said stay ba before i could finish the word she made a rippling gesture with the shimmering fingers of her left hand there was a whirling sensation and i was suddenly caught in a gale a whirlwind that tried to carry me toward the girl my feet started sliding across the floor i leaned back with a cry lifting my shield bracelet and it blazed into a dome of solid blue light before me it did nothing nothing at all the vicious vortex continued to draw me to her outstretched hand i started to panic and then realized what was happening there was no windnot physically anyway the books on the shelves were not stirring nor was my long leather duster my shield offered me no protection from a wholly nonphysical threat and i released it saving my strength the hideous vacuum wasnt meant for my body it was targeting my thoughts thats right alicia said holy crap shed heard me thinking of course young man give me what i want now and i may leave you enough of your mind to feed yourself i gritted my teeth marshaling my thoughts my defenses its too late for that boy like hell it was my thoughts coalesced into a unified whole an absolute image of a wall of smooth grey granite i built the image of the wall in my mind and then filled it with the power id been holding at the ready i felt a nauseating confusion for a second and then the mental gale ceased as abruptly as it had begun alicias head jerked as if shed been slapped across the cheek i glared at her teeth gritted and asked is that all you got corpsetaker snarled out a spiteful curse lifted her left arm and twisted her fingers into a raking claw there was a hideous pressure against the image of the granite wall in my mind it wasnt a single resounding blow as i had expected from my training a kind of psychic battering ram instead it was an enormous steady weight as if a sudden tide had flooded in to wash the wall away completely i thought that pressure would ease in a moment but it only became more and more difficult to bear i struggled to hold the image of the wall in place but despite everything i could do dark and empty cracks began to appear and spread through it my defenses were crumbling delicious corpsetaker said and her voice didnt sound strained at all after a century theyre still teaching the young ones the same tripe i saw movement beyond corpsetaker and li xian appeared in the shattered plywood doorway half of his face was lumpy and purpled with bruising and one shoulder had been smashed grossly out of shape he was bleeding a thin greenishbrown fluid and moved as if in great pain but he came in on his own power and his eyes were alert my lord xian said are you well perfectly corpsetaker purred once i have his mind the rest is yours his misshapen face twisted into a smile that spread too wide for human features thank you lord holy crap it was time to leave but my feet wouldnt move you neednt bother young wizard corpsetaker said if you take the attention you would need to free your feet your wall will fail just open to me boy you will feel less pain i ignored the necromancer and tried to think of other options my mental defenses were indeed crumbling but any strength of will i spent to move my legs would collapse the defenses entirely i had to get the pressure off of me for a momentonly time enough to distract corpsetaker to give me time to get the hell away but given that i could barely move at all my options were severely limited part of the wall began to crumble i felt corpsetakers will begin pouring in the first trickle from a dark sea if i wanted to live i had little choice i reached my thoughts down into the smoldering hellfire burning in the runes of my staff and sent it flooding into my mind into the failing wall that protected me the cracks in the cold grey granite filled with crimson flame and where the dark sea of corpsetakers will pressed against it there was a screaming hiss of freezing water boiling into a cloud of steam corpsetaker let out a sudden hollow gasp and the pressure on my thoughts vanished i spun wobbled got my balance and then ran for the back door take him corpsetaker snarled behind me he has the book and the word there was a sickly ripping crackling sound and li xian let out a bestial and inhuman howl i dashed through the back room of the bookstore and to the back door i slammed its opening bar and sprinted through it out into the alley behind the shop i heard two sets of feet following me and corpsetaker began chanting in a low growling voice that hideous pressure began to surge against my thoughts again but this time i was ready for it and my defenses fell into place more quickly more surely i was able to keep running i ran down the alley and made it maybe thirty yards before a sudden fire exploded through my right calf i crashed down to the ground barely holding on to my mental defenses i dropped my staff and reached down to my calf to feel something metal and sharp protruding from it i cut my fingers on an edge and jerked them back i couldnt get a good look but i saw a flash of steel and a lot of bloodand corpsetaker and the ghoul were still coming there was no way i could have whipped up any magic to stop themnot with all of my power focused on keeping corpsetaker from invading my mind i wouldnt be able to overcome the ghoul physically even wounded xian was quick on its feet and closing the distance fast i drew the and sent three shots back down the alley corpsetaker darted to one side but the ghoul never even slowed down it flung one toolong arm through an arc and there was a glitter of steel in the gloomy alley something hit me in the ribs nearly hard enough to knock me down but the spellcovered leather of my duster stopped it from piercing through a triangle of steel fell to the ground each point sharpened and given a razors edge all i needed i muttered ninja ghouls i emptied the revolver at xian he wasnt ten feet from me on the last shot and i must have hit him he jerked careened off a wall and stumbled but he was a long way from down corpsetakers will continued to erode my defenses i had to get away from her or shed open up my brains like a tin of sardinesand then xian would eat them the threepointed shuriken still in my calf i forced myself to my feet through the screaming pain i seized my staff hobbling in earnest this time and struggled toward the end of the alley my only chance was to make it to the street to flag down a cab somehow beg a ride from a passing car or maybe get some help i knew there wasnt much hope of any of those things happening but it was all i had i almost got to the end of the alley the pain in my leg growing steadily worseand then i abruptly lost track of what was going on one moment id been busy i knew i was doing something important the next i was just standing there sort of floundering whatever id been doing it was right on the tip of my tongue i knew that if i could just focus for a second id be able to remember it and get back on track my leg hurt i knew that and my head felt jumbled the thoughts there but in disarray as if id gone through a drawer of folded laundry pulled out something from the bottom and then slapped the drawer shut again without straightening anything up i heard a snarl behind me and realized that whatever id been doing it was too late to get back on track now i tried to turn around but for some reason i couldnt remember how i have it panted a womans voice behind me numbers its only he only has numbers my lord snarled a thick deformed voice what is your command he doesnt know where the word is he is useless to me the book is in the right pocket of his coat take it xian then kill him chapter eighteen i was pretty sure that corpsetaker was talking about me and i knew for sure that getting killed was a bad thing i just couldnt figure out how to go about doing something to stop it something about my mind that it wasnt working right a batteredlooking man entered my field of view and i was able to turn my head enough to watch him oh crap it was li xian the ghoul i had a bad feeling that he was going to do something unpleasant but he just stuck his hand in my coat pocket and pulled out the slender copy of erlking the ghoul turned away from me and offered the book to someone out of my field of view there was the sound of flipping pages excellent corpsetaker said take him back from the street and finish him hurry hes stronger than most id rather not hold him all day oh right corpsetaker was holding my mind captive that meant that she was in my head that meant she had beaten my defenses down just pulling those thoughts together made me feel stronger my head started clearing and as it did the pain in my wounded leg grew more intense hurry she said her voice now strained rough hands seized the back of my coat i wanted to run but i still couldnt get everything to respond together an inspiration seized me if corpsetaker was in my head it meant that she could feel everything i was feelingsuch as the burning pain in my leg when the ghoul started pulling me backward i couldnt struggle but i managed to twist my hips a little and bend my good knee i fell over sideways onto the wounded leg the fall drove the shuriken a little harder into my calf and the world went white with pain corpsetaker shrieked i heard a metallic clatter as if she had stumbled into a trash can and i felt my arms and legs come all the way back under my command the ghoul stumbled on his mangled leg he pushed off the wall and came at me i spun on the small of my back and kicked out hard and straight at his good knee thats a nasty defensive technique murphy taught me and one that doesnt rely upon raw physical power the ghouls weight was all on that leg and the kick connected hard there was a grinding pop and he let out a spitting snarl of pain i scrambled away from him on one leg and the heels of my hands i could see my blood on the floor of the alley smeared in a trail from my wounded leg there were little stars fluttering through my vision and i felt as weak as a starved kitten everything was spinning around so much that i didnt even bother to get to my feet i crawled out of the cold shadows of the alley onto the sidewalk and into broad daylight i heard someone shout something there were police sirens a block or two away they were doubtless heading for bocks place after someone had seen me throw the ghoul out through the plywoodcovered door give them two minutes to sort out what was going on and id have men with silver shields and a strong desire to speak to the dead professors missing assistants all around me of course by then id probably have been dead for a minute and a half the wounded ghoul his face twisted jaws lolling open wide to show yellowed fangs came shambling out of the alley after me i heard a woman shout the sound high and furious and totally unafraid there was a whooshing sound a spinning shape and then an ax a freaking doublebladed axburied itself to the eye in the ghouls flank just as it hit there was a flash of light from a spot on the blade so bright that it left a red mark in the shape of a single rune burned into my vision there was a loud bark of sound as the ax hit the ghoul the creature was thrown forcefully to the sidewalk and thin greenishbrown fluid sprayed everywhere in a disgusting shower a woman in a dark business suit stepped into my line of sight she was better than six feet tall blond and coldly beautiful her blue eyes burned with battlelust and excitement as she drew a sword with a straight threefoot blade from the scabbard at her side as i watched she took several smooth steps to place herself between the ghoul and me then she pointed the tip of the sword at him and snarled avaunt carrion the ghoul tore the ax from his side and staggered into a crouch holding the weapon in both hands with a panicked desperation he took a pair of awkward shuffling steps back an engine roared and a grey sedan swerved up onto the sidewalk avaunt cried the woman then she raised the sword and glided toward the ghoul li xian didnt want any part of it his inhuman face twisted in recognizable fear he dropped the ax and fled back down the alley coward the woman sighed clearly disappointed she snatched up the ax then said to me get in i know you i said miss gard you work for marcone i work for monoc securities the woman corrected me her hand clamped down on my arm like a slender steel vise and she hauled me to my feet without effort my wounded calf clenched into a nasty cramp and i could feel the steel blades continuing to cut at my muscles i clenched my teeth snarling my defiance at the pain gard gave me a quick glance of approval and tugged me toward the grey sedan i still had to hobble on my staff but with her help i made it to the car and fumbled my way into the backseat more hands pulled me in the whole time gard kept her sharp cold blue gaze on the alley and the street around us once i was in she shut the door sheathed the sword and undipped the scabbard from her belt before getting into the passengers seat the grey sedan pulled out into the street again and started away from the scene the driver turned his head just enough to catch me in his peripheral vision his neck was too thick for any more movement than that he had red hair clipped into a close buzz shoulders wide enough to build a deck on and hed had to get his business suit at the bigandtall store hendricks i greeted him he looked up into the rearview mirror with his beady eyes and glowered nice to see you again too i said i settled back into the seat as much as i could trying to ignore my leg and refusing to look at the man sitting beside me i didnt really need to look at him he was a man a little over average height somewhere in the late prime of his life his dark hair flecked with grey he had skin that had seen a lot of time out in the weather leaving him with a perpetual boaters tan and eyes the color of wrinkled old dollars hed be wearing a suit that cost more than some cars and making it look good he looked handsome and wholesome more like the coach of a successful sports team than a gangster but john marcone was the most powerful figure in chicagos criminal underworld isnt that a little childish he asked me his voice amused refusing to look at me like that indulge me i said its been a long day how serious is your injury he asked do i look like a doctor to you i asked you look more like a corpse he answered i squinted at him he sat calmly in his seat mirroring me is that a threat i asked if i wanted you dead marcone said i would hardly have come to your aid just now you must admit dresden that i have just saved your life again i closed my eye again and scowled your timing is improbable he sounded amused in what way coming to my rescue just as someone was about to punch my ticket you must admit marcone that it smells like a setup even i occasionally enjoy good fortune he replied i shook my head i called you less than an hour ago if it wasnt a setup then how did you find me he didnt said gard i did she looked over her shoulder at marcone and frowned this is a mistake it was his fate to die in that alley what is the point of having free will if one cannot occasionally spit in the eye of destiny marcone asked there will be consequences she insisted marcone shrugged when arent there gard turned her face back to the front and shook her head hubris mortals never understand tell me about it i said everyone makes that mistake but me marcone glanced at me and his eyes wrinkled at the corners it was very nearly a smile gard turned her head slowly and gave me a cold glare that wasnt anywhere close to smiling lets get to the part of the conversation where you tell me what you want i said i dont have time for any more banter ah marcone said i suspected you would somehow become involved in the events at hand what events would those be i asked the situation concerning the death of tony mendoza i scowled at him what do you want unless i miss my guess marcone said i want to help you yeah i said right im quite serious dresden he told me i allow no one to harm those in my employ whoever murdered mendoza must be chastised immediatelywhether or not they happen to be necromancers i blinked how did you know what they were miss gard he replied serenely she and her colleagues have outstanding resources i shrugged good for you but im not interested in helping you maintain your empire naturally but you are interested in stopping these men and women before they accomplish whatever goal it is that they are pursuing i shrugged you dont know that yes i do he said his tone growing distant and cool he met my eyes and said because i know you i know that you would oppose them just as you know that i will not permit them to take one of mine from me without punishment i glared back at him i wasnt worried about a soulgaze those happened only once between any two people and marcone had already gotten a look at me when he said that he knew me thats what he was talking about id seen his soul in return and it had been a cold and barren placebut one of order as well if marcone gave his word he kept it and if someone came for one of his people he would go after them without hesitation fear or pity that didnt make him noble marcone had the soul of a tiger of a predator protecting his territory it only made him more resolved and more dangerous im not a hit man i told him and i dont work for you nor am i asking you to he said i simply want to give you information that might help you in your efforts you arent listening i am not going to kill anyone for you his teeth suddenly showed very white against the tan but you will go up against them yes he settled back in his seat ive seen what you do to the people who get in your way im willing to take my chances that thought that attitude was a little creepier than i was comfortable with i wasnt a killer i mean sure sometimes i fought sometimes people and notpeople got killed but it wasnt as though i was some kind of jack the ripper from time to time matters got desperately dangerous between me and various denizens of the preternatural world but i had only killed i thought about it for a minute id killed more of them than i hadnt quite a few more i felt a little sick to my stomach marcone watched me from behind hooded eyes and waited what do you want to tell me i asked him i dont want to waste your time he said ask me questions ill answer whichever i can how much do you know about the deal that got mendoza killed he drummed the fingers of his right hand on his thigh for a moment mendoza was getting ready to retire marcone said he had a final scheme to complete i owed the man for loyalties past and at his request i allowed him certain liberties he was selling something independently marcone nodded the contents of an old storage locker mendoza had come across the key to it in an estate sale that was criminalspeak for purchasing hot merchandise from a mugger or burglar go on the key opened a storage locker that had been sealed since it contained a number of works of art jewelry and similar cultural artifacts i arched an eyebrow loot from world war two so mendoza presumed marcone said he offered me my selection of the contents and in return i allowed him to dispose of the rest in whatever manner he saw fit what did you get out of it i asked two monets and a van gogh holy crap i shook my head what happened then mendoza went about liquidating his cache it had been in process for several weeks when he reported that one of the people he had approached regarding an antique book seemed to have access to resources that were well beyond the ordinary did he give you a name i asked a man named grevane marcone said mendoza asked for my advice on the matter and you told him about how wizards are technologically challenged among other things he said nodding but the deal went south so it would seem marcone said since mendozas death i have asked miss gard to collect information on recent events in the local supernatural community i glanced at the woman and nodded and she told you there were necromancers running around once that had been established we attempted to narrow down the location of these individuals particularly grevane but met with very limited success im able to find where theyve been gard said without turning around or at least where theyve been weaving their spells and there are a number of hot spots of necromantic energy around town i said i know that already marcone placed his fingers in a steeple before him but what i suspect you do not know is that last night at the location on wacker a member of my organization had an altercation with representatives of a rival interest from out of town there was a gunfight my man was mortally wounded and left for dead that doesnt add up to necromancy i said frowning what caused the hot spot that is the question marcone said he took a folded piece of paper from his breast pocket and passed it to me these are the names of the responding emts he said according to my man they were the first on the scene did he talk to you before he died i asked he did marcone replied in point of fact he did not die thought you said he was mortally wounded he was mister dresden marcone said his features remote he was he survived the surgeons at cook county thought it a bona fide miracle naturally i thought of you at once i rubbed at my chin what else has he said nothing marcone said he has no memory of the events after he saw the ambulance arriving so you want me to talk to the emts why havent you done it yourself i asked he arched his brows dresden try to keep in mind that i am a criminal for some reason its quite difficult to get people in uniforms to open their hearts to me i gritted my teeth at another agonizing twinge from my leg right so he said were back to my original question how serious is your injury ill make it i said do you think youll need to see a doctor if its too mild a wound ill be glad to have miss gard make it look more authentic i looked at him for a moment im heading for an emergency room whether i need it or not eh as luck would have it we are near a hospital cook county in fact yeah the cuts pretty deep i looked at the piece of paper and then stuck it in my pocket theres bound to be an emt or two there maybe you should drop me off at the emergency room marcone smiled and it didnt touch his eyes very well dresden you have my deepest sympathies for your pain chapter nineteen marcone and company dropped me off a hundred yards from the emergency entrance to the hospital and i had to hobble in alone it was hard and i was tired but id been hurt worse before it wasnt like i wanted to do this every day or anything but after a certain point of ridiculous discomfort the pain all feels pretty much the same once i made it to the emergency room i was a big hit when you drag yourself inside panting and leaving a trail of bloody footprints behind you it makes a certain impression i had an orderly and a nurse helping me onto my stomach on a gurney within a few seconds while the nurse examined the wound it isnt lifethreatening she reported after she cut away my pant leg and took a look she glanced at me almost in accusation from the way you came in here youd think this almost killed you well i said im kind of a wimp nasty commented the burly orderly he produced a clipboard layered in forms and a ballpoint pen and handed them both to me theyll have to cut this out well let the doctor decide that the nurse said how did this happen sir i have no clue i said i was walking down the street and all of a sudden i thought my leg was on fire you walked here she asked a helpful boy scout brought me most of the way i said she sighed well its been a slow day they should be able to see to you shortly thats super i said because it hurts like hell i can get you some tylenol the nurse said primly i dont have a headache i have a fourinch piece of steel in my leg she passed me a paper cup and two little white tablets i sighed and took them heh the orderly said after she left dont worry too much theyll get you something when the doctor sees to you with this kind of loving care i probably wont need it dont be too hard on her the orderly said you should see what people try so that they can get to some painkillers vicodin morphine that kind of thing yeah i said hey man can i ask you something sure he had brought a bowl of ice with him and he started sealing it into plastic bags which he started packing around my leg this should numb it a little and maybe take down some of the swelling it aint a local but its what ive got the ice didnt actually burst into steam upon touching me even though it felt like it should have the pain didnt exactly lessen but it did suddenly feel a little more distant thanks man hey i was hoping i could talk to a couple of guys i know while i was here i said theyre emts gary simmons and jason lamar the orderly lifted his eyebrows simmons and lamar sure they drive an ambulance i know are they around they were on shift last night he said but its the end of the month and they might be on their swing shift ill ask appreciate it i said if simmons is there tell him a school buddy is here sure if i do that though you gotta do something for me and fill out these forms i eyed the clipboard and picked up the pen tell the doc to sign me up for carpal tunnel surgery when he gets that thing out of me two birds with one stone the orderly grinned ill do that he left me to fill in forms which didnt used to take terribly long to fill out since i didnt have any kind of insurance one of these days when i had the money i was going to have to get some they say that when you pay for insurance youre really buying peace of mind it might make me feel peaceful to think of how much money the company was probably going to lose on me in the long run if i lived my whole life in the open as i had been since id come to chicago they might be dealing with me for two or three centuries i wondered what the yearly markup would be for a twohundredandfiftyyearold a young doctor came in after i was finished with the forms and true to the orderlys prediction he had to cut the shuriken out of me i got a local and the sudden cessation of pain was like a drug all by itself i fell asleep while he was cutting and woke up as he was wrapping my leg up the sutures dry he was saying though from the looks of your file i suppose you know that sure doc i said i know the drill do you need to take them out or did i get the other kind theyll dissolve he said but if you experience any swelling or fever get in touch im giving you a prescription for something for the pain and some antibiotics follow all the printed instructions and be sure to take them all i said in my best surgeongeneralslashtelevisionannouncer voice looks like youve done this as often as i have he said he gestured to the steel tray where the bloodied shuriken lay did you want to keep the weapon might as well ill have to get a souvenir in the gift shop otherwise you sure you dont want the police to look at it he said they might be able to find fingerprints or something i already told you guys it must have been some kind of accident i said he gave me a look of extreme skepticism all right if thats the way you want it he dropped the little weapon into a metal tray of alcohol or some other sterilizer keep your leg elevated that will ease the swelling stay off of it for a couple of days at least no problem i said he shook his head the orderly will be by in a minute with your prescriptions and a form to sign he departed a minute later there were footsteps outside the little alcove theyd put me in and a large young man drew the curtain aside he had skin almost as dark as my leather duster and his hair had been cropped into a flattop so precise that his barber must have used a level he was on the heavy sidenot out of shape or ripped out but simply large and comfortable with it he wore an emts jacket and the name tag on it read lamar he stood there looking at me for a minute and then said youre the wrong color to have been in my high school and i didnt do college army medic i asked navy marines he folded his arms what do you want my name is harry dresden i said he shrugged but what do you want i sat up my leg was still blissfully numb i wanted to talk to you about last night he eyed me warily what about it you were on the team who responded to a gunshot victim on wacker his breath left him in a long exhale he looked up and down the row then stepped into the little alcove and closed the curtain behind him he lowered his voice so so i want you to tell me about it i said he shook his head look i want to keep my job i lowered my voice as well you think telling me is going to endanger that maybe he said he pulled open his jacket and then unbuttoned two buttons on his shirt he opened it enough to show me a kevlar vest beneath it see that emts have to wear them around here because people shoot at us sometimes gangbangers that kind of thing we show up to try to save lives and people shoot at us must be tough i said cautiously he shook his head i can handle it but a lot of people dont and if it looks like youre starting to crack under the pressure theyll pull you out word gets around that im telling fairy tales about things ive seen theyll have me on psychiatric disability by tomorrow he turned to go wait i said i touched his arm lightly i didnt grab him you dont go unexpectedly grabbing former marines if you want your fingers to stay in the same shape look mr lamar i just want to hear about it im not going to repeat it to anyone im not a reporter or he paused youre the wizard he said saw you on larry fowler once people say youre crazy yeah i said so it isnt as if theyd believe me even if i did talk about you which i wont youre the one they arrested in the nursery a few years back he said you broke in during a blackout they found you in the middle of a wrecked room with all those babies i took a deep breath yeah lamar was silent for a second then he said you know that the year before the sids rate there was the highest in the nation they averaged one case every ten days no one could explain it i didnt know that i said since they arrested you there they havent lost one he said he turned back to me you did something yeah do you like ghost stories he snorted out a breath through his nose i dont like any of this crap man why do you want me to tell you what i saw because what you know might help me keep more people from getting hurt he nodded frowning all right he said after a moment but im not saying this right now you understand me im not going to say this again to anyone only reason ill tell you is that you helped those babies i nodded he sat down on the edge of the gurney we got the call around midnight headed over to wacker the cops were there already found this guy on the street all busted up two hits in the chest and two in the abdomen he was bleeding bad i nodded listening we tried to stabilize him but there wasnt much point to it simmons and me both knew that but we tried its what you do you know he was awake for it scared as hell screaming some kept begging us not to let him die said he had a little girl to look after what happened he died lamar said his voice flat ive seen it before here in town in action while i was in the corps you get to where you can recognize death when he comes knocking he rubbed his large rather slender hands together we tried to resuscitate but he was gone thats when it happened go on this woman shows up i dont know from where we just looked up and she was standing over us looking down i leaned forward what did she look like i dont know lamar answered she was like wearing this costume right like those people at renaissance fairs big old black robe with a hood over her head i didnt see much of her face just her chin and her throat she was white what did you do i figured she was a nut you get them a lot this time of year or maybe going to a costume party or something hell its almost halloween she looks at me and tells me to back up and let her help him how many women in a black hooded robe could have been running around town last night kumori that would have been maybe fortyfive minutes or an hour before i saw her at bocks lamar peered at my face you know her he said not personally but yeah what did she do his face grew more remote she knelt down over him like straddling the stretcher then she leaned down the robe and the hood fell over them both right like i couldnt see what she was doing he licked his lips and it got cold i mean ice started forming on the sidewalk and the stretcher and on our truck i swear to you it happened i believe it i said and the victim all of a sudden starts coughing trying to scream i mean it wasnt like the wounds were gone but i dont know how to describe it he was holding on his face twisted with a sickened expression he was in agony and he was stable it was like like he wasnt being allowed to die so the woman stands up she tells us weve got less than an hour to save him and then shes gone like poof gone like she was all in my imagination i shook my head then we get him brought in the docs patched him up and got fresh blood into him he passed out about an hour later but he made it lamar was silent for a long moment that couldnt have happened he said then i mean ive seen people pull through some bad stuff but not like that he should have been dead everything i know tells me so but he kept going sometimes miracles happen i said quietly he shuddered this wasnt a miracle there wasnt any angel choir singing my skin tried to crawl away and hide he shook his head i dont want to think about it what about your partner i asked he drank himself under the table twenty minutes after our shift ended hell only reason i wasnt with him was that i was teaching a cpr class this morning he looked at me that help it might i said thank you sure what are you going to do now i asked gonna go find my own table lamar stood up and said good luck man thanks the big man left and while i got my prescriptions and filled out the last forms i thought about what hed had to say i got the prescriptions filled at the hospital pharmacy called a cab and told him to take me to mikes to pick up the blue beetle i sat in the backseat with my eyes closed and thought about what id learned kumori had saved the gunshot victims life if everything lamar had said was accurate it meant that she had gone out of her way to do it and whatever shed done it had been an extremely difficult working to leave a mystic impression as intense as it did that might explain why kumori had done very little during the altercation with cowl i had expected her to be nearly as strong as her partner but when she tried to take the book from me her power hadnt been stronger than my own muscles and limbs but the kemmler alumni association was in town with some vicious competition in mind why would kumori have expended her strength for a stranger rather than saving it for battling rival necromancers could the shooting victim have been important to her plans in some way it didnt track the victim was just one more thug for the outfit and he certainly wasnt going to be doing anything useful from his bed in intensive care i had to consider the possibility that shed been trying to do the right thing using her power to help someone in dire need the thought made me uncomfortable as hell i knew that the necromancers id met were deadly dangerous and that if i wanted to survive a conflict with them i would have to be ready to hit them fast and hard and without any doubts thats easy when the enemy is a frothing psychotic monster but kumoris apparently humanitarian act changed things it made her a person and people are a hell of a lot harder for me to think about killing even worse if shed been acting altruistically it would mean that the dark energy the necromancers seemed to favor might not be something wholly inherently evil it had been used to preserve life just as the magic i knew could be used either to protect or to destroy id always considered the line between black magic and white to be sharp and clear but if that dark power could be employed in whatever fashion its wielder chose that made it no different from my own dammit investigation was supposed to make me certain of what needed to be done it was not supposed to confuse me even more when i opened my eyes thick clouds had covered the sun and painted the whole world in shades of grey chapter twenty it was past the middle of the afternoon by the time i got the blue beetle from mikes and headed back to my apartment i tried to be wary of possible tails but by then the local was wearing off and my leg was hurting again i dont know if youve ever had a serious physical injury but theres more to it than simply increasing the amount of discomfort its tiring the pain carries with it a tax of bonedeep weariness that makes you want to crawl into a dark hole and hibernate so when i say i tried to be wary what i mean is that i nicked a glance at my rearview mirror a couple of times whenever i had the presence of mind to remember to do so as long as the bad guys were restricting themselves to driving brightly painted sidepanel vans or maybe nitroburning funny cars i was perfectly safe i got back to my place disabled the wards unlocked the door and slipped inside mister came flying down the stairs at my back and thumped companionably against my legs i all but screamed stupid cat i snarled mister wound around my legs in a pleased fashion unconcerned with my opinion of him i limped inside and locked up behind me mouse waited until mister was bored with me then shambled over to snuffle at my legs and collect a few scratches behind his ears hey there thomas greeted me quietly he sat in the chair by the fire several candles lit on the end table beside it he had a book open sword and shotgun rested near his hand he glanced at my leg and rose his face alarmed what happened i grimaced tottered over to the couch and plopped down on it sticks and stones may break your bones but chinese throwing stars get you a dozen stitches i drew the ghouls weapon from my pocket by way of illustration and tossed it down on the coffee table hows butters fine thomas said funny little guy made an awful racket with that polka thing of his for about half an hour babbled for forty minutes straight and fell asleep eating dinner i put him on the bed hes had a stressful day i said hes a coward thomas said i glared at him and started to snarl something harsh and defensive he held up a hand and hurried to speak dont take that wrong harry hes smart enough to understand whats happening and hes smart enough to know that theres not a damned thing he can do about it he knows the only reason hes alive is that someone else is protecting him he isnt kidding himself that hes somehow done it because of his own cleverness or skill thomas glanced at the door to the bedroom he doesnt know how to deal with the fear its strangling him i propped my aching leg up on the coffee table thank you for your professional opinion counselor thomas gave me a level look ive seen it before i know what im talking about whatever i said when you were attacked in the morgue last night he froze didnt he i shrugged one shoulder not everyone is cut out for the battlefield but he froze thomas said you had to scream orders into his ear and haul him around like luggage right that doesnt make him a coward he lets his fear control him thats what a coward is harry a lot of people would react the same way i said a lot of people arent making themselves into excess baggage for my brother he shot back no one does well their first time out i said it isnt an isolated incident thomas said you told me that when he reported on the corpses taken from biancas manor and they locked him up in the nuthouse so so do you think he got his job back without backing down admitting to some shrink that he hadnt really seen what he saw thomas shook his head he was afraid to lose his career he caved i sat silently doesnt make him a bad person thomas said but hes a coward hes either going to get you killed or else freeze at a bad moment and dieand youll torture yourself over how its all your fault if we want to survive we need to get him somewhere safe then cut him loose better for everyone i thought about it for a minute you might be right i said but if we tell him to rabbit hes never going to be able to get over the fear well be making it worse for him he has to face it down he doesnt want to no i said but he needs to thomas looked from me to the fire and nodded its your show i watched mouse mosey over to his bucketsized food bowl he sat down by it and waited expectantly until mister prowled over to him then he bent down to eat my cat stalked up to mouse and promptly swatted him on the muzzle with one paw mouse opened his jaws in a doggy grin and walked a couple of steps in the direction mister had swatted him mister regarded mouse with lordly disdain then ate part of a single piece of kibble then he slapped at the bowl of food scattering bits over the kitchen floor and walked away once he was done mouse padded back over patiently ate the spilled food and then resumed munching on the bowl remember when mouse would slide all the way to the wall when mister did that thomas asked heh yeah do you think mister realizes that the dog is about twenty times bigger than he used to be thomas asked oh he realizes it all right i said he just doesnt see how its relevant one of these days mouse is going to disabuse him of the notion i shook my head he wont mister made his point when mouse was tiny mouse is the sort to respect tradition or hes scared to cross the cat thomass eyes drifted to my bandages and he nodded at my leg how bad is it i can walk i wouldnt want to go dancing is that your next move dancing i leaned my head back on the couch and closed my eyes im not sure what to do next how are you as a sounding board i can look interested and nod at appropriate moments he said good enough i said i told thomas everything he listened taking it all in and the first thing he said was you have a date i opened my eyes and blinked at him what is that so hard to conceive well yeah he said christ harry i thought you were going to spend the rest of your life as a hermit what he rolled his eyes it isnt like youve gone looking for women thomas said i mean you never hit any clubs try to get any phone numbers i figured you just didnt want to he mulled it over for a minute and then said good god youre shy i am not i said the girl practically had to throw herself into your arms my sister would laugh herself sick i glowered at him you are not a spectacularly helpful sounding board he stretched out a little and crossed his legs at the ankle im so pretty its hard for me to think of myself as intelligent he pursed his lips there are two things you need to know the book i said nodding yeah everyone is hot and bothered over this erlking thing you read it yeah and i raked my fingers through my hair and nothing its a collection of essays about a particular figure of faerie lore called the erlking who is he hes one of the high sidhe i said and he isnt part of winter or summer hes a wyldfae powerful very i said but just how powerful he is varies depending on who was writing about him some of them ranked him among the top faerie nobles a couple claimed he was on par with one of the faerie queens what does he do hes some kind of hunter spirit i said associated with all kinds of primal violence hes apparently one of the beings who can call up and lead the wild hunt the what thomas said its a gathering of some of the more predatory beings of faerie i said they appear in the autumn and winter usually usually along with storms and rough weather a gathering of black hounds the size of horses with glowing red eyes led by a hunter with the horns of a stag on a black horse the erlking thomas asked there are several figures who can lead the hunt apparently i said none of them are particularly friendly the hunt will kill anything and anyone it runs across its majorleague dangerous i think ive heard about it thomas said is it true that you can avoid being hunted by joining them i shrugged i dont know ive never heard of anyone who met the hunt and survived could be that they wont hunt what they think of as another predator like sharks thomas said its all about body language i wouldnt count on nonverbal cues to protect you from the hunt i said assuming you ever saw them it appears maybe only once every five or six years and can show up almost anywhere in the world is it the hunt you think the kemmlerites are interested in im not sure i said i cant think what else it would be the erlking has a reputation as a being that preys upon children or at least one that heralds their deaths a couple of wizards even peg him as a guardian who ensures that childrens souls arent harmed or diverted as they depart dying bodies sounds like there is a mixed opinion on this erlking guy faeries are like that i said they arent ever quite what they seem to be its hard to pin them down but why would a gang of necromancers be interested in him is there anything in the book that makes sense not that i saw i said there were stories songs lectures accountings bad sketches and worse poetry about the erlking but nothing practical nothing you saw thomas said nothing i saw i confirmed but these lunatics would hardly be this serious about the book if it wasnt there somewhere do you think its connected to this darkhallow that corpsetaker was talking about thomas asked i dont know i said whats a darkhallow we listened to the fire crackle for a minute before thomas said i hate to say this but maybe you should contact the council i grimaced i know i should i said i dont know what theyre doing and these necromancers are strong thomas stronger than me i dont think i can take them in a straight fight sounds like a good reason to call for help i cant do that i said mavra would torpedo murphy i dont think murphy would want you to get killed over this harry he pointed out and whats going to happen if the council hears that you knew these folk were around and didnt report it to them they arent going to be happy i know i said i know but at the moment its my choice and im not going to choose for my friend to get hurt i cant he nodded as if hed expected the answer plus theres one more reason not to call in the council i said why right now cowl grevane and corpsetaker arent working together if i call in the council it gives them a common enemy and a reason to cooperate they have a common enemy he pointed out you i laughed and it came out a little bitter they arent worried about me hell i cant even figure out whats going on i rubbed at my eyes you said there were two things i need to know whats the second thing your car oh i got it back i said its out front no dummy thomas said whoever trashed your car did it deliberately they were trying to tell you something it might not even be related to this situation i said he snorted yeah it just happened now out of all the times it could have happened whoever was sending the message its a little obscure you think its one of the kemmler crowd why not he said i thought about it for a minute it doesnt seem like something grevane would do i bet hes more like the kind to send undead minions to deliver his messages corpsetaker would send a nightmare or a forced hallucination or something shes big on the mind magic ghouls dont really send messages they just eat you that leaves cowl his buddy and grevanes buddy with the liver spots yeah i said i almost feel like there was something familiar about liver spots i said im not sure what i might be grasping at straws what about cowl and kumori i dont know man i said they were just a couple of people in cloaks i never saw their faces if i had to guess from the way they talked id bet that they were council that would be a very good reason to cover their faces thomas agreed theres no point in chewing this over and over i said i rubbed at my eyes bony tonys numbers mean something theyll lead to the book somehow im sure of it maybe a locker number thomas asked too many digits i said maybe its some kind of cipher substituting letters for numbers i raised my eyebrows thats a thought i dug the folded piece of paper out of my pocket and passed it over to him stay here and work on it see if you can make any sense out of it he accepted the paper now i feel like james bond suave and intelligent breaking all the codes while looking fabulous what are you going to do i think the erlking is the key to this i said and the erlking is a faerie he lifted his eyebrows meaning when you want to know about faeries i said its best to ask a faerie im going to call up my godmother and see if she knows anything from what youve told me isnt that kind of dangerous very i said youre hurt you should have some backup i nodded watch the fort i said mouse the big dog lifted his shaggy head from the floor ears perked forward serious eyes on me come on i told him were going for a ride oh harry thomas said yeah before you go would you mind if i uh helped butters out by getting his polka contraption loaded up into your trunk what you dont like polka thomass expression looked strained please harry i like the little guy but come on i rubbed at my mouth with one hand to cover up the smile sure probably safest for everyone that way thank you he said and collected the polka suit and brought it up the stairs behind me as i prepared to take a chance on a conversation with one of the more dangerous beings i knew chapter twentyone mouse and i took the beetle out of chicago proper following the lake north out of town for once i wished i had an automatic transmission driving stick with only one good hand and one good leg is not fun in fact its the next best thing to impossible at least for me i wound up using my wounded leg more than i should have and the discomfort intensified i thought about the painkillers in my pocket and then blew them off i needed to be sharp when all of this was over there would be time to muddle my head with codeine so i drove and swore under my breath at anything that made me change gears while mouse rode along in the passenger seat with his head usually sticking out the window by the time i was far enough from town to start calling out to my godmother the sun had set though the cloudveiled western sky still glowed the color of campfire embers i pulled off onto a side road that was made of old gravel and stubborn weeds that kept trying to grow up in the roads smooth center it led down to a little dead end where some kind of construction project never went through it was a popular spot for local kids to hang out and imbibe illegal substances of one intensity or another and there were empty beer cans and bottles scattered around in abundance mouse and i left the car up on the road and walked maybe fifty yards down through trees and heavy undergrowth to the shore of the lake at one point on the shore a little spit of land formed a promontory only ten or twelve inches higher than the surface of the water wait here i told mouse and the dog sat down at the end of the spit of land watching me with alert eyes his ears flicking around at all the little sounds then i walked out onto the spit to its end and a cold wind off the lake swept around me blowing my coat and threatening my balance i grimaced and leaned on my staff out at that point of land where earth and water and sky met one another and focused my thoughts blocking out the pain of my leg my fears my questions i gathered together my will then lifted my face to the wind and called out quietly leanansidhe an it please thee come hither and hold discourse with me i sent my will my magic coursing into the words and they reverberated with power echoing from the surface of the lake repeating themselves in whispers in the swirling wind vibrating the ground upon which i stood then i waited i could have repeated myself but my godmother had certainly heard me if she was going to come she would if she wasnt no amount of repetition was likely to change her mind the wind blew colder and stronger throwing cold droplets up from the lake and into my face one gust of wind brought me the sound of an airliner overhead and another the lonely whistle of a freight train distantly somewhere on the lake a bell rang out several times a solemn sound that made me think of a funeral dirge beyond that nothing stirred i waited in time the fire faded from the overcast sky and only the darkest tones of purple were left on the western horizon behind me dammit she wasnt coming after i thought that but before i could actually turn around there was a swirling in the waters near my feet and a slow spiral of water spray spun up from the surface of the lake a bizarre sight the spray rolled up and away from a female form beginning at the feet bare and pale and rolling up over a medievalstyle gown of emerald green the gown was belted with a woven silver rope and a slightly curved singleedged knife of some dark glassy material hung at an angle through it when the spray rolled up over the womans face i expected my godmothers blazing wealth of copper and scarlet curls her wide feline eyes of amber her features that always made her seem smug and somewhat pleased with herself in absence of the animation of any other emotion instead i saw a long pale throat features of heartstopping cold beauty canted eyes greener than any color to be found in the natural world and long silken hair of purest white bound within a circlet of what looked like rose vines surrounded in gleaming ice beautiful and brittle and cruel behind me a deepthroated snarl burst forth from mouse back on the shore greetings mortal said the faerie woman her voice shook water and earth and sky with subtle power i felt it resonating through the elements around me as much as heard it my mouth went dry and my throat got tight i leaned on my staff to help me balance as i cast a courtly bow in her direction greetings queen mab i do beg your pardon it was not my intention to disturb thee my head shifted into panicked quick thought queen mab had come to me and that absolutely could not be good mab monarch of the winter court of the sidhe the queen of air and darkness was not a very nice person in fact she was one of the most feared beings of power youd find short of archangels and ancient gods id once used my wizards sight to look upon mab as she unveiled her true self in a working of power and it had come perilously close to driving me insane mab was not some paltry mortal being like grevane or cowl or the corpsetaker she was far older far cruder far more deadly than they could ever be and i owed her a favor two to be exact she stared at me for a long and silent moment and i didnt look at her face then she let out a quiet laugh and said disturb me hardly i am here only to fulfill the duties i have been obliged to take upon myself it is no fault of thine that this summons reached mine ears i straightened up slowly and avoided her eyes i had expected my godmother to come mab smiled her teeth were small and white and perfect her canines delicately sharp alas the leanansidhe is tied up at the moment i drew in a breath my godmother was a powerful member of the winter court but she couldnt hold a candle to mab if mab wanted to take lea down she certainly could do itand for some reason the thought spurred on a protective instinct something that made me irrationally angry yes lea was hardly a benevolent being in her own right yes shed tried to enslave me several times in the past several years but for all of that she was still my godmother and the thought of something happening to her angered me for what reason have you detained her because i do not tolerate challenges to my authority she said one pale hand drifted to the hilt of the knife at her belt certain events had convinced your godmother that she was no longer bound by my word and will she is now learning otherwise what have you done to her i asked well it didnt sound like a question so much as a demand mab laughed and the sound of it came out silvery and smoother than honey the laugh bounded around the waves and the earth and the winds clashing against itself in a manner that made the hairs on my neck stand up and my heart race with a sudden apprehension as i felt an odd kind of pressure settle over me as if i were closed into a small room i gritted my teeth and waited the laugh out trying not to show how harshly it had affected me she is bound mab said she is in some discomfort but she is in no danger from my hand once she acknowledges who rules winter she will be restored to her station i can ill afford the loss of so potent a vassal i need to speak to her now i said of course mab said yet she languishes in the process of enlightenment thus am i here to fulfill her obligation to teach and guide you i frowned you locked her away somewhere but youre keeping her promises something cold and haughty flickered through mabs eyes promises must be kept she murmured and the words made wave wind and stone tremble my vassals oaths and bargains are binding upon me so long as i restrain her from fulfilling them does that mean that you will help me i asked it means that i will give you what she might give you mab said and speak what knowledge she might have spoken to you were she here in flesh rather than in proxy she tilted her head slowly to one side you know wizard that i may speak no word that is untrue thus is my word given to you i eyed her warily it was true that the high sidhe could not speak words that were untruebut that wasnt the same thing as telling the truth most of the sidhe i had met were past masters of the art of deception speaking in allusions and riddles and inferences that would undermine the necessary honesty of their words so thoroughly that they might be much stronger lies than if they had simply spoken a direct falsehood trusting the word of one of the sidhe was an enterprise best undertaken with extraordinary caution and exacting care if i had any choice in the matter i would avoid it but there was nothing i could do but forge ahead i still had to find out more about what sergeant kemmlers lonely hearts club band was doing in chicago and that meant taking the risk of speaking with my godmother mab was simply more of the same risk a lot more of it i seek knowledge i said about the one known as the erlking mab arched an eyebrow him she said yes your godmother knows some little of him what would you know of him i want to know why all of kemmlers disciples are grabbing up all the copies of the white councils book about him nothing that i could imagine would truly rattle mabs composure but that sentence apparently came close her expression froze and with it the wind came to a sudden dead halt the waves of the shore abruptly stilled to a sheet of glass beneath her feet dimly reflecting the glow of the city skyline in the distance and the last shreds of purple light in the leaden sky kemmlers disciples she said her eyes were deeper than the lake she stood upon could it be could what be i asked the word she said the word of kemmler has it been found um i said sort of her delicate white brows rose meaning what pray tell meaning that the book was found i said by a local thief he tried to sell it to a man named grevane kemmlers first student mab said did he acquire the book no i said the thief used mortal technology to conceal the book in order to prevent grevane from taking it from him without paying grevane killed him mab guessed and how this mortal ferromancytechnology you called it does it yet conceal the book yeah grevane yet seeks it yeah him and at least two more cowl and the corpsetaker mab lifted a pale hand and tapped a finger to rich lovely lips the color of frozen mulberries her nails were colored with shining opalescence gorgeous to the eye and distracting as hell i felt a little dizzy until i forced myself not to look at them dangerous she mused you have fallen among deadly company mortal even the council fears them you dont say mab narrowed her eyes and a little smile graced her lips impudent she said its sweet on you gosh thats flattering i said but you havent told me a thing about why they might be interested in the erlking mab pursed her lips the being you ask me about is to goblins as i am to the sidhe a ruler a master of their kind devious cunning strong and swift he wields dominion over the spirits of fallen hunters i frowned what kind of spirits the spirits of those who hunt mab said the energy of the hunt of excitement hunger bloodlust betimes the erlking will call those spirits into the form of the great black hounds and ride the winds and forests as the wild hunt he carries great power with him as he does power that calls to the remnants of hunters now passed on from mortal life youre talking about ghosts i said the spirit of hunters indeed mab said shades that lay in quiet rest beyond the beck of the mortal pale will rise up to the night and the stars at the sound of his horn and join the hunt powerful shades i said quietly specters most potent mab said nodding her eyes bright and almost merry as they watched me i leaned on my staff trying to get as much weight as i could off of my injured leg so that it would stop pounding enough to make me think so a gaggle of wizards whose stock in trade is enslaving the dead to their will is interested in a being whose presence calls up powerful spirits they couldnt otherwise reach i followed the chain of logic from there theres something in the book that tells them how to get his attention darling child mab said so clever for one so young so what is it i asked which part of the book your godmother she said her smile growing wider has no idea i ground my teeth together but you do i am the queen of air and darkness wizard there is little i do not will you tell me she touched the tip of her tongue to her lips as if savoring the taste of the words you should know us better than that by now wizard nothing given by one of the sidhe comes without a price my foot hurt i had to hop a little bit on my good leg when my balance wavered great i muttered what is it you want you mab said folding her hands primly in front of her my offer of knighthood yet stands open to you whats wrong with the new guy i asked that youd dump him for me mab showed me her teeth again i have not yet replaced my current knight treacher though he is she purred hes still alive i asked i suppose mab said though he very much wishes that he were not i have taken the time to explain to him at length the error of his ways torture shed been torturing him in vengeance for his treachery for more than three years i felt a little sick to my stomach if you like you might consider it an act of mercy she said accept my offer and i will forgive your debt to me and answer all your questions freely i shuddered mabs last knight had been an abusive psychotic drugaddicted murdering rapist i was never clear on whether he got the job because of those qualities or whether they had been instilled in him on the job either way the title of winter knight was a permanent gig if i accepted mabs offer id be doing it for lifethough there would of course be no promises as to how long that life would be i told you once before i said that im not interested things have changed wizard mab said you know the kind of power you face in kemmlers heirs as the winter knight you would have strength far outweighing even your own considerable gifts you would have the wherewithal to face your foes rather than slinking through the night gathering up whispers to use against them no i paused and then said and no means no mab shrugged one shoulder a liquid motion that drew my eyes toward the curves of her breasts within the silken gown you disappoint me child but i can wait i can wait until the sun burns cold thunder rumbled over the lake off in the southwest lightning leapt from cloud to cloud mab turned her head to watch interesting uh whats interesting powers at work preparing the way what is that supposed to mean i asked that you have little time mab said she turned to face me again i must do what i might to preserve your life know this mortal should kemmlers heirs acquire the knowledge bound within the word they will be in a position to gather up such power as the world has not seen in many thousands of years what how kemmler wasmabs eyes grew distant as if in memory a madman a monster but brilliant he learned how to bind to his will not only dead flesh but shadesto rend them asunder and devour them to feed his own power it was the secret of the strength that allowed him to defy all the white council together i added two and two and got four the heirs want to call up the ancient spirits i breathed and then devour them for power mabs deepgreen eyes almost seemed to glow with intensity kemmler himself attempted it but the council struck him down before he could finish i swallowed what happens if one of his heirs is able to do it the heir would gain power such as has not been wielded by mortal hands in the memory of your race mab said the darkhallow i said i rubbed at my eyes thats what it is a ritual tomorrow night halloween they all want to be the one to make themselves into a juniorleague god power is ever sweet is it not i thought about it some more i had to worry about more than just kemmlers cronies mavra wanted the word too hells bells if mavra succeeded in making herself into some kind of dark goddess there wasnt a chance in hell that she wouldnt obliterate me at the first opportunity can they do it without the word mabs mouth curled up in a slow smile if they could why would they seek it so desperately the wind began to stir again and the lake began to resume its ebb and flow beware wizard you are engaged in a most deadly game i should be disappointed were i deprived of your service then get used to it i said im never going to be your knight mab tilted back her head and let out that nervesearing laughter again i have time she said and you mortals find life to be very sweet two favors you yet owe me and make no mistake i will collect one day you will kneel at my feet the lake suddenly surged dark waters whirling up in a snakequick spiral forming a waterspout that stretched from the lakes surface up out of sight into the darkness above me the wind howled driving my balance to one side so that my wounded leg buckled and i fell to one knee then as suddenly as it began the gale was gone the lake was calm again the wind sighed mournfully through tree branches sparsely covered in dead leaves there was no sign of mab i grimaced and struggled to my feet i glanced back at mouse who was sitting on the shore watching me with worried doggy eyes she always has to have the last word i told him mouse padded over to me and i scratched his ears a couple of times while he snuffled at me he looked warily out at the lake one problem at a time i told him well handle mab later somehow i walked back to the beetle more slowly than ever and mouse stayed within a step or two the entire time the adrenaline faded and left me wearier than ever i had to fight to stay awake all the way back to my place a thin cold drizzling rain began to fall i had just gotten home and out of the car when mouse let out a warning snarl i spun and wavered then planted my staff hard on the ground to keep from falling over out of the darkness and rain a dozen or more people suddenly loomed into view all of them walked toward me steady and unhurried and all of them marched in step with one another in the distance i heard the low rumbling thunder of a drum played on a big bass stereo behind the first group came another and behind them another by then i could see the eyes of the nearestempty staring eyes in sunken deathly faces my heart lurched in sudden terror as the zombies closed in on me i shambled down my stairs and tripped stumbling against my door i fumbled at my keys frantically taking down my wards so that my own security spells didnt kill me on my way in mouse stayed at my back continuous snarls bubbling from between his bared teeth thomas i screamed thomas open the door i heard a noise close and spun around mindless faces appeared at the top of the stairs leading down to my apartment door and grevanes killing machines leapt down them straight at me chapter twentytwo mouse leapt into the air as the lead zombie flung itself at me and met it with an ugly sound of impact the dog and the animate corpse dropped onto the stairs the zombie swung an arm at mouse but the dog rolled taking the blow on one slab of a shoulder his snarl sharpening at the impact the dog surged against the zombies legs and got his teeth into the corpses face he shook his head violently while the zombie stumbled and reeled under the ferocity of the attack the second zombie bypassed the struggling pair reaching out for me i barely had time to brandish my staff at the creature and snarl forzare unseen force struck the zombie like an ocean wave flinging it back up the stairs and out of sight mouse let out a shrieking sound of pain ripped his fangs once more at the zombies face and pushed away from it the zombies face had been crushed and torn until it was unrecognizable both eyes had been torn out and the undead thing flailed around wildly striking blindly with heavy sweeps of its arms mouse leaned heavily against me one paw held lifted from the ground snarling three more zombies were already most of the way down the stairs and there was no time to do anything but try my staff again i raised it but the nearest zombie was faster than i had guessed and he batted the wood out of my hand it smacked against the concrete wall of the stairwell and rebounded onto the blinded zombie out of my reach the zombie snatched at my arm and i barely avoided it the door opened at my back and thomas called down i dropped to the ground and did my best to haul mouse down with me there was a roar of thunder and the leading zombies head vanished into a spray of ugly rotten gore the remainder of the being thrashed for a second and then fell drunkenly to one side collapsing into immobility thomas stood in the doorway dressed in only a pair of blue jeans he held the sawedoff shotgun against his shoulder and his eyes blazed with a cold silver fury he worked the pump on the gun and fired it three times more destroying or driving back my nearest attackers for a moment then he seized the collar of my duster and dragged me forcibly into the apartment mouse came with us and thomas slammed the door shut get the locks i told him he started shoving the doors two heavy security bolts shut while i crawled to the door laid my hands against it and with a whisper of will rearmed the wards that protected the apartment the air hummed with a low buzz as the wards snapped back up into place silence fell over the apartment okay i said panting thats it safe at home i looked around the apartment and spotted butters hovering near the fireplace poker in hand you okay man i guess so butters said he looked a little wild around the eyes are they gone if they arent yet they will be were safe are you sure definitely i said theres no way theyre going to get in here the words were hardly off my lips when there was a thunder crack of sound and a heavy thump that knocked scores of books off my bookshelves and sent us all staggering around like the cast of the original star trek what was that butters screamed the wards thomas snapped no i said i mean come on walking right into those wards is suicide there was another clap of thunder and the apartment shook again a flash of bright blue light bathed the outside of the boardinghouse and even reflected through the sunken windows near my apartments ceiling it was painfully bright cant commit suicide if youre already dead thomas said how many of those things were out there uh im not sure i said a lot thomas swallowed got the box of shells off the mantel and started loading them into the shotgun what happens if he just keeps throwing zombies at the wards i didnt build them to keep up a continuous discharge i said there was another roaring sound and another flash of light but this time there was barely a tremor on the floor theyre going to fade and collapse how long thomas asked there was a crackling buzz from outside too slow this time to be heard only as a roar of noise bluewhite light flickered dimly not long dammit oh god butters said oh god oh god what happens when the wards are gone i grunted the door is made of steel it will take them some time to get through it and after that theres the threshold that should stop them or at least slow them down i raked my fingers over my hair weve got to come up with something fast what about the extra defenses thomas asked theyre standing right outside i said hence the need for extra defenses thomas snapped he pumped a round into the shotguns chamber and slipped another into the extra slot in its clip those defenses are meant to stop a magical assault i said not physical entry will they keep the zombies out butters asked yes but theyll also keep us in whats so bad about that butters asked nothing i said until grevane sets the building on fire once they go up i cant take them down again well be trapped i ground my teeth weve got to get out of here but the zombies are out there butters said im not the only one who lives here i said if he burns down the house to get to me people will die thomas get dressed and get your shoes on butters theres a ladder under that navajo rug there i want you to take a candle and go down it theres a black nylon backpack on a table and a white skull on a wooden shelf put the skull in the backpack and bring it to me what butters said do it i snapped butters scurried over to the navajo rug found the trapdoor down to my lab and grabbed a candle he disappeared down the ladder thomas put the shotgun down and opened his trunk it didnt take him long to get dressed in socks black combat boots a white tshirt a black leather jacket maybe it was part of his supernatural sexvampire powersdressing quickly for a hasty getaway you see he said while he dressed about butters shut up thomas i said what is the plan he said i limped over to the phone and put it to my ear nothing they cut the phone we cant call for help thomas said right only thing we can do is smash our way out to the car thomas nodded his head with a jerk how you want to do it what do you think big old wall of fire would do it cover our left flank and keep the bad guys off of us ill take the right flank and shoot anything that moves fire magic a sudden memory of my burned hand flashed through my head so intensely that i felt actual physical pain in the nerve endings that had been destroyed i thought about what i would need to do to manage the wall thomas had suggested and at the mere thought my stomach twisted in revulsionand worse with doubt for magic to work you have to believe in it you have to believe that you can and should perform whatever action you had in mind or you get zippo as my hand burned with phantom agony i realized something i had not admitted not even to myself i wasnt sure i could use fire magic again ever and if i tried it and failed it would only make it more difficult to focus my will on it again in the future each failure building a wall that would only grow more difficult to breach my belief in my powers might never recover i looked down at my maimed hand and for just a second i actually saw the blackened cracked flesh my fingers swollen the whole of it seeping blood and fluid the second passed and there was only my hand in its leather glove again and i knew that beneath the glove it was scarred in various shades of white and red and pink i wasnt ready god even to save lives that included my own i wasnt sure that i would be able to call up fire again i stood there feeling helpless and angry and afraid and stupidand most of all ashamed i shook my head at thomas and avoided meeting his eyes while i gave him an excuse im all but done i said quietly ive got to save whatever i have left to block grevane if he throws power at us directly i dont know how much im going to be able to do he searched my expression for a second frowning then he shrugged into the jacket his face grim he seized the saber in its scabbard and buckled it on with a worn leather belt he settled it at his hip and picked up the shotgun again guess its up to me then i nodded im not sure how hard ill be able to push he said quietly you handled black court vampires pretty well last year i said id been feeding on justine every day he said i had a lot to draw on now he shook his head now im not sure we arent exactly overstaffed here thomas he closed his eyes for a second and then nodded right heres the plan we get to the beetle we drive away and then what where do we go after that he asked you dont see me nitpicking your plans do you there was a sudden heavy thump against the steel security door it rattled in its frame bits of dust descended from my ceiling then another and another grevane had thrown enough zombies at the wards to wear them out thomas grimaced and looked at my leg can you get up the stairs on your own ill make it i said butters came panting up the stepladder from the lab his face pale he wore my nylon pack and i could see bob the skull making one side of it bulge a little gun i said to thomas and he handed me the shotgun right heres how it works we open the door i gestured with the shotgun i sweep it clear enough to get thomas clear of the doorway then thomas goes in front butters im going to hand you the shotgun i dont like guns butters said you dont have to like it i said you just have to carry it with my leg hurt i cant get up the stairs without using my staff the steel door rattled again the pace of the blows against it increasing butters i snapped butters youve got to take the gun when i hand it to you and follow thomas all right yeah he said once we get up the stairs thomas runs interference while i start the car butters youll get in the backseat thomas gets in and then we leave um butters said grevane trashed my car so i couldnt get away remember what if hes done the same thing to yours i stared at butters for a second and tried not to show him how much that worried me butters thomas said quietly if we stay here were going to die but if theyve destroyed the car butters began well die thomas said but we dont have a choice whether or not theyve destroyed it our only chance of getting out of this alive is to get to the beetle and hope it runs the little guy got even paler and then abruptly doubled over and staggered over to the wall beneath one of my high windows he threw up he straightened after a minute and leaned back against the wall shaking i hate this he whispered and wiped his mouth i hate this i want to go home i want to wake up get it together butters i said my voice tight this isnt helping he let out a wild laugh nothing i can do would help harry butters youve got to calm down calm down he waved a shaking hand at the door theyre going to kill us just like phil theyre going to kill us and were going to die you me thomas were all going to die i forgot my bad leg for a second crossed the room to butters and seized him by the front of his shirt i hauled up until his heels lifted off of the floor listen to me i snarled we are not going to die butters stared up at me pale his eyes terrified were not no and do you know why he shook his head because thomas is too pretty to die and because im too stubborn to die i hauled on the shirt even harder and most of all because tomorrow is oktoberfest butters and polka will never die he blinked polka will never die i shouted at him say it he swallowed polka will never die again p ppolka will never die he stammered i shook him a little louder polka will never die he shrieked were going to make it i shouted polka will never die butters screamed i cant believe im hearing this thomas muttered i shot my half brother a warning look released butters and said get ready to open the door then the window just over butterss head exploded into shards of broken glass i felt a hot stinging sensation on my nose i stumbled my wounded leg gave out and i fell butters shrieked i looked up in time to see dead grey fingers clutching the little guy by the hair they hauled him off of his feet and two more zombie hands latched onto him and pulled him up through the broken window and out of the apartment it happened so fast before i could get my good leg under me before thomas could draw his saber there was a terrified scream from outside it ended abruptly oh god i whispered butters chapter twentythree i stood staring up at the broken window in stunned silence for a second harry thomas said quiet urgency in his voice we need to go no i said im not leaving him hes probably dead already if he is i said it wont protect him from grevane i wont leave him there do we have a chance in a fight i shook my head with a grimace help me up he did i limped over to the window and shouted grevane good evening grevane said the rich cultured tones of his voice a marked contrast to the dull steady pounding at my front door my compliments to your contractor that door is really quite sturdy i like my privacy i called back is the mortician alive thats a somewhat fluid term in my experience grevane said but he is well enough for the time being my knees wobbled a little in relief good if butters was still all right i had to keep grevane talking barely five minutes had passed since the attack began even if the bad guys had cut the phone lines to the whole boardinghouse the neighbors would have heard the racket and watched the light show from my wards someone was sure to call the authorities if i could keep grevane busy long enough they would arrive and i was willing to bet money that grevane would rabbit rather than take chances this close to his goal youve got him i want him as do i grevane said i presume he found the information in the smugglers corpse yes i said and i take it you also know yes he made a thoughtful sound he was very near the broken window though i couldnt see him that presents a problem for me grevane said i have no intention of sharing the word with anyone im afraid it will be necessary for me to silence you im the least of your worries i called back corpsetaker and li xian took the information from me this afternoon there was a silence broken only by the slow steady pounding on my door if that had happened grevane said you would not be alive to speak of it i got lucky and got away i said corpsetaker sounded all hot and bothered about this darkhallow thing you guys have planned i heard the angry sound of someone spitting if you are telling the truth grevane said then it profits me nothing to allow you and the mortician to live thats one way to look at it i said but you could just as easily say that it costs you nothing to do it either last night you wanted to make me a deal you still willing to talk to what purpose he said there was the shrieking sound of steel beginning to bend under stress one corner of the door up at the top bent in letting in cold evening air hurry thomas urged me we have to do something fast give me butters i said to grevane ill give you the information i found you offer me nothing i have him already grevane said i can extract the information from him myself you could i said if he knew it he doesnt grevane snarled something in a language i didnt understand i heard scuffing shoes then the sound of a slap and a dazed exclamation from butters is that true grevane asked him do you have the information about the word dunno what it is butters mumbled there was a jump drive numbers it was a whole bunch of numbers what numbers grevane snarled dont know whole bunch cant remember them all harry has them liar grevane said there was the sound of another blow and butters cried out i dont know butters said there were too many and i only saw them for a sec another blow fell this time with the dull heavy sound of a closed fist hitting flesh i clenched my teeth rage filling me i dont know i dont know i dont know butters said it sounded like he was crying look at me grevane said look i closed my eyes and turned my face a little from the window i could imagine what was happening butters probably on his knees being held by a pair of zombies grevane standing over him in his trench coat pinching butterss chin between his thumb and forefinger i could imagine him forcing butterss eyes up to meet his to begin a soulgaze grevane wanted to see the inside of butterss head in a swift and harsh attempt to assess the truth and butters would be exposed to the corruption of a soul steeped in dark magic and a lifetime of murder i heard a highpitched little sound that rose rapidly growing louder and louder until it was a wail of terror and madness there was no dignity in the sound no selfcontrol i would never have recognized it as butterss voice if i hadnt known he was out there but it was him butters screamed and he kept screaming without pausing to take a breath until it wound down to a frozen gurgling sound and died away well asked another voice one i did not recognize it rasped harshly as if the man speaking had spent a lifetime imbibing cheap scotch and cheaper cigars he doesnt know grevane reported quietly disgust in his voice youre sure said the second voice i moved a bit to one side and stood up on tiptoe to peer out the window i could see the second speaker it was liver spots yes grevane said he doesnt have any strength to him if he knew hed answer if you kill the mortician youll have to kill me i called of course im the only one with the information other than corpsetaker im sure that you psychotic necrowannabes with delusions of godhood are all about sharing with your fellow maniacs there was silence from outside so you should go ahead and take me out i said of course when i lay down my death curse on you its going to make it that much harder for you to beat out corpsetaker for the darkhallow but whats life without a few challenges to liven things up i paused and then said dont be an idiot grevane if you dont deal with me youll be cutting your own throat is that what you think grevane said perhaps i will simply walk away no you wont i said because when corpsetaker gets his membership to the mount olympus country club the first thing hes going to do is find his nearest rivalyouand rip your pancreas out through your nose the door suddenly bent on a diagonal on the top half folding it in as if it had been wax paper the door didnt quite go down but i could see dead fingers reaching up through it trying to rip and tear the weakened section harry thomas said his voice tight with apprehension he drew his saber and went to the door he hacked at dead fingers that appeared in the breach they spun through the air and landed on the floor still bending and wriggling like bisected earthworms make up your mind grevane i called if this goes any further im going to do everything in my power to kill you i cant beat you we both know that but you wont get the information out of me against my will im not a pansy i can push you hard enough to make you kill me you would have me believe that you would simply commit suicide grevane asked to take you down with me i replied oh hell yeah count on it dont listen to him liver spots hissed kill him he knows hes finished hes desperate which was true dammit but the last thing i needed was for someone to point that out to grevane a zombie finger flew past my head and another bounced off my duster and fell to the floor at my feet still twitching a long and yellowed fingernail making an unsettling scratching sound against my boot the pounding on the door got louder the whole thing rattling in its frame and then just like that it stopped silence fell over the apartment what are your terms grevane asked you release butters to me i said you let us drive off with your sidekick in the car once were away from here i give him the numbers and drop him off mutual truce until sunrise these numbers grevane said what do they mean i dont have a clue i said at least not yet neither did corpsetaker then what value do they have he asked someone is bound to figure it out but if you dont deal with me now it sure as hell wont be you there was another long pause and then grevane said give me your pledge that you will abide by the terms only in return for yours i said you have it grevane said i swear it by my power no hissed liver spots dont do this i lifted my eyebrows and traded a speculative look with thomas oaths and promises have a certain kind of power all their ownthat was one reason they were so highly regarded among the beings of the supernatural community whenever someone breaks a promise some of the energy that went into making it feeds back on the promise breaker for most people that isnt a really big deal maybe it shows up as a little bad luck or a cold or a headache or something but when a more powerful being or a wizard swears an oath by his own power the effect is magnified significantly too many broken oaths and promises can cripple a wizards use of magic or even destroy the ability entirely ive never seen or heard of a wizard breaking an oath sworn by his own power it was one of the constants of the preternatural world and by my own power i swear in return to abide by the terms of the agreement i said harry thomas hissed what the hell are you doing saving our collective ass i hope i said you dont actually think hell abide by it do you thomas whispered he will i said and as i said it i realized how confident i was that i was right if he wants to survive he doesnt have much choice grevanes entire purpose here is gaining power he wont jeopardize that now by breaking an oath sworn by his magic you hope even if he decides to screw us its good to keep him talking the longer we delay the more likely it is the cops are going to show up hell back off before he faces that but if the cops dont show youre giving him what he needs to make himself into a freaking nightmare thomas said i shook my head might not be a bad thing i cant beat him corpsetaker either throwing grevane into the mix is going to make it harder for either of them to concentrate on me thomas exhaled slowly its a hell of a risk oh no a risk i said well we wouldnt want that now would we no one likes a wiseass harry butters is counting on me i said right now im all hes got do you have any better ideas thomas grimaced and shook his head very well grevane called how shall we proceed pull your zombies back i said as i did i found a pen and a piece of paper pulled out the folded piece of paper from my pocket and made a copy of the numbers you go with them liver spots and butters wait by the car we all get in and drive off once im a few blocks away ill drop liver spots off with the numbers unharmed agreed grevane said we waited for a minute and then thomas said you hear anything i went to the door and listened i could hear someone breathing fast and heavy butters nothing else i shook my head and glanced at thomas he came over to the door sword still in hand he opened it slowly the pounding it had taken had warped it and he had to haul hard on the door to get it unstuck from its frame thomas looked out for a moment there were a couple of stilltwitching pieces of zombie on the stairs but other than that it was empty he paced slowly up the stairs looking around him as he went my staff still lay at a slant on the floor before the door thomas nudged it back into the apartment with his foot looks clear i grabbed the shotgun and picked up the staff holding both awkwardly with my good hand mouse fell into place at my side his hackles still stiff a low almost subsonic growl rumbling in his chest every few moments i hobbled out and up the stairs cold rain fell light but steady it was dark really dark no lights were on anywhere in sight grevane must have hexed this entire portion of the city power grid when the attack began i didnt make use of electricity in my apartment so it hadnt been noticeable to me inside i got a sick sinking little feeling if the lights were all out and the phones were all down then there might not be any cops on the way by the time the wards had begun to make noise the phones were already dead without lights there was an excellent chance that no one had seen anything unusual in the dark and the rain would have muffled sounds considerably people tended to stay home in comfortable surroundings in such situationsand if someone had seen or heard a crime going on but had no way to notify the authorities about it it was unlikely that they would do anything but stay at home and keep their heads down zombie scrap parts littered the top of the stairs the gravel parking lot and the little lawn some of them looked burned while others seemed to have melted like wax in the summer sun there were a number of blank black spots burned into the ground i couldnt easily count how many zombies had been destroyed but there had to have been almost as many down as i had seen in the opening moments of the attack grevane had brought more the rain almost hid them but i could see the zombies at the limit of my sight standing in silence motionless there were dozens of them hells bells if wed made that run for the car we wouldnt have had a prayer that big booming stereo bass rumbled steadily in the background near the beetle stood liver spots he wore the same coat the same broadbrimmed hat the same sour expression on his wrinkled spotted face his fine white hair drifted around in every tiny bit of moving air wherever it wasnt wet from the rain i studied him for a minute he was a good two or three inches under average height his features seemed familiar i was certain but i couldnt place them it bothered mea lot but this was no time to start entertaining uncertainties butters lay curled in a fetal position on the muddy wet gravel at liver spotss feet he was breathing hard and fast and his eyes stared sightlessly forward liver spots gestured curtly at butters in reply i held up the copy of the numbers then slipped it back in my pocket put him in the car i told liver spots do it yourself the man responded his voice rough harsh mouse focused on liver spots and let out a low rumbling growl i narrowed my eyes at him but said thomas thomas sheathed the sword and picked up butters like a small child his eyes on liver spots he came back to the car and mouse and i watched liver spots closely the whole while put him in the back i said thomas opened the door and set butters in the backseat the little guy leaned his head against the wall and sat all curled up you could have fit him into a paper grocery sack mouse i said in mouse prowled into the backseat and sat leaning against butters serious dark eyes never leaving liver spots all right i said passing the shotgun to thomas it works like this thomas you get in the back spots youre riding shotgun and when i say riding shotgun i mean that thomas is going to shove it up your ass and pull the trigger if you try anything funny he stared at me eyes flat do you understand me i said he nodded eyes narrowed say it i told him raw hatred dripped from his words i understand you good i said get in liver spots walked toward the car he had to step around me to get to the passenger side door and when he drew even with me he suddenly stopped and stared at me there was a puzzled frown on his face he stayed that way for a second looking at me from soles to scalp what i demanded where is it he said he sounded as if he was speaking for his own benefit rather than for mine why isnt it here ive had a long day i told him shut your mouth and get in the car for a second i saw his eyes and at my words they suddenly burned with a manic loathing and scorn i could see quite clearly that liver spots wanted me dead there wasnt anything rational or calm about it he wanted to hurt me and he wanted me to die it was written in his eyes so strongly that it might as well have been tattooed across his face i needed no soulgaze no magic to recognize murderous hate when i saw it and he still looked familiar though for the life of memaybe literallyi couldnt remember from where i avoided his eyes in time to avert a soulgaze of my own and said get into the car he said im going to kill you perhaps not tonight but soon im going to see you die youll have to wait in line spots i told him i hear the only tickets left are in general admission he narrowed his eyes and began to speak mouse let out a sudden warning snarl i tensed watching liver spots but he did the same thing i did he flinched and then looked warily around when his eyes got to a spot behind me they widened thomas had the shotgun on him so i turned from liver spots and looked for myself from the rain and the dark came a rising cloud of light it drew nearer with unsettling speed and after only a few speeding heartbeats i could see what made the light they were ghosts surrounded in a sickly greenish glow a company of civil warera cavalry rushed toward us dozens of them there should have been a rumble of thundering hooves accompanying them but there was only a distant and pale sound of a running herd the riders wore broadbrimmed union hats and jackets that looked black rather than blue in the sickly light and bore pistols and sabers in their semitransparent hands one of the lead riders lifted a trumpet to his lips as he rode and ghostly strains of the cavalry charge drifted through the night air behind them mounted on phantom horses that looked as if theyd been drowned were li xian and the corpsetaker the ghoul wore a tomtom drum at his side held in place by a heavy leather belt draped sideways from one shoulder while he rode he beat out a staccato military rhythm on it with one hand and it sounded somehow primitive and wild the corpsetaker had changed into clothes made of heavy biker leather complete with a chain gauntlet and spiked fighting bracers on her forearms she wore a curved sword on her belt a heavy tulwar that looked ugly and murderous as she came closer she sent her ghostly steed racing to the head of the troop and drew her blade she spun it over her head laughing in wild abandon and bore straight down upon us treachery howled liver spots we are betrayed grevane appeared in the mist from among the motionless zombies he stared at the oncoming corpsetaker and let out a howl of rage he raised his hands and every zombie in sight abruptly stiffened and then broke into a charge kill them grevane howled actual literal foam formed at the corners of his mouth and his eyes burned beneath the brim of the fedora kill them all liver spots whirled toward me producing a tiny pistol from somewhere in his sleeve a derringer from the size of it it couldnt have held a very heavy bullet but he wouldnt need it to be heavy to kill me at this range i dove back and to my right trying to get the car between liver spots and me there was a startling popping sound and a flash of light i hit the muddy gravel hard liver spots came around the car after me evidently determined to use the second bullet in the pistol thomas didnt have time to get out of the car there was a sudden explosion and my windshield blew outward in a cloud of shot and shattered glass both tore into liver spots and he stumbled and went down i lifted my staff in my good hand and brought it down hard on his wrist there was a brittle snapping sound and the little gun flew from his grasp he went into an utter rage before i knew what was happening liver spots had thrown himself on top of me and had both of his hands fastened on my throat i felt him shut off my airway and struggled against him it didnt do much good the old man seemed filled with maddened strength its mine he screamed at me he shook me on each word slamming my head back against the gravel in precise separate detonations of pain and bright stars in my vision give it to me mine a zombie landed on the gravel near us in a crouch and turned toward me its dead eyes regarded me without passion or thought as it formed a fist and drove it at my head before it could land a flickering saber from one of the spectral cavalry whispered through the night and the rain and struck the zombie on the neck the corpses head flew from its shoulders dribbling a line of sludgy black ichor and landed with its empty eyes staring into mine thomas screamed down i stopped struggling to get up and tried to press myself as flat to the ground as i could the driversside door to the beetle flew open swept just over the end of my nose and struck liver spots in the face he flew back from me thomas leaned out of the drivers side to grab at me but a second ghostly horseman swept by sword hissing thomas ducked in time to save his neck but took part of the slash across his temple and ear and scalp and that side of his head and shoulder was almost immediately covered in a sheet of blood a few shades too pale to be human thomas recovered his balance and pulled me grimly into the car i fumbled with the keys and shoved them into place i twisted the key in desperate haste mashing on the gas as i did the engine turned over once and then stalled dammit thomas cried in frustration a streak of faint green light appeared in the air over the cars hood a second later another went by this time ending at the hood there was a startling sound of impact and the frame of the car rattled a bullet hole appeared in the hood i tried the car again and this time coaxed the old vw to life hail the mighty beetle i crowed and slapped the car into reverse the wheels spun up gravel and mud and i shot back straight into a crowd of zombies slamming into them and sending them flying i whipped the cars hood toward the street and shifted into drive as i did i got a look at the corpsetaker bearing down on grevane tulwar raised from somewhere in his coat grevane produced a length of chain and as the sword swept toward him he held up the chain his arms outstretched and caught the blow on the links between them sliding the deadly blade away from him corpsetaker howled in fury and whirled the phantom mount around to charge him again almost absently striking the head from a zombie as she passed it i flattened the gas pedal and the beetle lurched forwardstraight toward a trio of ghostly cavalry troops they bore down on us not wavering i hate playing chicken i muttered and shifted into second just before i would have hit them the cavalry leapt translucent horses and riders rising effortlessly into the air over the car to land on the ground behind me i didnt give them a chance to whirl and try it again i bounced the beetle out onto the street turned left and charged away at flank speed i got a few blocks away then slowed enough to roll down the window there were no screams or shrieks of battle the rain muffled the sound and in the heavy darkness i couldnt see anything going on behind me i could dimly hear the whumping bass drum that kept grevanes zombies going still somewhere out there in the background beyond that very quiet but getting nearer i heard sirens everyone all right i asked ill make it thomas said he had stripped out of his jacket and shirt and had the latter pressed to the side of his bleeding head mouse i asked there was a wet snuffling sound by my ear and mouse licked my cheek good i said butters there was silence thomas looked at the backseat frowning butters i repeated heya man earth to butters silence butters i asked there was a long pause then a slow inhalation then he said in a very weak voice polka will never die i felt my mouth stretch into a fierce grin damn right it wont i said true thomas sighed where are we going we cant go back there i said and with the wards torn down it wouldnt do us too much good anyway where then thomas asked i stopped at a stop sign and patted at my pockets for a moment i found one of the two things i was looking for thomas frowned at me harry whats wrong the copy of the numbers i made for grevane i said its gone liver spots must have grabbed it from me when we were tussling damn thomas said i found the key to murphys house in another pocket okay ive got a place we can hole up for a while until we can figure out our next move how bad is the cut bleeder thomas said looks worse than it is keep pressure on it i said thank you yes thomas said though he sounded more amused than annoyed i got the beetle moving again frowning out the windows hey i said do you guys notice something thomas peered around for a moment not really too dark butters drew in a sharp breath his voice still unsteady he said thats right its too dark he pointed out one window thats where the skyline should be thomas stared out its gone dark lights are out i said quietly do you see any anywhere thomas looked around for a moment then reported looks like a fire off that way some headlights some police lights the rest are he shook his head what happened butters whispered so thats what mab meant they did this i said the heirs of kemmler but why thomas asked they think that one of them is going to become a god tomorrow night theyre creating fear chaos helplessness why theyre preparing the way thomas didnt say anything none of us did i cant speak for the others but i was afraid the beetles tires whispered over the streets as i drove through the cold lightless murk that had fallen over chicago like a funeral shroud chapter twentyfour murphys house had belonged to her grandmother it was a dinky little place and resided in a neighborhood built before edisons lights went into vogue and while some areas like that became ragged and rundown this particular street looked more like some kind of historical real estate preserve with wellkept lawns trimmed trees and tidy paint jobs on all the homes i pulled the beetle into the driveway hesitated for half a second and then continued up onto the lawn and around to the rear of the house parking beside a little outbuilding that looked like a toolshed as envisioned by the gingerbread man i killed the engine and sat for a moment listening to the car make those juststopped clicking sounds without the headlights it was very dark my leg hurt like hell it seemed like a really great idea to close my eyes and get some rest instead i fumbled around until i found the cardboard box i keep in the car next to a couple of holywater balloons an old pair of socks and a heavy old potato i found a crinkling plastic package i tore it open bent the plastic tube inside sharply and shook it up the two chemical liquids inside mixed and the glow stick began to shine with goldgreen light i got out of the car and hauled my tired ass toward the back door thomas and mouse and butters followed me i unlocked the door with murphys key and led everyone inside murphys place was dare i say it really cute the furniture was old victorian worn but well cared for there were a lot of doilies in its decorating scheme and all in all it was a very girly sort of place when murphys grandmother passed away and murphy moved in she hadnt changed it much the sole concession to the presence of chicagos toughest little detective was a simple wooden stand on the fireplace mantel which held a pair of curved japanese swords one over the other i went from the living room into the kitchen and got into the drawer where murphy kept her matches i lit a couple of candles then used them to find a pair of old glass kerosene lamps and get them going thomas came in while i was doing that grabbed the glow stick and held it in one hand while he opened the refrigerator and rummaged inside hey i said thats not your fridge murphy would share wouldnt she thomas asked that isnt the point i said its not yours the powers out thomas replied shoulder deep in the fridge this stuff is going to spoil anyway all right pizza and beer i stared at him for a second then i said check the freezer too murphy likes ice cream right he said he glanced up at me and said harry go sit down ill bring you something im fine i said no you arent your leg is bleeding again i blinked at him and looked down the white bandages had soaked through with fresh dark red the bandage wasnt saturated yet but the stain had covered most of the white damn thats inconvenient butters appeared in the kitchen doorway ghostly somehow in his pale blue scrubs his hair was a mess all muddy and mussed his glasses were gone and he had his eyes squinted up as he looked at us he had a cut on his lower lip that had closed into a black scab and he had one hell of a shiner forming over his left cheekbone presumably where grevane had struck him let me wash up butters said then ill see to it youll want to make sure that stays clean harry go sit down thomas said butters are you hungry yes butters said is there a bathroom hall first one on the left i said i think murphy keeps a firstaid kit under the sink butters moved silently over to one of the candles took it and left just as quietly well i said at least hes clear now maybe so thomas said he was moving things from the fridge to the kitchen counter they know he doesnt know anything but you risked your life to protect his that might start them to thinking what do you mean i asked you were willing to die to protect him you think grevane understands enough about friendship to comprehend why you did it i grimaced probably not so they might start wondering what made him so valuable to you wondering what you know that they dont he rummaged in a cupboard and found some bread some crackers maybe it wont amount to anything but it might he should be careful i nodded agreement you can keep an eye on him thomas glanced at me you think youre going out now soon as i eat something i said dont be stupid thomas said your leg is hurt you can barely walk straight eat get some sleep theres no time i said he glared at me for a second then pressed his mouth into a line and said lets talk about it after we eat something everyones angry when theyre hungry makes for bad decisions probably smart i said take the coat off go sit down let butters look at your leg it just needs a new bandage i said i can do that myself youre missing my point dummy thomas said a friend would let butters deal with a problem that hes capable of handling hes had plenty of the other kind tonight i glared at thomas shrugged out of the duster and limped for the living room its easier to deal with you when youre a simple selfish asshole i forget how limited you are brainwise thomas said ill be more careful i settled cautiously down onto murphys old couch it creaked as i did murphy isnt large and i doubt that her grandma was either im not exactly layered in muscle but as tall as i am no one ever mistakes me for a lightweight i shoved some doilies off the coffee table so that they wouldnt get blood all over them and propped my throbbing leg up on the table it took a little bit of the pressure off of the injury which didnt mean it stopped hurting it just hurt a little bit less aggressively whatever anything was a relief i sat like that until butters emerged from the hall that went back to the bathroom and the houses two bedrooms he had murphys medical kit in hand i remembered one of those little standard firstaid kits that would fit into the glove box of a car murphy had evidently been planning ahead shed replaced the little medical kit with one the size of a contractors toolbox i dont think im quite that hurt i told butters better to have it and not need it he replied quietly he set down the kerosene lamp and the toolbox he rummaged in the box came out with a pair of safety scissors and set about stripping the bandage away his motions smooth and confident once he had the bandage clear he peered at the injury moved the lamp to get a better look and winced this is a mess youve popped the two center sutures he glanced up at me apologetically ill have to replace them or the others are going to tear out one at a time i swallowed i did not want to do sutures without anaesthetics hadnt i already experienced enough pain for one day do it i told him he nodded and set about cleaning the bloodied skin around the injury he wiped his hands down with a couple of sterilizing wipes and snapped on some rubber gloves theres a topical here ill use it but its not much stronger than that stuff you get for a toothache just get it over with i said he nodded produced a curved needle and surgical thread adjusted the lamp again and set to work he was fairly quick about it i did my best to hold still when he was finished my throat felt raw and rough i hadnt actually done any yelling but only by strangling any screams before they came out i lay there kind of limply while butters recovered the wound you started on the antibiotics right he asked not yet i said he shook his head you should take them right away i dont want to think about what might have gotten into the wound back at your apartment he swallowed and went a little pale i mean my god thats the worst part about the walking dead i said the stains he smiled at me or at least he tried to harry he said im sorry for what i he shook his head i was useless back there worse than useless you could have been hurt thomas appeared in the doorway to the kitchen pale and silent he arched his brow somehow managing to say i told you so without actually opening his mouth i glared back at him in an effort to convey several uncharitable things he smiled a little and faded back into the kitchen butters missed the whole thing dont worry about it i said you ever had anything like this happen before like zombies and ghosts and necromancers butters asked like lifethreatening and dangerous i said oh he was quiet for a minute no i tried to go into the army but i couldnt make it through boot wound up in the hospital same thing when i tried to be a policeman the spirit was willing but butters was weak some people just arent cut out for that kind of thing i told him thats nothing to be ashamed of sure it isnt he said but he wasnt agreeing with me you can do a lot that i cant i told him i nodded at my leg but this stuff is hell its simple butters said i mean the words get a little bit long but all in all it isnt that complicated listen to yourself butters i told him youre sitting there with a straight face saying that medicine and medical forensics is simple except for the long words do you have any clue what its like to not be as intelligent as you he shook his head impatiently im not some kind of genius he frowned okay well technically i have a genius iq but that isnt the point a lot of people do the point is that ive spent most of my adult life doing this thats why i can do it well and the point is i told him that ive spent most of my adult life doing zombies and ghosts and other things trying to kill me thats why i can do it well weve got different specialties thats all so dont beat yourself up for not being better at my job than i am he started cleaning up the medical detritus throwing things away and stripping out of the gloves thanks harry but its more than that i just i couldnt think when those things grabbed me when he was hitting me i knew i should have been doing something planning something but my brain wouldnt work he slammed something down into the trash can with more force than necessary i was too afraid i was too tired to move and for the first time i started to notice how cold it was without my coat i folded my arms and tried not to shiver i watched butters quietly for a moment and said it gets easier what does living with the fear it goes away he asked no i said never gets worse in some ways but once you face it down you learn to accommodate it even work with it sometimes i dont understand he whispered fear cant hurt you i said it cant kill you well technically butters i said dont give me statistics on heart failure fear is a part of life its a warning mechanism thats all it tells you when theres danger around its job is to help you survive not cripple you into being unable to do it i have empirical evidence to the contrary he said bitter humor in his voice thats because youve never thought about it before i said youve reacted to the fear but you havent ever faced it and put it into the right perspective you have to make up your mind to overcome it he was quiet for a second just like that he said just make up my mind and poof its different no but its the first step i said after that you find other steps to take think about it for a while maybe youll never need it again but at least youll be ready if it happens sometime down the line he closed up the medical toolbox you mean its over for you i said grevane knows that you dont have anything he wants hes got no reason to look for you hell for that matter i think you were just in the wrong place at the wrong time when he did come looking anyone with access to the corpse and the ability to find where bony tony had hidden the jump drive would have been good enough for grevane your part in this is over butters closed his eyes for a second oh thank god he blinked up at me sorry i mean it isnt that i dont like being around you but i smiled a little i understand im glad youre all right i glanced down at my leg looks nice and neat again thanks butters youre a good friend he frowned up at me yeah yeah i thought i saw him straighten his shoulders a little okay thomas appeared in the door of the kitchen gas stove hot food and tea sugar tons i said not for me butters said thomas nodded and slipped back into the kitchen so how come if im your friend you dont tell me important things butters said like what i asked him butters gestured at the kitchen well that you know youre gay i blinked at him i mean dont get me wrong its the twentyfirst century you can live your life how you want and it doesnt make you any less cool butters i began and hey look at the guy i mean im not even gay and i think he looks great who could blame you choking sounds came from the kitchen oh shut up i snarled at thomas he kept on making choking sounds that bubbled with laughter you should have just said something butters said dont feel like you have to hide anything harry i wont judge i owe you too much for that im not gay i stated butters nodded at me compassion and empathy all over his face oh okay sure im not butters raised his hands it wasnt my place to intrude he said later some other time maybe none of my business oh for crying out loud i muttered thomas came out bearing plates of steaming reheated pizza some roast beef sandwiches and crackers with slices of cheese partly melted on them he put them down and came back with bottles of cold beer and cups of hot tea he poured my tea for me then leaned over and gave me a chaste kiss on the hair there you go butters pretended not to notice i punched thomas awkwardly in the ribs give me the damned pizza before i kill you thomas sighed and confided to butters he gets like this sometimes i grabbed the pizza from thomas and leaned over enough to snag a beer mouse who had been lying by the front windows staring out at the darkness got up and came nosing over toward the food oh here thomas said the antibiotics he put a couple of pills down on my plate i growled wordlessly at him washed them down with a swallow of beer and fell to eating pizza and roast beef sandwiches and crackers with cheese i shared a bit with mouse every third or fourth bite until thomas snagged the last roast beef sandwich and put it on the floor for mouse to have to himself i finished the beer and settled back with the tea afterward i hadnt realized how hungry i was until id started eating the tea was sweet and just barely cool enough to drink in the wake of the meal and the evenings excitement i finally started to feel warm and human again the pain in my leg faded until it was barely noticeable i blinked heavily down at my bandaged leg and said hey hmmm thomas asked you bastard those werent antibiotics no they werent thomas said and without a trace of shame they were the painkillers you idiot you need to rest before you kill yourself bastard i said again the couch really was very comfortable i finished my tea over the next several moments maybe you have a point of course i do thomas said oh heres the antibiotic by the way he passed me a single horse pill i swallowed it with the last of my tea thomas set the teacup aside and then helped me to my feet come on get a few hours of rest then you can figure out your next move i grunted thomas helped me into one of the darkened bedrooms and i sank onto a soft bed too tired to be angry too tired to be awake i vaguely remember stripping out of my shirt and shoes before pulling soft and heavy covers over me then there was blessed darkness warmth and quiet the last thing i thought before i dropped off to sleep was that the covers smelled faintly of soap and sunlight and strawberries they smelled like murphy chapter twentyfive in the odd dream i had a hot tub i lay back in it luxuriating the water churning to a controlled froth by jets that hit it and me from dozens of angles the water was at that perfect temperature a little short of scalding my skin and the heat of it sank into muscle and bone warming me deliciously and washing away aches and pains it was an odd dream because i have never in my life been in a hot tub i opened my eyes and looked slowly around me the hot tub was set in the floor of what looked like a natural cave low reddish light came from what looked like some kind of moss growing on the stalactites overhead that was odd because id never been in a cave like this either hello i called my voice bounced around the empty cavern i heard the sound of movement and a woman stepped into sight from behind a rock formation she was a little taller than average and had hair that fell in a sheet of golden silk to her shoulders she was dressed in a silken tunic belted with soft rope both pure white the outfit neither displayed any impropriety nor allowed anyone looking to ignore the beauty of the body it clothed her eyes were of a deep deep blue like a sunny october sky and her skin glowed with wholesome appeal she was quite simply a stunning creature hello i thought it was time we had a talk she said youve had a hard day i thought pleasant surroundings might suit you i eyed her for a moment i was naked which was good the surface of the pool had enough in the way of bubbles and froth to be opaque which was also good it saved me the embarrassment of my response to her who are you she lifted golden brows in a faint smile and seated herself beside the hot tub on the floor of the cave her legs together and to one side her hands folded on her lap have you not reasoned it yourself by now i stared at her for a long minute and then said quietly lasciel the woman bowed her head smiling in acknowledgment indeed you cant be here i said i sealed you into the floor under my lab i imprisoned you indeed you did the woman said what you see here is not my true self as such think of me as a reflection of the true lasciel who resides within your mind as a what when you chose to touch the coin you accepted this form of my awareness within you lasciel said i am an imprint a copy i swallowed you live in my head and you can talk to me i can now lasciel said now that you have chosen to employ what i have offered you i took in a deep breath hellfire i used hellfire today to empower my magic you made the conscious choice to do so she said and as a result i can now appear to your conscious mind she smiled actually ive been looking forward to meeting you you are a great deal more interesting than most i have been given to you uh i said you dont look much like a demon keep in mind please that i was not always a resident of hell i relocated there she looked at herself shall i add the wings a harp a golden halo why are you asking me i asked because i am something of a guest she said it costs me nothing to take on an appearance that pleases my host uh huh i said if youre my guest then get out she laughed and there was nothing alluring or musical about it it was just laughter warm and genuine that isnt possible im afraid by taking the coin you invited me in you cannot simply will me away fine i said this is a dream ill wake up see ya i made the simple effort of will required to wake myself from a dream and nothing happened maybe its the painkillers lasciel suggested and you were after all very tired it looks like well be spending a little time together i glared for a while i dont usually take the time to glower at things in dreams either what do you want i said to make you an offer she said the answer is no i said we now return me to my regularly scheduled dream she pursed her lips then smiled again i think you want to hear me out she said this is your dream after all if you truly wished me to begone dont you think you could make it so maybe its the hot tub i suggested i saw that youd never experienced one lasciel said she dipped a toe into the pool and smiled i have often do you like it its okay i said and tried to look like i didnt think it was just about the nicest thing ever for an aching and tired body you know what i know eh i exist within your mind she said i see what you see feel what you feel i learn what you learnand quite a bit more besides what is that supposed to mean i said that i can do you a great deal of good she said i have the knowledge and memory of two thousand years of life upon this world and infinite thousands outside it i know many things that could be of use to you i can advise you teach you secrets of your craft never known to mortalkind show you sights no human has ever seen share with you memory and image beyond anything you could imagine by any chance does all of this knowledge and power and good advice come for only three easy installments of nineteen ninetyfive plus shipping and handling the fallen angel arched a golden brow at me or maybe it comes with a bonus set of knives tough enough to saw through a nail yet still cut tomatoes like this she regarded me steadily and said you arent nearly as funny as you think you are i had to come up with some kind of response to your offer to corrupt and enslave me bad jokes seemed perfectly appropriate because i can only assume that youve got to be kidding lasciel pursed her lips a thoughtful expression it made me start thinking about how soft her mouth looked for example is that what you think i want a slave i got a look at how you guys work i said youre referring to ursiels previous host yes yes he was insane broken im not eager to give it a whirl for myself lasciel rolled her eyes oh please ursiel is a mindless thug he doesnt care what happens to the holder of his coin provided he gets to taste blood as often as possible i dont operate that way sure you dont she shrugged your derision will not unmake the truth some of my kindred prefer domination in their relationships with mortals the wiser among us though find a mutual partnership to be much more practical and beneficial for both parties you saw something of how nicodemus functions with anduriel did you not no offense but i would shove a sharpened length of rebar into one ear and out the other if i thought i was going to turn into anything like nicodemus her expression registered surprise why because hes a monster i said lasciel shook her head perhaps from your perspective but you know very little of him and his goals i know he did his damnedest literally to kill me and two of my friends and god knows how many innocent people with that plague and he did kill another friend what is your point lasciel asked she seemed genuinely confused the point is that he crossed the line and im never going to play on his team he doesnt get understanding or sympathy anymore not from me hes got payback coming you wish to destroy him in a perfect world he would vanish off the face of the earth and i would never hear of him again i said but ill take whatever i can get she absorbed that for a few moments and then nodded slowly very well she said i will depart but let me leave you with a thought as long as you leave she smiled rising i understand your refusal to allow another to control your life its a poisonous repugnant notion to think of someone who would dictate your every move impose upon you a code of behavior you could not accept and refuse to allow you choice expression and the pursuit of your own hearts purpose pretty much i said the fallen angel smiled then believe me when i say that i know precisely how you feel all of the fallen do a little cold spot formed in the pit of my stomach despite the hot tub i shifted uncomfortably in the water we have that in common wizard lasciel said youve no reason to believe me but consider for a moment the possibility that i am sincere in my offer i could do a great deal to help youand you could continue to live your life on your own terms and in accordance with your own values i could help you be ten times the force for good that you already are with that power i should have power too great and terrible and over me the ring would gain a power still greater and more deadly i said gandalf to frodo the demon said smiling but i am not sure the metaphor is applicable you neednt actually take up the coin if it did not suit you to do so the aid i can offer you in this shadow form is far more limited than if you took up the coin but it is not inconsiderable ring coin whatever the physical object is only a symbol in any casea symbol for power i merely offer you the benefit of my knowledge and experience she said yes i said power ive already got more than im comfortable with which is the foremost reason that you of all people are capable of wielding it responsibly maybe i am i said maybe not i know how it works lasciel the first taste is free the price goes up down the line she watched me with luminous blue eyes see if i start leaning on you now how long is it going to be before i decide that i need more of your help how long before i start digging up the concrete in my lab because i think i need your coin in order to survive and she asked quietly if you do need it to survive i sat in the swirling hot waters and sighed then i closed my eyes made an effort of will and reshaped the dream we stood within so that the hot tub was gone and i stood dressed and facing her on a solid cavern floor if it comes to that i hope i die with a little bit of style because im not going to sign on with downbelow not even in hells foreign legion fascinating lasciel said she smiled at me my god it was beautiful it wasnt merely physical loveliness or the appearance of warmth it was the whole sense of her the vibrant glowing life of the being before me a life with energy enough to ignite a star seeing her smile was like watching the sun rise on the very first morning like feeling the caress of the first breeze of the first spring it made me want to laugh and run and spin around in it like the sunny days of a childhood i could only dimly remember but i held myself back beauty can be dangerous and fire though lovely can burn and kill when not treated with respect i faced the fallen angel cautiously my posture unthreatening but unbowed i faced her beauty and felt the radiant warmth of her presence and held myself from reaching out for it im not fascinating i said i am what i am it isnt perfect but its mine im not making deals with you lasciel nodded her expression thoughtful youve been burned in bargains past and you have no desire to repeat the experience you are wary of dealing with me and those like meand for good reason i dont think i would have had any lasting respect for you had you accepted my offer at face valueeven though it is genuine gee i would have felt crushed by your lack of respect she laughed with a lot of belly in it genuinely pleased i admire your will your defiance as something of a defiant being myself i think we might forge a strong partnership given time to develop it that wont happen i said i want you to leave get thee behind me she asked something like that she bowed her head as you wish my host i request that you merely consider my offer should you wish to converse with me again you have only to call my name i wont i said as it pleases you she said then she was gone and the dream cavern was darker and lonelier for her absence i relaxed and went back to my sleep and my solitary dreams i was too tired to remember if any of them had a hot tub chapter twentysix i slept hard and didnt wake up until well after sunrise i heard voices and after a minute i identified the sharp crackling edges of tone that told me they were coming out of a radio i got up and gave myself a washcloth bath at the bathroom sink it wasnt as nice as a hot tub and not even as nice as a shower but i didnt feel like sticking my aching leg into a trash bag and taping it shut so that i could get one without getting my bandages wet i couldnt find my clothes anywhere so i wandered out into the house in my bare feet and mangled pants the hospital staff had cut the pant leg mostly off of my wounded leg and the edges were rough and uneven i passed a mirror in the hallway of the house and stopped to examine myself i looked like a joke a bad joke mysterious power outage continues the radio announcer was saying in fact its difficult to estimate how long well be able to stay on the air or even how many people are actually receiving this broadcast gasolinepowered generators have been encountering odd trouble throughout the city batteries seem unreliable and other gasolinepowered engines including those of vehicles are behaving unpredictably the telephone lines have been having all kinds of problems and cell phones seem to be all but useless ohare is completely shut down and as you can imagine its playing havoc with airline traffic throughout the nation thomas was standing in the kitchen at the gas stove he was making pancakes and listening to an old batterypowered radio sitting on murphys counter he nodded to me put a finger against his lips and flicked a glance at the radio i nodded folded my arms and leaned against the doorway to listen to the announcer continue national authorities have declined to comment on the matter though the mayors office has given a statement blaming the problems on unusual sunspot activity thomas snorted the radio prattled on that answer doesnt seem to hold much water given that in cities as near as the south side of joliet all systems are behaving normally other sources have suggested everything from an elaborate halloween hoax to the detonation of some kind of electromagnetic pulse device which has disrupted the citys electrical utilities a press conference has reportedly been scheduled for later this evening well be on the air all through the current crisis giving you up to date information as quickly as we the announcers voice broke up into wild static and sound thomas reached over and flicked the radio off had it on for twenty minutes he said got a clear signal for maybe five of them i grunted do you know whats happened maybe i said wheres butters thomas tilted his head toward the back door walking mouse i took a seat at the little kitchen table getting my weight off of my injured leg todays going to be pretty intense i said thomas flipped a pancake because of the heirs of kemmler yeah i said if mab is right about what theyre trying to do someone has to stop them before tonight why because after that im not sure anyone will be able to stop them i said my brother nodded think you can take them theyre fighting among themselves i said theyre all going to be more worried about their fellow necromancers than they are about me uh huh thomas said but do you think you can take them no then what youre talking about isnt heroism man its suicide i shook my head i dont need to kill them i only need to stop them if i play this right i wont need to fight anybody thomas flipped another pancake the cooked side was a uniform shade of perfect light brown how are you going to manage that they need two things to make this godhood thing go i said the erlking and the knowledge in the word of kemmler if i can deny them either the whole shebang is canceled you figure out those numbers yet thomas asked no so what you going to put a hit on the erlking to keep him from showing up i shook my head mab gave me the impression that the erlking was in the same weight class as her she tough thomas asked beyond the pale i said so you cant kill the erlking what then i summon him myself he arched an eyebrow look no matter how mighty he is he cant be in two places at once if i call him up and keep him busy then the heirs cant summon him to their ceremony he nodded how are you going to call him the book i said its almost got to be one of those poems or songs one of them must be an incantation to attract the erlkings attention but you dont have the book thomas said yeah i said thats the kink i havent worked out yet thomas nodded scraping the last of the batter out of a bowl and onto the griddle even if you do figure out how to call the erlking it sounds like he might be kinda dangerous probably but impersonal that means not as dangerous as one of the heirs going godly and showing up to give me some payback for annoying them i shrugged and the only one in danger will be me wrong thomas said ill be with you i had been sure he would say something like that but hearing it still felt pretty good thomas had a truckload of baggage and he wasnt always the most pleasant person in the worldbut he was my brother family hed stand with me which made what came next hard to say you cant i said his expression smoothed over into neutrality because of mavra no i said because im going to bring in the white council thomas dropped his spatula onto the kitchen floor i have to i said it took all the wardens together to take down kemmler and his students last time i might not be able to prevent the erlkings arrival if that happens someone has to stop the heirs directly i cant do it the wardens can its as simple as that okay he said but that doesnt explain why i cant stick with you because to them youre just a white court vampire thomas with whom i am supposed to be at war if they learn that youre my brother it might give the people in the council who dont like me grounds to question my loyalty and even if they believe that im not acting against the council or being controlled by you theyd still be suspicious of you theyd want assurances that you were on their team theyd use me he said quietly and use me against you theyd use us both against each other which is why you cant be around when they show thomas turned and studied my face carefully what about murphy if you call in the council mavra will screw up her life i chewed on my lip a little murphy wouldnt want me to put innocents in danger to protect her if one of the heirs turns into some kind of dark god people are going to die she wouldnt forgive me for protecting her if that was the cost i said besides this isnt about recovering the word this is about stopping the heirs i can still get the book to mavra and fulfill our bargain thomas took a deep breath is that wise i dont know shes not exactly alive i doubt kemmlers techniques would apply to her use of magic if they didnt thomas said then why would she want the book which was a damned good question i rubbed at my eyes all i know is that ive got to stop the heirs and ive got to protect murphy if the council finds out that youre planning on using them to defeat the heirs so that you can give kemmlers book to a vampire of the black court youll be in trouble not for long i said the wardens will execute me on the spot god and you can accept that from your own people im acclimated i said we were quiet for a moment you want me to sit this out thomas said you dont want me to help i dont see that i have much choice i told him do you you could just leave this whole thing we could head for aruba or something i looked at him okay he said you wont but a guy can hope i just dont like the idea of sitting on the sidelines when you might need my help he frowned hey youre doing this on purpose youre trying to keep me out of it to protect me you sneaky little bitch it works out that way i said think of it as payback for those painkillers he grimaced at me then nodded and thank you i said quietly you were right i needed the rest of course i was right thomas said you looked like you were about to pass out you still dont look great im hungry did you make those pancakes for breakfast or are they only decorative go ahead and mock thomas said he slapped a bunch of pancakes onto a plate and brought it over to the table along with a plastic bottle of maple syrup here happy birthday i blinked at the pancakes and then up at him id have gotten you a present but he shrugged no i said i mean no thats okay im surprised you remembered at all no one has remembered my birthday since susan left town thomas got himself a plate and left the rest on a third plate for butters he sat down at the table and started eating them without syrup dont make a big thing of it im sort of surprised i remembered it myself he nodded at the world in general so you think grevane and the corpsetaker are the ones who turned the lights out i shook my head they were both stretching themselves by keeping so many undead under their control thats why the corpsetaker went after grevane with a sword and why he defended himself physically then who did it cowl i said he made himself scarce last night my guess is that he was too busy setting it up to take a swing at grevane or the corpsetaker why cowl because this is a major hex man if youd have asked me yesterday i wouldnt have thought this was possible i dont know how he did it but i shivered his magic is stronger than mine and from what i saw of his technique hes a hell of a lot more skilled too if hes as good at thaumaturgy as he is at evocation hes the most dangerous wizard ive ever seen im not sure how he did it matters as much as why thomas said i nodded he gets a lot of advantages paralyzes human power structures keeps cops and so on too busy to interfere with whatever theyre doing but thats not the only reason you said something about preparing the way yeah i finished a large bite of syrupy pancake goodness black magic is tied in pretty closely with a lot of negative emotionsespecially fear so if you do something that scares a whole lot of people you get an environment that is better for black magic this stunt is going to cause havoc make a lot of people worry it will help with the heirs major mojo tonight youre sure its tonight i nodded pretty much its halloween the barriers between the mortal world and the spirit world are at their weakest theyll be able to call up the most spirits to devour tonight all the acts of black magic theyve been working around town were also part of that preparation creating spiritual turbulence making it easier to use larger and larger amounts of black magic thomas ate several bites while i listened then he said how are you going to contact the council with the phones out alternative channels i said ill call up a messenger meanwhile thomas said his voice a little bitter i will stay here and do nothing no you wont i said because youre going to be figuring out where they can call up the most old spirits not only that but im leaving you a copy of bony tonys code numbers figure out what they mean he toyed with a bit of pancake old spirits would come from a graveyard right probably i said but sometimes they can get attached to possessions instead of a specific location see what you can find out about native american burial grounds or ruins thats the right age bracket for what the heirs want okay thomas said without much confidence and you want me to figure out the numbers too with butters i said he can help you on both counts hes damned smart assuming he wants to help thomas said he might want to cash in his chips and get out of this game while hes still alive if he does then youll be on your own i said but i dont think he will just then the kitchen door opened and butters came in with a panting mouse the big dog padded over to me and nudged my hand with his nose until i scratched him in his favorite spot just behind one notched ear dont think who will what butters asked oh hey pancakes are there any for me counter thomas said cool butters i said look i think youre going to be all right on your own now if you want me to ill take you home after breakfast he peered owlishly at me and said of course i want to go home the oktoberfest polkaoff is tonight thomas arched an eyebrow at me butters looked back and forth between us and said do you need me to do something maybe i said theres some research to be done i totally understand if you want to get while the gettings good but if youre willing we could use your help research butters said what kind of research i told him butters chewed on his lip is it is anything going to try to kill me for doing it i dont think so i said but i cant lie to you these are some dangerous people i cant predict everything they might do butters nodded but if you dont get this information what happens it gets harder to stop them and if you dont stop them what happens i put my fork down suddenly not very hungry one of them gets phenomenal cosmic power and all the living space he can take i get killed so will a lot of innocent people and god only knows what someone could do with power like that over the long term butters looked down at his pancakes i waited thomas said nothing his appetite hadnt been affected and the sound of his knife and fork on the plate was the only one in the kitchen this is bigger than me he said finally its bigger than polka even so i guess ill help i smiled at him appreciate it thomas looked up studying butters speculatively yeah butters nodded and grimaced if i walk away when i know i could lend a hand im not sure i could live with that i mean if you were asking me to shoot somebody or something id head for the hills but research is different i can do research i rose and clapped butters gently on the shoulder thomas will fill you in where are you going he asked i have to figure out how to call up the erlking i said is that why everyone wanted that book apparently but you had it heck you read it i rubbed at my eyes yeah i know but i didnt know exactly what i was looking for butters nodded frustrating huh just a bit its too bad you dont have a photographic memory butters said i knew a guy in college with one of those the bastard he could just look at a page and then read it back to himself in his head a week later a thought struck me hard and i felt my limbs twitch with sudden excitement what did you say uh you dont have a photographic memory butters asked yes i said butters you are a genius i am he said then his brow furrowed in puzzlement i am brilliant i said certifiably oh good i rose and started gathering my things where is that backpack i had you wear living room butters said why you might need it i limped out to the living room and got the backpack i touched it lightly and felt the solid curve of bob the skull within i got my coat and my car keys and headed for the back door where are you going thomas asked gumshoeing i said you shouldnt go alone probably not i agreed but i am at least take mouse thomas said the big dog tilted his head quizzically looking back and forth between thomas and me and hold his leash in my teeth i said ive only got the one hand to work with thomas frowned and then rolled a shoulder in a shrug okay the phones are apparently unreliable i said i tossed the backpack at thomas he caught it bob will know how to reach me if you find something got that bob a muffled voice from the backpack said jawohl herr kommandant butters jumped halfway out of his chair and made a squeaking sound what was that explain it to him i told thomas ill be in touch as soon as i call my brother nodded at me good luck be careful you too keep your eyes open thanks again butters sure sure see you soon butters poked at the backpack with his fork hey bob protested from inside the pack stop that youll scratch it all up i swung out the door the nights rest had done me good and realizing how it might be possible to stop the heirs of kemmler had given me an electric sense of purpose i strode to the car barely feeling my aching leg i turned my hand over and regarded shielas phone number written on it in black marker i didnt have a photographic memory but i knew someone who did chapter twentyseven i went to my office traffic wasnt as bad as it could have been it looked like the commuters hadnt poured into town in the usual volume the traffic lights were out but there were cops at most of the problem intersections and everyone seemed to be driving slowly and reasonably during the crisis thats what they were calling it on the radiothe crisis there were a lot more people than usual out and about on the street and with far less of the usual brisk businesslike manner all in all it was about the best reaction to the situation you could hope for it seemed like people could go one of two ways either they freak out and start rioting or they actually act like human beings in trouble ought to and look out for one another when la blacked out there had been bigtime rioting in new york people had pulled together it was just as well that people hadnt reacted quite so blindly as they might have without even trying i could feel the slow sour tension of black magic pulsing and swirling through the city with the subtle influence of all that dark energy behind it even a mild panic could have turned ugly and fast of course it wasnt dark yet nightfall could change things as advanced as mankind likes to think it is we all have that ageold primal undeniable dread of darkness of being unable to see danger coming we dont like to think that were afraid of the dark anymore but if thats true then why do we work so hard to make sure our cities are constantly lit we cloak ourselves in so much light that we can barely see the stars at night fear is a funny thing in the right light even tiny and insignificant fears can suddenly grow swelling up to monstrous proportions with the black magic rolling around the way it was that instinctive fear of the dark would feed upon itself doubling and redoubling and with no explanation to tell them why the lights hadnt come on people would start to forget their carefully rational reasons not to be afraid in favor of panic even assuming i prevented a brandspankingnew dark godling from arising tonight could be bad it could be very bad i got to my office and tried to call shielas number the phones werent cooperating with me which hardly came as a surprise they rarely worked perfectly on the best of days i kept a copy of a reverse phone book at my office though and i found the address of her cabrini green apartment while it wasnt as bad as it had been in the past it wasnt exactly the best part of town either i had a brief pang of longing for the gun id lost in the alley behind bocks place it wasnt that the gun was more effective than other things i could do to defend myself but it was a hell of a lot more of a deterrent to the average chicago thug than a carved stick just for fun i tried the phones again dialing my contact number for the nearest outpost of the wardens so help me god the phone rang yes answered a woman with a low roughened voice i fumbled my little notebook of security phrases out of my dusters pocket one second i said i didnt think the call would go through i flipped the little notebook open to the last page and said uh chartreuse sirocco rabbit answered the voice i checked the notebook it was the countersign this is wizard dresden i said i have a code wolf situation here repeat code wolf the woman on the other end of the phone hissed this is warden luccio wizard holy crap the boss herself anastasia luccio was one of the next in line for a seat on the senior council and was the commander of the wardens she was one tough old bird and she was the field commander of the councils forces in the war with the red court warden luccio i said respectfullyboth because she probably deserved it and because i needed to get along with her as well as i possibly could what is the situation she asked at least three apprentices to the necromancer kemmler are here in chicago i said they found the fourth book theyre going to use it tonight there was a stunned silence from the other end of the phone hello i said are you sure luccio asked her voice had a faint italian accent how do you know who they are all those zombies and ghosts were sort of a giveaway i said i confronted them they identified themselves as grevane cowl and capiorcorpus and they each had a drummer with them dio luccio said do you know where they are not yet but im working on it i said can you help affirmative luccio said we will dispatch wardens to chicago immediately they will arrive at your apartment within six hours might not be the best place i said i was attacked there last night and my wards got torn apart the apartment may be under surveillance understood then we will rendezvous at the alternate location i checked the notebook id have to meet them at mcanallys gotcha i said che cosa she asked uh understood warden i said six hours alternate location dont skimp on the personnel either these folks are serious i am familiar with kemmlers disciples she said though her tone was more one of agreement than reprimand i will lead the team myself six hours right six hours she hung up the phone i settled it back onto its cradle lips pursed in thought hells bells the war captain of the white council herself was to take the field that meant that this situation was being regarded as an emergency tantamount to a terrorist with an armed nuclear bomb if the head warden was coming out to battle it meant that the wardens were going to pull out all the stops i was going to have a lot of help for a change help that held me in deadly suspicion and who might execute me if they learned some of my secrets but help nonetheless i felt an odd sense of comfort the wardens had been one of my biggest fears practically since i had learned about their existence there was something deeply satisfying about seeing the object of that fear take a hostile interest in grevane and company like when darth vader turns against the emperor and throws him down the shaft theres nothing quite so cool as seeing someone who scares the hell out of you go at an enemy and then a disturbing thought occurred to me why in hell was the war captain of the white council answering the freaking phones why wasnt a junior member of the wardens doing the receptionist work i could think of only a couple or three reasons none of them were pleasant my brief flash of relief and confidence melted away good thing it did too im sure the world would come to an end if i were allowed to feel a sense of relief and wellbeing for any length of time i shoved my worry out of my head it wasnt going to help anything the only one i could count on to ride to my rescue was me if the wardens managed to do it anyway it would be a nice surprise but i had to get myself moving before the problem started looking too big it was the same principle as cleaning a really messy room you dont think about everything you have to do you focus on one thing and get it done then move on to the next i needed the summons that was hidden in die erlking to get that i had to talk to shiela right harry get a move on i tried the phone once more but i guess id already won the functional tech lottery all circuits were busy i hadnt been sitting down very long but it was long enough for my leg to make it clear to the rest of my body that it didnt want to be walked on any more today get with the program i told my leg severely you dont have to be happy about it but i need you functional my leg sat there in sullen silence and throbbed which i took as assent i reached for my keys and then heard a soft sound at my office door i whirled my staff into my hand calling up my will and the runes were already smoldering with sullen orange light when the door opened billy stood in the doorway his expression frozen in surprise his mouth open he was wearing jeans cowboy boots and an old leather jacket he hadnt worn his glasses much over the past several years but he had them on today his hair had been mussed by the wind which sighed against my office windows i heard a few drops of rain begin to fall striking with dull taps on the glass um he said after a minute hi harry i scowled at him and lowered the staff letting the power ease out of it the warmed wood felt good under my hand and the faint scent of wood smoke lay on the air bad time to be appearing suddenly in my office door i said next time ill whistle or something billy replied howd you find me its your office he looked around the place you talking to someone not really i said what do you need he opened his coat the handle of a gun protruded from his belt my revolver artemis bock came by my place he said there was some trouble at his store yeah i said bad guys were trying to rough him up i argued with them about it billy nodded thats what he said he found this in the alley outside he said there was blood one of them clipped my leg i said i got it taken care of billy nodded worried um he was worried about you im fine i stood up careful about my leg bock okay um billy said he looked at me his expression clearly concerned yeah not hurt i mean some damage to the store which he said he didnt mind he wanted me to thank you for him he pulled the gun out of his belt and said and i thought you might need this shouldnt carry it in your pants like that i said good way to sing soprano its empty he said and offered me the handle of the gun i took it flipped the cylinder open and checked it the gun wasnt loaded i slid it into the pocket of my duster then opened the drawer of my desk and took a small box of ammunition i kept there i put it in the pocket along with the gun thanks for bringing that by i said whyd you come looking here you didnt answer the phone at your place i went by there it looked like someone tried to tear the door off someone did i said but youre all right there was a little more weight on the question than i would have expected im fine i said getting impatient hells bells billy if youve got something to say go ahead and say it he inhaled deeply um well im sort of afraid to i arched a brow at him and scowled again look you arent acting right harry meaning i asked meaning not like yourself billy said people have been noticing people i asked my leg pounded i had no time for this kind of psychological pattycake what people people who respect you he said carefully maybe who are even a little bit afraid of you i just stared at him i dont know if you know this harry but you can be a really scary guy i mean ive seen what you can do and even the people who havent seen themselves have heard stories believe me were all glad youre one of the good guys but if you werent what i said suddenly feeling more tired if i wasnt then what youd be scary really scary get to your damned point i said quietly he nodded youve been talking to things excuse me he lifted his hands talking to things i mean you were talking to things when i was outside your door that was nothing i said okay billy said though his tone suggested that he was placating me rather than agreeing what is this talkingtothings crap did bock say i was doing that harry billy said because i wasnt i said good god i do some crazy crap but its usually the this is never going to work but i have to try it variety of crazy im not insane billy folded his arms his eyes searching my face see thats the thing if you were truly insane would you be able to realize it i rubbed at the bridge of my nose so let me get this straight because bock said something about me and because you heard me talking to myself suddenly im ready for the room with rubber walls no he said sort of harry look it isnt like im trying to accuse thats funny because it sounds like an accusation from this end i said i only i slammed my staff down on the floor and billy flinched he tried to cover it but i had seen the motion billy flinched like he was genuinely afraid that i was going to hurt him what the hell billy i said quietly there is some bad business going on i dont have time for this i dont know what bock told you but hes had a bad couple of days hes rattled im not going to hold anything against him all right he said quietly i want you to go home i told him and i want you to start sending out word around to the in crowd everyone wants to be behind a threshold tonight he frowned and took off his glasses scrubbing at them with a corner of his shirt why because the white council is sending a war party to town you dont want anyone you know to get caught in the backwash billy swallowed this is big then and i have to get moving i dont have time for distractions i stepped forward and put my hand on his shoulder hey its me harry im as sane as i ever am and i need you to trust me for a little while tell people to keep their heads down okay he took a deep breath and then nodded sharply ill do it man good i dont know why youre so worried about me but well sit down and talk after the dust settles figure out whats up make sure i havent stripped a gear when i wasnt looking i promise you right he said nodding thank you im sorry if this is aw hell man enough with sharing the emotions i said were gonna turn into women as we stand here get a move on he chucked my arm with a mostly closed fist and left i waited for him to go i didnt feel like riding down in the elevator with him wondering if he was afraid of me suddenly turning on him with an ax or a butcher knife or something i leaned on my staff and thought about it for a second billy was really worried about me worried enough that he was afraid that i might do something to him what the hell had i done to set that off and an even better question which i had to ask myself followed on the heels of that first one what if he was right i poked at my skull with a finger it didnt feel soft or anything i didnt feel insane but if youd really lost it would you have enough left upstairs to know crazy people never thought they were crazy ive always talked to things i said and to myself good point myself agreed with me unless that means youve been nuts all along i dont need wiseass remarks i told myself severely theres work to do so shut up all i could think was that it had been georgias idea she was always buried to the ears in her psych textbooks maybe she had fallen victim to some kind of inverted psychological hypochondria or something thunder rumbled outside and the rain started coming down harder i didnt need any doubts distracting me right now i shrugged off the whole conversation with billy tabling it for later i loaded my gun since not loading it would have been almost as good as not having it then slipped it back into my pocket locked up my office behind me and headed for the car i had to get to shiela and see if her remarkable memory could call up the poems and stanzas from that stupid book and then i had to figure out how to call up a wild and deadly lord of the darker realms of faerie and sidetrack him so that the heirs of kemmler couldnt use him to promote themselves to demigod status and along the way i had to find the word of kemmler and get it to mavra somehow without the white council learning what i was up to easy as breathing as i rode down in the elevator i had to admit that billy might have a point chapter twentyeight the cabrini green tenement shiela lived in had seen better daysbut it had seen worse too the city had dumped a lot of money into urban renewal projects there and it was an ongoing process shielas building was still undergoing renovation and the lobby and many of the floors were only halffinished no workmen were in the building when i went into the lobby but there were dozens of tarps stacks of drywall and raw lumber heavy tool lockers that had been bolted to the floor and other evidence of the contractors who would doubtless have been working had the citys lights not been out i walked over to the elevators and to the security panel there and found the button of shielas apartment on the ninth floor i pressed it and held it down for a minute before i realized that duh the power was out and i wasnt going to be able to ring her apartment i grimaced and looked around for the stairs nine flights up on my leg wasnt going to feel nice but it wasnt as though i had an infinite number of options the door to the stairs was locked but it was a standard fire door with a push bar on the other side i lifted my staff looked around the lobby to make sure no one had wandered in to see me and then gestured with the staff and murmured forzare i sent a bare whisper of my power through the door and then drew it back toward me with a sharp gesture i caught the push bar on the other side with it and the door trembled and then swung open by an inch or two i thrust the end of my staff into it to hold it open then grabbed on and heaved i stared at the stairs for a second but they didnt get any shorter or turn into an escalator or anything so i sighed and started painfully hauling myself up them one step at a time nine floors and steps later i paused to catch my breath and then opened the door to the ninthfloor hallway in the same manner i had the one in the lobby the ninthfloor hallway was still under construction and several of the apartments in it were missing doors and even walls i limped along until i found shielas apartment and then knocked on the door i felt a tingling tension over the door as i touched ita magical ward of some kind it was nowhere near as strong as the ones on my apartment had been but it was stable that was fairly impressive shiela might not have a ton of inborn talent but she evidently had enough discipline to offset the lack i held my hand out lightly just over the surface of the door sending my senses running over the ward getting more of a feel for its strength it couldnt have stopped me if i used my power to force my way in but it felt strong enough to give me a solid kick in the teeth if i tried it physically it would certainly scare the hell out of a wouldbe burglar not bad after a minute i heard footsteps and the door opened a little i could see a security chain and a slender stripe of her face that included one of shielas dark sparkling eyes she let out a surprised little sound and then said harry just a minute i waited while she shut the door and took off the security chain then she opened the door again smiling at me she had an infectious smile and i found myself answering it with one of my own she was dressed in a scarlet sequined bodice that made her chest into something very difficult not to stare at nearly translucent baggy leggings leather sandals that wrapped around her calves and million pounds of bangles on her arms and ankles her hair had been caught up in a high ponytail fixed into place to rise over some kind of mesh headdress and her smooth bare shoulders looked lovely and strong hi she said hi i said back is your roommate shiela in genie she laughed you caught me in the nick of time i was just about to leave to get together with some people i know costume party i asked no i dress like this all the time her eyes sparkled it is halloween even with the lights out she bobbed her brows her smile wicked for a second who knows that might make it more fun i had been right about the curves that had been hidden under her loose clothing back at bocks they were awfully pleasant ones it was an effort of will to stay focused on her faceespecially when she laughed her laugh made all sorts of interesting little quivers run over her do you have a minute i asked maybe even two she said what did you have in mind i need your help with something i said i looked up and down the hallway as far as i knew i hadnt been followed and id been watching my backbut that didnt mean that no one was there i was pretty good at noticing such things but there were plenty of people and nonpeople who were better than me if you dont mind can we talk about it inside her expression became a little wary and she looked up and down the hall herself are you in trouble is this about the people at the store pretty much i said may i come in of course of course she said and stepped back inside holding the door open for me i limped in oh my god she said staring at me as i came in what happened a ghoul threw a knife into my leg i told her she blinked at me you mean a real ghoul an actual ghoul yeah her face twisted up with dismay oh wow ive heard stories but i never thought you know its hard to believe theyre really out there does that make me an idiot no i said it makes you lucky if i never see another ghoul it will be too soon her apartment was pretty typical of the kind small worn rundown but clean she had mostly secondhand furniture an ancient old fridge mismatched bookshelves that overflowed with paperbacks and textbooks and a tiny aged television that looked as if it didnt get much use sit down she said picking up a couple of blankets and a throw pillow from the couch clearing off a space for me i tottered over to the couch and sat which felt entirely too good i grunted and got my leg elevated onto the coffee table and it felt even better thanks i said she shook her head staring at me you look frightful been a tough couple of days she studied me with serious eyes i suppose it must have been what are you doing here the book i said the one on the erlking that i got from bock i remember she said exactly um what thats why im here i said you remember but i dont and the bad guys stole my copy i need you to remember it for me she frowned the whole thing i dont think so i said there were several poems and stanzas in there i think what i need is in one of them what do you need she said i stared at her for a second then i said it might be better if you dont know she lifted her chin and regarded me for a moment as if id just said something bad about her mother excuse me this is some bad business i said it might be safer for you if i dont tell you much about it well she said thats quite patronizing of you harry thank you i held up a hand it isnt like that yes she said it is you want me to give you information but you wont tell me why or what you are going to do with it its for your own protection i said perhaps she replied but if i give you this information im going to bear some responsibility for what you do with it we dont know each other very well what if you took the information i gave you and used it to hurt someone i wont and maybe thats true she said but maybe it isnt dont you see i have an obligation in this matter she said to use my talent responsibly that means not using it blindly or recklessly can you understand that actually i said i can she pursed her lips and then nodded then if you want me to help you tell me why you need it you could be put at risk if you become involved in this i said it could be very dangerous i left a clear silence between the last two words for emphasis i understand she said i accept that so tell me i stared at her for a second and then sighed a little frustrated she had a point after all but dammit i didnt want to see anyone else get hurt because of kemmlers disciples particularly not anyone with such lovely breasts i jerked my eyes away from them and said the people youve seen around the store are going to use the book to call up the erlking she frowned but hes an extremely powerful faerie yes can they do that do you mean is it possible i asked sure i whistled up queen mab a few hours ago myself which was technically the truth oh she said her tone mild why because i needed information i said no not that why are these people calling up the erlking theyre going to use his presence on halloween night to call up an extralarge helping of ancient spirits then theyre going to bind and devour those spirits in order to give themselves a valhallasized portion of supernatural power she stared at me her mouth opening a little its a rite of ascension she whispered a real one yeah i said but thats thats insane so are these people i said what you tell me could stop it from happening it could save a lot of livesnot least of which is my own she folded her arms over her stomach as if chilled her face looked pale and worried i need the poems because im going to summon the erlking before they can do it and make sure that i sidetrack him long enough to ruin their plans isnt that dangerous she asked not as dangerous as doing nothing i said so now you know why will you help me she fretted her lower lip as though mulling it over but her eyes were sparkling say please please i said her smile widened pretty please dont push me i half growled but i doubt it came out very intimidating she smiled at me it might take me few minutes i havent looked at that book in some time ill have to prepare meditate is it that complicated i asked she sighed the smile fading theres so much of it sometimes my head feels like a library i dont have a problem remembering its finding where ive put it thats a challenge and not all of it is very pleasant to remember i know what thats like i said ive seen some things i would rather werent in my head she nodded and paced over to settle down on the couch next to me she drew her feet up underneath her and wriggled a bit to get comfortable the wriggling part was intriguing i tried not to be too obviously interested and fumbled my notebook and trusty pencil from my dusters pocket all right she said and closed her eyes give me a moment ill speak it to you okay i said and dont stare at me i moved my eyes i wasnt she snorted delicately havent you ever seen breasts before i wasnt staring i protested of course she opened one eye and gave me a sly oblique glance then she closed her eyes with a little smile and inhaled deeply thats cheating i said she smiled again and then her expression changed her features growing remote her shoulders eased into relaxation and then her eyes opened dark distant and unfocused she stared into the far distance for several moments her breathing slowing and her eyes started moving as if she were reading a book here it is she said her voice slow quiet and dreamy peabody he was the one to compile the various essays i just need the poems i said no need for the cover plate hush she said this isnt as easy as it looks her fingers and hands twitched now and then while her eyes swept over the unseen book i realized after a moment that she was turning the pages of the book in her memory all right she said a minute later ready i poised my pencil over my notepad ready she started quoting poetry to me and i started writing it down it wasnt in the first poem or the second but in the third one i recognized the rhythms and patterns of a phrase of summoning each line innocent on its own but each building on the ones preceding it with the proper focus intent and strength of will the simple poem could reach out beyond the borders of the mortal world and draw the notice of the deadly faerie hunter known as the eriking the lord of goblins thats the one i said quietly i need you to be completely sure of your accuracy of recollection shiela nodded her eyes faraway her hand made a reverse of the pageturning motion she used and she spoke the poem to me again more slowly i doublechecked that id written it all down correctly it doesnt do to mangle a summoning if you get the words wrong it can have all kinds of bad effects bestcase scenario the summoning doesnt work and you pour all the effort into it for nothing one step worse a bungled summoning could call up the wrong beingmaybe one that would be happy to rip off your face with its tentacleladen extendable maw finally at the extreme end of negative consequences the failed summons might call up the being you wantedin this case the erlkingonly it would be insulted that you hadnt bothered to get it right uberpowerful beings of the spirit world had the kind of power and tempers that horror movies are made of and it was a bad idea to get one of them mad at you if you called up a being incorrectly there was very little you could do to protect yourself from them that was the job hazard of summoning if i chanted the erlking to chicago i had to be damned sure i did it correctly or it would be worth as much as my life once more i told shiela quietly when she was finished i had to be sure she nodded and began again i checked my written version they all came out the same for the third time in a row so i was as sure as i reasonably could be that it was accurate i stared at the notepad for a moment trying to absorb the summoning to remember its rhythm the rolling sound of consonant and verb that were only incidentally related to language this wasnt a poemit was simply a frequency a signal of sound and timing and i committed it with methodical precision to memory the same way i stored the precise inflections required to call upon a spirit being using its true name in a sense the poem was a name for the erlking he would respond to it in the same way when i looked up again a few moments later i felt the gentle pressure of shielas gaze she was watching me her eyes worried youre either incredibly stupid or one of the most courageous men ive ever seen go with stupid i said lightly in my experience you cant go wrong assuming stupid if you use the summoning she said quietly not smiling at my tone and something bad happens to you i will be to blame i shook my head no i said i know what im doing it will be my own damned fault im not sure that your acceptance can absolve me of responsibility she said frowning is there anything else i can do to help you theres no need to offer i said yes she said earnestly there is i need to know that ive done whatever i can that if something happens to you it wont be because of something i didnt do i studied her face for a moment and found myself smiling you take this whole responsibility thing very seriously i said is there some reason i shouldnt she asked none at all i said its just unusual from someone well dont take this the wrong way but its unusual from someone so far down the ladder when it comes to raw power she smiled a little it doesnt take much power to hurt someone she said its far easier than healing the damage its always like that for everything not just magic yeah but not many people seem to get that i reached over and put my right hand on hers she had very soft very warm hands thank you for helping me if theres anything i can ever do to pay you back she smiled at me and said there is one thing oh i asked she nodded a friend told me once that you can tell a lot about a person from how they do things the first time i blinked a couple of times and then said uh like what like this she said and came to me she moved beautifullyfluid and graceful and elegantly feminine she was all warm curves and soft flesh scented of wildflowers as she slid one leg over mine straddling my thighs her gentle hands lightly framed my face as she leaned down to kiss me her eyes rolling back and closing in anticipation as her mouth met mine the kiss began slowly quietlysensuous but not impassioned patience without hesitance her lips were a warm and gentle contact on mine and there was a sense of exploration to her mouth as she felt her way around the kiss maybe i was just too tired or too injured or too worried about my prospects for immediate survival but it felt good it felt really good shielas mouth wasnt inflamed with need she demanded nothing with the kiss all she wanted was to taste my mouth to feel my skin under her hands and then without warning a desperate yearning for more of that simple contact that human warmth roared through me in a flash fire of need nearly everyone underestimates how powerful the touch of another persons hand can be the need to be touched is something so primal so fundamentally a part of our existence as human beings that its true impact upon us can be difficult to put into words that power doesnt necessarily have anything to do with sex either from the time we are infants we learn to associate the touch of a human hand with safety with comfort with love i hadnt been touched much for well a long damned time thomas may have been my brother but he avoided physical contact even casual and incidental contact like the plague i hadnt exactly been overwhelmed with romantic interests either the closest thing to it id had of late had been the advances of a neophyte succubusand that contact had been anything but loving when sex becomes part of the equation the impact of anothers touch can be even more urgent and profoundso much so that good sense even basic logical deduction can go right out the window washed away in a flood of needs that simply must be met i hadnt been touched in a long time i hadnt been kissed in even longer given how likely it was that i was going to die before my next sunrise shielas presence her warmth the simple fact that she wanted to be touching me crowded out every worry and fear and i was glad to see them go shielas kiss freed me from pain and from feareven if only for a moment and i wanted to hold on to that moment for as long as i possibly could i tightened my grip on the kiss and my good arm rose sliding deliberately around the small of her back pulling her toward me shiela let out a hiss of sudden excitement but her kiss grew no deeper no swifter her mouth stayed in its gentle rhythm and i leaned harder into it myself her breath quickened still more but her kiss deepened only slowly maddeningly patient torturously gentle her hips shifted in slow tension against mine and i could feel the heat of her against me what i wanted to do was to reach up and haul down the sequined top i wanted my mouth to explore every sinuous curve of her i wanted to drive her mad with need to fill my senses with her warmth her cries her scent i wanted to forget everything arrayed against me even if it was just for a little while and bare her an inch at a time the emptiness that her warmth had begun to fill howled at me to let go but what i did was open my mouth and brush my tongue over her lips gently and slowly and only once she shivered at that touch and her teeth tugged delicately at my lower lip i drew the kiss to a slow quiet close and bowed my head so that my forehead rested against hers both of us remained like that for a minute breathing a little fast did you want to stop she whispered no i answered but i needed to why because you dont know me i said did you want me to stop no she said but i needed you to you dont know me either then why kiss me i asked i i heard a touch of something like embarrassment in her voice its been a long time for me since ive kissed anyone i didnt realize how much ive missed it same here her fingers stirred lightly touching the sides of my face you seem so alone i just wanted to know what it was like just the kiss before anything else gets involved thats reason enough i agreed what did you think of it she made a low sound in her throat i think i want more mmmm i said agreeing that works for me she let out a quiet wicked little laugh good she shivered again and then drew away from me dark eyes bright still breathing fast enough to make her chest absolutely mesmerizing she stood up smiling is there anything else i can do to help you grab my staff for me she arched a brow i felt my cheeks flush uh the literal staff oh she said and passed it to me she watched me with quiet concern as i heaved myself to my feet but she made no move to help me for which my ego was entirely grateful i hobbled over to her door and she walked beside me i turned to her and touched her cheek with my right hand she leaned her face against my palm just a little and smiled up at me thank you i told her youre a lifesaver probably literally she looked down and nodded all right be careful ill try i told her try hard she said id like to see you again soon okay ill survive but only because you asked she laughed and i smiled and then i left her in her apartment and started back down the stairs to the street going down was a lot harder than going up had been i made it to the third floor before i had to stop for a breather and i sat down to rest my aching leg for a moment so i was panting and sitting flat on my ass when the air in front of me wavered and a dark hooded figure stepped forward from out of nowhere one hand extended some sort of fine mesh that covered her outstretched palm flickering with ugly purple light be very still dresden kumori said her voice soft if you try to move ill kill you chapter twentynine kumori stood about four feet from meeasily within reach of my staff if i wanted to strike at her but since i was sitting down and had only one strong hand to swing the staff i wouldnt be able to hit hard enough to disable her even if i somehow managed to hit her before she unleashed the power she was holding in her hand and besides she was a girl unless she proved herself to be some kind of monstrous thing that just looked like a girl i wasnt going to hit her on some rational level i knew my attitude was dangerously illogical but that didnt change anything i dont hit girls i had the feeling she was quick enough to beat me as she stood over me with the magical equivalent of a cocked and readied gun sparkling through the metal mesh over her right palm i could feel the air vibrating with a low steady note of power and her stance was both confident and wary one thing i was pretty sure ofshe was here to talk if shed wanted to kill me she could have done it already so i stayed sitting set my staff aside very slowly and mildly raised both hands take it easy there cowgirl i said you got me dead to rights i couldnt see her face within the depths of the hood but i heard a dry note of amusement in her voice take off the bracelet please and the ring on your right hand i arched a brow the ring was spent and probably didnt have enough juice left in it to push her back a step but id never run into anyone who had noticed it before whoever she was kumori knew how wizards operated and it made me even more sure that she was hiding her face because she was someone i might recognizesomeone on the white council i slipped the bracelet off my left hand and lowered it slowly to the stair beside me but getting that ring off was going to be problematic i cant get the ring off i said why not kumori asked fingers on my left hand dont work anymore i said what happened i blinked at her for a second the question had been polite in fact if i didnt know any better id have taken her tone for actual interest what happened to your left hand she asked her tone patient i answered her as politely as i could while staring at her trying to figure her out i was fighting vampires there was a fire burned my hand so bad the doctors wanted to take it off theres no way i can get the ring off unless you want to come over here and take it yourself she was still for a moment then she said it might be easier if you would agree to a truce for the duration of this conversation are you willing to give your word on it she wanted a truce which meant that she had indeed come to talk rather than to execute me there sure as hell wouldnt be any harm in agreeing to a truce and it might prevent hostilities that could be triggered by raw nerves in exchange for yours i said this conversation and half an hour after its conclusion done kumori said you have my word and you have mine i said she lowered her hand at once taking the odd mesh over it and its sparkling energies into the deep sleeves of her robe i didnt take my eyes off her as i reclaimed my shield bracelet and fixed it back onto my wrist all right i said what did you want to talk about the book she said we still want your copy youll have to talk to the corpsetaker i said he and his ghoul took it from me last night but if you go looking he looks like a girl in her early twenties great dimples the hood shifted as though kumori had tilted her head to one side you know of the source of the corpsetakers name i figure hes a body switcher i said ive heard necromancers can do that kind of thing move their consciousness from one body to another exchange with some poor sucker who cant protect themselves corpsetaker was in that old professors body i figure he swapped with his assistant and then killed the old mans body with the girls mind inside the hood nodded conceding me the point but i have difficulty believing your story had the corpsetaker taken the book from you he would have killed you as well wasnt for lack of trying i said and gestured at my leg he was overconfident and i was a little bit lucky he got the book but i got away she was silent for a moment and then said her voice thoughtful youre telling me the truth im bad at lying lies get all confusing cant keep them straight kumori nodded then let me make you this offer join or die i guessed she exhaled softly through her nose hardly cowl has a certain amount of respect for you but he believes you too raw to make some sort of alliance feasible ah i said then youll probably go to the second offer i always get go away and you wont kill me something like that kumori said you have no real idea of what is going on here your ignorance is more dangerous than you know and your continued involvement in this matter could cause disastrous consequences what do you want me to do i asked withdraw from the field she said or what or you will regret it she said that isnt a threat simply a fact as i said cowl has a certain respect for you but he will not be able to protect you or treat you gently should you continue to involve yourself if you stand in his way he will kill you he would prefer it if you stood clear gosh thats so altruistic of him i shook my head if he kills me hell have my death curse to contend with he has already contended with such curses kumori said many times i advise you to retire from the field i cant do that i said i know what you people are doing i know about the darkhallow i know why youre doing it and and i cant let that happen i said insurance in chicago is expensive enough without adding in a petulant new deity tearing up the real estate our goals are not so different kumori said grevane and the corpsetaker are madmen they must be stopped from what ive seen of old cowl hes a couple of french fries short of a happy meal too and you would do what kumori asked prevent them from reaping the bounty of the darkhallow take the power for yourself i want to make sure nobody takes it i said i dont particularly care how i get it done truly she asked i nodded now heres where i make you an offer she hesitated clearly taken off guard very well bail i told her leave cowl and the sociopath squad to their squabbling give me what information i need to stop them hed kill me in a day she said no i told her id take you to the white council id get you protection she stared at me from within her hood utterly silent see kumori youre sort of a puzzle i said because youre working with these necromancers in fact im willing to bet you arent bad at necromancy yourself but you went out of your way to save someones life the other night and that just doesnt jive with that crowd doesnt it she said no theyre killers good at it but theyre just killers they wouldnt take a step out of their way to help someone else but you went way the hell out of your way to help a stranger it says that you arent like them she was silent for a moment more then she said do you know why cowl has made a study of necromancy and why i have joined him no because necromancy embraces the power of death just as magic embraces the power of life and as magic can be twisted and perverted to cruel and destructive ends necromancy can be turned upon its nature as well death can be warded off as i did for the wounded man that night life can be served by that dark power if ones will and purpose are strong uh huh i said you got involved with the darkest and most corruptive insanitycausing forces in the universe so that you could jumpstart wounded bodies to life she moved her hand a sudden slashing motion no no you idiot dont you see the potential here the possibility to end death uh end death you will die she said i will die cowl will die everyone now walking this tired old world knows but one solid immutable fact their life will end yours mine everyones yeah i said thats why they call us mortals because of the mortality why she asked what why she repeated why must we die because thats the way it is i said why must that be the way it is she said why must we all live with that pain of separation with horrible grief with rage and loss and sorrow and vengeance ruling the lives of every soul beneath the sky what if we could change it change it i said my skepticism clear in my voice change death yes she said just poof make it go away what if we could she said can you imagine what it would mean if mere age would not lay mankind low after his threescore and ten how much better would the world be can you imagine if da vinci had continued to live to study to paint to invent that the remarkable accomplishments of his lifetime could have continued through the centuries rather than dying in the dim past can you imagine going to see beethoven in concert taking a theology class taught by martin luther attending a symposium hosted by albert einstein think dresden it boggles the mind i thought about it and she was right supposing for half a second that what she said might be possible it would mean hell it would change everything there would be so much more time and for everyone wizards lived for three or even four centuries and to them even their own lives seemed short what kumori was talking about the end of death itself would give everyone else the same chance to better themselves that wizards enjoyed it would in a single stroke create more parity between wizards and the rest of mankind than any single event in history but that was insane setting out to conquer death people died that was a fact of life but what if they didnt have to what if my mother hadnt died or my father how different would my life be today impossible you couldnt just drive death away could you maybe that wasnt the point maybe this was one of those things in which the effort meant more than the outcome i mean if there was a chance even a tiny teeny chance that kumori was right and that the world could be so radically changed wouldnt i be obliged to try even if i never reached the goal never finished the quest wouldnt the attempt to vanquish death itself be a worthy pursuit wow this question was a big one way bigger than me i shook my head and told kumori i dont know about that what i know is that ive seen the fruits of that kind of path i saw cowl try to murder me when i got in his way ive seen what grevane and the corpsetaker have done ive heard about the suffering and misery kemmler causedand is still causing today thanks to his stupid book i dont know about something as big as trying to murder death but i know that you can tell a tree from what kind of fruit falls off it and the necromancy tree doesnt drop anything that isnt rotten ours is a calling kumori said her voice flat a noble road i might be willing to believe you if so much of that road wasnt paved in the corpses of innocents i saw her head shake slowly beneath the hood you sound like them the council you do not understand or maybe im just not quite arrogant enough to start rearranging the universe on the assumption that i know better than god how long life should last and theres a downside to what youre saying too how about trying to topple the regime of an immortal napoleon or attila or chairman mao you could as easily preserve the monsters as the intellectual allstars it can be horribly abused and that makes it dangerous i faced her down for a long and silent second then she let out a sigh and said i think we have exhausted the possibilities of this conversation you sure i asked her the offer is still open if you want to get out ill get the council to protect you our offer is open as well stand aside and no rancor will follow you i cant i said nor can i she said understand that i do not wish you any particular harm but i will not hesitate to strike you down should you place yourself in our path i stared at her for a second then i said im going to stop you im going to stop you and cowl and grevane and corpsetaker and your little drummers too none of you are going to promote yourself to godhood no one is i think you will die she said her tone even without inflection maybe i said but im going to stop you all before i go tell cowl to get out of the way now and i wont hunt him down after all of this is over he can walk you too she shook her head again and said im sorry we could not work something out yeah i said she hesitated then she asked me her voice soft and genuinely curious why because this is what i have to do i said im sorry you arent going to let me help you we all act as we think we must she said i will see you by and by dresden count on it i said kumori left without another word gliding silently down the stairs and out of sight i sat there for a moment aching and tired and more scared than i had sounded a minute before then i got up shoved my pain and my fear aside and hobbled out to the blue beetle i had work to do chapter thirty i went back to my car got in and headed out to find a few things i would need to make the summoning of the erlking marginally less suicidal serious summoning spells have to be personalized both to the entity to be summoned and to the summoner and it took me a little while to find enough open businesses to get it all traffic on the streets grew steadily worse as the afternoon wore on slowing me down even further more ominous than that the tenor of the city had begun to slowly steadily change what had been an atmosphere of bemused enjoyment of an unanticipated holiday from the daily grind had turned into annoyance as the sun tracked across the sky and the power still hadnt come back on annoyance started turning into anger by high noon there were police visible on every street in cars on motorcycles on bicycles and on foot that all for ya asked an enterprising vendor he was a potbellied balding gardener selling fresh fruit and vegetables from the back of a pickup on a corner and he was the only one id seen who wasnt trying to gouge chicagoans in their moment of trial he put the pumpkin id chosen in a thin plastic bag as he did and took the money i offered him thats everything i said thanks shouting broke out somewhere nearby and i looked up to see a whipthin young man sprinting down the sidewalk across the street a pair of cops chased him one of them shouting at his uselessly squealing radio christ look at that the vendor said cops everywhere why do they need the cops everywhere if this is just a power outage theyre probably just worried about someone starting a riot i said maybe the vendor said but i hear some crazy things like what i asked he shook his head that terrorists blew up the power plant or maybe set off some kind of nuke they can disrupt electronics and stuff you know i think someone might have noticed a nuclear explosion i said oh sure he said but hell maybe somebody did practically no phones radio is damned near useless how would we know i dunno the big boom the vaporized city the vendor snorted true true but something happened yeah i said something happened and the whole damned city is getting scared the vendor shook his head as more shouting broke out farther down the block a police car lights and sirens wailing tried to bull through the traffic to move toward the disturbance without much success getting worse the vendor observed this morning it was all smiles but people are getting afraid halloween i said the vendor glanced at me and shivered maybe thats part of it maybe just because its getting darker clouding over people get spooked sometimes just like cattle if they dont get the lights on tonight might be bad here maybe i said i juggled the bag with my staff trying to work out how to carry them both back down the street to the beetle here said the vendor ill help you son thank you i told him though to be honest i felt embarrassed that i actually wanted his help much less needed it that old bug there he walked the fifty feet down the sidewalk with me he dropped off the sack in the frontend trunk of the vw nodded at me and said about time i got my old self out of here anyway i think getting tense around here thunderstorms coming in newspaper weatherman said it was supposed to be clear i said the vendor snorted and tapped his nose i lived around this old lake all my life theres a storm coming boy was there in spades he nodded to me you should get home good night to stay in and read a book that sounds nice i agreed thanks again i nudged the beetle out into traffic by virtue of being more willing to accept a fenderbender than anyone else on the road i had everything i needed to try to whistle up the erlking but it had eaten up a lot of my day id tried to call murphys place every time id stopped the car but i never got a line through to thomas and butters and now with the afternoon sun burning its way down toward the horizon i had run out of daylight it was time to rendezvous with the wardens so i headed for mcanallys macs tavern was tucked in neatly beneath one tall building and surrounded by others you had to go down an alley to get to the tavern but at least it had its own dinky parking lot i managed to find a spot in the lot and then limped down the alley to the tavern taking the short flight of steps down to the heavy wooden door i opened the door onto a quiet buzz of activity in times of supernatural crisis mcanallys became a sort of functional headquarters for gossip and congregation i understood why the tavern was old lit by a dozen candles and kerosene lamps and smelled of wood smoke and the steaks mac cooked for his heavenly steak sandwiches there was a sense of security and permanence to the place thirteen wooden pillars each one handcarved with all manner of supernatural scenes and creatures held up the low ceiling ceiling fans that normally turned in lazy circles were not moving now thanks to the power outage but the actual temperature of the bar was unchanged there were thirteen tables scattered out irregularly around the room and thirteen stools at the long bar the whole layout of the place was meant to disperse and divert dangerous or destructive energies that might accompany any grouchy wizard types into the tavernnothing major it was just a kind of wellplanned feng shui that cut down on the number of accidents badtempered practitioners of the arts might inadvertently inspire but that dispersal of energies did a little something to ward off larger magical forces as well it wasnt going to protect the place from a concentrated magical attack mcanallys wasnt a bomb shelter it was more like a big beach umbrella and when i came through the door i felt a sudden relief of pressure i hadnt realized had built up the minute i shut the door behind me some of the fear and tension faded the dark energies cowl had stirred up sliding around the tavern like a stream pouring around a small heavy stone a sign on the wall just inside the door proclaimed accorded neutral territory that meant that the signatories of the unseelie accords including the white council and the red court had agreed that this place would be treated with respect no one was supposed to start any kind of conflict inside the tavern and would be bound by honor to take outside any fight that did come up as rapidly as possible that kind of agreement was only as good as the honor of anyone involved but if i broke the accords in the building the white council would hang me out to dry from past experience i assumed that the red court would come down on any of their folk who violated the taverns neutrality in the same way the tavern was crowded with members of the supernatural community of chicago they werent wizards most of them had only a pocketful of ability one darkbearded man had enough skill at kinetomancy to alter the spin on any dice he happened to throw an elderly woman at another table had an unusually strong rapport with animals and was active in municipal animal shelter charities a pair of darkhaired sisters who shared an uncanny mental bond played chess at one of the tables which seemed kind of masturbatory somehow in one of the corners five or six wizened old practitionersnot strong enough to have joined the council but competent enough in their own righthuddled together over mugs of ale speaking in low tones mac himself glanced over his shoulder he was a tall spare man in a spotless white shirt and apron bald and good at it mac could have been any age between thirtyfive and fifty he pursed his lips upon seeing me turned back to his woodburning stove and quickly finished up a pair of steaks hed been cooking i started limping over to the bar and as i went the room grew quiet by the time i was there the uneven thump of my staff on the floor and the sizzling of the steaks were the only sounds mac i said someone vacated a stool and i nodded my thanks and sat down with a wince harry mac drawled he slipped his frying pan off the stove slapped both steaks onto plates and with a couple of gestures and brief movements made fried potatoes and fresh vegetables appear on the plates too it wasnt magic mac was just a damned good cook i glanced around the room and spoke in a voice loud enough for everyone to hear i need some space mac some people are meeting me here shortly ill need several tables a round of nervous whispers and quiet comments went through the crowd the old practitioners in the corner rose from their table without further ado several of them nodded at me and one grizzled old man growled good luck the less experienced members of the supernatural crowd looked from me back to the departing seniors uncertainty on every face folks i said in general i cant tell you what to do but i would like to request that you all think about getting home before dark come nightfall you want to be behind a threshold whats happening blurted one of the youngest men in the room he still had pimples mac eyed him and snorted come on im a wizard we have union rules against telling anybody anything i said there was a round of muted chuckles seriously i cant say any more for now i said and i couldnt odds were better than good that one or more spies lurked among the patrons of the tavern and the less information they had about white council plans and activities the better take this seriously guys you dont want to be outside come nightfall mac turned around to the bar and swept his eyes over it his expression polite and pointed he grunted and flicked his chin at the door and the noise from the room rose again as people began speaking quietly to one another getting up and leaving money on the tables as they left two minutes later mac and i were the only people left in the tavern mac walked around the edge of the bar and sat down next to me he put one steakladen dinner plate on the bar in front of me kept the other for himself and added a couple of bottles of his homebrewed dark ale mac flipped the tops off with a thumbnail bless your soul mac i said and picked up one bottle i held it up mac clinked his bottle of ale against mine and then we both took a long drink and fell to on the steaks we ate in silence after a while mac asked bad pretty bad i said i debated how much i could tell him mac was a good guy and a longterm acquaintance and friend but he wasnt council screw it the man gave me steak and a beer he deserved to know something more than that there was a threat he probably couldnt do anything about necromancers macs fork froze on the way to his mouth he shook his head put his last bite of steak into his mouth and chewed slowly mac never used a sentence when one word would do wardens yeah a lot of them he pursed his lips with a frown kemmler he said i arched an eyebrow but i wasnt really surprised that he knew the infamous necromancers name mac always seemed to have a pretty darned good idea about what was going on not kemmler his leftovers but thats bad enough ungh mac finished up his plate in rapid order then rose and started collecting money and clearing the tables in the corner farthest from the door at some point he collected my barren plate and empty bottle and put a fresh ale down in front of me i sipped at it watching him he didnt make a production of it but he checked the shortbarreled shotgun he kept on a clip behind the bar and put a pair of s in unobtrusive spots behind the bar so that no matter where he stood one of the weapons would be within easy reach he handled them like he knew exactly what he was doing i sipped at the ale and mused i knew little of macs background hed opened the tavern a few years before id moved to chicago no one id talked to knew where hed been before that or what he had done i wasnt surprised that he knew something about weapons hed always moved like someone who could handle himself but since he wasnt exactly a chatterbox most of what i knew came from observation i hadnt the faintest idea of why or where hed learned the business of violence i could respect that i had run through few bad patches that were just as well left behind and forgotten mac looked up abruptly and started polishing the bar near the shotguns clip a second later the door opened and a warden of the white council came in he was a tall man six feet and then some and built with the solidity of an aging soldier his lank hair had more grey in it than i remembered and was drawn back into a ponytail his face was narrow almost pinched and in the absence of any other expression he looked like he had just taken a big bite of alumsprinkled lemon rind the warden wore the grey cloak of his office over black fatigues he carried a carved staff in his right hand and bore a longbladed sword on his left hip that much i had expected what surprised me was how battered he looked the wardens cloak was ripped in several spots and stained with what could have been mud blood and greenish motor oil there were burn marks along the hem and several raw ragged holes in it that might have been the results of corrosive burns his staff looked similarly nicked and stainedand the man himself looked like a boxer after a tough tenth round he had bruises on one cheek his nose had been broken sometime in the past several weeks there was an ugly line of fresh scarlet scar tissue running from his hairline to one eyebrow and i could see white bandages through a hole in his jacket over his left biceps for all of that he came through the door like a man who knew he could clear out a bar full of marines if he needed to and his eyes settled on me at once his mouth twisted into an even more sour frown wizard dresden he said quietly warden morgan i responded i figured morgan would be along with any wardens sent to chicago it was in his area of responsibility and he didnt like me hed spent a few years following me around hoping to catch me performing black magic so that he could execute me it hadnt happened and the council had lifted my probation i dont think he had ever forgiven me for that he blamed me for other things too i think but i had always figured they were just excuses some people dont get along ever morgan and i were two of them mcanally morgan said to the tavern keeper donald mac replied interesting hell id been on the council for years and i hadnt known morgans first name dresden morgan said have you checked for veils if i told you i had youd check it yourself anyway morgan i said so i didnt bother of course you didnt he said i saw him frown a little in concentration and then his eyes went a bit out of focus he swept his gaze around the room using his sight that odd halfsurreal sense that lets wizards observe the forces of magic moving around them a wizards sight cuts through all kinds of veils and spells meant to disguise and distract its a potent ability but it comes at a price anything you see through the sight stays with you never fading in your memory always right there for recall as if youd just seen it you cant just forget something that you see its there for life morgan didnt let his gaze linger too long near mac or myself and then he nodded to himself and called out clear the door opened and warden luccio came in she was a solid old matriarch of a woman as tall as most men and built like someone who did plenty of physical labor her hair was a solid shade of iron grey cropped into a neat military cut she too wore a wardens grey cloak though she wore clothes suitable for hiking or camping beneath that jeans cotton flannel boots all in muted tones of grey and brown she too carried a staff and bore a sword at her side though hers was a slender scimitar light and elegant though not as worn as morgans her gear also showed evidence of recent action warden luccio i said and rose from the bar stool to incline my head to her wizard she said quietly i would have needed a highspeed camera to take in the details of her smile but at least it was there she nodded to me and then a little more deeply to mac behind her came three more wardens the first was a young man i vaguely recognized from a council meeting a few years back he had naturally tanned skin dark hair dark eyes and sharpedged classically spanish features i remembered him in an apprentices brown robe back then and covering his mouth with one hand to conceal a grin inspired by some of my dialogue with the councils bigwigs the brown robe was gone and he looked like he had filled in a little since id first seen him but good lord he was younger than billy the werewolf he wore a grey cloak that looked reasonably clean and not at all damaged and black fatigues beneath that a simple straight sword hung from one hip and was balanced on the other side by a holstered glock and i kid you not three round fragmentation grenades his staff was fairly newlooking but there were enough dents and nicks in it to make me think he had kept things from hitting him with it and he walked with a kind of arrogant confidence you see only in people who have not yet realized their own mortality this is warden ramirez luccio said ramirez dresden hows it going ramirez said flashing me a grin i shrugged you know pretty much the usual two more wardens came in behind him and they looked even younger and greener their cloaks and staves were immaculate and they wore clothes and equipment so similar to ramirezs that they qualified as a uniform luccio introduced the blocky young man with distant haunted eyes as kowalski the sweetfaced young asian girls name was yoshimo i limped over to luccio and nodded at the tables mac had set up i hope theres room enough when are the other wardens arriving luccio fixed me with a quiet weary gaze then she drew her hands from beneath her cloak and held out a folded bundle wrapped in brown paper offering it to me take it i took the bundle and unwrapped it it was a folded grey cloak put it on said luccio in her quiet steady voice and then every available warden will be here chapter thirtyone i stared at luccio for a second thats a joke i said right she gave me a brief bitter smile master mcanally she said to mac i think we could use a round do you have anything decent to drink mac grunted and said got a new dark is it worth drinking luccio asked she sounded tired but there was a teasing tone to her voice mac glowered at her in answer and she gave him a smile that was part challenge and part apology and took a seat at one of the tables she gestured at the table and said wardens please join me morgan took the seat to luccios right and the look he gave me could have burned holes in sheet metal i did what i always did when morgan did that i eyed him right back then dismissed him as if he werent even there i pulled out the chair opposite luccio and sat the two youngest wardens sat down but ramirez stayed standing until mac had brought over bottles of his dark ale and left them on the table he headed back over to the bar ramirez glanced at luccio and she nodded close the circle please warden the young man drew a piece of chalk from his pocket and quickly drew a heavy line on the floor all the way around the table he finished the circle then touched it lightly with the forefinger of his right hand and spoke a quiet word i felt a flicker of his will as he released a tiny bit of power into the circle the circle closed around us in a sudden silent tension raising a thin barrier around us that was almost entirely impregnable to magical forces if anyone had been trying to spy on the meeting with magic the circle would prevent it if anyone had left some kind of listening device nearby the magicsaturated air within the circle would be certain to fry it within a minute ramirez nodded to himself and then reversed the last open chair at the table and straddled it resting one arm on the back morgan slid him the last bottle of ale and he took it in one hand absent friends luccio murmured holding up her bottle i could get behind that toast the rest of us muttered absent friends and we had a drink and luccio stared at her bottle for a moment i waited in the pregnant silence and then said so making me a warden thats a joke right luccio took a second slower taste of the ale and then arched an eyebrow at the bottle behind the bar again mac smiled its no joke warden dresden luccio said as much as we all would like it to be morgan added luccio gave him a look of very gentle reproof and morgan subsided into silence how much have you heard about recent events in the war nothing in the past several days i said not since my last checkin she nodded i thought as much the red court has begun a heavy offensive this is the first time that theyve concentrated their efforts on disrupting our communications we suspect that a great many wizards never received word through our usual messengers then they found weaknesses in the communications lines i said but they waited to exploit them until it would hurt us the most luccio nodded precisely the first attack came in cairo at our operations center there several wardens were taken including the senior commander of the region alive i asked she nodded yes which was an unacceptable threat when vampires take you alive it isnt so that they can treat you to ice cream that was one of the really nightmarish facets of the war with the red court if the enemy got you they could do worse than kill you they could make you one of their own if they managed to turn a warden especially one of the senior commanders it would give them access to a treasury of knowledge and secretsto say nothing of the fact that they would effectively gain in many ways a wizard of their own vampires didnt use magic in the same way that mortal wizards did they tapped into the same nauseating well of power that kemmler and those like him used but from what i understood of it the skills carried over a turned wizard would be a deadly threat to the wardens the council and mortals alike we never talked about it but there was a sort of silent understanding among wizards that we would never be taken alive and an equally silent fear that we might be you went after them i guessed luccio nodded a major assault madrid sao paolo acapulco athens we struck at enemy strongholds there to acquire intelligence to the whereabouts of the prisoners our people were being held in belize she waved a hand vaguely at morgan our intelligence indicated the presence of the highestranking members of the red court including the red king himself the merlin and the rest of the senior council took the field with us morgan said quietly that made me raise my brows the merlin the leader of the senior council was as defensiveminded as it was possible to be hed guided the white council into the equivalent of a cold war with the red court with everyone moving carefully and unwilling to commit in the hopes that it would give the war time to settle away into negotiations and some kind of diplomatic resolution an offensive action like a full assault from the senior council the seven oldest and strongest wizards on the planet had been long overdue what changed the merlins mind i asked quietly wizard mccoy luccio said when our people were taken he persuaded most of the senior council to take action including ancient mai and the gatekeeper that made sense my old mentor ebenezar mccoy was a member of the senior council he had a couple of longtime friends on the council but that didnt give him a majority vote if he wanted to get anything done he had to talk someone from the merlins bloc into casting their vote with himeither that or convince the gatekeeper a wizard who habitually abstained from voting to take a stand with him if ebenezar had convinced ancient mai and the gatekeeper to vote with him in favor of action the merlin would have little choice but to move and just because the merlin was a master of wards and defensive magic did not mean that he couldnt kick some ass if he needed to you dont get to be the merlin of the white council by collecting bottle caps and arthur langtry the current merlin was generally considered to be the most powerful wizard on earth i had seen for myself what ebenezar mccoy was capable of a couple of years ago he had pulled an old soviet satellite out of orbit and brought it down into the lap of duke ortega the warlord of the red court hed killed a ton of vampires in doing it hed also killed people hed taken the force of life and creation and used it to wipe out the lives of mortalsvictims of the red courts power and it wasnt the first time hed done it ebenezar id learned held an office that did not officially existthat of the white councils assassin known as the blackstaff he had a license to kill as well as to break the other laws of magic when he deemed it necessary when i learned that he was violating and undermining the same laws hed taught me to obey to believe in it had wounded me so deeply that in some ways i was still bleeding ebenezar had betrayed what i believed in but that didnt change the fact that the old man was the strongest wizard id ever seen in action and he was the youngest and least powerful of the senior council what happened i asked quietly there was no evidence of the presence of the red king or his entourage but other than that the attack went as planned morgan said we assaulted the vampires stronghold and took our people back with us luccios face twisted in sudden and bitter grief it was a lure i said quietly wasnt it yes she said quietly we moved out and took our wounded to the hospice in sicily what happened we were betrayed she said and her words carried more sharp edges than a sack of broken glass someone within our ranks must have reported our position to the red court they attacked us that night when was that i asked luccio frowned then glanced across the table at ramirez three days ago zulu time ramirez provided quietly ive not slept luccio said between that and all the travel i lose track she took another drink of ale and said the attack was vicious they were coming for the senior council and their sorcerers managed to cut us off from escaping into the nevernever for nearly a day we lost thirtyeight wardens that day in fighting all over sicily i sat there for a moment stunned thirtyeight stars and stones there were only about two hundred wardens on the council not every wizard had the kind of talent that made them dangerous in a facetoface confrontation most of those who did were wardens in a single day the red court had killed nearly percent of our fighting force they paid for it morgan rumbled quietly but they seemed almost mad to die in order to kill us driven i saw four different death curses unleashed that day i saw vampires climb over mounds of their own dead without so much as slowing down we must have taken twenty of their warriors for every loss of our own he closed his eyes and his sour face was suddenly masked with very real and very human grief they kept coming we had many wounded luccio said so many wounded as soon as the senior council was able to open the ways into the nevernever we retreated to the paths through faerie and we were pursued i sat up straight what morgan nodded the red court followed us into the territory of the sidhe he said they had to know i said quietly they had to know that by pressing the attack in faerie itself they would anger the sidhe theyve just declared war on summer and winter alike yes morgan said in a flat voice but it didnt stop them they attacked us as we retreated and he glanced at luccio as if in appeal she gave him a firm look and said to me they had called demons to assist them she inhaled slowly not simply beasts from the nevernever they had gone to the netherworld they had called outsiders i took a longer drink of macs ale outsiders demons were bad enough but they were at least something i was fairly familiar with the reaches of the nevernever the world of spirit and magic that surrounds the mortal world are filled with all kinds of beings most of them really dont give a damn about mortal affairs and we are nothing but a remote and unimportant curiosity to them when beings of the spirit world are interested in mortal business its for a good reason the ones who like to eat us hurt us or generally terrify us are what wizards commonly refer to as demons as a general term theyre bad enough outsiders though were so rarely spoken of that they were all but a rumor i wasnt really clear on all of the details but the outsiders had been the servants and foot soldiers of the old ones an ancient race of demons or gods who had once ruled the mortal world but who had apparently been cast out and locked away from our reality there was a specific law of magic against contacting themthou shalt not open the outer gates no one wanted to be the one suddenly suspected of opening ways for the outsiders to enter the mortal world the wardens absolutely did not play around with violations of the laws of magic their entire purpose in life was to protect the councilfirst from violators of the seven laws and then from everyone else i eyed the folded grey cloak on the table in front of me i thought only mortal magic could call up outsiders i said quietly luccio said quietly you are correct my stomach lurched a little someone had told the red court where to find the council someone had blocked off their escape route to the nevernever so strongly that the most powerful wizards on the planet had required a full day to open them again and someone had begun calling up outsiders in numbers sending them to attack the white council the council is not what it was cowl had said it has rotted from the inside it will fall soon the wardens fell back to fight a holding action against the red court so that our wounded could escape to safety luccio reported her crisp voice at odds with her weary eyes that was when they loosed the outsiders upon us we lost another twentythree wardens in the first moments of combat and many more were wounded there was silence while she took a long pull from her bottle emptying it then setting it down sharply on the table anger flickering in her eyes if senior council members mccoy and liberty had not come to our aid we might have all died there even with them we managed to hold them only long enough for the gatekeeper and the merlin to raise a ward behind us to give us time to escape a ward i blurted are you telling me that they stonewalled an entire army of vampires and demons with one ward you dont get to be merlin of the white council by collecting bottle caps ramirez said his voice dry i glanced aside at ramirez he grinned at me and swigged beer mccoy was injured luccio continued ramirez snorted who wasnt luccio snapped carlos he lifted a hand in surrender and settled back onto his chair again but his grin never faded there were many injuries luccio continued but as the hospice in sicily had been taken we diverted the worst cases to a hospital we control in the congo she stared at her bottle for a moment her mouth opened and then she closed it again she closed her eyes morgan frowned at her then he put a hand on luccios shoulder looked at me and said the vampires knew i got a sick twisting feeling in my stomach oh god it was daylight there morgan said and the place was a fortress of the merlins wards there was no way for the vampires to breach it from the nevernever and nothing short of a demon lord could have broken through them his mouth twisted and his eyes glittered with rage and hate they sent mortals against us against men and women lying injured unconscious helpless in their beds the anger in his voice seemed to strangle him for a moment but i said look i know what its like going up against mortals you dont want to kill its difficult but they can be stopped fought bullets and explosives can be defended against which is why they used gas ramirez said quietly stepping in where morgans and luccios voices had failed his own tone was serious his grin had vanished a nerve agent probably sarin they deployed it against the entire hospital the people we had protecting it and six square blocks of city around it he put his own bottle down and said no one survived my god i whispered there was dead silence ebenezar i asked in a whisper you said he was wounded was he ramirez shook his head stubborn old bastard wouldnt go to the hospital the young warden said he went with one of the teams staging a counteroffensive with the fellowship of saint giles thousands of innocent mortals died luccio said and there was a slow low snarl in her voice she kept it tightly leashed and under control but i heard it i recognized it and i knew what it was like to feel it permeating my words women children thousands and today i buried one hundred and fortythree wardens i sat there stunned in a single vicious stroke the red court had very nearly destroyed the white council they have crossed every line luccio said her voice quiet and precise violated every principle of war of our world and the mortal world alike madness they have gone mad theyve committed suicide i said quietly they dont have a prayer against the council and the faerie courts alike the sidhe were taken by surprise morgan rumbled they arent prepared for a fight and were holding on by our fingernails weve got less than fifty wardens capable of combat without our communications network in order members of the council have been attacked individually and by surprise we dont know how many more wizards have died and it gets even better ramirez said agents of the red court are haunting the ways through faerie we were attacked on the way here twice our priority luccio said voice crisp is to consolidate our forces and to draw upon every available resource to restore the wardens as a fighting force we must draw the members of the council together and make sure that they are protected were reorganizing our security she shook her head and frankly we must protect the lives of the senior council so long as they are concealed from the enemy and still able to take action they are a dangerous force together they wield more power than any hundred members of the council and it can be concentrated with deadly effect as the merlin showed in the nevernever so long as they stand ready to strike the enemy cannot openly unveil his full strength more important morgan growled the mortal wizards who betrayed us whoever they are fear the senior council that is why their first move was an attempt to destroy them luccio nodded if we can hold on until the faerie courts mobilize for action we can recover from this attack which brings us to today luccio said and studied me tired and frank every other warden able to fight is currently either engaged against the enemy or safeguarding the senior council our lines of support and communication are tenuous she gestured at those seated at the table this is every resource the white council has to spare i looked at the weary captain of the wardens at the battered morgan at ramirez who had reclaimed his cocky smile and at yoshimo and kowalski untried quiet and frightened warden luccio i said may i speak to you privately morgan scowled and said in a hot voice anything you have to say to her you can say to all luccio put her hand on morgans arm a gentle gesture but it cut him off morgan perhaps you would be so kind as to get me another bottle and im sure mcanally would be willing to provide us all with some dinner morgan stared at her for a second then at me then he rose smudged the chalk circle with a boot and broke the circle around the table releasing the buzzing tension from the air come on kids ramirez told the other two younger wardens rising we have to go sit with uncle morgan while the other adults have a serious talk he put a hand on my shoulder on the way past and squeezed hey bartender are those onion rings i smell i waited until they had all settled down at the far end of the bar and mac began to bring them some food then i turned to luccio and said i cant be a warden she studied me for a second and then asked in a very precise very polite voice and why not because you people have been threatening to kill me for doing something i didnt do since i was sixteen years old i said youre all convinced im some sort of hideous threat and every time you get the chance you try to make my life miserable luccio listened attentively and then said yes and and i said ive spent my entire adult life with the wardens looking over my shoulder waiting for a chance to accuse me of things i didnt do and trying to set me up and entrap me when you never found me doing anything luccios eyebrows shot up what dont give me that i said you know damned well that morgan tried to provoke me into attacking him just before we got the treaty with winter so he and the merlin would have an excuse to throw me to the vampires luccios eyes widened and her voice came out harder what she shot a look at morgan and then back at me are you telling me the truth there was some kind of cadence to the question that her words didnt usually have and on pure instinct i reached out with my senses i could feel a light tension in the air humming like the space between the tines of a tuning fork yes i told her the humming chime continued unabated im telling you the truth she stared at me for a long second and then settled back onto her chair the humming tension faded she folded her hands on the table frowning down at them then there were rumors of how morgan behaved around you but i thought that they were only that they werent i said morgan has threatened and persecuted me every time he got the chance i clenched my right hand into a fist and i have done nothing i wont become a part of that warden luccio so keep the cape i wouldnt polish my car with it she regarded her folded hands eyes narrow dresden she said quietly the white council is at war would you simply abandon your own people to the mercies of the red court would you stand aside and let kemmlers disciples have their way of course not i said and i never said i wouldnt fight but i wont be wearing this i shoved the cloak across the table keep it she shoved it back to the table before me put it on thank you no dresden luccio said and her voice was calm and agatehard it is not a request i dont respond well to threats i said then respond to reality she snapped dresden the wardens are all but shattered we need every battlecapable wizard we can recruit train or conscript a lot of wizards can fight i growled and they arent harry dresden she said you idiot dont you know what i am offering you yeah the chance to hunt down teenage kids who were never told the laws of magic and execute them for breaking them the chance to badger and intimidate and interrogate anyone who doesnt suit me neither of which i want anything to do with ebenezar said you were stubborn but not that you were a fool the council has been betrayed dresden and you are the most infamous wizard in it there are many who have spoken out against you many who say that you began the war with the red court intentionally so that you could create an opportunity to bring about the fall of the council i burst out in bitter laughter me thats insane for crying out loud i cant even balance my stupid checkbook luccios eyes softened a little and she sighed i believe you she shook her head but you have a reputation and the members of the council will be badly unsettled by this loss their fear could easily turn upon you that is why you are going to join the wardens i scowled i dont get it it is time to set our past differences aside if you wear the cloak of a warden and step in to fight when the council is in its hour of need it will make our people look at you differently i took a deep breath oh vader syndrome excuse me vader syndrome i said theres no ally so impressive encouraging and well loved as an ally who was an enemy that made you shake in your boots a couple of minutes ago theres more to it than that luccio said i think that you do not realize your own reputation you have overcome more enemies and battled more evils than most wizards a century your senior and times are changing there are more young wizards attaining membership to the council than ever beforelike ramirez and his companions there to them you are a symbol of defiance to the conservative elements of the council and a hero who will risk his life when his principles demand it i am you are luccio said i cant say that i approve of it but right now the council will need every scrap of courage and faith we can muster your presence and support in the face of a greater danger will appease your detractors and the presence of a wizard who has experience in battle will encourage the younger members of the council she grimaced put simply dresden we need you and you need us i rubbed at my eyes for a moment then i said lets say i do sign on im willing to wear the cloak im willing to fight for as long as the war is on but i wont move away from chicago there are people here who depend on me i glowered and i wont bow my head to morgan i dont want him within a hundred miles of my town luccio rubbed at her jaw and then nodded slowly her eyes thoughtful i have to reassign morgan in any case she nodded again more sharply then im conscripting you into the wardens as a regional commander i blinked youll be in charge of security and operations in this region and coordinate with the other three american regional commanders uh i said what does that mean that it will be your job to protect mortals in this area to be vigilant against supernatural threats in your region and represent the council in matters of diplomacy to aid and assist other wizards who come to you for aid and protection and when required to strike out at the enemies of the council such as the red court and their allies i frowned uh i pretty much do that anyway luccios face broke into the first genuinely warm smile id ever seen on her the care lines vanishing replaced with crowsfeet at the corners of her eyes so now youll do it in a grey cloak her expression sobered youre a fighter dresden if the white council is to survive we need more like you she pushed away from the table and walked over to the bar carrying our empty bottles with her when she came back i had just finished getting the cloak pin settled and draping the heavy soft grey fabric around my shoulders she stopped in front of me and looked me up and down for a moment ramirez glanced at me and his grin widened morgan looked and from his expression you would think someone had just shoved a knife into his testicles macs brow furrowed and he studied me in the cloak his lips quietly pursed thank you luccio said quietly and offered me an ale i accepted it with a nod we touched bottles and took a drink very well then commander luccio said her tone turning brisk and businesslike this is your territory and you have the most recent intelligence on kemmlers disciples what is our next step i shoved my hair back from my eyes and said okay warden luceuh captain luccio lets sit down and get to work its getting dark and we dont have much time chapter thirtytwo when i walked through the door of murphys house it was raining and i was still wearing the grey cloak i limped into the kitchen where thomas and butters and bob were sitting at a table with a bunch of candles paper pencils and empty cans of coors thomass jaw dropped open holy crap he said butters blinked at thomas and then at me uh what harry bob said orange eye lights glowing brightly you stole a wardens cloak i scowled at them and took the cloak off it dripped all over the kitchen floor i didnt steal it mouse came padding into the room tail wagging and i rubbed briefly at his ears oh bob said so you took it off a body no i said annoyed and settled onto a chair at the table i got drafted holy crap thomas said again i dont get it butters said harrys joined the wizard secret police bob burbled he gets to convict on suspicion and take justice into his own hands how cool is that thomas looked at me steadily and then at the door behind me then back to me im alone i said quietly relax he nodded what happened a lot i said there isnt time to cover it all now but the wardens are in town and im not so worried about them crawling all over and finding out everyones secrets why not thomas asked because at the moment all five of them are at a hotel downtown getting showers and changing bandages while i try to come up with more information about the heirs of kemmler thomas blinked slowly all five and they have wounded i nodded my lips pressed hard together wow thomas said quietly how bad is it they drafted me i said thats bad all right bob said cheerfully i looked at the scattered papers and books on the table tell me you guys came up with something butters blinked a few times and then started fumbling at the papers on the table peering at them in the candlelight uh well theres good news and bad news bad first i said im going to need the pickmeup afterward weve got nothing on those numbers butters said i mean they arent a code theyre too short they could be an address or an account number but none of the banks we could get on the phone use that number of digits he coughed apologetically if i could have gotten on the net i could have gotten you a lot more but he gestured uselessly around the room we couldnt get one call in fifty to go through and at most of the places we called no one answered and in the past hour the phones have gone out altogether i shook my head yeah citys going insane too there were two fires between here and mcanallys some kind of riot going in bucktown i heard on a police radio the governor has asked for help from the national guard thomas said quietly theyre sending troops in to keep order on the streets i blinked how did you find that out i called my sister he said i frowned i thought lara wasnt speaking with you thomass voice went dry just because she cut me off from the familys money kicked me out of any of our holdings made it clear that i no longer have their protection and shes holding the woman i love as a virtual prisoner dont think she doesnt still like me personally so she did you a little favor i said technically thomas said she did you a little favor why did she do that i asked well i hinted about how since her entire power base depended on a certain secret being kept and since you were awfully irrational about protecting the good citizens of chicago that you might develop loose lips to sink her ship if she didnt help you in your moment of need urn i said so youre telling me that i just engaged in blackmail against the ruler of the white court by proxy yeah thomas said youve got some great big brass balls on you to do something like that harry i guess i do i shook my head why did i do that because we needed help thomas said we were getting nowhere fast laras got a ton of resources available to her and a lot of manpower she was able to come up with some of the other information we needed which is the good news butters said she wasnt blacked out and cut off from the internet like we are and she was able to get a bunch of information we couldnt he passed me a piece of paper not on the numbersbut one of her people was able to find out about native american artifacts and weapons here in chicago i looked up sharply at butters yeah he nodded at the paper and i read over it yep he said the native american center is using their facility to host this big display on tribal hunting and warfare before all of us palefaces showed up with guns and smallpox the history channel is using it as a part of some historyofwarfare special and they were filming there all last week yeah i said that could have some old hunter spirits attached to it i read over the list dammit i should have remembered this myself the field museum has that big cahokian artifacts exhibit that professor bartlesby was in charge of hell it was a bunch of indian artifacts that corpsetaker helped assemble himself probably with tonight in mind butters nodded and the mitchell museum up in evanston has got more native american artifacts than either one put together crap i said thats it how do you know that butters asked it only stands to reason bob supplied the whole point is to summon up as many old spirits as possible and then consume them the most spirits are going to be attracted to wherever there is the most old junk i nodded i remember this place now that museums on a college campus right kendall college butters confirmed college campus on halloween night thomas said hell of a place for a gang of necromancers to slug it out theres going to be collateral damage no there isnt i said and i was surprised how vicious my own voice sounded because were going to stop this stupid summoning and then were going to hunt those murderous bastards down and kill them there was dead silence in the kitchen thomas and butters both stared at me expressions apprehensive maybe its the cloak bob suggested brightly harry do you feel any more judgmental and selfrighteous than you did this morning i took a slow and deep breath sorry i said sorry that came out kinda harsh maybe a little butters said his voice all but a whisper i rubbed at my face and glanced at the batterypowered clock on the wall of murphys kitchen okay sundowns in just over an hour i have to be ready to call up the erlking by then um thomas said harry if its the erlkings presence thats going to attract all of these old spirits to their old tools and stuff then wont it do the same thing no matter who calls him up yeah i said unless the one who calls him traps him in a circle to contain his power and leaves him there bob made a spluttering sound harry thats a dangerous proposition no scratch that its an insane proposition even assuming you have the will to trap something like the erlking in a circle and even if you keep him there all night he is not going to let that kind of insult go hell come back the next night and kill you if youre lucky i can worry about that after ive done it i said wait butters said wait wait i mean will it really matter these guys dont have the bad magic book right without that book all they can do is call up the spirits they cant you know eat them right we cant assume that they dont have it i said grevane might have found it but the other two couldnt right butters said even if they havent theyll still be there i said they cant afford to assume that their rivals havent gotten the book so theyre going to show up with everything they have to try to prevent one of the others from going through with the ritual why butters asked because they hate each other i said and if one of them goes all godly hes going to enjoy crushing the others it will probably be the first thing he does oh butters said thats why i need you to do something for me thomas my brother nodded name it i grabbed a blank piece of paper and a pencil and started writing this is a note i want you to take it down to the address im writing down and get it to the wardens im not going anywhere close to the wardens thomas said you dont have to i said theyre at a hotel youll leave it at the desk and ask the clerk to take it to them then clear out fast are they going to trust a note thomas asked skeptical i told them to expect a messenger if i couldnt get there myself they know about the erlking that im trying to sidetrack him they need to know where the heirs of kemmler are going to be so that they can take them down five of them thomas said quietly theyll be outnumbered by one i grimaced it would be worse than that ramirez had looked like he could handle himself but the two rookies couldnt have stood up to any of the heirs or their companions from what id seen once ive secured the erlking ill be along as quick as i can besides that theyre wardens i said theyll take down kemmlers flunkies or die trying thomas said he grimaced how should i get down there i went to another kitchen drawer and rummaged in it until i found murphys spare keys i tossed them to thomas here her motorcycle is in the shed right he said but his expression was wary she going to mind me stealing her bike its in a good cause i told him the streets are bad and the wardens need to get moving soonest go thomas nodded pocketed the keys and shrugged into his leather jacket ill get back here as soon as im done yeah i said quietly thomas to the wardens youre nothing but a white court vampire if they see you theyll be out for blood i understand he said his voice was a little bitter if im not back in time harry good luck he offered his hand and we traded grips hard my hand must have been cold with nerves because his felt warm then he let go of my hand nodded to bob and butters and headed out into the rain a minute later murphys harley grumbled in the backyard and then purred off into the rain and gloom i sat there in silence for a minute then got up and went to the stove i got the teapot out filled it up and put it on the gas burner to boil it took me a minute to find murphys collection of teas and it was gratuitously complex i mean come on how many different types of tea do you really need maybe im prejudiced because i take my tea with so much sugar that the actual flavor is sort of an aftertaste i found some in instant bags that smelled vaguely minty tea i asked butters sure he said i got out two cups whats next he asked hot tea i said staying warm then i go out in the rain and call up the erlking youre staying inside while i do why he asked because its going to be dangerous well yeah he said but why inside the house i mean this supergoblin can just rip the walls apart right strong enough to do it probably i said but it cant the house is protected by its threshold butters looked at me blankly which means what i leaned a hip on the counter and explained a threshold is a kind of energy that surrounds a home its i frowned thinking how to explain it its sort of like the home has a positive charge to it if outside magic wants to come in it has to neutralize that charge first big tough things from the nevernever need a lot of power just to stay in our world they dont usually have enough to take out a threshold and still have enough juice to be dangerous its like that vampire thing he asked they cant come in if you dont invite them pretty much yeah if you invite something in your threshold wont affect it but other magical beings and energy have trouble with it its a solid defense didnt help your place much butters observed my place is a rental apartment i said and except for the past several months its been just me living there doesnt give it the same kind of energy as youd find in a longestablished home oh is that what they mean by safe as houses then i smiled a little a house doesnt make a home when the place has got history family emotions worries joys worked into the wood thats when it gets a solid threshold this house has been in the murphy clan for better than a hundred years and lived in for every one of them its solid youll be safe in here but its not going to get loose once you call it up butters said right thats the plan but even if it did you arent the one who is going to piss it off there wont be any reason for it to come after you oh good he said he blinked at me and said apologetically not that i want it to come after you harry i dont blame you i said butters nodded why zombies he asked huh sorry changing topics new question why do all these necromancer types use zombies not all of them do i pointed out corpsetaker had called up a bunch of semicorporeal ghosts specters but human butters said zombies look human specters look human why not whistle up a pack of decayed rats or maybe semicorporeal mosquitos why use people oh i said its got to do with a kind of metaphysical impression that any given creature leaves upon its death sort of like a footprint human beings leave larger footprints than most animals which means that you can pour more energy into reanimating them they make stronger goons butters clarified yes how come grevane had fresh corpses when he came to get me but he attacked your house with old ones i mean i saw those things up close he shivered some of them must have dated back to the beginning of the twentieth century same reason they animate humans instead of animals i said older corpses leave a deeper metaphysical imprint theyre harder to call up but once you get them here theyre easier to control stronger more difficult to damage old corpses get you stronger undead flunkies he said right i said i could see the wheels turning in butterss head as he processed the information he looked like he was busy lining up dozens more questions spawned by the answers to the first few and i had a feeling he would pursue them with relentless curiosity okay but what if butters i said as gently as i could not now all i want to do is have a quiet cup of tea an inspiration hit me ask bob i told him bob knows a hell of a lot more than i do anyway oh butters said he looked from me to the skull um yeah i guess thomas was talking to it he bob said indignantly i am very much a he im not some kind of freaking animatronic tinkertoy right butters said um sorry bob do you mind if i ask you some questions its a waste of my vast intellect and talent bob sneered do it bob i told him oh man the orange lights in the skulls eye sockets rolled fine i havent got anything better to do than to teach kindergarten great butters bubbled and sat down at the table he grabbed some more paper and a pencil well how about we start with i fixed myself a cup of tea and one for butters i put the cup down near him but he took little notice of it he was deeply involved in a conversation with bob i slipped out into the living room and put my aching leg up on the table then settled back onto the couch with my tea i sat in the gloom sipping hot sweet mint somethingorother and tried to order my thoughts i was tired enough that it didnt take too long i was about to call up a peer of queen mab and try to trap it for an entire night a garden spider had about as much chance of trapping a bengal tiger except that the bengal tiger probably wouldnt bother to squash the spider for daring to make the attempt the erlking would that made the whole notion more stupid than most of my plans but i didnt have too much choice in the matter the presence of the erlking in the area would drastically increase the number and the potency of the undead that the kemmlerites were planning to summon tonight if i could block the erlkings presence from chicago it would take a big chunk out of the powers the necromancers would summon grevane and company were formidable enough without calling up an army of superzombies and uberghosts if i could stop that from happening it might give luccio and her wardens a real chance to defeat them if i wasnt fast enough to call the erlking before one of the kemmlerites or if he escaped my hold and ran loose through chicago people would die the erlking would summon the wild hunt into a lightless chicago halloween night and anyone they caught in the open would be torn to shreds lightning flickered outside somehow too dark and dull to be natural a beat later thunder ripped through the evening air shaking the little house the wind started to pick up and the steady beat of rain on the windows surged and retreated with its restless gusting i didnt feel like a wizard i didnt feel like a deadly and powerful warden i didnt feel like the supernatural champion of chicago or a fearless foe of evil a daring summoner able to cast his defiance into the teeth of a supernatural titan or an enlightened sage of the mystic arts i felt like a scarred battered aching onehanded man with few pleasant prospects for the future and a ridiculous pair of pants with one leg slashed off mouse padded over to me through the dimness he chuffed softly at me and then laid his head down on my leg my eyes were closed but i could hear his tail thumping softly against the couch i rested my bad hand on mouses head and petted him awkwardly mouse didnt mind he just leaned against me loaning me the warmth of his fur and the silent faithfulness of his presence it made me feel better mouse might not have been the smartest creature on earth but he was steady kind loyal and was possessed of the uncanny wisdom of beasts for knowing whom to trust i might not have been a superhero but mouse thought that i was pretty darned cool that meant something it would have to be enough i set my teacup down took my foot off murphys coffee table and rose i picked up my staff without looking at it took a deep breath and clenched my jaw then i marched into the kitchen in a lopsided stalk butters i said stay here with bob and mouse watch my back if you see anyone trying to sneak up on me give a yell right he said will do i nodded to him and went out into the rain to test my will against the legendary lord of the wild hunt chapter thirtythree the rain had plastered my hair to my head by the time i got all the material for the summoning out of the beetles trunk i stuffed it all into a gym bag and then walked out to the middle of the backyard it wasnt quite too dark to seenot yet but i didnt want to make any mistakes so i used the last of the chemical light sticks kincaid had given me before our raid on mavras scourge the year before i snapped it and shook it up and greenyellow light spread out in a little pool around me the rain limited how much it could spread and it created the illusion that the entire world had shrunk to a tenfoot circle rain and grass and greengolden light i started with the circle where i intended to trap the erlking the coil of barbed wire still gleamed with its factory finish i uncoiled enough of it to give me several small holes in my fingers and to join into a circle about seven feet across though it wasnt cold iron in the technical sense it was very much what the faeries meant when they said cold ironthe wire had plenty of iron in it and cold iron was the bane of the faerie world i laid the barbed wire out straightening it slightly as i went and tacked it down into the damp earth with horseshoeshaped metal staples as long as my little finger i doublechecked every staple and then clipped the barbed wire from the larger roll and used a pair of pliers to twist the loose ends together after that i marked out the points of an invisible fivepointed star within the circle and placed several articles with an affinity for the erlking a heavy collar one might place on a hunting hound a whetstone a small bowie knife flint and steel and several steel arrowheads then i placed my own affinity items opposite those of the erlkings outside the circle a used copy of the hobbit the splintered end of my last blasting rod my a parking ticket i hadnt paid yet and finally my mothers silver pentacle amulet i stepped back and went over the circle again making sure that it was fixed solidly and that nothing had fallen across it in the back of my mind somewhere i was aware of the approach of sunset i dont know how i knew it really it was already darker than most nights and i certainly couldnt judge when the sun would be down with all those rain clouds in the waybut that didnt seem to matter i could feel the sunlight still gliding down to be trapped in the overcast could feel its presence and warmth with some part of my mind that wasnt entirely beholden to mere physics i could feel it fading and felt the concurrent stirring of the magical forces of night as it did the energy of night was far different than that of the daylightnot inherently evil but wilder more dangerous more unpredictable night was a time of endings and this night samhain all hallows eve was particularly so on this night the forces of the spirit world the wild things that haunted the nevernever drawn to death and decay would flit freely back and forth spirits would turn restless in their graves and wander the world mostly unseen by mortal eyes the wild beasts could feel the night coming and their metropolitan cousins could sense the knife edge of danger and energy in the air dogs began to howl in the neighborhood around me first one then two then dozens and their long low mournful howls rose up in a haunting tide dark was only moments away and i stripped the black leather glove from my bad hand and knelt by the barbedwire circle then i leaned down and pressed my left palm all scarred but for the shape of lasciels sigil like a living brand on my skin against the nearest tine of barbed wire pressing my flesh down with careful deliberation i didnt feel the wire cut me but there was a trickle of warmth over a portion of the sigil and my bloodblack in the greenish chemical lightslipped down over the barbed wire mixing with my will to send energy coursing into the coldiron prison i had built the prison was built and the trap was set i wished that there had been more time to assemble the articles id needed if there had been months to prepare i could have worked with bob to figure out the best way to do the job the materials might have been rare and expensive and difficult to attain but it was within the realm of possibility to build a circle from which even a being like the erlking could not lightly escape but there hadnt been time and if my quickiemart alcatraz was going to do the job it would need all of my focus and determination so i shut my doubts into a closet in the back of my mind along with my fears i knelt in my coat in the rain staff still in my right hand and took slow deep breaths i envisioned myself drawing in power with each breath and exhaling weakness and distraction i felt the magic stirring around me and within me as i did and i started building up my will gathering my strength for use until the wet grass seemed to sparkle with too many points of greengold light and the hairs on my neck rose up on end i took in a final deep breath and on the exhale night fell i opened my mouth and began to call out in the steady cadence of the summoning my voice rang hollow in the wind and rain muffled but strong and i poured some of my will into the words until the power in them began to make the air ripple around them as they flowed from my lips there in the darkness i reached into the spirit world to call up one of the deadliest beings of faerie and the erlking answered one moment the circle was empty then there was a flash of lightning a crash of thunder and a disembodied black shadow appeared on the grass within the circlethe shadow of a tall standing figure with no physical presence to cast it i barely stopped myself from flinching and breaking off the summoning chanta mistake that would have freed the erlking to leave at best and freed it to kill me at worst but i recovered myself and kept up the litany all the way through to the end when i finished it my voice had risen to a strident silvery clarion and on the last word lightning flashed down from the storm green and white and eyesearing it struck down upon the circle slammed against it and then scattered out around the circle in a hissing matrix of electricity and steam and magic defining the cylinder of the magic circle in a sparkle of greenish light that rose up into the night for a moment and then faded away when it was gone the shadow within my circle was no longer alone the erlking stood better than eight feet high other than that it looked more or less like a human dressed in closefitting leathers and mail of some dark matte black substance it wore a bucketshaped helmet that covered its face and the horns of an enormous stag rose up and away from the helm within the slit of the helmets visor i could see twin gleams of amber fire and as those terrible eyes settled upon me i could feel the presence of the being behind them like a sudden raw and wild hunger that pressed against the outside of my skin i could feel the erlkings lust for the wild night for the hunt and for the kill lightning flashed again and the rain came down harder and he raised his arms slowly dismissing me and stretching his body up to glory in the storm it is time mortal release me the words suddenly appeared in my head without going through my ears scarlet and glowing and scalding this time i did flinch as the erlkings will sent meaning into my thoughts like a wellthrown spear i tore my attention away from that lance of thought and spoke aloud in reply i will not release you the glowing eyes within the helm snapped back to me flaring larger and brighter i am no beast to be lured and trapped mortal set me free and join me in the hunt images came with the thoughts this timethe rush of rain and wind in my face raw hunger in my belly that i was about to sate the strength and power of my body and that of the mount beneath me and the glorious thrill of the chase as the prey fled as it was created to do testing my strength speed endurance and will while the night called and the storm raged around me to my surprise there was no sense of hate in it no twisting bitterness of despair there was only a wild and ferocious joy an adrenaline sense of excitement of passion of savage harmony red in tooth and claw i barely managed to pull my thoughts back into my own control grinding my teeth and reminding myself that i was kneeling in murphys backyard not pursuing game through the forest primeval the erlking might not be evil incarnate but that didnt mean that he wasnt far too dangerous to be allowed to go free no i growled i will not release you his amberflame eyes narrowed and he dropped slowly into a crouch knees bent his fingers resting lightly on the grass just inside the barbed wire those eyes were barely three feet from mine and he considered me in silence that swiftly became a torment of suspense you are he the erlking cast at me he who defied queen winter he who slew lady summer in those thoughts i saw mab standing over me as i lay stunned beside the summer ladys corpse offering me her hand i felt auroras blood drying on my skin tasted it harsh and sweet in my mouth i had to force myself not to try to spit the phantom taste from my tongue i am he i said we are not foes came his thoughts and he was curious about it even baffled in sending me his thoughts i also got flashes of emotion from him you are part of the hunt a predator why do you call me if not to join me to prevent another from setting you free this night the erlking tilted its head there was no sending of thought but i read the gesture clearly enough to interpret it as if he had why because your presence would mean suffering and death for those people i would protect man suffers man dies it is how things are not tonight it isnt i growled hunter cast the erlking you are not strong enough to hold me release me lest i turn the hunt upon you and suddenly i felt the other side of the hunt i felt my legs singing with the strength of terror i felt my lungs burning felt my body moving with the power and grace that only the approach of death can summon from it i fled over the rough ground bounding like a deer and knew the whole while that there was no escape thrice i say and done i gasped forcing the words out in a defiant scream i will not release you and the erlking rose an unearthly scream piercing the night the chorus of howling dogs rose with it louder and louder and the storm lashed at the air with sabers of wind and lances of lightning the sound was deafening the light searing and the freaking ground started to tremble as the erlking lashed out against my circle with his will i stood my ground facing the erlking and casting my will into the circle forcing it against his own power struggling to contain him while he sought to burst free from my enchantment it was an enormous struggle and almost hopeless i felt like a man straining to push a car up a hill not only was it a difficult weight to begin to move but a greater force was working against me and if i allowed it to move even an inch it would begin to gain momentum and crush me beneath it so i fought for that inch refusing to give it to him the erlking wasnt an evil beingbut he was a force of nature power and violence without conscience or restraint he screamed again and the howling wind and rain and the call of beasts grew even louder again he surged against the circle of my will and again i held him in wild the erlking shook his head like a maddened beast and his antlers slammed against the confining wall of the circle that imprisoned him sending ripples of greenish light out through the circle then he reached to his side and drew a black sword from its scabbard he lifted the blade and a lance of green lightning flashed down from the storm touching upon its tip and wreathing it in blinding light then he took the sword in both hands and brought it down upon the barrier i have little memory of what the third blow was like i remember it in much the same way i do the burning of my left hand there was too much light too much energy a tide of agony and i was terrified my vision faded to a blind field of white and i thrust my staff hard against the ground to keep from falling and then my vision began to clear the tide began to recede and within the circle whirling in a frenzy of frustration and need was the erlking his power was fading and the circle id built had been good enough to give me enough leverage to hold him i thought i heard a muffled voice somewhere amid all the wind and rain and thunder and the swift pounding of my own heart i started to look around for the source of the noise and then someone hit me on the back of the head i remember that part because id been through it before a flash of light pain a sickening whirling sensation as i fell and a disjointed looseness to limbs that had suddenly gone useless i fell to one side shocked that the whole world had suddenly tilted on end the grass suddenly felt cold and wet against my cheek with a shriek of triumph the erlking shattered my circle into a cloud of golden light that faded and vanished there was a roar of wind and then an enormous horse landed in murphys yard as if it had just vaulted over the whole of her house the erlking flung himself up onto the black steeds back and let loose an eerie cry when he did all the howling music of the dogs primitive and fierce seemed to congeal into flashes of lightning that leapt up from the ground and into the clouds for a second there was silence and then the screaming winds warbled and whistled into deeper more terrifying howls than any dog had ever uttered from the shadows rushed a great hound a beast the size of a pony with dark fur gleaming white teeth and the flaming amber eyes of the erlking himself more hounds came leaping from the shadows bounding in bloodthirsty joy around the erlkings horse the erlking whirled his steed lifted his black sword in a mocking salute to me and then cried out to his steed and his hounds the black horse gathered itself and leapt into the air then started churning its legs as if running up a hilland kept going up the hounds leapt and followed their master up into the teeth of the storm lightning flashed in my eyes and when it died again they were gone the wild hunt was loose in chicago and i had been the one to call them here i struggled until i began to move i wasnt able to get enough balance to rise but i managed to roll over onto my back cold raindrops slapped against my face cowl put the barrel of my own to the end of my nose and said an impressive display dresden its always such a pity when someone with such talent dies so young chapter thirtyfour i looked at the cavernous barrel and thought to myself that a really was a ridiculously big gun then i looked past it to cowl and said but you arent planning on doing it yourself are you otherwise youd have just shot me in the back of the head and had done with it with me groggy like that you might not even have had a death curse to worry about very good cowl said approvingly your reason at least seems sound provided you remain very still and give me no reason to think you a threat ill be glad to let you live until the erlking returns for you i held still partly because i didnt want to get shot and partly because i thought i might throw up if i moved my head too much howd you find me i asked kumori and i have been taking turns tailing you most of the day he said when do you people sleep i asked no rest for the wicked cowl said his tone was amused from within his heavy hood but the gun never wavered someone had to keep an eye on me i said you and grevane and corpsetaker all wanted the erlking to be in town it didnt matter to you who called him as long as someone did and you were the only one with an interest in keeping him away cowl said all i needed to do was watch you and ensure that you did not actually trap the erlking and thats why you followed me i said its one reason he replied i think you might actually have done it you know had i not interrupted you i was the only one of the three of us who thought you might succeed i dont get it i said i thought that you guys hated one anothers guts oh yes then are you working together or trying to kill each other i asked why yes cowl said and what sounded like a genuine laugh bubbled in his voice we smile at one another and play nicely all in the name of kemmlers greater glory of course but we are all planning on killing one another as soon as its convenient i take it that corpsetaker tried to remove grevane last night yeah it was a real party pity i would have enjoyed watching them in action again but i was busy with the actual work thats how it usually works out taking out the citys power grid and phone lines radio communications and quite a few other subtler things cowl said it was difficult but someone had to do it naturally it fell to me but well see how things settle out before morning heh i said they think theyre using you to get the serious technical magic done while they save up their juice for the fight and you think youre lulling them off guard so that when the darkhallow goes down you get the power theres no real reason to practice my swordplay and summoning of the dead when i have no intention of entering a tactical contest with them you really intend to make yourself into a god i asked i intend to take power cowl said i regard myself as the least of the possible evils uh huh i said someone is going to get the power might as well be you something like that something like that cowl said what if no one got it i said i dont really see that happening he said grevane and the corpsetaker are determined i intend to beat them to the prize and use it to destroy them its the only way to be sure one of those madmen does not become something more terrible than the earth has ever seen right i said youre the correct madman for the job cowl was silent for a long moment in the rain drops fell off the end of my pistol in his gloved hand then he said his voice pensive i do not perceive myself to be mad but if i were truly mad would i be able to tell i shivered probably from the rain and the cold cowl took a step back from me and said voice firm and confident again did you find him i looked behind me and saw kumori glide out the back door of murphys house yes i stared hard at kumori and my heart lurched in my chest she left the door open behind her there was no candlelight in the kitchen there was no movement inside the house excellent cowl said he took a step back from me i have already warned you to stay clear of my path dresden i now suspect that you are too proud to back down i know of the wardens now in the city they pose no serious obstacle to my plans you think you can take them in a fight i said i have no intention of fighting them dresden cowl replied im simply going to kill them join them if it suits you to do so instead of waiting for the erlking it makes no difference to me how you die his voice was steady and absolutely confident it scared me my heart lurched in my chest fear for butters and a dawning understanding of cowls quiet madness competing to see which could make it race faster theres one problem cowl i said cowl began to turn away but then paused oh you still dont have the word how are you going to manage the darkhallow without it for an answer cowl carefully lowered the hammer on my revolver and turned away and he laughed quietly under his breath he started walking and kumori hurried to his side then cowl tossed my gun into the grass raised his hand and nicked it at the air before him i felt a surge of power as he parted the veil between the material world and the nevernever and they both stepped through it vanishing from murphys backyard the rift sealed behind cowl so quietly and smoothly that i would never have been able to tell it had opened at all i was left alone in the wind and the darkness and the cold rain somewhere in the distance there was an echoing howl that came from above me and very far away it should have frightened me but i was so woozy that i mostly wanted to lie down and close my eyes for a minute i knew that if i did i might not open them for a while maybe not ever i had to check on butters and mouse i rolled over and picked up my staff then crawled a couple of feet and got my mothers pentacle then i stood up my head pounded with a dull throbbing beat of pain and i bowed my head forward for a moment letting cold rain fall onto the lump forming on the back of my skull the worst of it passed after a minute and i got the pain under control id taken harder shots to the head than that one had been and i didnt have time to coddle myself i blew out a harsh breath and shambled into the house i found it dark all the candles that had been lit now extinguished i lifted my mothers pentacle and ran my will through it causing it to pulse and then glow with silverblue light i lifted the pentacle over my head and surveyed the kitchen it was empty there was no sign of either mouse or buttersand no evidence of a struggle either my fear subsided a little if kumori had found them there would be signs of violenceblood scattered furnishings butterss papers were still stacked up neatly on the kitchen table murphys house wasnt a large one and there were only so many places butters could be i limped into the living room and then down the short hall to the bedrooms and the bathroom butters i called softly its harry mouse there was a sudden rough scratching at the door of the linen closet beside me and i almost jumped through the ceiling i swallowed in an effort to force my heart back down into my chest then opened the closet door butters and mouse crouched on the floor of the closet butters was at the rear and though mouse looked cramped he crouched solidly between butters and the door his tail began to thump against the inside of the closet when he saw me and he wriggled his way clear to come to me oh thank god butters said he squirmed out of the closet after mouse harry are you all right been worse i told him are you okay what happened um butters said i saw you out there and then there was something inside that ring of barbed wire and i was i couldnt see it very well but then the wind kicked up and i thought i saw something moving outside and i yelled and sort of panicked his face flushed sorry i was just much shorter than that thing i panicked hed rabbited all in all probably not a stupid reaction to the presence of an angry lord of faerie dont worry about it i said mouse stayed with you yeah butters said i guess so he started to try to get outside when that thing in the circle screamed i was holding him back i didnt realize i still had his collar when i uh butterss face turned greenish and he said excuse me then he sprinted for the bathroom i heard him throwing up inside and frowned down at mouse you know what i told the dog i dont care if butters had been chockfull of gamma radiation and had green skin and purple pants theres no way he could haul you into a closet with him mouse looked up at me and tilted his head to one side doggy expression enigmatic but that would mean that it was the other way around that you were the one hauling butters to a hiding place mouses jaw dropped open into a grin but that would mean that you knew you couldnt handle kumori and that she was dangerous to butters and you knew that i wanted you to protect him and that instead of fighting or running away you formulated a plan to hide him i frowned and dogs arent supposed to be that smart mouse snorted out a little sneeze shook his fuzzy head and then flopped over onto his back eyes begging me to scratch his tummy what the hell i said and started scratching looks to me like you earned it butters emerged from the bathroom a couple of minutes later sorry he said nerves i uh harry im sorry i ran away like that took cover i provided in the action business when you dont want to say you ran like a mouse you call it taking cover its more heroic right butters said flushing i took cover its fun taking cover i said i take cover all the time what happened butters asked i called the erlking but someone kept me from keeping him penned up they came in the house for a minute and i felt my voice trail off my relief that butters and mouse were all right began to fade as i realized that they had never been what kumori had been searching for what butters said quietly harry what is it son of a bitch i swore and my voice was a sulfurous snarl how could i be so stupid i whirled and stalked back down the hall through the living room and into the kitchen lifting my light on the kitchen table there were only empty cups of tea empty cans unlit candles paper and pens in the spot where bob the skull had sat there was nothing oh man butters said quietly at my elbow oh man they took him they took him i spat why butters whispered why would they do that because bob the skull hasnt always been mine i growled he used to belong to my old teacher justin and before that he belonged to the necromancer kemmler i whirled in a fury and slammed my fist into murphys refrigerator so hard that it dented the side and split my middle knuckle open i i dont get it butters said his voice very quiet bob did for kemmler what he did for me he was a consultant a research assistant a sounding board for magical theory i said thats why cowl took him cowls doing research butters asked no i spat cowl knew that bob used to be kemmlers somewhere in there bob knows everything about the theory that kemmler did what does that mean it means that cowl doesnt need the word of kemmler now he doesnt need the stupid book to enact the darkhallow because hes got the spirit that helped kemmler write it i shook my head bitter regret a metallic taste in my mouth and i practically gave it to him chapter thirtyfive i gave the blood on my torn knuckle a disdainful glance then snapped get your things and hold on to mouse were going going butters asked it isnt safe for you here now i said they know about this place i cant leave you behind butters swallowed where are we going they tailed me all day ive got to make sure the people ive seen today are all right i paused thoughts tearing through my head and ive got to find the book the necromancers book butters asked why i got out my keys and headed for the beetle because i have no freaking clue whats supposed to be happening at this darkhallow the only part that i understood enough to stop was the summoning of the erlking and thats been blown to hell i keep getting burned because i dont know enough about whats going on ive got to figure out how to throw a wrench into cowls gears during the darkhallow why because the only other thing i can do is try to kick my way through a crowd of necromancers and undead and try to punch his ticket facetoface wouldnt that work if i could pull it off i said and went out into the rain but im a featherweight fighting in the heavyweight division nosetonose i think cowl would probably kick my eldritch ass my only real chance is to fight smart and that means ive got to know more about whats going on for that i need the book butters hurried after me a couple of fingers through mouses collar we got into the beetle and i revved it up but we still havent figured out those numbers he said that has to change i said now um said butters as i got the beetle moving you can say now all you want but i still dont know could it be a combination i said like to a safe the older safe combinations need some kind of designation for left and right the newer ones might use some kind of digital code sure but unless you find a safe with a password sixteen numerals long that wont help us much a credit card i said thats sixteen digits right can be butters said you think thats what the number was maybe a credit card or debit card account that bony tony wanted his fee to get paid to i grimaced doesnt make any sense i said something like that would be in his pocket not hidden in a balloon hanging from a string down his throat good point butters said we rode in silence for a while except for the headlights of other cars the streets were dark between the total lack of lighting the dark and the heavy rain it was like driving through a cave traffic was tight and snarled anywhere near the highways but it had thinned out considerably since the afternoon the people of chicago seemed to mostly be staying home for the night which was a mercy in more ways than one butters looked around nervously a few minutes later harry this isnt exactly the best neighborhood i know i said and pulled over in front of a hydrant the only open space in sight he swallowed why are you stopping the car i need to check on someone i said stay here with mouse ill be right back but butters i said impatiently theres a girl here who helped me out earlier today i have to make sure cowl and his sidekick havent harmed her but cant you do this after you stop the bad guys i shook my head im doing my best here i dont know what might happen in the next few hours but dammit this girl helped me because i asked her to i dragged her into this cowl and kumori were going to considerable lengths to destroy every copy of der erlking that they could find and if they guessed that i got it from her memory shell be in danger i need to be sure shes all right oooooh butters said this is the girl who asked you out right i blinked how did you know that thomas told me i growled under my breath and said remind me to punch his lights out sometime soon hey butters said at least he didnt let me keep thinking you were gay i gave butters a flat look and got out of the car stay in the drivers seat i told him if theres trouble run try to circle back for me right butters said got it i hurried through the rain and the darkness into shielas building i drew out my pentacle and willed light from it and went up the stairs to her floor as i had that morning the stairs and the hallway had that illusory unfamiliarity that darkness can give a place youve seen only once or twice but i found my way to shielas door easily enough i paused for a moment and tried to sense the wards shed woven and found that they were still in place that was good if anyone had come in after her for some reason theyd have either torn the ward down or set it off on the way through unless of course someone had gone to the trouble to get invited in first shiela didnt seem to be the kind to turn folks away out of a sense of general paranoia i knocked several times there wasnt an answer she had said she was going out earlier she was probably at some costume party somewhere talking with friends eating good food having fun probably i knocked again and said shiela its harry i heard a couple of soft steps the creak of a floorboard and then the door opened to the length of its security chain shiela stood in the opening there was soft candlelight coming from her apartment harry she said quietly her mouth curling into a smile what are you doing here hang on she closed the door the security chain rattled and then she opened it again come in i really cant stick around i said but i stepped through the door anyway she had half a dozen candles lit on the end table beside her couch and there was a mussed blanket on the couch next to a paperback novel shielas long dark hair was piled up into bun and held in place with a couple of chopsticks leaving her ears and the smooth skin of her neck intriguingly bare she was wearing a bears football jersey made of soft cotton that hung to her knees and she wore pink slippers on her feet the jersey was loose on her but she had the curves to make it look more appealing than it had any right to be i could see her calves and they did a wonderful job of blending softness and strength shiela saw me looking and her cheeks turned a little pink hi she said her voice quiet hi i said back and smiled at her hey i thought you had a party tonight she shook her head i was walking i didnt want to walk in the rain and i couldnt call anyone to get me a ride so im home she tilted her head to one side and frowned at me you seem im not sure tense angry both i said there are some things happening she nodded her dark eyes serious ive heard that theres something bad brewing its what youre working on isnt it yes she fretted at her lower lip then why are you here she looked beautiful like that in a sleepshirt in the candlelight she wasnt wearing any makeup but she looked deliriously soft and feminine i thought about kissing her again just to make sure that the first one hadnt been some sort of anomaly then i shook my head and reminded myself that tonight was about business i just needed to make sure that you were all right her eyes widened am i in some kind of danger i lifted my hand placatingly i dont think you are now but i was followed today i had to be sure that you were safe have you seen anyone maybe felt nervous or anxious for no reason no more than any other day she said thunder rumbled and the rain kept drumming on her windows honestly i let out my breath and felt myself relax a little okay good im glad thunder rumbled again and we both just stood there staring at each other both of us glanced just for a second at the others eyes then pulled away before anything could happen harry she said quietly is there anything i can do to help you you already have i said she took a step closer and her dark eyes looked huge are you sure my heart sped up again but i took a little step back from her yeah shiela i knew i wouldnt be able to focus on the rest of tonight if i didnt look in on you first she nodded then and folded her arms all right but when youre finished with this theres something id like to talk to you about what i asked she shook her head and put her hand on my arm it would take some time to explain it if you think you need your focus for tonight i dont want to distract you with anything i looked at her and then deliberately down her and said thats probably best im finding you very distracting right now she flushed brighter no thats just you reacting to being in danger youre afraid that youre going to die and sex is very life affirming is that what it is i drawled among other things she said for a few seconds my hormones did their best to lobby for overcoming distraction by means of indulgence but i reined them in shiela was right i was in pain and in fear and in danger and those kinds of circumstances have a tendency to make you pay attention to different things the soft shine of candlelight on shielas hair for example or the soft scent of rose oil and flowered soap on her skinand shiela had been in danger for part of that time as well i didnt want to take advantage of that and i didnt want to start anything with her that i wasnt going to be able to finish for all i knew id be dead before another day was out and it wouldnt be right to allow things to go any further just because i was afraid on the other hand though there was nothing wrong with savoring life while you still had it i leaned down to her lifted her chin gently with my right hand and kissed her mouth again she quivered and returned it with a slow hesitant shyness i stayed like that for a moment tasting her lips my fingertips light on her chin and then straightened breaking it off very slowly she opened her eyes a moment later her breathing a little fast i touched her cheek with my fingertips and smiled at her ill call you soon she nodded her eyes clouding with concern be careful harry called a voice i blinked and looked around harry he called again and i recognized butterss voice there was a curious quality to the acoustics of his voiceas if he were standing in an empty room with no furniture or carpeting to absorb any sound shiela froze looking toward her door and then said dammit i blinked at her what i didnt want this to distract you she said and her tone was enigmatic i frowned at her for a moment and then opened the door to the apartment butters stood in the hall hed improvised a lead for mouse out of what looked like the torn hem of his scrubs tunic and my big shaggy dog headed for me nose to the ground pulling butters along the way butters for his part stumbled along uncertainly as if hed had a little too much to drink and couldnt get his balance butters i said whats up the car died he said and there were some guys who looked like they didnt like me on the street so i came to find you butters stopped or tried to mouse chuffed out a breath in greeting and headed straight for me i leaned down to scratch at mouses ears hey mouse shiela this is my dog mouse and this is waldo butters hes a friend of mine shiela blinked her eyes closed slowly and looked away butters peered and squinted looking around him what i frowned at him and touched his arm are you okay he flinched a little when i touched him then clapped a hand down on my arm as if using it to orient on me harry he asked dont you have a light i lifted my eyebrows at him and lifted my pentacle willing it to light here i said shiela i hope you dont mind if they come in butters peered up at me and then around him harry he asked yeah um who are you talking to i stared at him for a silent second and then a few details floated together in my mind and the bottom dropped all the way out of my stomach i closed my eyes for a moment and opened my inner vision my wizards sight and turned to face shiela the little apartment simply dissolved sliding away like paint being washed away by a stream of falling water in its place i could see a dimly lit gutted building studs stood naked where the drywall had been removed there were piles of scrap wiring halfrottedlooking ducts and similar refuse which had been removed from the building and thrown aside into refuse piles the place had been prepared for renovationbut it was empty the only window i could see was broken thunder rumbled the sound slightly different than it had been a moment before the driving rain gained a couple of notches of volume beating hollowly on the old apartment building i stared at shiela with my sight and she stood there unchanged except that i could see a faint tint of light around her subtle but definite it meant that she was either a noncorporeal presence or an illusion of thought and energy rather than a reality but if shed been an illusion she should have faded away entirely as the apartment had done i released my sight again my stomach twisted on itself a burning bitter feeling shiela i said quietly stars and stones its all but your real name isnt it lasciel its close shiela agreed quietly harry butters whispered his eyes were very wide who are you talking to shut up a minute butters i said staring at her she regarded me quietly her eyes now steady on mine thats what billy was talking about bock started looking awfully odd when i was speaking to you at the bookstore and you never interacted with anyone else never opened any doors in the store didnt pick up the book when i was looking for it i glanced down at my hand where shed written her number in permanent ink it was now gone illusions i said yes she said calmly some of appearance only some of seeming why to help you she said i told you that i could not make open contact with your conscious mind that is why i created shiela she gestured down at herself i wanted to help you but i couldnt do it directly so i tried to do it this way so you lied to me i said she arched a brow i had little choice in the matter what about after you made contact with me i said and my voice was bitter too i used the hellfire and you came to me in a dream that was after you met shiela if you will recall she said but you didnt need shiela anymore no she said i didnt but i found that i she rolled her shoulders in a shrug that i enjoyed being shiela that i enjoyed interacting with you as one person to another without being regarded with fear and suspicion i know that you understand what it is like youve felt it often enough in your own life but oddly enough i said i havent gone off and pretended to be someone else to gain anothers trust youve felt that isolation for less than two score years my host ive lived with it for millennia yeah how long were you planning on stringing me along her soft mouth turned into a firm line i was going to tell you once the nights business was doneassuming you lived through it sure you were i said i told you she said i didnt want it to become a distraction for you i barked out a harsh little laugh and why should i believe that because your death would mean the death of this part of me she said gesturing down at herself again the thought shadow of lasciel would not survive your deathand the true lasciel my true self would remain trapped for who knows how long you have no idea of what it is to be trapped without sound sight or senses waiting for someone to bring you forth from oblivion i stared hard at her i dont believe you you need not my host she said and gave me a little bow but that makes it no less true you kissed me i said shiela lasciels eyebrows lifted and she gave me an almost whimsical smile when i said that it has been a long time since i was close to anyone i meant it i enjoyed that contact my host as i think did you oh let me guess i said you did that for me too because you wanted to help me i kissed you because i desired it and because it was pleasurable if you will recall my host i did help you i gave you the summons to call the erlking did i not i opened my mouth and then closed it again struggling to find something to say i have never wished you ill my host she said in fact i have done all that i can to assist you i suddenly felt very tired and rubbed at my forehead i reminded myself that lasciel was a fallen angel that she was one of the thirty demons of the order of the blackened denarius that she was known as the temptress and the webweaver and that she was ancient powerful and deadly dangerous at the art of manipulation she could not be trusted nor could her little carbon copy that had taken up residence in my head but she had helped me and she had kissed me sure a kiss was just a kiss but her desire for it her hesitation the sense of yearning to her had been genuine she had wanted to do it she had enjoyed it she was one hell of a good kisser hell being the operative word i reminded myself i can still help you my host she said you are a powerful mortal but your foes are more formidable still they will kill you her face took on an expression of frustrated protest let me help you survive give me the chance to preserve myself please i stared at her for a moment she looked lovely and sincere and afraid she looked exactly like the kind of woman in trouble whom i could never turn away i have no intention of dying i said quietly but you arent going to be part of the equation if you dont save it i told her quietly i know how this works first i allow you to help with this problem then with the next one then with the one after that and at some point ill need more power for what will probably look like a very good reason and dig up the coin and then youll be able to do pretty much anything you want with me i shook my head thats one big long slippery slope no she clenched her jaw her expression frustrated but i do not wish you any harm maybe i said but theres no way for me to know that she arched one dark eyebrow at me then as quickly as blinking the building was on fire it rose up in a sudden explosion of heat and flame that engulfed the bare studs on the walls and chewed at the floor vicious heat assaulted my back a searing pain that left me with no choice but to move forward behind me the fire roared up higher and i looked around frantically suddenly panicked the only portion of the building that wasnt being swallowed by rising hungry flame led to the broken window i sprinted to it spotted the old iron of a fire escape lattice beneath it and ducked down to go through onto the fire escape before i was burned to charcoal and then the flames vanished the air became cool once more and the beat of rain replaced the roar of flame i stood at the window one leg raised onto the sill the rain soaking my chest and my jeans and there was no fire escape outside the window there was only a long long drop to the sidewalk beneath i swallowed and drew back from the window shaking the whole thing had happened so fast my reaction to the fire had been sheer and naked terror and even now my hand throbbed with the pain of illusory burns ever since that fire id had nightmares of more the illusion of fire had cut straight through to my pain and terror and utterly bypassed my brain which was exactly what lasciel meant it to do harry butters called his voice high and thready i couldnt see him he stood back in the darkness of the empty building and in my mindless panic i had allowed the light of my mothers pentacle to go out im okay i told him just stay where you are im coming i lit the pentacle again and found lasciel standing next to me one eyebrow still raised that is how you know she said if i wished to kill you my host your blood would be seeping from your broken corpse and mixing with the rain on the sidewalk there wasnt much i could say to that let me help you she urged me i can help you defend yourself against the disciples of kemmler i can teach you magics you have never considered i can show you how to make yourself stronger swifter i can show you how you might heal the damage to your hand if you have enough discipline there wouldnt even be a scar i turned my back on her my heart pounded against my chest as i walked back to butters she was lying to me she had to be thats what the denarians did they lied and manipulated their way into a mortals good graces gradually giving them more power while they fell more deeply under their demonic influence but she was telling the truth about one thing for sure she could make me stronger even the weakest denarian i had seen quintus snakeboy cassius had been a certifiable nightmare with hellfire to supplement my magic and an enormously powerful being to serve as a tutor and consultant my abilities could grow to epic proportions if i had power like that i could protect my friendsmurphy billy and the others i could turn my power against the red court and help save the lives of the wardens and the council i could do a lot of things and her kiss the illusion had all been in my head but it had been so utterly real every detail shiela herself had been so thoroughly genuine that i would never have guessed she was an illusion indeed there was little difference from my own perspective between that complex an illusion and reality the feel of her the scent everything had been there and she had been just as convincingly real in her blondgoddess form beside the hot tub in my dream her appearance had to be malleable she could appear to me as anything as anyone some darker baser part of my nature toyed with that notion for a moment but only for a moment i didnt dare let that thought flow through my head for long her touch had been too soft too gentle too warm too good id been without female company for years and more of that warmth that pleasing contact was a temptation too great to allow myself to dwell upon i turned slowly and faced lasciel she lifted her eyebrows leaning a little forward in anticipation of my answer i knew how to manipulate and control my dreamsand this manifestation of lasciels shadow was nothing more than a waking dream this is my mind i told her quietly get thee behind me i focused my thoughts and my power and brought forth my own illusion of imagination and thought silver manacles appeared from nowhere manifested from my focus and desire and locked themselves around lasciels wrists and ankles i gestured sharply and visualized her being lifted through the air then i opened my hand my spread fingers out palm to the floor and she fell into an iron cage that appeared from my concentrated effort the door slammed and locked behind her fool she said in a quiet voice we will die i closed my eyes and with a last effort of imagination and will summoned a heavy tarp that fell over the cage covering it and blocking lasciel from sight and sound maybe we will i muttered to myself but ill do it on my own i turned around to find butters staring at me his expression almost sick with fear mouse sat beside him also staring at me somehow managing to look worried harry he asked im okay i told him quietly um what happened a demon i told him it got into my head a while back it was causing me to experience hallucinations i guess you could call them i thought i was talking to people but it was the demon pretending to be them he nodded slowly and and its gone now you did like some kind of autoexorcism not gone i said quietly but its under control once i knew what it was doing i was able to lock it away he peered at me are you crying i turned my face away trying to make it look like i was staring at the window while i wiped a hand over my eyes no harry are you sure youre all right not you know insane i looked back up at butters and suddenly laughed look whos talking polka boy he blinked for a moment and then smiled a little i just have better taste than most i walked to him and rested my hand on his shoulder im all right or at least no crazier than i usually am he looked at me for a moment and then nodded okay good thing you came along when you did i said you tipped the demons hand when you came up here there was no way it could fit you into the illusion i helped he said big time i said i think im just too used to knowing more than most people about magic the demon was using some of my expectations against me it knew exactly how to hide things from a wizard an idle thought flicked through my brain at the words and suddenly i froze with my mouth open hells bells i swore thats it it is butters asked er what is mouse tilted his head to one side ears perked inquisitively how to hide things from a wizard i said and i felt my mouth stretching into a wide halfcrazy grin i dug in my memory until i found the string of mystery numbers and recited them ha i said and threw my hand up in the air in triumph hah haha eureka butters looked distressed lets go i told him rising excitement making tingles of nervous energy shoot through my limbs i started walking to give some of it an outlet come on lets hurry why butters asked bewildered because i know what those numbers mean i said i know how to find the word of kemmler and to do it i need your help chapter thirtysix the lights of chicago were still out and the night was growing even darker the storm had driven most people from the streets and now headlights appeared only intermittently the national guard had set up around cook county hospital bringing in generators and laboring to keep them running while providing a shelter of some sort and a presence of authority on some of the streetsbut they were as badly hampered by the lack of reliable telephone and radio communications as anyone else and rain and darkness had cast them into the same morass of confusion as the rest of the city the net result of it was that some streets were bright with the headlights of military trucks and patrolled by national guardsmen and some of them were as black and empty as a crooked politicians heart one section of state street was sunken in blackness and i pulled the beetle up onto the sidewalk in front of a darkened radio shack stay mouse i told the dog and got out of the car i walked to the glass door and considered it and the bars on it then i leaned my staff against it drew in my will and muttered forzare there was no flash of light with the release of energyid kept the spell tidy enough to avoid that instead it all went into kinetic force snapping the plate glass as cleanly as if id used a cutter and bending the center bars out into a neat bow shape large enough to slip through holy crap butters said his voice a hushed shout youre breaking in no ones minding the store i said i nudged a few pieces of door that hadnt fallen out of the frame then carefully slid into the building come on now youre entering butters informed me youre breaking and entering were going to jail i stuck my head out between the bars and said its in a good cause butters were the secret champions of the city justice and truth are on our side he looked at the front of the store uncertainly they are they are if you hurry up before someone in a uniform spots us i said move it i went back into the store lifting up my amulet and willing it to light i stared around me at all the technological things only a very few of which i could readily identify i turned in a circle looking for one particular gadget but i had no idea where in the store it would be butters came in and looked around the blue light of my pentacle gleamed on his glasses then he nodded decisively at a section of counter and walked over to it is this it i asked him something wrong with your eyes he asked me i grimaced at him i dont get in here a lot butters remember oh oh yeah right the murphyonic technology thing murphyonic sure butters said you exude a murphyonic field anything that can go wrong does dont let murph hear you say that heh butters said bring the light i lifted it higher and stepped up behind him yeah yeah he said theyre right here under the glass he peered around behind the counter there must be a key here somewhere i lifted up my staff and drove it bodily down through the glass shattering it butters looked a little wild around the eyes but he said oh right i forgot burglary one hand darted in and plucked up an orange box then he looked around and picked up a couple of packs of batteries from a rack on the wall he hadnt touched a thing but what he had taken with him and neither had i without security systems the only way we would get caught would be by fingerprints or direct apprehension and i was glad we didnt have to take the time to wipe anything for prints before commencing the getaway i led butters back to the car and away we got i cant see anything butters said can you make the light again not this close to the gadget i told him a minute or two wouldnt be a problem but the longer i work forces near it the more likely it is to give out i need some light he said all right hang on i found a spot near an alley and parked with the beetles headlights pointing at the overhanging awning of a restaurant i left the car running and got out with butters he opened the box and took out the batteries and did gadgety things with them while i kept an eye out for bad guys or possibly the cops tell me why you think this is it again butters said he had drawn a little plastic device the size of a small walkietalkie from the box and fumbled with it until he found the battery cover the numbers in bony tonys code are just longitude and latitude i said he hides the book see he records the coordinates with one of those global satellite thingies all those soldiers raved about during desert storm global positioning system butters corrected me whatever the point is that you need a gps to find those specific coordinates theyre accurate to what ten or twelve yards more like ten feet butters said wow so bony tony figures that most wizards wouldnt have a clue about what a gps device isand the ones who do cant use one because theyre hightech and running one even close to a wizard will short it out its his insurance to make sure that grevane cant screw him but grevane did butters said grevane did i echoed the idiot he never considered that bony tony might have been able to outfox him so he knows that bony tony has got the key to finding the word of kemmler on him but grevane never even considers that it might be something he cant access he just blunders along doing as he pleases which hes used to whereas you butters said read books at the library and magazines cause theyre free there i said though i have to give most of the credit to georgias suv i might not have thought of this if it hadnt had the same system note the past tense on that butters said had he glanced up at me pointedly im about to turn it on do you need to move off i nodded at him and backed off all the way to the car and tried to think technologically friendly thoughts butters stood in the headlights for a minute frowning down at the gadget and then peering up at the sky whats wrong i asked signal isnt coming through very well maybe its the storm storm isnt helping i said back theres magic at work too i chewed on my lip for a second turn it off butters did and then nodded at me i hurried over to him and said now hold still then i drew a piece of chalk from my duster pocket and marked out a quick circle around him on the concrete butters frowned down at the chalk and said is this some kind of mime training do you want me to press my fingers against an invisible wall no i said youre going to throw up a circle around youan outwardly directed barrier it should put a screen between you and any outside magical influence i am huh he said how do i do that i completed the circle reached for my penknife and passed it to him you need to put a drop of your blood on the circle and picture a wall going up in your head harry i dont know magic anyone can do this i said butters there isnt any time the circle should hold out cowls working and give you a chance to get a signal normally an anti murphyonic field huh youve watched too many trek reruns butters but basically yeah he pressed his lips together and then nodded at me i backed away to the beetle again butters grimaced and then touched the penknife to the base of his left thumbnail where the skin is thin and fragile then he leaned over selfconsciously and squeezed his thumb until a drop of blood fell on the chalk circle the circle barrier snapped up immediately invisibly butters looked around for a second and then said it didnt work it worked i told him its there i can feel it try again butters nodded and went back to his gizmo five seconds later his face brightened hey whaddya know it worked so this circle keeps out magic and only magic i said anything physical can cross it and disrupt the barrier handy for hedging out demons and such though ill remember that butters said he peered down at the gadget harry he exclaimed you were right the numbers match up to coordinates right here in chicago where i demanded hang on the little guy punched buttons and frowned i have to get it to calculate distance and heading from here it can do that i asked oh yeah he said plus amfm radio weather reports fish and game reports maps of major cities locations of restaurants and hotels for travelers all kinds of stuff that i said is really cool yeah you really get a lot for the five hundred bucks on this model the whole time his fingers flicked back and forth on the gadget right he said uh northwest of us and maybe a mile off i frowned at him doesnt it tell you the address or something yeah butters said pushing more buttons oh wait no you have to buy the expansion card for that he looked up thoughtfully maybe we could go back and get it one little burglary and youve gone habitual i said no its a bad idea if a patrol car spotted the broken window there will be police there i doubt anyone saw us but theres no reason to take chances well how do we find it then he asked turn it off then break the circle with your foot and get in the car well head that way and stop in a bit and you can check again rinse and repeat right good idea he turned the gizmo off and smudged the chalk circle with his foot like that like that lets go butters got in the beetle and we started through the dark dank streets after several long blocks i stopped with my lights shining into the awning in front of an apartment building and butters got out to repeat the process he took my chalk with him dribbled a bit of his blood on the circle he drew and tried the gps gadget again then he hurried through the rain back into the car more north he said i peered at the darkness as i got moving going through my mental map of chicago soldiers field maybe he said i cant see anything we drove north and cruised past the home of da bears i stopped just on the other side and butters checked again facing the stadium then he blinked and turned around his eyes widened and he came running back to the car were really close i think its the field museum i got the car moving makes sense i said bony tony had plenty of contacts there he did some trading in discretionary antiquities you mean stolen artifacts what did i just say he probably has some kind of arrangement with security there maybe he stashed it in a staff locker or something i parked in front of the field museum under a no parking sign there were a couple of actual spots i could have used but the drive was even closer besides i found it aesthetically satisfying to defy municipal code i put the beetles parking brake on and got out into the rain stay mouse i said come on butters can that thing get us close to the book within ten feet or so he said but harry the museum is closed how are we going to i blew out the glass of the front door with my staff just as i had at radio shack oh he said right i strode into the main hall butters walking on my heels lightning flashed abruptly illuminating sue the tyrannosaurus in all her bony jurassic glory butters hadnt been expecting it and let out a strangled little cry thunder rolled and i got out my amulet for light lifting an eyebrow at butters sorry he said i uh im a little nervous dont worry about it i told him my own heart pounding wildly the sudden reveal of that monstrous skeleton had shaken me too dont look at me like that it was a tense sort of evening i looked slowly around the place and listened for a moment i couldnt sense anyones presence i opened my sight again just for a quick glance around but i didnt see anyone hiding behind a veil of magic i backed off check again he did so though the shining floor of the museum didnt take the chalk as readily as concrete a few minutes later he nodded toward sue and said over that way he broke the circle and we hurried across the enormous floor try to keep quiet i told him security might still be around we stopped at sues feet and checked again butters frowned peering around this cant be right he said according to the gps these coordinates are inside that wall could bony tony have hidden it in the wall its stone i said and i think someone might have noticed if hed torn out a wall in the entry hall and replaced it he shook the gps a little i dont get it then i chewed on my lip and looked up at sue elevation i said what come on i pointed up theres a gallery overlooking the main hall it must be either up there or on a floor below us how do we know which we look starting with the upstairs the levels below us are like some kind of gerbil maze from hell i started for the stairs and butters came after me going up them was a pain but my instincts were screaming that i was right and my excitement made the discomfort unremarkable once on the gallery we went past a display of articles from buffalo bills wild west showsaddles wooden rifles that had been carried by the shows cowboys and indians alike cavalry bugles feathered war bonnets beaded vests moccasins ancient old boots several worn old tomtoms and about a million old photographs beyond that was some kind of interactive ecology display and just past that there was a table bearing the weight of an enormous malformedlooking dinosaur skull butters checked again and nodded toward the skull i think its there i went down to the skull the display proclaimed that it was sues actual skull but that geological shifts and pressures had warped it so the museum had created an artificial skull for the display holding my light up i walked slowly around the skullan enormous block of rock now i peered into darkened crevices in the rock and when i didnt find a book i got down on the floor and started checking under the heavy platform that supported the skull i found a manila envelope ducttaped to the underside of the platform and snatched it i got out from under the platform and tore the envelope open my fingers shaking an old slender black volume not much larger than a calendar notebook fell from the envelope i held it in my bare right hand for a moment there was no tingle of arcane energies to the book no sense of lurking evil or imminent danger it was simply a bookbut nonetheless i was sure i had found the word of kemmler my fingers shook harder and i opened it the front bore a spidery scrawl of cursive writing the word of heinrich kemmler hey that was kind of fun butters said is that it this is it i said we found it i glanced up at butters and said actually you found it butters i couldnt have done it without your help thank you butters beamed glad i could help i thought i heard a noise i lifted a hand forestalling whatever butters was about to say the sound didnt repeat itself there was only thunder and rain i put a finger to my lips and butters nodded then i closed my eyes and reached out with my senses slow and careful for the barest second i felt my thoughts brush against a stirring of cold energy necromancy i drew back from it with panicked haste butters get out the little me blinked up at me what get out i said my voice harsher theres a fire exit at the far side of the gallery go out it run get out of here and dont stop until youre someplace safe dont look back dont slow down he stared at me his eyes huge his face deathly pale now i snarled butters bolted i could hear terrified little sounds escaping his throat as he sprinted toward the far end of the gallery i closed my eyes and concentrated again drawing in my will and power as i did so casting my senses about in an effort to find the source of the dark power i touched the necromantic working again and this time i didnt even try to hide my presence by pulling away whoever it was had come in through the door id broken open i could feel a slithering sort of power there mixed in with a cold kind of lust a passion for despair i walked to the railing of the gallery and looked down into the entry hall grevane stood below trench coat wet and swaying water dripping from the brim of his fedora there was a half circle of dead men standing behind him and he beat a slow rhythm on his leg with one hand i wanted to cut and run but i couldnt i had to hold things up here until butters had a chance to get away and besides if i ran away toward the back exit and nowhere near my car grevanes zombies would catch me and tear me apart i licked my lips struggling to weigh my options then i had an idea holding my pentacles chain in my teeth for light i opened the book and started flipping through it one page after another i didnt read it i didnt even try to read it i just opened the pages fixed my gaze at a couple of points on each and moved on it wasnt a long book i was finished less than two minutes later there was a sound from the stairway and i rose readying my shield bracelet grevane came onto the gallery floor zombies marching behind him he stood and stared at me for a moment his expression impossible to read stay back i said quietly he blinked at me very slowly why i held up the book in one hand because ive got the word here grevane and if you dont back off ill burn it to ash his eyes widened and he lurched a half step closer to me licking his lips no you wont he said you know that you want the power as much as i do god you people are dysfunctional i said but just to save time ill give you a reason that youre capable of understanding ive read the book i dont need it anymore so if you push me ill be glad to flashfry it for you you didnt read it grevane spat you havent had it for ten minutes speed reading i lied i can do war and peace in thirty minutes give me the book grevane said i will allow you to live get out of my way or i will allow it to burn grevane smiled and suddenly a weight fell on me like someone had dropped a leadlined blanket on my shoulders my ears filled with rushing hissing whispers i stumbled and felt a dozen flashes of burning needlefine pain and between that and the extra weight i fell to my knees it took me a second to realize what was happening snakes i was covered in snakes there were too many of them to count or identify and they were all furious some dark green reptile as long as my arm struck at my face sinking fangs into my left cheek and holding on more of them struck at my neck my shoulders my hands and i screamed in panic and pain my duster took several hits but the enspelled leather held out against them i tore at my neck and shoulders and head ripping snakes free of me by main strength their fangs tearing at my flesh as i did i struggled to order my thoughts and rise because i knew grevane would be coming i tried to gather my shield as i pushed myself to my hands and knees but i saw a flash of a heavy boot driving toward me and light exploded in my eyes and i flopped back to the floor briefly stunned i blinked slowly waiting for my eyes to focus liver spots appeared in my vision weathered and strange white hair wiry and stiff beneath his hat his loose skin somehow reptilian in the dim light i know you i slurred the words tumbling out without checking in with my brain i know who you are now liver spots knelt down over me he took my wrists and clamped something around them while he did grevane came up and took the word of kemmlar from my limp fingers he opened it and began scanning through pages until he found the passage hed been looking for he read it stared at it for a long moment and then opened his mouth in a slow wheezing cackle by the night he said his voice dusty and amused its so simple how could i not have seen it before you are satisfied liver spots asked grevane entirely grevane said and you will stand by our bargain of course grevane answered he read another page of the book a pleasure working with you hes all yours grevane turned still beating a slow rhythm on his leg and the shambling zombies followed him well dresden liver spots said once they were gone his voice was a rich rough purr i believe you were saying you recognized me i stared up at him blankly let me help your memory he said he took an olivedrab duffel bag from his shoulder and set it on the ground then mostly with one hand he opened it and he drew out a louisville slugger oh my god i tried to move but i couldnt the metal bindings burned cold on my wrists you i said you busted up my car mmmm much as you broke my ankles my knees my wrists and my hands with a louisville slugger baseball bat while i lay helpless on the floor quintus cassius the snakeboy the serpentsummoning sorcerer and former knight of the order of the blackened denarius smiled down at me he leaned over kneeling and far too close to me for comfort and whispered to me as if to a lover i have dreamed of this night boy he purred and gently stroked the side of my face with the baseball bat in my day we would say that revenge is sweet but times have changed how do you say payback is a bitch chapter thirtyseven i stared up at the withered old man id called liver spots and behind the loose skin the wrinkles the white wiry hair i could see the man who had been one of the order of the blackened denarius how i asked him how did you find me i didnt he said the coroners apartment was easy enough to find i took hairs from his brush since you were so eager to keep him sheltered under your wing it wasnt too terribly difficult to keep track of himand youonce we had destroyed your wards oh i said my voice shook a little are you afraid boy cassius whispered youre about the fifthscariest person ive met today i said his eyes became very cold dont knock it i said thats really better than it sounds he rose slowly looking down at me the fingers of his right hand tightened and loosened on the handle of the bat hatred burned there as well mindless and irrational and howling to be slaked cassius hadnt exactly been stable when id faced him two years before from the look of him now he was preparing a campaign for the presidency of the world psychosis association i knew that cassius was a killer like few id ever seen he had spent what might have been fifteen or sixteen centuries bound to a different fallen angel within his own silver coin working hand in hand with the head of the order he had i was sure personally done away with hundreds of foes who had done far less to him than i had he would kill me if a flash of rage took him hed cave my head in with that bat screaming the whole time i shuddered at the image and reached out for my magic seeing if i could draw in enough to try to sucker punch him but when i tried the manacles on my wrists suddenly writhed moving and dozens of sharp points suddenly pricked into my wrists as if i had swept my hand through a rosebush i winced in pain my breath frozen in my chest for a second cassius smiled at me dont bother weve used those manacles on wizards and witches for centuries nicodemus himself designed them yeah ouch i winced but no amount of writhing would move my arms very much and i couldnt move to try to make the thorny manacles hurt less cassius stared down at me his eyes bright he stood there watching me try to writhe enjoying my helplessness and pain an image flashed through my mindan old man of faith and courage who had willingly given himself into the hands of the order in exchange for my freedom shiro had died after sustaining the most hideous torments i had ever seen visited upon a human bodyand some of them had come at the hands of cassius i closed my eyes i knew what he wanted he wanted to hurt me he wanted to see how much pain he could deliver before i died and there was nothing i could do to prevent it unless i thought of what shiro had told me about having faith for him it was a theological and moral truth upon which he had based his life i didnt have the same kind of belief but i had seen how forces of light and darkness came into conflict how imbalances were redressed cassius was in the service of some of the darkest forces on the planet shiro would have said that nothing he did could have prevented a balancing force of lightsuch as shiro and his brother knightsfrom being placed in his way in my own experience i had noticed that when something truly deeply evil arose one of the knights tended to show up maybe one would show up to face cassius hells bells that was mighty thin but it was technically possible and it was all i had i almost laughed what i needed to survive this lunatic was something i had never had much of faith i had to believe that some other factor would intervene i had no other option but that didnt mean i couldnt try to help intervention along the longer i kept breathing the more likely it was that someone would happen across the scenemaybe even someone who could help maybe even someone like my friend michael i had to keep cassius talking what happened to you i asked him a moment later opening my eyes id read somewhere that people love to talk about themselves the last time i saw you you could have passed for forty cassius stared at me for a moment more and then leaned his bat on the floor it was the result of losing my coin to you and your friends he said voice creaking while i held my coin saluriel prevented age from ravaging my body now nature is collecting her due from me plus interest he waved his stifffingered right hand wrinkled spotted swollen with what looked like bad arthritis if she has her way i will be dead within the year why i asked him isnt your new demon stopping the clock for you his eyes narrowed unsteady and cold i have no denarius now he said his voice low and very polite when i eventually left the hospital and rejoined nicodemus he had no coin being held as a spare mad fire flickered through his gaze you see hed given it to you i swallowed thats what you were looking for outside my apartment you wanted the denarius lasciel wouldnt be my first choice but i must be content with what is available uh huh so wheres nicodemus hes helping you i take it cassiuss eyes closed almost all the way nicodemus cast me out he said that if i was too much a fool to keep possession of my coin that i deserved whatever befell me what a guy cassius shrugged he is a man of power with no tolerance for fools once you are dead and lasciels coin is mine he will take me back you sound pretty confident there i said is there some reason i should not be he moved stiffly over to his duffel bag you should make this simpler for both of us im willing to make you an offer give it to me now and i will make your death quick i dont have it i told him he let out a rough cackle there are only so many places one can hide it he said if you are holding it as part of you enough pain will make you drop it he drew out a slender little coping saw from the bag and set it on the floor i once knew a man who swallowed his denarius and would swallow it again when it came through yuck i said cassius put a standardhead screwdriver down next to the saw and one who cut himself open and placed the coin in his abdominal cavity he drew a viciouslooking hooked linoleum knife from the bag and held it thoughtfully if you tell me ill take your throat and if i dont i asked he pared a yellowed fingernail with the knife i go on a treasure hunt i studied him for a minute then said i dont have it with me thats the truth i bound lasciel and buried the coin he let out a snarl and snatched at my left hand he tore my glove from it and then twisted my hand to show me my own horribly scarred palm and the namesigil of the demon lasciel upon it the only skin that wasnt layered in scar tissue you have it he spat and it is mine i took a deep breath and tried to embrace an optimistic conviction in the moral rectitude of my cause to think positive hey hideous torture would draw things out it wasnt the way i would have chosen to stall cassius but again i wasnt spoiled for choice im telling you the truth i said besides you wouldnt have made it quick even if i did give it to you he smiled it looked grandfatherly probably he agreed he reached into the duffel bag again and pulled out a threefoot length of heavy chain the kind they used to use for bicycle locks he held it in one hand while he moved my wrists lifting them so that i lay flat on my back my arms outstretched over my head im a winner either way i wasnt strong enough to move them the damned manacles made me weaker than a newborn kitten surrender your coin cassius said pleasantly then he gave me a hard kick in the ribs it drove the breath from me and hurt like hell i managed to choke out the words dont have it surrender your coin he said again and this time he swung the chain and lashed it down hard over my stomach my duster was open and the chain tore through my shirt and ripped at the flesh of my belly my vision went red with a sudden haze of agony i dddont i began surrender your coin he purred and he hit me again with the chain rinse and repeat i dont know how many times an eternity later cassius touched his tongue to some of the blood on the chain and regarded me thoughtfully i hope you arent too impatient for me to get the bat he said you see my balance is quite unsteady these days im told its a result of all the damage to my knees and ankles i lay there hurting my belly and chest were on fire blood from one of the snakebites had trickled into my left eye and had crusted my eyelashes together so that i couldnt open it again you see ive only got this one good hand to swing the bat with my other was badly broken by multiple bluntimpact traumas onehanded im afraid its difficult to aim properly or judge the power of my swing i tried to look around me but i couldnt get my right eye to move properly as a result cassius continued once i start paying you back for what you did to me im afraid its quite likely that i might hit you too hard and too many times and i want to savor this where was michael where was anyone cassius leaned down and said and when i start dresden i want to be free to indulge myself to really let go and live the moment im sure you understand no one is coming to save you harry i rasped i told you he paused eyebrows lifted and rolled a hand pray continue told you i said and it was marred with a groan told you if i ever saw you again i would kill you he let out a low amused little chuckle and put the chain down he picked up the linoleum knife then he knelt stiffly down beside me and calmly cut my shirt open and spread it and my duster away from my abdomen i remember he said one should never make promises one cannot keep i didnt i told him quietly best you hurry then he told me i cant imagine you have more than a few moments to make good he prodded my belly with his finger drawing a gasp of pain from me mmmm nice and tender now the better to cut through i watched the knife move slow and bright and beautiful time seemed to slow down as it did dammit i was not going to die i was not going to let this murderous bastard kill me i was going to survive i didnt know how i would do it but my will locked onto the notion and i found myself grinding my teeth i had shown him mercy before hed had his chance to walk away i was going to live and i was going to kill him the knife bit into the muscle of my stomach he moved it very slowly staring at the inner edge of the hooked blade as he drew it toward my groin in a gradually deepening incision it hurt almost as much as the chain but it left me with enough breath to scream i did i howled at him at the top of my lungs i shrieked profanities at him i even managed to twitch my body a little and i began calling up my will again bringing fresh agony from the manacles he finished his first long shallow almost delicate cut lifted the knife from my flesh and repositioned it beside the first the whole while i never stopped ranting at the top of my lungs i doubted it was coherent enough to understandbut it described my feelings perfectly i screamed and i kept on screaming and because i did cassius never heard mouses claws on the marble floor the air suddenly shook with a bellowing damned near leonine roar cassiuss head whipped around in time to see my dog leap from twenty feet away and hurtle forward like a greyfurred wrecking ball mouses front paws hit cassius squarely on the sternum and a bloodcurdling snarl exploded from the huge dogs chest as they both went down mouse snapped his jaws at cassiuss throat but he had too much momentum remaining from his charge his paws slid on the smooth floor carrying him past cassius before his teeth could do more than lightly rip at one shoulder cassius screamed in rage crouching and flicked his hand at mouse there was a surge of dark magic a shimmering blur and suddenly a serpent coalesced from the shadows lying upon the gallery it reared up for a second and i could see the deadly outline of a cobras hood rising a good five feet from the floor then the serpent launched itself at mouse my dog saw it coming sprang back from the serpents first strike and then leapt forward jaws trying to latch on behind the shadow serpents head lashing loops of reptilian darkness whipped into coils that tried to trap the big dog and the pair of them rolled along the floor each seeking to grasp and kill the other cassius stared at mouse for a second eyes wide and then turned to me there was actual literal foam at the corner of his mouth and his face was stretched into a grotesque grimace of fury he lurched over to my side speaking a language i didnt recognize in a halfhysterical shriek then he seized my hair jerked my head back to bare my throat and swept the knife down toward my jugular before his arm was halfway down there was a thin highpitched tinnysounding wail butters threw himself onto cassiuss back carrying them both over me and to the floor the knife missed me entirely and went skittering away on impact cassius snarled another oath and tried to crawl for the knife butters tried to pull cassius away his face deathly pale the little guy had all the fighting prowess of a leatherback turtle but he got his arms and legs around cassiuss torso and clung like a wildhaired monkey cassiuss body may have been weakened but hed had more than a millennium to learn about infighting he twisted his shoulders and then slammed the side of his head into butterss nose with a crunching sound of impact butters reeled from the blow and blood spattered his face and upper lip cassius then twisted again and escaped butterss grip he heaved himself toward the knife butters i screamed helpless to move and furious and terrified dont let him get the weapon the little medical examiner shook his head once then let out that tinny wail of challenge again and threw himself at cassius butters caught him around one leg cassius kicked at his face but butters ducked his head down and the blows rolled off his shoulders cassius pushed himself a little closer to the knife butters lifted his head with a squeak of defiance and sank his teeth into cassiuss leg the former denarian howled in sudden startled pain another bellowing roar shook the gallery and i looked up to see mouse gripping the shadow serpents neck in his heavy jaws mouse shook his head violently there was a burst of crunching sounds and suddenly the shadow serpent stiffened and then abruptly dissolved into gallons and gallons of translucent gelatinous ectoplasm butters yelped and i looked up to see cassius holding the knife sweeping it clumsily at his opponent butters skittered away from the knife eyes wide with terror but he skittered directly between cassius and me and held his ground mouse didnt skip a beat after killing the serpent this time he rushed forward low his snarls in chorus with the growling of thunder outside he hit cassius at the knees with the full power of his body and cassius went down like a tenpin before a bowling ball butters rushed forward and kicked at cassiuss knife hand the weapon skittered away again over the edge of the gallery and into the great hall below cassius kicked at butters and got him in the shins sending butters to the floor cassius got out from under mouse and lurched for me his eyes mad his hands outstretched in strangling claws mouse landed on his back and the huge dogs jaws closed on the mans neck cassius froze in place in sudden terror his eyes very wide he stared at me for a second there was total silence i gave you a chance i told him my voice quiet quintus cassiuss liverspotted face went pale with horrified comprehension wait mouse i said kill him i had only one open eye with which to watch cassius meet his end but in that final second rage and terror and horrified realization flashed through his eyes and just as mouses jaws crushed the delicate bones of his neck there was a flare of ugly energies a flash of unholy purplish light around him and he spoke words that rang in echoes totally out of proportion to their volume die alone he spat a flood of power hit me and my vision went black the last thing i heard was the snapping of bone chapter thirtyeight i didnt wake up it was more like i felt myself putting together some kind of awareness the way a stagehand constructs a set evidently i was a minimalist because the reality i awoke to was a bare black floor a single hanging lamp overhead and three chairs i walked forward into the light and stared at the chairs in one sat lasciel again in her angelic blond wholesome form she wasnt wearing the white tunic though instead she was clothed in an illinois department of corrections prison jumpsuit the orange suited her hair and complexion quite well she wore prison shackles wrists and feet and sat primly in her chair in the second chair was me well it was a version of me some kind of subconscious alter ego of mine his hair was clipped shorter and neater than mine and he wore a dark beard that was kept in similar fastidious order he wore a black silk shirt black trousers and his hands both of them were unmarred his fingertips held together in a steeple that rested on his chin another dream i said and sighed i slumped down into the third chair i looked more or less as i had when i woke up that morning my shirt was slashed open though there wasnt any blood on my torso and my skin hadnt been pounded and ripped with a chain wishful thinking not precisely a dream the subconscious me said call it a meeting of the minds lasciel smiled very slightly no i said and pointed at lasciel ive said everything i intend to say to her i turned to my alter egothough on thinking about it maybe alter id was more accurate as for you youre sort of a jerk and the whole look youve got going there says evil wizard which i am now professionally opposed to alterna harry sighed ive told you before im not some sort of dark demon im simply the more primal essence of yourself the one most concerned with such matters as food survival his dark eyes flickered idly over lasciel mating he said a lazy growl to the tone he looked back to me the important things in life that i am even having this dream probably means that i need a good therapist i said i stared at my other self and said it was you wasnt it you wanted to pick up the coin make sure you remember that i am a part of you before you point any fingers he said and yes the potential for power in an alliance with lascielhe inclined his head to her a courtly gentlemanly gesture damn his chivalrous eyeswas too great to simply ignore there are too many things out there determined to kill you so long as you keep lasciels coin you both have the option to seek more power if necessary to protect yourself or others and you prevent the coin from being used by unscrupulous sorts like cassius i grimaced so so he said this is a time to consider employing a portion of that power i stared at him and said youve been talking to her behind my back for months he said calmly it was only polite after all you wanted nothing to do with her you asshole i said the whole reason i wasnt talking was that i didnt want the temptation i did my subconscious said honestly you should listen to me more often if youd taken my advice about murphy she wouldnt be in hawaii in bed with kincaid lasciel coughed gently and said gentlemen if i might offer a suggest both i and my alternative self said at the same time and in exactly the same voice shut up lasciel blinked but did my double and i eyed each other and i nodded slowly were in agreement then that her presence and her influence are dangerous we are my double said she must not be allowed to dictate actions or to direct our choices through suggestion or manipulation my double looked at her and said but she can and should be used as a resource under careful control she can offer us enormous amounts of information he eyed her again and said and amusement lasciel left her eyes down and smiled very slightly no i said ive got bob when i want information and if i want sex ill figure out something you dont have bob now my double said and youve wanted sex since about twenty minutes after the last time you had it thats beside the point i told him sullenly im not quite insane enough to let a fallen angel give me virtual nooky just for kicks listen to me he said and his voice became sharp commanding heres the cold truth you are determined to take us into battle against forces you cannot possibly overcome through main strength not only that but your source of assistance the wardens may also turn against you if they learn the truth about what youre attempting you are wounded you are out of contact with your other allies its the right thing to do i said setting my jaw my double rolled his eyes tell me is it morally necessary for you to die in the process i glowered at him this meeting is just a formality you know he said you are already planning on asking lasciels shadow for her help thats why you read through the book as you did before it was taken from you you wanted it to go through your mind so that she could see it and provide you with the text as she did for the summoning of the erlking i lifted a finger i only did that in case i wasnt able to pry enough out of grevane to figure out exactly what kemmlers disciples are doing my double arched a brow howd that work out for you dont be a wiseass i said the point he said is that you have little or no chance to prevail if you blindly rush in you must know how they intend to manipulate these energies you must know if there is a weak time or place at which to assault them you must know the details of the darkhallow or you might as well cut your own wrists dont have to i told him i could just sit and wait for the erlking to come by six of one half a dozen of another my double agreed in addition your body is in no condition to do anything at the moment he leaned forward free her to help us i inhaled slowly and stared at lasciel for a moment then i said after i killed justin and got my head together at ebenezars place i promised myself something i promised that i would live my life on my own terms that i knew the difference between right and wrong and that i wouldnt cross the line i wouldnt allow myself to become like justin dumorne dont you want to survive my double asked i rose from the chair and started walking into the darkness outside the light of course i do but some things are more important than survival yeah my double said like the people who are going to get killed when you die and dont stop kemmlers disciples i froze at the edge of the darkness take the high road if you want to my double said choose to walk away from this strength in the name of principle but after your noble death everyone you no longer protect everyone who might one day have come to you for help everyone who is killed in the aftermath of the darkhallowevery life you might have protected in the future will be on your head i stared at the darkness and then closed my eyes regardless of where it came from lasciel offers you the power of knowledge if you turn aside from that powerpower only you can take upthen you abandon your commitment to protect and defend those who are not strong enough to do it themselves no i said that isnt that isnt my responsibility of course it is my subconscious said voice clear and sharp you coward i stopped and turned staring at him if you go to your death rather than do everything you might to prevent what is happening you are merely committing suicide and trying to make yourself feel better about it that is the act of a coward it is beneath contempt i went through the logic of his argument and didnt make any headway against itof course while my double might look like another person he wasnt he was me if i open this door now i said slowly i might not be able to close it again or you might my double said i have no intention of allowing her any control so you will be the one who determines it what if i cant contain her again once she is freed why shouldnt you be able to its your mind your will your choice you still believe in free will do you not its dangerous i said of course it is and now you must choose will you face that danger or will you run from it and so condemn those who need your strength to their deaths i stared at him for a minute then i looked at lasciel she waited her eyes steady her expression calm can you do it i asked her bluntly can you show me what was on those pages of course she answered her manner one of subservience without a trace of resentment i would be pleased to offer you whatever assistance you permit she looked humble she looked cooperative but i knew better the mere shadow of the fallen angel lasciel was a vital and powerful force she might look humble and cooperative but if that was her true nature she wouldnt have fallen to begin with i didnt think she was harboring murderous impulses or anythingmy instincts told me that she was genuinely pleased to help me after all that was the first step and she had patience she could afford to wait dangerous indeed lasciel represented nothing less than the intrinsic allure of power itself i had never sought to become a wizard hell a lot of the time i thought about how nice things might be if i hadnt been one the power had been a birthright and if it had grown since then it had done so by the necessity of survival but id tasted a darker side to the possession of powerthe searing satisfaction of seeing an enemy fall to my strength the lust to test myself against another to challenge them and see who was the strongest the mindless hunger for more that if once indulged might never be slaked one of the coldest most evil souls i have ever encountered once told me that the reason i fought so hard to do what seemed right was that i was terrified to look within me and see the desire to cease the fight and do as i would free of conscience or remorse and now i could see that he had been right i looked at the fallen angel patiently waiting and was terrified but there were innocent lives at stake men and women and children who needed protection if i didnt give it to them who would i took a deep breath reached into my pocket and found a silver key there i threw it to my double he caught it and rose then he unlocked lasciels shackles lasciel inclined her head to him respectfully then she walked over to me gorgeous and warm in the harsh light her eyes lowered without a trace of selfconsciousness she sank down to her knees bowed her head and said how may i serve you my host i opened my eyes and found myself on my back there was a candle burning nearby mouse had curled himself protectively around my head and his tongue was nicking over my face rough and wet and warm i hurt absolutely everywhere id learned to block out pain under the harsh lessons of justin dumorne but it went only so far lasciel had shown me a different technique i couldnt have explained to anyone what i did i wasnt sure that i understood it myself at least on a conscious level i simply knew i gathered the pain together and fed it into a burning fire of determination in my thoughts and it began to steadily recede i exhaled slowly and began to sit up my brain registered the screaming torture of the muscles in my stomachit just wasnt horribly important and took up little of my attention my god harry butters said his voice was thick and slurred as if he were holding his nose his hand pushed on my shoulder dont sit up i let him push me back down i needed a couple of minutes to let the pain continue to fade how bad is it he exhaled its pretty hideous but i dont think he actually perforated the abdominal wall skin and tissue damage but you did some bleeding he swallowed and looked a little green around the gills thats my best guess anyway you okay yeah yeah fine its just i work with corpses because i just couldnt handle you know actual living people heh you can eat lunch while looking at a threemonthold corpse but first aid on my stomach is too much to handle yeah i mean youre still alive thats just weird i shook my head how long was i out i was surprised at how calm and steady my voice sounded its been about fifteen minutes butters said i found some bandages and alcohol in the old mans duffel bag ive got your belly cleaned and covered but i dont have much of an idea of how much trouble youre in you need a hospital maybe later i said i lay on my back poring over what lasciel had given me about the writings in the book hell the thing had been written in german i didnt know german but lasciel had translated the text about the darkhallow it felt like we had talked about it for an hour or more but dream time and real time arent always lockstepped butterss nose had swollen up there was still some blood on his face and he already had a matched set of gorgeously colorful black eyes he leaned over and fussed with the bandages on my stomach hey i said quietly i told you to run i was doing that heroic rearguard thing you screwed it all up sorry he answered his voice serious but i got outside and i couldnt run i mean i wanted to i really wanted to but after all youve done for me he shook his head i just couldnt do that what did you do i ran around the outside of the museum i tried to find help but with all the rain and the dark there wasnt anyone around so i ran to the car and got mouse i thought that maybe he could help you he could i agreed he did mouses tail thumped on the floor and he kept on licking at my head i realized dully that he was cleaning the dozens of tiny snakebites but he couldnt have done it without you butters i said you saved my life another five minutes and id have been history he blinked down at me for a moment and then said i did didnt i damned brave of you i said his spine straightened a little you think yeah and check it out he said gesturing at his face his mouth opening into a toothy smile i have a broken nose dont i absolutely i said like im a boxer or maybe a toughasnails gumshoe you earned it i said hurt like hell he said but he was still smiling he blinked a few times the gears almost visibly spinning in his head and said i didnt run away and i fought him i jumped on him i kept quiet and let him process it my god he said that was that was so stupid actually when you survive it gets reclassified as courageous i reached out my right hand butters shook it gripping hard he looked at cassiuss body and his smile faded what about him he asked hes done i said thats not what i mean oh i said well leave the body here no time to move it hell be a john doe on the public records and there probably wont be a heavy investigation if we get out quick it shouldnt be an issue no i mean i mean my god hes dead we killed him dont kid yourself i told him im the one who killed him all you did was try to help me his brow furrowed and he shook his head thats not what i mean either i feel sorry for him dont i said he was a monster butters frowned and nodded but he was also a man or was once he was so bitter so much hate he had a horrible life note the past tense i said had butters looked away from the corpse what happened there at the very end there was a light and his voice sounded weird i thought hed killed you he hit me with his death curse i said butters swallowed i guess it didnt work i mean because youre breathing it worked i told him id felt that vicious magic grab hold of me and sink in i dont think he was strong enough to kill me outright so he went for something else die alone butters asked quietly what does that mean i dont know i said not sure i want to i took a deep breath and then exhaled i didnt have enough time to lie there waiting to recover butters i dont have any right to ask this of you im already in your debt but i need your help you have it he said i havent even told you what it is i said butters smiled a little and nodded i know but you have it i felt my lips peel back from my teeth in a fierce grin one little assault and youve gone habitual next thing i know youll be forming a fight club help me up you shouldnt he said seriously no choice i said he nodded and then stood up and offered me his hand i took it and rose waiting to sway or pass out or throw up from the pain i did none of those things the pain was there but it didnt stop me from moving or thinking butters just stared at me and then shook his head i found my staff picked it up and walked to the buffalo bill exhibit butters got the candle and then he and mouse kept pace i looked around for a second then picked up a long heavyduty extension cord running from an outlet on the wall to power some lights on an exhibit in the center of the room i jerked it clear at both ends and gathered it into a neat loop once i had it i passed it to butters what are you doing he asked preparing i said i found out about the darkhallow butters blinked you did how i grunted magic okay he said what did you learn that this isnt a rite its a big spell i said it all depends on drawing together a ton of dark spiritual energy like what he asked like a lot of things the necromantic energy around animated corpses and manifested shades the predatory spirits of ancient hunters all the fear thats been growing since last night plus the past several years have seen some serious magical turbulence around chicago kemmlers disciples can put that turbulence to work for them too then what they gather it together and get it going in a big circle it creates a kind of vortex which then funnels down into whoever is trying to consume the energy poof instagod he frowned im not very clued in on this magic stuff but that sounds kind of dangerous hell yeah i said and crossed the room to a rack of riding equipment its like trying to inhale a tornado holy crap butters said but how does that help us first of all i found out that the vortex itself is deadly its going to draw off the life of every living thing around it butters gulped it will kill everything not at first but when the wizard at the vortex draws down the power its going to create a kind of vacuum where all that power used to be the vacuum will rip away the life energy of everything within a mile dear god that will kill thousands of people only if they finish the spell i said until then the farther back you are from it the less it will do i said but to get near the vortex the only way to survive it is to surround yourself with necromantic energy of your own only those with ghosts or zombies need apply he asked exactly i lifted a saddle from the rack then i got a second one i hung both over opposite ends of my staff and picked it up like a plowmans yoke the saddles hanging i started walking down the stairs but wait butters said what are you going to do get to the center of the vortex i said the effort it will take to work this spell is incredible i dont care how good cowl is if i hit him as he tries to draw down the vortex its going to shake his concentration the spell will be ruined the backlash will kill him and everyone will be all right he asked thats the plan he nodded and then stopped abruptly in his tracks i felt his stare burning into my back but harry to get there youll have to call up the dead yourself i stopped and looked over my shoulder at him comprehension dawned in his eyes and you need a drummer yeah he swallowed could could you get in trouble with your people for doing this its possible i said but theres a technicality i can exploit what do you mean the laws of magic specifically refer to the abuse of magic when used against our fellow human beings technically it only counts if you call up human corpses but you told me that everyone only calls humans right so while the laws of magic only address necromancy as used on human corpses there usually isnt any need for a distinction nutty necromancers only call up humans sane wizards dont touch necromancy at all i dont think anyone has tried something like this we reached the main level of the museum its going to be dangerous i told him i think we can do it but i cant make you any promises i dont know if i can protect you butters walked beside me for several steps his expression serious you cant try it without someones help and if you dont stop it the spell will kill thousands of people yes i said but i cant order you to help me i can only ask he licked his lips i can keep a beat he said i nodded and reached my destination i slipped my improvised yoke off my shoulders and dropped both saddles to the floor my breathing was a little harsh from the effort even though i barely noticed the pain and strain youll need a drum butters nodded there were some tomtoms upstairs ill go get one i shook my head too highpitched your polka suit is still in the beetles trunk right yes i nodded then i looked up and up and up another flash of lightning illuminated the pale towering terror of sue the most complete tyrannosaurus skeleton mankind has ever discovered okay butters i told him go get it chapter thirtynine by the time we got outside the storm had turned into something with its own vicious will rain lashed down in blinding cold sheets wind howled like a starving beast lightning burned almost continually across the sky and the accompanying thunder was a constant rumbling snarl this was the kind of storm that came only once or twice in a century and i had never seen its equal that said the entire thing was nothing but a side effect of the magical forces now at work over the city the apprehension tension fear and anger of its people had coalesced into dark power that rode over chicago in the storm the erlkings presencei could still hear the occasional shrieking howl amidst the storms angry roaringstirred that energy even more i shielded my eyes from the rain as best i could with one hand staring up at the lightningthreaded skies there a few miles to the north i found what i had expecteda slow and massive rotation in the storm clouds a spiral of fire and air and water that rolled with ponderous grace through its cycle there i called back to butters and pointed you see it my god he said he clutched at my shoulders with both hands to hold himself steady and his bass drum pulsed steadily behind me is that it thats it i growled i shook the water from my eyes and clutched at the saddlehorn to keep my balance its starting what a mess butters said he glanced behind us at the broken brick and debris and wreckage of the museums front doors is she all right one way to find out i growled hah mule i laid my left hand on the rough pebbled skin of my steed and willed it forward the saddle lurched and i clutched hard with my other hand to stay on the first few steps were the worst the saddle sat at a sharp incline not too unlike that on a rearing horse but as my mount gathered speed the length of her body tilted forward until her spine was almost parallel with the ground i didnt know this before but as it turns out tyrannosaurs can really haul ass she might have been as long as a city bus but sue despite her weight moved with power and grace as id called forth energycharged ectoplasm to clothe the ancient bones they had become covered in sheets of muscle and a hide of heavy surprisingly supple quasiflesh she was dark grey and there was a ripple pattern of black along her head back and flanks almost like that of a jaguar and once i had shaped the vessel i had reached out and found the ancient spirit of the predator that had animated it in life animals might not have the potential power of human remains but the older the remains the more magic can be drawn to fill themand sue was sixtyfive million years old she had power she had power in spades i had rigged the saddles to straddle her spine just at the bend where neck joined body id had to improvise to get them around her using the long extension cords to tie them into place and it had been ticklish as hell to get butters on board without him losing the beat and destroying my control of the dinozombie but butters had pulled through sue bellowed out a basso shriek that rattled nearby buildings and broke a few windows as she hurtled forward down the streets of the city the blinding rain and savage storm had left the streets all but deserted but even so there were earthquakes less noticeable than a freaking tyrannosaur the streets literally shook under her feet in fact we left acres of strained cracked asphalt behind us heres something else i bet you didnt know about tyrannosaurs they dont corner well the first time i tried to take a left sue swung wide the enormous momentum of her body simply too much for even her muscles to lightly command she swung up onto the sidewalk crushed three parked cars under her feet knocked over two light poles kicked a compact car end over end to land on its roof and broke every window on the first two floors of the building beside us as her tail lashed back and forth in an effort to counterbalance her body oh my god butters screamed he kept hanging on to me with his arms stabbing his legs out alternately to either side in order to operate the bass drum strapped on his back theyre probably insured i shouted thank god the streets werent crowded that night i made a note to be sure to have sue slow down a little before we turned again and kept the focus of my will on her her attention on the task at hand just before we turned onto lake shore drive we hit a national guard checkpoint there were a couple of army hummers there their headlights casting useless cones of light into the night and storm wooden roadblocks and two luckless gis in rain ponchos as sue bore down on them the two men stared their faces white one of them simply dropped his assault rifle from numb hands get out of the way fools i screamed the two men dove for cover sues foot crashed down onto the hood of one hummer crushing it to the asphalt and then we were past the checkpoint and pounding our way down the street toward evanston heh i said looking back over my shoulder id love to hear how they explain that to their co you crushed that truck butters shouted youre like a human wrecking ball there was a thoughtful pause and then he said hey are we going anywhere near my bosss place because he just wont shut up about his new jaguar maybe later for now look sharp i told him shes a lot faster than i thought well be there in just a minute i ducked under the corner of a billboard as sue went by it whatever you do keep that drumbeat going do you understand right butters said if i stop no more dinosaur no i called back if you stop the dinosaur does whatever the hell it wants to shouts rose up from a side street where a couple more guardsmen saw us go by sue turned her head toward them and let out another challenging bellow that broke more windows and startled the guardsmen so much that they fell down i felt a surge of simple enormous hunger run through the beast id called up as though the ancient animus id summoned from the spirit world was beginning to remember the finer things in life i touched sues neck again sending a surge of my will down into her jerking her head back around with a rumbling cough of protest my ears rang in the wake of that vast sound and i glanced over my shoulder to make sure butters was okay his face was pale if this thing gets loose he said that would be bad which is why you shouldnt stop the drum i told him if sue went wild i could scarcely imagine the potential carnage she could inflict i mean good grief look at all the senseless victims of jurassic park ii we hit evanston the first suburb of chicago proper which is mainly separated from chicago by the presence of trees on the streets and a few more homes than highrises but given that its only a block or two away from the heart of second city the addition of trees and homes made it feel more like a park nestled down at the feet of the city i guided sue into a gentler left turn onto sheridan slowing down enough to be sure that we wouldnt swerve off the street as sue headed in i was suddenly struck with the realization of how fragile those homes seemed good lord another driving accident like the one back in town would result in a home being crushed and not just some dents and broken windows we would be moving among precisely the people i was trying to protectfamilies homes with children and parents and pets and grandparents decent folks for the most part who just wanted to make their homes peaceful and secure and go about their lives of course if i didnt hurry up and stop the darkhallow every house i was now passing would be filled with its dead i checked the sky during the next long flicker of lightning and didnt like what i saw the clouds were spinning faster more broadly and unnatural colors and striations had appeared in their formation and we were almost under its center i guided sue down another side street and thats when i felt the cloud of power gathering before me it swirled and writhed against my wizards senses sending tingling shafts of heat and cold and other less recognizable sensations running through me i shuddered at the disorienting strength of it there was magic being wrought ahead a lot of it there butters shouted pointing down that way that whole block is the campus lightning flashed again as i turned sue down the street and it was over the dinosaurs broad head that i saw wardens battling for their lives in the street ahead they were in trouble luccio had them moving in a tight group around a cluster of hells bells around a group of children in colorful halloween costumes morgan was at the head of the group luccio brought up the rear and yoshimo kowalski and ramirez were on the flanks even as i watched i saw dozens of rotting forms lurch out of the shadows ahead of them and charge more came running in behind them letting out wails of mad anger luccio whirled to deal with them and dear god i suddenly saw the difference between a strong but somewhat clumsy young wizard and a master of the magic of battle fire lashed from her left handnot a gout of flame like i could call up but a slender needle of fire so bright that it hurt the eyes to see she swept it in an arc at thigh level and every one of the zombies coming behind went tumbling to the ground amidst crackling sounds of shattering muscle and singeing meat another wave surged up behind the first luccio caught one of them in a grip of invisible power and hurled the undead into the ones behind sending more of them to the ground but a pair of the zombies got through luccio ducked the grasping arms of the first caught the thing by a wrist and sent it stumbling aside with a twist of her body that reminded me of one of murphys moves the second zombie drove a hammerheavy blow at her head but that slender blade she wore at her side swept up out of its scabbard and took off its arm at the elbow another move brought a chiming surge of some power i could feel even from half a block away singing through the silver steel of her sword and she flicked it lightly at the zombies head the blade touched there was a flash of light and the zombie abruptly fell limp to the ground the magic that had animated it disrupted and gone in less than five seconds luccio had simply wiped out thirty undead and it hadnt even been a contest i guess you dont get to be commander of the wardens by collecting bottle caps either my eyes flicked back to the front of the group where morgan met the shock of another wave his style was rougher and more brutal than luccios but he got similar results a heavy stomp of his foot sent a ripple through the earth that knocked undead to the ground like bowling pins a gesture of his hand and wrist and a cry of effort drew grasping waves of concrete and earth up to clamp down on the fallen zombies he closed his fist and the earth tightened drawing back down into the ground cutting and tearing its way through undead flesh and ripping the zombies to shreds one of the creatures was still mobile and with a look of contemptuous impatience on his face morgan drew the broadsword at his hipthe one used for executions of wizards guilty of breaking one of the laws of magicpaused a beat to get the timing right and then swung once twice snickersnack and the zombie fell apart into a number of wriggling bits several others got through here and there kowalski hammered one to the ground with unseen force while beside him yoshimo twisted a hand and the branches of a nearby tree reached down of their own accord wrapped around the undeads throat and hauled it up off of the ground ramirez a fighters grin on his face lashed out with some kind of bright green energy i had never seen before and the zombie nearest him simply fell apart into what looked like grains of sand as an afterthought he drew his sidearm as a second creature charged him and calmly put two rounds into its head from less than ten feet away he must have been loaded up with hollow points or something because the creatures head exploded like rotten fruit and the rest fell twitching to the ground none of the zombies got within ten feet of the terrified children more of them materialized out of the rain and the night but luccio and the wardens kept moving steadily forward burning and crushing and slicing and dicing their way across the street furiously determined to get the children clear which is probably why they didnt see the sucker punch coming out of nowhere there was the roar of an engine and an old chrysler shot forward along the street the driver pulled it into a sharp left turn as it got close to the wardens and their charges and the wet rain turned it into a broadside slide the car swept forward like an enormous broom of iron and steel and none of the wardens were looking that way i cried out to sue and hung on to the saddlehorn the car slid sending out a bow wave of sheeting water from the wet street ramirezs head snapped around toward the car and he shrieked a warning but it was too late to get out of the way the group was still under attack and the mindless creations that assaulted them cared nothing for selfpreservation they would continue the fight and even if the wardens could have run from the car they would never survive being mobbed by the undead in the chaos in a flash of insight i realized that these were the same tactics grevane had used at my apartment ruthlessly sacrificing minions in order to defeat the enemy everyone elses head turned toward the oncoming car the muscles of sues legs tensed and the saddle lurched one of the little girls screamed and then the tyrannosaur came down from the leap that had carried her over the besieged wardens sue landed with one clawed foot on the street and the other came down squarely on the caddys hood like a falcon descending upon a rabbit there was an enormous sound of shrieking metal and breaking glass and the saddle lurched wildly again i leaned over to see what had happened the cars hood and engine block had been compacted into a twofootthick section of twisted metal even as i looked sue leaned over the car in a curiously birdlike movement opened her enormous jaws and ripped the roof off inside was li xian dressed in a black shirt and trousers the ghouls forehead had a nasty gash in it and greenblack blood had sheeted over one side of his face his eyes were blank and a little vague and i figured hed clipped his head on the steering wheel or window when sue brought his sliding car to an abrupt halt li xian shook his head and then started to scramble out of the car sue roared again and the sound must have terrified li xian because all of his limbs jerked in spasm and he fell on his face to the street sue leaned down again her jaws gaping but the ghoul rolled under the car to get away from them so sue kicked the car and sent it tumbling end over end three or four times down the street the ghoul let out a scream and stared up at sue in naked terror covering his head with his arms sue ate him snap gulp no more ghoul whats with that butters screamed his voice high and frightened just covering his head with his arms didnt he see the lawyer in the movie those who do not learn the lessons of history are doomed to repeat them i replied turning sue around hang on i rode the dinosaur into the stream of zombies following in the wardens wake and let her go to town sue chomped and stomped and smacked zombies fifty feet through the air with swinging blows of her snout her tail batted one particularly vilelooking zombie into the brick wall of the nearest building and the zombie hit so hard and so squishily that it just stuck to the wall like a refrigerator magnet arms and legs spread in a sprawl in a couple of minutes there wasnt much in the way of zombies to keep on demolishing so i swung sue around to pace after the wardens they had gotten clear of the street while i covered their retreat and i saw warden luccio at the door of the nearest building waving the last two children and ramirez through the door while she watched out behind i guided sue up to the building and had her settle down to the ground come on but keep the drum going i told him we slid out of our saddles and ran a couple of steps through the heavy rain to where luccio stood at the door hey there i said sorry im late luccio stared at me for a moment and then at the dinosaur her eyes held a mixture of wonder anger gratitude and revulsion i dio dresden what have you done it isnt a mortal i said its an animal you know the laws are there to protect our fellow wizards and mortals its she looked like she might throw up its necromancy she said its necessary i said and my voice sounded harsh i hooked a thumb up youve seen the vortex forming yes what is it dark power kemmlers people are going to call it down and devour it along with all the shades they could get to show up and if they go through with it and turn one of themselves into a god luccios eyes widened as she figured it out and caught on there will be a vacuum she said it will draw in magic to replace it it will draw in life right i said and theyre going to be over there directly under the vortex i said but if anyone tries to go in without a field of necromantic energy around them the vortex will suck them dry before they get there we need to get in there to stop them thats why i borrowed tiny here so dont give me any crap about the laws of magic or at least wait for later because there are too many lives at stake anger flickered over her face and she opened her mouth then she frowned and closed it again where did you get this information kemmlers book i said you found it i grimaced briefly grevane jumped me and took it butters looked back and forth between us marching in place to make the polka suits drumbeat luccio blinked at him took a deep breath then said and who is this the drummer i needed to pull this off i told her and a good friend he saved my life tonight butters this is ms luccio captain this is butters luccio gave butters a courtly little bow and he ducked his head sheepishly in reply where did you find those kids i asked she grimaced this building is an apartment complex we got here just as the first of the undead arose one of the parents was screaming about the children being at some sort of halloween party in a building on campus we were too late to save the women taking care of them but at least we got the children out i chewed on my lip studying the warden you had evil wizards to gun down and you stopped to get some kids out of the line of fire i figured wardens would have melted the bad guys first tried to get the civilians clear later she lifted her chin and regarded me with an arched brow is that how you think of us yes i said she frowned and looked down at the hilt of her sword dresden the wardens are not as a rule concerned with compassion or empathy but they were children i am not proud of my every act as a warden but i would sooner hurl myself to the demons than leave a child to die i frowned at her you would i said thoughtfully wouldnt you she smiled a little her irongrey hair plastered to her head with the rain and it made many wrinkles at the corners of her eyes not all of us share morgans attitudes but even he would never have turned aside from children in danger he is an enormous ass at times but a brilliant soldier and beneath all his flaws a decent man the door to the building slammed open and morgan came through sword gripped in both hands i told you he said viciously to luccio i told you he would turn on us this latest violation of the laws only proves what ive said all along his voice trailed off slowly as he caught me from the corner of his eye and turned to see me standing there and sue crouched a couple of yards behind me yeah i told luccio and my voice was the only dry thing about me i see what you mean morgan he found the book she looked at me tell him i relayed everything i had learned to morgan he glowered at me with enormous suspicion but by the time i got to the part where thousands of people would die if we failed to stop the spell his face became drawn with anxiety and then hardened with determination he listened without interrupting we need to get to the center of the spell i finished attack them just as they try to draw it down its impossible morgan said i got close enough to see them when we went in for the children theyre in a little patch of grass and picnic tables between the buildings there are several hundred animated corpses in our way as it happens i said jerking my head at sue i brought an animated corpse countermeasure along with me tonight ill get us through morgan stared at me for a second and then nodded the idea clearly gathering momentum in his thoughts yes then we try to hit them as they complete the spell that gives them the most time to backstab one another and if we disrupt a working that powerful the backlash will probably kill them agreed luccio said hows yoshimo ramirez says her thigh is broken morgan growled shes not in danger but she wont be doing any more fighting tonight dammit luccio said i should have caught that one before it went through no captain morgan said implacably she should never have tried her sword on it she was an unremarkable fencer at best gosh youre a sweetheart morgan i said he glared at me and the sword quivered in his hands luccio brought her hand down between us in a gesture of absolute authority gentlemen she said quietly later weve no time morgan took a deep breath in and then nodded i folded my arms and kept up my glower but i hadnt been the one near violence point dresden ive done for grevanes drummer and sue just ate corpsetakers sidekick i said that leaves us with those two and cowl plus cowls assistant four of them and five of us morgan said luccio grimaced it could be worse she admitted but only you and i have any experience with this kind of fight she glanced at me no offense dresden but youre young and you havent seen this kind of duel very oftenbut even you have more experience than ramirez or kowalski none taken i said beginning to shiver in the rain id rather be home in bed morgan please get the other wardens and fill them in then put yoshimo where she can see the front door and defend the building if things dont go well we may need somewhere to fall back if things dont go well i said we really wont have to worry about that morgan shook his head at me ill be right back i stood there for a moment a mangled zombie wandered up the sidewalk i walked back to sue and touched her flank and her thoughts and she flicked her tail batting the thing away into the darkness then i walked back over to luccio incredible she said quietly looking at sue dresden this this kind of magic is an abomination perhaps a necessary one this night but hideous all the same and yet look at it its amazing pretty good for zombie crushing too i said indeed she looked up at the sky again how will we know when they begin drawing down the power i started to say your guess is as good as mine but i didnt get any of it out of my mouth before the clouds rolled and stirred and suddenly began to spin in a single enormous spiral more lightning showed me the dim form of what looked like a thin almost spidery tornado that dropped from the cloud and began to descend to the ground i stiffened and nodded at it there you go i said theyre starting now very well luccio said then we must move at once i want you to luccio didnt get to tell me what she wanted me to do because the earth suddenly boiled with writhing masses of pale green light that came surging up out of the ground they took on form as they came first vaguely human then over the next instants resolving into clearer images of what looked like amerind tribesmen as they came their mouths opened in shrieks and wails of excitement and rage and ghostly weapons appeared in their handsspears and hatchets clubs and bows one of them turned and threw a translucent shimmering spear at my chest i barely had time to think but my left arm swept up my charred shield bracelet exploded into a cloud of blue and white sparks and the hurled spear shattered into angry green flames against my shield i heard a short cry beside me and ducked narrowly avoiding a swing from a spectral hatchet whose wielder floated over me i threw myself forward and rolled coming up with my shield ready and my will gathering in my staff making the sigils carved along its length glow with sullen fire a specter swung a club at luccio and she rolled with the blow but even so took a hit to her jaw and mouth that staggered her she recovered her balance ducked to avoid a second swing and once more drew the silver sword of a warden from her hip again the blade sang with that buzzing power id sensed before and luccio made a clean lunge at the specter that thrust the blade though its heart the specter arched as if in agony and then simply exploded into flashes of sickly light and falling globs of ectoplasm luccio swept her sword back and spun on a heel to face two more of the quasisolid spirits i blocked a second blow of the hatchet on my shield looking wildly around for butters i spotted the little guy five yards away on his hands and knees on the crosswalk his legs still kicking wildly to keep the drum going three of the deadly specters were closing in on him with wails of madness and rage butters i shouted and rose to go to him but two more specters dove at me and forced me to crouch behind my shield i could only watch what happened as the three undead swarmed butters and attacked him butters spun around wildly his eyes down evidently not even aware that they were coming one of them swung a great twohanded club back as butters put one hand to his mouth and then slammed it back down on the ground again the specters weapon swept down with a clean and lethal grace heading directly for the back of butterss head and suddenly shattered against the curving curtain of an empowered circle butters looked up at the specters as they flailed uselessly against the circle he had the piece of chalk id given him in one hand and hed torn the little cut hed used before open once more with his teeth he stood up the drum still thumping and gave me a shaky thumbsup good butters i shouted at him stay in there he nodded his face pale and marched in place to keep the drum going i swung my staff at a specter and hit it and the ghostly warrior reacted as if struck by a heavy brick it was a curious kind of impactnot the thudding thump of hitting something solid but some kind of impact nonetheless i knew from the way that the specters had come up through the earth that they were only partially material a material impact would have little enough effect on them and the strength of my arm behind the swing meant nothing to them but the power of my will that i had called up and held ready in my staffthat was something else that energy was what the specter reacted to and i pressed my advantage whipping my staff through the specters head and belly on two separate swings driving the apparition away with howls of pain in the time it took me to do that luccio had simply dispatched three more of the specters with the humming power of her wardens blade she looked at me her eyes wide and lifted a pointing finger she snarled a word and another searing thread of flame shot over my shoulder about eight inches from my right ear there was a howl and i turned my head to see another specter that had been charging my back fall consumed in scarlet flame i felt a fierce grin on my face and i turned around to nod my thanks to luccioand saw the corpsetaker come out from under a veil of magic and swing her drawn tulwar at luccios back captain i shouted luccios sword arm swept up and around blade parallel to her spine as she drew it around her shoulders in a circle and caught corpsetakers attack without even turning to face it luccio sprang forward like a cat and spun in place only to have corpsetaker press her attack and drive the captain of the wardens back on her heels corpsetakers young face was set in a wide and manic smile cheeks dimpled her curly hair flying wildly around her head as she charged she wore a small skin drum of some kind on a rig at her hip and she beat a swift tattoo on it with one hand while fighting with the other a fresh cloud of specters swirled up in support of her and a flying arrow drew a line of scarlet on luccios cheek i roared out a challenge brandished my staff and bellowed forzare a lance of unseen force lashed out at corpsetaker but the necromancer leapt back and away from it she cried out words in an unknown tongue and half a dozen specters darted toward me i brought up my shield but was soon hardpressed to even hold it up against repeated attacks from the specters and they kept trying to circle around me if id stood my ground they would have killed me and as much as i wanted to help luccio i had no choice but to take one step back after another until i found my shoulders pressed against sues enormous flank but my attack on the corpsetaker had bought luccio what she needed to make a fight of thingstime to recover from the surprise attack she cut down two more specters with needles of flame contemptuously slapped aside another cut from corpsetakers tulwar and then took the battle to the necromancer grey cloak flying in the storms wind pressing her hard with the silver rapier and driving corpsetaker back one step after another i dropped the staff and slapped my bare hand on sues hide though the dinosaur looked like a living beast that was only appearance her own flesh was made of the same ectoplasm that the specters werei had just poured enough energy into it to make it seem more solid she was of the same stuff as the spectersand that meant that she could hurt them the tyrannosaur stirred and then snapped her jaws to one side closing on a specter and tearing it into fading light and globs of goo she heaved herself to her feet eyes sweeping around the ground in front of her for the next specter it lifted a bow and loosed a glowing green arrow that sank into the muscle of her neck and she bellowed in pain but the arrow was no more than a bees sting one clawed foot came up and down and destroyed a second specter the others let out wails and shouts of fear and anger and spread out to attack sue while the dinosaur lashed her tail around and looked for the next victim i saw luccio drive corpsetaker forward and around the corner of the building out of sight id given the specters a bigger problem to worry about and i went after luccio harry butters shouted pointing i looked up at the building i heard children screaming inside someoneramirez i thoughtscreamed get down get down there were flashes of luminous green light swirling here and there in the windows i heard morgan shout a challenge and i heard a raucous booming sound from within the wardens there were under attack as well stay put i told him and ran after luccio it was too thick with shadow to see easily around the side of the building but in a flash of lightning i saw luccio make another lunge her technique gorgeous back leg stretched forward spine straight the sword extended and taking the full weight of her body behind its vicious tip luccio knew what she was doing she dipped the tip of her blade under corpsetakers tulwar and the point sank into the necromancer just under the floating ribs corpsetakers mad smile never faltered the lightning died away and i heard a short gasping cry i took my mothers pentacle in hand and lifted it willing light from it silverblue light filled the little space between buildings i saw luccio plant her feet twist the blade viciously and whip it back out again corpsetaker fell to her knees she stared down at her chest and then pressed her hands tightly to the wound she looked up again staring at luccio and then at me her eyes clouded over with confusion and she slowly toppled to her side on the grass excellent said luccio turning around she flicked blood from the silver blade and regarded it for a moment then strode with purposeful steps for the front of the building again come wizard we have no time to waste youre going to leave her there shes finished luccio said harshly come are you all right i said she shot a hard look at me perfectly grevane and cowl remain we must find them and kill them her eyes flicked to the spiraling clouds overhead and quickly we have only moments hurry fool i stood there for a second staring at luccios back i lifted the pentacle and looked at corpsetakers body lying on its side in the rain she twitched a little her dark eyes wide and staring blindly her face pale and my stomach twisted in sudden fear i stepped around the corner of the building with my in my hand aimed it at the back of luccios head drew back the hammer and shouted my voice harsh and hard corpsetaker luccios steps faltered her head snapped around to look at me and in her eyes i saw a brutal cruelty that could never have belonged to the captain of the wardens i felt the first tug of a soulgaze but i made my decision in the moment that my voice caused her steps to falter she opened her mouth and i saw the corpsetakers madness twist luccios eyes felt the sudden dark tension as she began to gather power she never got it in that single second of uncertainty corpsetaker had been relying upon her disguise to defend her and had her mind bent upon planning her next stepnot preparing her death curse the bullet from my hit her just over her right cheekbone her head snapped back and then forward it might have been luccios body but it was the corpsetakers expression of shock and surprise as the stolen body fell to the ground in a loose tangle of dead limbs i heard a low strangled sound i looked up to see morgan standing in the buildings doorway sword in hand he stared at luccios corpse and rasped captain i stared at him for a second and then fumbled for words morgan this isnt what it looks like morgans dark eyes rose to focus on me and his face twisted with rage you his voice was deadly quiet the sword rose to a guard and he stalked out into the rain and his voice rose to a wrathful roar as the groundthe freaking groundbegan to literally shake murderer traitor oh shit chapter forty morgan lashed his fist out at me shouting something that sounded vaguely greek and the very rocks of the earth rippled up in a wave that flew toward me with incredible speed i had never fought against earth magic in earnest before but i knew enough about it to not want to be in the way when it got to me the gun went back in my pocket and i took my staff in hand and ran for the nearest tree i thrust the staff back at the earth as i ran gathered in my will and shouted forzare unseen force lashed out at the ground behind me and flung me up at an angle i hit the branches of the tree maybe ten feet up and scrambled wildly to grab one i did it and though it shook the tree like a blow from a giant ax the wave of power went by under me without oh sucking me under the ground or crushing me or anything like that i cant imagine that whatever morgan had in mind was less than horribly violent morgan bellowed in rage and charged toward me sword in hand i jerked my legs up and he missed my ankles if not by much he snarled in rage whirled with the silver sword of the wardens abruptly emitting a low howling sound and struck at the trunk of the tree in a motion of focus and power that reminded me of way too many kurosawa movies there was a flash of light as the blade cut all the way through the trees trunk the heat of all that force setting both sides of the cut on fire as the tree started to fall i dropped clear and rolled as the tree fell out toward the street and morgan darted to one side trying to get around the fallen tree to kill me morgan i shouted for gods sake man that wasnt luccio lies morgan snarled he abandoned chasing me around the tree in favor of simply hacking his way through it and the sword in his hands howled again and again as he struck cutting trunk and branches like bits of straw it was the corpsetaker i shouted the body thief she let luccio gut her and then switched places with her his answer was an almost incoherent snarl he came the last several feet faster than i could have believed and lashed at me with the sword i brought my shield up and deflected the blow but the impact of it slammed painfully against the whole left side of my body there was more than simply physics behind that blade i backpedaled out into the street where several more zombies saw me and headed my way specters darted or looped lazily about now with no sense of purpose in them at all now that their drum was silent and the corpsetaker was dead morgan i screamed luccio might still be alive but not if she doesnt get help and soon we cant do this more lies he murmured something the blade in his hands hummed as luccios had and he flicked it lightly out against my shield there was a shrieking screamin my head rather than in my ears i dont know how to describe it except to say that bad audio feedback is musical and soothing by comparison the power in the silver sword hit my defensive shield and simply undid it unraveled it so that all the energy in it went flying apart in all directions while a hot tingling pain flashed through my left arm where i wore the bracelet morgan attacked in earnest after that little flick of the blade had destroyed my defense but his first swing was an overhand one aimed at my temple i knocked the blade aside with a sweep of my staff and saw a flash of surprise cross his face at the speed of the parry he recovered his balance but i simply ran from him taking that vital second to get moving again morgan cursed and followed me but i can move especially for a man my size and morgan wasnt exactly a spring chicken i gained ten or twelve feet on him before my legs suddenly became unsteady and i faltered and nearly fell i wanted to scream in frustration though i didnt feel how much pain my body was in it was battered and weak there was no way i could simply outrun him but i made it back over to where my dinosaur stood restlessly idle after driving away the specters i got close enough to touch her and slapped at her flank desperately willing my intentions to her tiny brain doubtless savvy necromancers had ways of conveying their orders over a distance but i was new at this and i had no intentions of refining my technique anytime soon sue spun around as morgan charged leaned down low and opened her vast jaws in a bellow of challenge say what you will about morgan the man was no coward but the bellow of an angry tyrannosaur is enough to give any mammal a moment or two of doubt he slid to a halt on his heels still grasping the sword in his left hand and stared at sue and then at me he took a deep breath and then reached out his right hand where there was a low yawning humming sound that shook the air around his fingers no he said quietly not even this creature will keep you from justice this time dresden even if i have to die doing it i stared at morgan the same old frustration and fear suddenly yielding to a realization i had always assumed that morgans irrational hatred was something personal reserved for me and me alone i had assumed that for whatever reason morgans persecution was the result of the political and philosophical enmity of certain members of the white council that he was nothing but a pawn for someone higher up in the game but politicians dont make good kamikazes that kind of dedication is reserved for zealots of principle and lunatics for the first time i considered the notion that perhaps morgans hate was not directed at me personally but at those that he truly believed to be violators of the laws of magic murderers and traitors i knew people who would face death even embrace it rather than surrender their principles karrin murphy was one of them and i was friends with most of the rest at the end of the day morgan was a cop he worked for a different body of law of course and under a different set of guidelines but his duties were the same pursue combat and apprehend those who violated the laws put in place to protect people from harm hed spent more than a century as a policeman dealing with some of the more nightmarish things on the planet thinking of him in that light suddenly gave me a different understanding of morgans character id seen burnedout cops before theyd labored long and hard in the face of danger and uncertainty to uphold the law and protect the victims of crimes only to see both the law and the victims it should have protected broken beaten and abused again and again it mostly happened to the cops who genuinely cared who believed in what they were doing who passionately wanted to make a difference in the world somewhere along the way their passion had become bottled anger the anger had fermented into bitter hatred then the hatred had fed upon itself gnawing away at them over years even decades until only a shell of cold iron and colder hate remained i didnt feel contempt for burnedout cops i didnt feel anger toward them all i ever felt was sadness and empathy for their pain theyd seen too much in their daily battle against criminals ten or twenty or thirty years of witnessing the most monstrous aspects of humanity had slowly turned them into walking casualties of war and morgan had been on his beat for more than a century morgan didnt hate me he hated the bad guys he hated the wizards who abused the power he had dedicated his life to using to protect others when he looked at me he didnt see harry dresden he could see only the atrocities and tragedies that had burned themselves into his mind and heart i understood him it didnt make me like him but i could understand the pain that drove him to persecute me of course my sensitivity and empathy were completely irrelevant because they wouldnt do a damned thing to stop him if he charged me i wouldnt have any options morgan i rasped please dont we cant let corpsetaker divide us like this cant you see that that was her intention when she took luccio traitor he snarled liar i ground my teeth in frustration my god man thousands of people are about to die his mouth twisted baring his teeth all the way to the gums and you will be the first if he charged me again i wouldnt have any choice but to fight and he was at least as strong as me and far more experiencednot to mention the enchantmentbreaking silver sword in his hand if i didnt kill him fast he would kill me it was as simple as that and even if i did kill him he would spend his death curse on meand it wouldnt be like the feeble thing cassius had thrown morgan would obliterate me i couldnt run i couldnt survive fighting him regardless of whether or not i beat him the best i could hope for would be to take him with me if i died sue would go wild reverting to the instincts of her ancient spirit she would hunt people would die but if morgan died it would leave only kowalski and ramirez to stop cowl and grevane even if they could manage to pull off some kind of necromancy to shield them from the vortex as they went in they would never be able to beat the necromancers within they would certainly die and not long after that the darkhallow would annihilate thousands of innocent lives with morgan leading them they might have a chance not a good one but at least there was a chance which meant that if i wanted to stop the darkhallow and save all those lives i had only one choice i leaned my suddenly trembling hand against sues leg and she sank back into a passive crouch morgan let out a bellow of defiance and determination and rushed me i lowered my shield my heart pounded with a fear so strong that i nearly threw up the lightning gleamed on the silver blade of his sword i dropped my staff to the ground and faced him arms at my sides my hands clenched into terrified fists i readied my will my own death curse picturing grevane in my thoughts at least i could give the wardens a better chance for victory if i could kill or cripple one of the bastards on my way out time stretched out into an endless moment i watched morgans sword sweep up to the vertical the blade a gorgeous silver that reflected the lightning ripping apart the spinning vortex behind me harry butters screamed his voice horrified the drum pounding frantically as morgan struck i took the cowards way out and closed my eyes i knew that it was inevitable that one day i would die but i didnt want to watch it coming chapter fortyone a gunshot rang out morgan jerked at the hips suddenly thrown off balance he spun gracelessly and fell to the ground i stared at him in shock morgan let out a snarl fixed his eyes on me and lifted his right hand deep and terrifying power gathering in it morgan snapped a womans voice that voice rang with authority and confidence with command the speaker damned well knew that when she gave an order that it would be obeyed and imbued the command with a power that had nothing to do with magic stand down morgan froze for an instant and glanced over his shoulder ramirez stood twenty feet away his pistol smoking in his hand the other arm was supporting the weight of the girl i had known as the corpsetaker the girls face was as pale as death and she could not possibly have been standing on her own but though her features were exactly the same as when corpsetaker had been in the body she did not look like the same person her eyes were narrowed and hard and her expression was filled with a stern almost regal confidence you heard me the girl snapped stand down who are you morgan asked morgan ramirez said dresden was telling the truth this is captain luccio no morgan said shaking his head but his voice lacked his usual absolute conviction no its a lie its no lie ramirez said i soulgazed her its the captain morgans lips worked soundlessly but he didnt release the strike he held ready in his hand morgan the girl said quietly this time its all right stand down you arent the captain morgan mumbled you cant be its a trick the girl luccio abruptly put on a lopsided smile donald she said dear idiot im the one who trained you i am fairly certain that you do not know as much as i do about who i am luccio lifted her arm and showed morgan the silver rapier shed carried before she took it in her hand and whipped it in a circle eliciting a steady humming power as id felt before there could another so employ my own blade morgan stared at her for a moment then his hand dropped suddenly limp the power hed held draining away my heart started beating again and i leaned heavily against sues flank ramirez holstered his gun and helped the new luccio over to morgans side then lowered her gently to the ground beside him youre hurt morgan said his own face had gone white with pain how bad is it luccio tried a small smile im afraid i aimed too well the wound has done for me it may take some time thats all my god morgan said im sorry im so sorry i saw dresden shoot you and while you were bleeding needed help luccio raised a weak hand no time she said gently ramirez had bent over morgan meanwhile and was examining the gunshot wound the bullet had caught morgan in the back of one leg and it looked messy dammit ramirez said it hit his knee its shattered he placed his fingers lightly over morgans knee and the older warden abruptly twisted in pain his face gone bloodless he cant walk luccio nodded then its up to you she looked over at me and you warden dresden what about kowalski i said ramirez paled he glanced back at the apartment building and shook his head he was sitting on the floor when the specters rose out of it he never had a chance no time luccio said weakly you must go butters came marching over to us drum still beating his face pale okay he said im ready lets do it not you butters i said sue just needs to be able to hear the drum shell hear it over there just as well as if you were on her back i want you to stay here but i cant afford to spare effort to protect you i told him and i dont want to leave the wounded here alone just keep the drum beating but i want to go with you i want to help im not afraid tohe swallowed face paledie fighting beside you look at it this way i said if we blow it you get to die anyhow butters stared at me for a second and then said gee now i feel better i believe that theres a cloud for every silver lining i said come on ramirez ramirezs grin returned everyone else who lets me ride on their dinosaur calls me carlos i climbed back up into the first saddle and ramirez settled into the second god be with you harry butters said marching in place on the ground his face worried given whom i had chosen as my ally i sort of doubted that if god went with me it would be to assist me ill take whatever help i can get i said aloud and laid my hand on sues hide she lurched up from her crouch and i turned her toward the site of the vortex youre hurt ramirez said he kept his voice pitched very low i cant feel it i said ill worry about the rest if theres a later youve got great timing by the way thank you de nada he said i was right behind morgan i heard you trying to talk to him about luccio you believed me i started sue forward it would take her several steps to pick up speed rodriguez sighed ive heard a lot about you watched you at that council meeting my gut says youre okay it was worth checking out and you soulgazed her that was some fast thinking and good shooting im brilliant as well as skilled he said modestly its a great burden all of that on top of my angelic good looks but i try to soldier on as best i can i let out a short rough laugh i see i hope i wont embarrass you then did i not mention my nearly godlike sense of tolerance and forgiveness sue gathered speed and i turned her down the street hey he said the bad guys are back that way i know i said but theyre expecting an attack from that direction im going to circle the block try to come in behind them is there time my baby can move i told him sue broke into her run and the ride smoothed out ramirez let out a whoop of pure enjoyment now this is cool he said i cant even imagine how complicated this must have been wasnt complicated i told him oh so summoning up dinosaurs is actually very easy is it i snorted any other night any other place i dont think i could have done it but it wasnt complicated either lifting up an engine block isnt complicated its just a lot of work ramirez was silent for a moment im impressed he said i didnt know ramirez very well but my sense of him told me that those were words he was not in the habit of uttering when you do something stupid and die its pathetic i said when you do something stupid and survive it then you get to call it impressive or heroic he let out a rueful chuckle what were doing right now he said his voice softened and lost its edge of brash arrogance its pathetic isnt it probably i said on the other hand he said recovering if we survive it were heroes medals girls endorsements cars maybe they put us on a cereal box seems the least they could do i said so weve got two of them left to take down who do we hit first grevane i said if hes holding a bunch of zombies as guard dogs he isnt going to have a lot of attention to spare for defensive spells or for throwing anything else at us we hit him fast hopefully put him down before he can try anything he handled a chain like he knew how to use it when i saw him fight corpsetaker ugh ramirez said nasty anyone who knows their way around a kusari is a tough customer yeah so we shoot him damn right we shoot him ramirez said this is why so many of the younger members of the council like the way you do things dresden i blinked they do oh hell yes ramirez said a lot of them were apprentices when you were first tried after justin dumornes death like me a lot of them are still apprentices but there are people who think a lot of what youve done like you i would have done a lot of those things he said only with a lot more style than you i snorted second one well hit calls himself cowl hes good ive never seen a wizard stronger than he is and that includes ebenezar mccoy a lot of guys who hit hard have a glass jaw bet hes all offense i shook my head no hes just as good at protecting himself i nipped a car over on top of him and it barely slowed him down ramirez frowned and nodded how do we take him down then i shook my head havent thought of anything good hit him with everything and hope something gets through and if that wasnt enough hes got an apprentice with him called kumori who seems personally loyal shes probably strong enough to be on the council herself damn ramirez said quietly she pretty she keeps her face covered i said no idea if she was pretty id just turn on the ramirez charm and have her eating out of my hand he said but i cant take chances with that kind of power if im not sure shes pretty used recklessly it could endanger innocent bystanders or land me in bed with an ugly girl cant have that i said turning sue around another corner i checked the vortex the slender spinning psuedotornado was more than halfway to the ground all right then ramirez said once were past grevane ill take on the apprentice you go for cowl i glanced back at him with an arched eyebrow if we ignore kumori shell be free to take us both out one of us has to counter her youre stronger than me he said his tone matteroffact dont get me wrong im so damned good that i make it look easy but im not stupid you have the best shot at taking cowl down if i can drop the apprentice ill help sound like a plan sounds like a plan i said i just wish it sounded like a winning plan you got a better idea ramirez asked me cheerfully no i said and i turned sue down the street that would hopefully let us attack the necromancers from the rear well then he said his smile ferocious shut up and dance chapter fortytwo the campus of the college consisted of only a few buildingsa couple of dorms a couple of buildings with classrooms the mitchell museum and an administrative office the area between them was a nicely kept lawn too small to look like a park but larger than youd want to mow every week at the center of the area directly in front of the museum picnic tables had been overturned onto their sides around a large circle open to the skies above i slowed sues steps for a moment to try to get some kind of idea of what we had to contend with standing in silent ranks around that circle were grevanes style of undeadvery solid very physical though there were relatively few of them in the halfrotted or desiccated condition of the corpses that had attacked my place these undead looked like they might still have been saved by a snappy emt they all looked like native american tribesmen just as corpsetakers specters had though the styles of clothing and weaponry were slightly different one other thing was different too these undead radiated a kind of hideous ephemeral cold and their skin almost seemed to glow with its own pale horrible light i could sense the raw power that lay within them even from a hundred yards away these undead were different from those that had attacked the wardens as different as an old pickup truck was from a modern battle tank these zombies would not be so easily destroyed as those others and were likely to be far stronger far faster they stood in ranks around the inner circle facing outward but they ranked thicker between the circle and the last location of the wardens than on the side nearest us i had managed to outflank the thinking of whoever had those undead in position and the thought cheered me somewhat spirits and specters and formless masses of luminescent light darted and flowed around the circle like strands of kelp and bits of algae caught in a whirlpool they were all the same unpleasant colors as the lightning in the storm and even as i watched their numbers visibly grew sue paced a restless step forward and i felt a horrible sensation of cold on the skin of my face and forehead as if the hovering vortex above was casting out some kind of perverted inversion of sunlight i crouched a little lower on sues back and the feeling faded lightning flashes from different directions cast a web of shadows over the whole place trees and buildings collaborating with the storm to conceal much of the open circle continually clothed in shifting blocks and threads of darkness i could see that there was someone within the circle of picnic tables but not who and i couldnt even be sure of how many that i said in a low voice is a lot of badass zombies and ghosts ramirez said and ghosts look at it this way he said with that many of them how can we miss yeah i said cool i didnt want to do it i wanted to go find myself a hole and crawl into it but instead i put my hand on sues neck drew her attention to the zombies and willed her forward into battle sue leapt forward and hit the nearest rank of zombies before any of them had the chance to notice her she tore one apart with her vast jaws smashed several others flat crushed some with her flailing tail and generally went to town after her devastating initial charge i heard a frantic mans voice shout from within the circle and the zombies turned to attack the zombies whipped out bows and spears and clubs or else tore at sue with their bare hands it wasnt pretty arrows streaked through the air with unnatural speed and when they struck the tyrannosaurs hide they sounded almost like gunshots one zombie rammed a spear cleanly through the massive muscle of sues right thigh a swinging club shattered several of her teeth and even as i watched an unarmed zombie leapt up onto her flank got a hold of the heavy extension cord that held the saddles in place then drove his fist into her flesh up to the elbow and started raking out gobbets of tissue by the handful i brought up the sparkling blue cloud of my shield bracelet in time to intercept an arrow and others smashed against it with the force of bullets even as i held it in place without being told i felt ramirez turn to our right his own left hand extended and a concave disk of green light expanded weblike from his outstretched fingertips covering that flank from still more of them but as vicious and as strong and as swift and deadly as the zombies were they couldnt hold a candle to sue the injuries that might have terrified a living beast only infuriated her and as that rage swelled her own greyandblack hide gained a silvery sheen of power she roared so loudly that my chest and belly shook and my ears screamed with pain she caught one zombie in her jaws and flung it away it sailed up over the nearest fivestory building and out of sight in the darkness and rain when she stomped down with her foot she shattered the concrete of a walkway and drove a footprint more than a foot deep into the earth around it the zombie assault turned into one enormous exercise in suicidal tactics for whenever one of the undead warriors managed to get through to harm sue the tyrannosaur not only crushed the unlife out of them but grew that much more angry and powerful and unstoppable it was like riding a carnivorous earthquake look ramirez screamed look there i followed his nod and spotted grevane in the circle in his trench coat and fedora the necromancer was keeping a steady beat on a drum hung from his belt and he gripped a staff of gnarled twisted black wood with the other he stared at us his face twisted in hatred and his eyes glittered with insane malice i willed sue to head for the circle but the tyrannosaurs will was suddenly no longer pliable or easily led the blood rage and fury of battle had overloaded what little mind she actually possessed and now she was nothing but several rampaging tons of killing machine hurry ramirez shouted shes not listening i told him i applied my will even more forcefully but it was like one man struggling to hold back a bulldozer i gritted my teeth desperately trying to figure a way to get sue where i wanted her and hit on one idea instead of trying to stop her battle rage i encouraged it and then i pointed her at the zombies nearer to the circle sue responded with bloodlust and glee swerving to charge toward the zombies nearest the circle crushing and rekilling them as she went we have to jump i shouted wahoo ramirez cried his smile blazing white sue pursued a dodging zombie to within ten feet of one of the fallen picnic tables and i let out a scream of fear and excitement as i jumped it was like falling from a little bit higher than a secondstory window but i managed to land feetfirst and well enough to absorb most of the shock of impact though the flash of pain told me that my knees and ankles were going to be sore for days i rose and lifted my shield at once in time to intercept the deadly flash of grevanes whirling chain fool he snarled you should have joined me when you had the chance his eyes flicked up and glittered i followed the line of his gaze the vortex wasnt more than ten feet from the ground you cant draw it in if im standing right here i shouted back retreating and circling to get into the circle of picnic tables when i did that horrible sickly sense of cold faded this near the vortex wasnt drawing the life off of me it was the eye of the metaphysical hurricane one distraction and the backlash will kill you its over it is not over he howled and the chain whipped out again striking my shield it is mine my birthright i was his favored child i barely heard a footstep behind me and whirled in time to lift my shield against another zombie with a spear the weapon shattered against my upraised shield but even as it did i felt a burning impact as grevanes chain wrapped around my wounded leg and jerked hard my balance went out from under me and i fell to the ground grevanes zombie piled onto my back and started biting me i felt hot horrible pain on my trapezius muscles left of my neck even through my cloak and spellworked duster the zombie let out a vicious cry and let go then went for the unprotected nape of my neck i struggled to throw it off of me to get away but my battered body was weakened and it was incredibly strong die grevane screamed wild laughter in his unsteady voice die die die his howls broke off into a single quiet choking noise and the zombie on my back abruptly froze i struggled out from under it in time to see grevane standing a few feet away the chain discarded upon the ground his hand held to his neck blood black in the night sprayed from between his fingers his expression became enraged and he turned toward me extending a hand to the zombie near me the zombie turned once more with purpose but then grevanes expression became puzzled his eyes rolled back in his head and i saw the long straight smooth cut that had opened his neck from one side to the other cutting all the way to his spine ramirez stepped into my line of vision his silver sword in hand and coated with blood in his other hand he held his pistol without hesitation or hurry he raised the gun and aimed at grevanes head from five feet away then he executed the stunned necromancer the body went loose fell and lay there in the grass and rain one leg twitching around us the zombies had suddenly lost their vibrant animation and most of them simply stood passively still staring at nothing tyrannosaur sue couldnt have cared less and carried on with her killing spree ramirez came to me and helped me to my feet sorry it took me so long i had to dodge some bad guys you got here i said panting he nodded once grimacing couldnt shoot with you that close in this light had to do it the oldfashioned way you were one hell of a good distraction though you did fine i said i could feel hot wetness trickling down my back thank god he was insane hows that ramirez asked at the end there youd opened his throat but he still thought he could keep going he tried to hang on to his control of the zombies it was like he didnt think death counted when it came to him and thats lucky why he refused to believe he was dying i said no death curse ramirez nodded yeah youre right lucky us then a mans voice said i dont know if id say that gentlemen i whirled as one of the passive zombies still standing nearby turned lifting its spearand then shimmered into the form of cowl he lifted one hand from the folds of his dark cloak and there was no warning surge of gathering power when a wave of vicious force flickered out from his palm and took ramirez full in the chest the young warden hadnt been ready for it the magical blow lifted him from his feet and threw him backward like a rag doll he hit the ground twenty feet later limbs already flopping limply and lay there without moving no i shouted and i whirled on cowl hellfire erupting from the runes of my staff i lifted the staff snarled forzare and sent a lance of vicious energy at the dark figure cowl swiftly crossed his hands at the wrists forming an x shape with his arms aligning defensive energy before himbut he hadnt been quite swift enough or else he hadnt reckoned on how much energy he had to deal with the lash of raw scarlet force hammered him hard on the right side of his body spinning him around and stealing his balance he stumbled in a corkscrewing motion and went to the ground i drew back the staff for another blowbut then someone pressed against my back fingers tightened in my hair and i felt the cold deadly edge of a knife at my throat dont move kumoris quiet voice said she was stretched out quite a bit to be pulling my hair and holding the knife but shed done it right there was no way i could try to escape her without her opening an artery i ground my teeth my power still ready to lash out again and debated doing exactly that kumori would probably kill me but it might be worth it to finish cowl i looked up at the writhing vortex its tip was now barely above the height of my own head cowl recovered his feet by slow degrees shaken more than hurt and anger radiated from him in nearly palpable waves idiot he said voice harsh you have lost can you not see this game is over dont do this i growled it isnt worth it youre going to kill thousands of innocent people cowls hood tilted up toward the descending vortex and he marched over the grass until he stood directly beneath it keep him still he snapped to kumori yes lord kumori replied the steel at my throat never wavered cowls hand dipped into a pouch at his side and came out holding bob the skull the lights in the skulls eye sockets burned a cold shade of blue and violet there spirit cowl said holding the skull up to see the vortex do you see it of course said the skull his voice just as cold and empty it is precisely as the master described proceed the eye lights swiveled and came to rest on me ah the white councils black sheep i recommend that you kill him immediately no kumori said firmly his death curse could destroy the working i know that the skull replied his voice contemptuous but if he lives when cowl draws down the power he might disrupt it kill him now silence spirit cowl said in a harsh voice you are not the master here challenge me again at your own peril the skulls eye sockets burned colder yet but he said nothing i swallowed bob wasnt bob anymore id known that he was bound and beholden to whoever possessed the skull he resided within and that their personality would strongly influence his ownbut id never really imagined what that might be like bob wasnt precisely a friend to me but i was used to him in a way he was family the mouthy annoying irritable cousin who was always insulting you but who was definitely at thanksgiving dinner i had never considered the possibility that one day he might be something else something murderous the worst part was that bob had given cowl good advice my death curse might well mess up this spell but on the other hand cowl did not seem one to be afraid of death curses if he gave me the chance to wait until he was actually at the delicate moment of drawing down the power i wouldnt need anything as strong as a death curse to upset his balance of course it would kill me kumoris blade would see to that but i could stop him if i was alive when it went down cowl set the skull aside on the grass then raised his hands above his head and let the sleeves fall back from his long weathered arms covered in old scars he began a chant in a low voice steady and strong the vortex quivered and then almost delicately it began to descend to cowl drifting toward him as lightly and slowly as a drifting feather of down power rolled through the heavens the clouds the whirling vortex spirits and swirling apparitions screamed and wailed their tormented replies kumoris hands never weakened or wavered but i could sense that almost every fiber of her attention was directed toward cowl i might have one chance bob i said bob the blue eye lights turned toward me think i said quietly think bob you know me youve worked with me for years the blue eye lights narrowed bob i said quietly youve got to remember me i gave you a name the skull quivered a little as if a shudder had run through it but the eyes continued to burn cold and blue and then one of them flickered into a shade of its usual orange then immediately back to cold blue my heart thudded in sudden excitement bob the skull my bob had just winked at me cowl continued his chant and the clouds spun more and more rapidly the rain abruptly stopped as swiftly as if someone had turned off a faucet and the air filled with spirits ghosts apparitions and specters caught in some vast and unseen whirlpool that dragged them in accelerating circles the power in the air made it hard to breathe and the roar of wailing spirits vast wind and an earthdeep rumble grew steadily louder bob i shouted into the cacophony you have my permission orange light streaked from the eye sockets of the skull and blazed away from the circle of overturned picnic tablesbut even so i saw bobs glowing body of energy pulled by the whirling currents of magic he fought against that horrible vortex and i suddenly realized that without the shelter of the skull or some other kind of physical body bob was no different from any of the other spirit beings trapped in that vast maelstrom if the darkhallow was completed he too would be trapped and devoured i thought i saw bobs form sucked up into the clouds of trapped spirits but there was too much light and noise for me to be sure of anything cowl kept on chanting and i saw his body arch with tension over the next minute or so he actually physically rose above the ground until his boots were three or four inches in the air his voice had become part of the wild storm part of the dark energy and it rolled and boomed and echoed all around us i began to understand the kind of power we were dealing with it was power as deep as an ocean and as broad as the sky it was dark and lethal and horrible and beautiful and cowl was about to take it all in the strength it would give him would not make him a match for the entire white council it would put him in a league so far beyond them that their strength would mean virtually nothing it was power enough to change the world to reshape it after ones own liking the tip of the vortex spun down danced lightly upon cowls lips and then slipped gently between them cowl howled out the last repetition of his chant his mouth opening wide i ground my teeth bob hadnt been able to help me and i couldnt let cowl complete the spell even if it killed me i drew in my magic for the last spell i would ever throw a blast to slam into cowl disrupt the spell let that vast energy tear him to bits kumori sensed it and i heard her let out a short cry the knife burned hot on my throat and then the dinosaur id summoned plunged through the clouds of wild spirits and headed directly for kumori her eyes blazing with brilliant orange flames tyrannosaur bob let out a bellow and swiped one enormous talon at kumori cowls apprentice was tough and competent but no amount of training or forethought can prepare you for the sight of an angry dinosaur coming to eat your ass she froze for the briefest second and i turned shoving away from her the knife whipped against my throat and i felt a hot sting i wondered if that was what grevane had felt there was no more time i flung myself across the grass gripped my staff in both hands and swung it like a baseball bat at cowls head the blow connected right on what felt like the tip of his upturned jaw snapping his mouth shut and knocking him to the ground the vortex abruptly screamed and filled with a furious red light i choked out a cry and fell down on my right side to the ground bringing up my shield bracelet and holding it over me in an effort to protect myself from the vast forces now flying free from the botched spell there was more sound so loud that no word could accurately describe it incandescent lightning screaming faces and forms of spirits and ghosts and trembling earth beneath me and blackness fell chapter fortythree when i came to my senses there was darkness and steady cold rain and i had sunk up to my neck in a deep well of aching pain neither lightning nor thunder played through the skies i lay there for a moment gathering my wits and as i did the lights of the city began to come on bit by bit as the power grids went back online a booted foot pressed into the ground beside my face and i followed it up up and up until i saw the horned helmet of the erlking outlined against the brightening chicago skyline wizard called you forth a mighty hunter tonight one that has not walked this earth since time gone and forgotten yeah i said pretty nifty huh there was a low wild laugh from that helmet daring arrogant it pleases me he tilted his head and you are poor game at the moment because of that and because you pleased me with your calling of the old hunter this night you may go free but beware mortal the next time our paths cross it shall be my very great pleasure to run you down there was a gust of cold autumn wind and the erlking was gone i looked around blearily every tree in the area was gone torn off about a foot from the earth the picnic tables had been torn to splinters the buildings of the college especially the museum looked as if they had been ravaged by a tornado that had torn out great chunks and sections of them my ribs hurt i looked down and saw that i had fallen around bob the skull and curled my body around him as i had shielded myself orange flame flickered to life in the eye sockets some show huh bob said he sounded exhausted you had to go get the dinosaur eh i said i figured youd just grab a handy zombie why settle for wieners when you can have steak the skull said brightly pretty good idea harry talking to me once cowl sat me on the ground i didnt want to work for him anyway but as long as he had the skull well you know how it is i grunted yeah what happened the spell backlashed when you slugged cowl bob said did just a bit of property damage i coughed out a little laugh looking around me yeah cowl most likely there are little pieces of him still filtering down bob said brightly and his little dog too you see them die i asked well no once that backlash came down it tore apart every enchantment within a hundred miles your dinosaur sort of fell apart i grunted uneasily oh bob said i think that warden over there is alive i blinked ramirez yeah bob said i figured that you were a warden now and stuff and that you would probably want me to help out some other warden so just before the big bang i had the dinosaur stand over him soak up the blast i grunted okay i said weve got to help him but one thing first whats that bob asked i squinted around until i found grevanes battered corpse then i crawled over to it i fumbled in the trench coats pockets until i found kemmlers slender little book i squinted around me but there was no one to look as i put it in my pocket okay i said come on watch my back while i help ramirez you betcha boss bob said and his voice was very smug hey you know what size really does matter ramirez made it out of that evening alive he had four broken ribs and two dislocated shoulders but he came through with butterss help i was able to get him luccio and morgan back to my place at some point in the evening butters had taken off his drum and let morgan take over the drumming duties while he tried to help luccio and as a result her wound hadnt been quite as fatal as she had thought it would be they were far too badly hurt to stay at my place though and senior council member injun joe listenstowind himself showed up with half a dozen more stayathome wizards who knew something about medicine and healing to move them to a more secure location just dont get it morgan was telling listenstowind all of these things happening at once it cant be a coincidence it wasnt i heard myself say morgan looked at me the resentment in his eyes hadnt changed but there was something else there that hadnt been beforedare i hope it some modicum of respect think about it i said all those heavy vampire attacks just when cowl and his buddies most needed the white council not to be involved are you saying that you think cowl was using the vampires as a tool morgan asked i think they had a deal i said the vampires throw their first major offensive at the right time to let cowl pull off this darkhallow but what do they get out of it morgan asked i glanced at listenstowind and said the senior council impossible morgan said by that time they had to know that the senior council was back at edinburgh the defenses there have been built over thousands of years it would take morgan paused frowning i finished the sentence for him it would take a god to break through them and kill the senior council morgan stared at me for a long time but didnt say anything it wasnt long before they left pulling out the wounded wardens and leaving it left me with only about half an hour to meet mavras deadline but since the phones were up again i left a message at her number and headed for our rendezvous i turned up at my grave again standing over the open hole in the ground as mavra approached me this time openly and without melodrama she faced me over my grave and said nothing i took the book out of my pocket and tossed it to her she picked it up regarded it and then drew an envelope from her jacket and tossed it at my feet i picked it up and found the negatives of the incriminating pictures of murphy inside mavra turned to leave i said wait she paused this never happens again i said quietly you try to get to me through other mortals again and ill kill you mavras rotted lips turned up at one corner no you wont she said in her dusty voice you dont have that kind of power i can get it i said but you wont she responded mockery in her tone it wouldnt be right i stared at her for a full ten seconds before i said in a very quiet voice ive got a fallen angel tripping all over herself to give me more power queen mab has asked me to take the mantle of winter knight twice now ive read kemmlers book i know how the darkhallow works and i know how to turn necromancy against the black court mavras filmed eyes flashed with anger i continued to speak quietly never raising my voice so once again let me be perfectly clear if anything happens to murphy and i even think you had a hand in it fuck right and wrong if you touch her im declaring war on you personally im picking up every weapon i can get and im using them to kill you horribly there was utter silence for a moment do you understand me i whispered she nodded say it i snarled and my voice came out so harsh and cold that mavra twitched and took half a step back from me i understand she rasped get out of my town i told her and mavra retreated into the shadows i stood there over my grave for a minute more just feeling the pain of my battered body and bitterly considering the inevitability of death after a moment i felt another presence near me i looked up and found the dream image of my father regarding my tombstone speculatively he died doing the right thing my father read maybe i can change it to he died alone i said back my father smiled a little thinking about the death curse eh yeah die alone i stared down at my open grave maybe it means ill never be with anybody have love a wife children no one who is really close really there maybe my father said what do you think i think thats what he wanted to do to me i think im so tired that im hallucinating and that i hurt and that i want someone to be holding my hand when its my time i dont want to do it alone harry my dad said and his voice was very gentle can i tell you something sure he walked around the grave and put his hand on my shoulder son everyone dies alone thats what it is its a door its one person wide when you go through it you do it alone his fingers squeezed me tight but it doesnt mean youve got to be alone before you go through the door and believe me you arent alone on the other side i frowned and looked up at my fathers image searching his eyes really he smiled and drew his finger in an x on his chest cross my heart i looked away from him i did things i made a deal i shouldnt have made i crossed a line i know he said it only means what you decide it means i looked up at him what harry life isnt simple there is such a thing as black and white right and wrong but when youre in the thick of things sometimes its hard for us to tell you didnt do what you did for your own benefit you did it so that you could protect others that doesnt make it rightbut it doesnt make you a monster either you still have free will you still get to choose what you will do and what you will be and what you will become he clapped my shoulder and turned to walk away as long as you believe you are responsible for your choices you still are youve got a good heart son listen to it he vanished into the night and somewhere in the city bells started tolling midnight i stared at my waiting grave and i suddenly realized that death was really not my biggest worry he died doing the right thing god i hope so thomas was waiting back at my apartment when i returned and mouse came loping in not long after murphys bike had failed him completely and by the time hed reached the college campus the fur had flown and the whole show was over i crashed hard and slept for more than a day when i woke up i found that my injuries had all been dressed again and that an iv was hanging beside my bed butters showed up every day to check on me and he had me on antibiotics and had imposed a ferociously healthy diet on me that thomas made me stick to i grumbled a lot and slept a lot and after several days was feeling almost human again murphy showed up to chew me out for the wreck she found where her house used to be wed left the place sort of trashed but when she saw me in bed covered in bandages she stopped in her tracks what happened she asked oh things i said chicago was interesting for a couple of days there i peered at her she had a cast on her left arm as if for a broken wrist and i thought i saw the edge of a bruise on her neck hey i said what happened her cheeks turned pink oh things hawaii was interesting for a couple of days there ill trade you my story for yours i said she got pinker um ill have to think about it then we both looked at each other and laughed and we left it at that chicago reacted to the events of that halloween predictably it was all attributed to the worst storm in fifty years rioting a minor earth tremor a large load of bread produced by a local bakery that had been contaminated with ergot and similar halloweenfueled hysteria in the blackout some reprehensible types had vandalized the museum and relocated sues skeleton to a local campus as some kind of bizarre practical joke there had been dozens of breakins robberies murders and other crimes during the blackout but any other reports and wild stories were automatically put down to hysteria andor ergot poisoning life went on captain luccio survived her injuries but not without serious longterm damage that would take a lot of rehabilitation between that and the uncertainty of what would happen in her shiny new body she had been relieved of command as the captain of the wardens until such time as her health and state of mind were judged to be sound and reliable morgan took her place he came to visit me at my place maybe two weeks later and gave me the news dresden he said i was against inducting you in the first place but captain luccio had the right to ignore my recommendation she made you a warden and she made you a regional commander and theres nothing i can do about that he took a deep breath but i dont like you i think you are dangerous his mouth twisted but i am no longer convinced you do these things out of malice i think you lack discipline and judgment you have repeatedly demonstrated your willingness to put yourself in harms way to protect others as much as it galls me to admit it i dont think you have any evil intentions i think your questionable actions are the result of arrogance and poor judgment in the end it matters little why you do it but i cannot in good conscience condemn you for it without giving you some sort of chance to prove me wrong from morgan this was the equivalent of emperor constantine converting to christianity he was almost admitting that he had been wrong i reached into my pocket pulled out a penny and dropped it to the floor what was that for he asked im just making sure gravity is still online i said he frowned at me then shrugged and said i dont trust you im not committing any wardens to your command and truth be told we dont have them to spare in any case but you may be required to participate in missions from time to time and i will expect you to work with the other regional commander in america he operates out of los angeles he specifically requested the assignment and given his role in recent events he could hardly be gainsaid ramirez i guessed morgan nodded then he reached into his coat and produced an envelope he handed it to me whats this i asked your first paycheck morgan said and he didnt look happy to be saying it monthly i opened the envelope and blinked it wasnt a fortune but it sure as hell would be a nice little addition to my earnings in the investigation business i never thought i would hear myself say this i said as he started to leave but thank you morgan his face twisted up into something bitter and he managed to spit out the words youre welcome i think he fled before he started to puke several weeks later butters showed up at my door with a big box wrapped in christmas paper i let him in and he carried it to the living room and presented me with it go ahead open it i did inside the box was a guitar case and inside that an old wooden guitar uh i said whats this for therapy butters said hed been having me practice squeezing a squishy ball with my left hand and just as hed predicted i had slowly gained a little more control of it youre going to learn to play uh my hand doesnt work that well i said not yet butters replied but well start slow like everything else and you can work up to it just do the lessons look theres a book in the bottom of the case i opened the case and found a book entitled guitar for total idiots while butters went on about tendons and metacarpal somethingorother and flexibility i opened the book but night had fallen and the fire was too low to let me read it i absently waved a hand at the candles on the table beside the couch and muttered flickum bicus they puffed to light with a little whoosh of magic i stopped and blinkedfirst at the candles and then at my burned hand what butters asked nothing i said and opened the book to look over it you know butters for a mortician youre a pretty good healer you think so i glanced at the warm steady flame of the candles and smiled yeah authors note when i was seven years old i got a bad case of strep throat and was out of school for a whole week during that time my sisters bought me my first fantasy and scifi novels the boxed set of lord of the rings and the boxed set of the han solo adventure novels by brian daley i devoured them all during that week from that point on i was pretty much doomed to join sf ampf fandom from there it was only one more step to decide i wanted to be a writer of my favorite fiction material and here we are i blame my sisters my first love as a fan is swordsandhorses fantasy after tolkien i went after c s lewis after lewis it was lloyd alexander after them came fritz leiber roger zelazny robert howard john norman pol anderson david eddings weis and hickman terry brooks elizabeth moon glen cook and before i knew it i was a dual citizen of the united states and lankhmar narnia gor cimmeria krynn amber you get the picture when i set out to become a writer i spent years writing swordsandhorses fantasy novelsand seemed to have little innate talent for it but i worked at my writing branching out into other areas as experiments including sf mystery and contemporary fantasy thats how the dresden files initially came aboutas a happy accident while trying to accomplish something else sort of like penicillin but i never forgot my first love and to my immense delight and excitement one day i got a call from my agent and found out that i was going to get to share my newest swordsandhorses fantasy novel with other fans the codex alera is a
