robin cook chromosome prologue march pm cogo equatorial guinea given a phd in molecular biology from mit that had been earned in close cooperation with the massachusetts general hospital kevin marshall found his squeamishness regarding medical procedures a distinct embarrassment although hed never admitted it to anyone just having a blood test or a vaccination was an ordeal for him needles were his specific bÃªte noire the sight of them caused his legs to go rubbery and a cold sweat to break out on his broad forehead once hed even fainted in college after getting a measles shot at age thirtyfour after many years of postgraduate biomedical research some of it involving live animals hed expected to outgrow his phobia but it hadnt happened and it was for that reason he was not in operating room a or b at the moment instead hed chosen to remain in the intervening scrub room where he was leaning against the scrub sink a vantage that allowed him to look through angled windows into both orsuntil he felt the need to avert his eyes the two patients had been in their respective rooms for about a quarter hour in preparation for their respective procedures the two surgical teams were quietly conversing while standing off to the side they were gowned and gloved and ready to commence thered been little technical conversation in the ors except between the anesthesiologist and the two anesthetists as the patients were inducted under general anesthesia the lone anesthesiologist had slipped back and forth between the two rooms to supervise and to be available at any sign of trouble but there was no trouble at least not yet nonetheless kevin felt anxious to his surprise he did not experience the same sense of triumph he had enjoyed during three previous comparable procedures when hed exalted in the power of science and his own creativity instead of jubilation kevin felt a mushrooming unease his discomfort had started almost a week previously but it was now watching these patients and contemplating their different prognoses that kevin felt the disquietude with disturbing poignancy the effect was similar to his thinking about needles perspiration appeared on his forehead and his legs trembled he had to grasp the edge of the scrub sink to steady himself the door to operating room a opened suddenly startling kevin he was confronted by a figure whose pale blue eyes were framed by a hood and a face mask recognition was rapid it was candace brickmann one of the surgical nurses the ivs are all started and the patients are asleep candace said are you sure you dont want to come in youll be able to see much better thank you but im fine right here kevin said suit yourself candace said the door swung shut behind candace as she returned to one of the surgeries kevin watched her scurry across the room and say something to the surgeons their response was to turn in kevins direction and give him a thumbsup sign kevin selfconsciously returned the gesture the surgeons went back to their conversation but the effect of the wordless communication with kevin magnified his sense of complicity he let go of the scrub sink and took a step backward his unease was now tinged with fear what had he done spinning on his heels kevin fled from the scrub room and then from the operating suite a puff of air followed him as he left the mildly positive pressure aseptic or area and entered his gleaming futuristic laboratory he was breathing heavily as if out of breath from exertion on any other day merely walking into his domain would have filled him with anticipation just at the thought of the discoveries awaiting his magic hand the series of rooms literally bristled with hitech equipment the likes of which used to be the focus of his fantasies now these sophisticated machines were at his beck and call day and night absently he ran his fingers lightly along the stainlesssteel cowlings casually brushing the analogue dials and digital displays as he headed for his office he touched the hundredandfiftythousanddollar dna sequencer and the fivehundredthousanddollar globular nmr machine that sprouted a tangle of wires like a giant sea anemone he glanced at the pcrs whose red lights blinked like distant quasars announcing successive dnastrand doublings it was an environment that had previously filled kevin with hope and promise but now each eppendorf microcentrifuge tube and each tissueculture flask stood as mute reminders of the building foreboding he was experiencing advancing to his desk kevin looked down at his gene map of the short arm of chromosome his area of principal interest was outlined in red it was the major histocompatibility complex the problem was that the mhc was only a small portion of the short arm of chromosome there were large blank areas that represented millions and millions of base pairs and hence hundreds of other genes kevin did not know what they did a recent request for information concerning these genes that hed put out over the internet had resulted in some vague replies several researchers had responded that the short arm of chromosome contained genes that were involved with muscularskeletal development but that was it there were no details kevin shuddered involuntarily he raised his eyes to the large picture window above his desk as usual it was streaked with moisture from the tropical rain that swept across the view in undulating sheets the droplets slowly descended until enough had fused to reach a critical mass then they raced off the surface like sparks from a grinding wheel kevins eyes focused into the distance the contrast between the gleaming airconditioned interior with the outside world was always a shock roiling gunmetal gray clouds filled the sky despite the fact that the dry season was supposed to have begun three weeks previously the land was dominated by riotous vegetation that was so dark green as to almost appear black along the edge of the town it rose up like a gigantic threatening tidal wave kevins office was in the hospitallaboratory complex that was one of the few new structures in the previously decaying and deserted spanish colonial town of cogo in the littleknown african country of equatorial guinea the building was three stories tall kevins office was on the top floor facing southeast from his window he could see a good portion of the town as it sprawled haphazardly toward the estuario del muni and its contributory rivers some of the neighboring buildings had been renovated some were in the process but most had not been touched a half dozen previously handsome haciendas were enveloped by vines and roots of vegetation that had gone wild over the whole scene hung the perennial mist of supersaturated warm air in the immediate foreground kevin could see beneath the arched arcade of the old town hall in the shadows were the inevitable handful of equatoguinean soldiers in combat fatigues with aks haphazardly slung over their shoulders as usual they were smoking arguing and consuming cameroonean beer finally kevin let his eyes wander beyond the town hed been unconsciously avoiding doing so but now he focused on the estuary whose rainlashed surface looked like beaten tin directly south he could just make out the forested shoreline of gabon looking to the east he followed the trail of islands that stretched toward the interior of the continent on the horizon he could see the largest of the islands isla francesca named by the portuguese in the fifteenth century in contrast to the other islands isla francesca had a junglecovered limestone escarpment that ran down its center like the backbone of a dinosaur kevins heart skipped a beat despite the rain and the mist he could see what hed feared hed see just like a week ago there was the unmistakable wisp of smoke lazily undulating toward the leaden sky kevin slumped into his desk chair and cradled his head in his hands he asked himself what hed done having minored in the classics as an undergraduate he knew about greek myths now he questioned if hed made a promethean mistake smoke meant fire and he had to wonder if it was the proverbial fire inadvertently stolen from the gods pm boston massachusetts while a cold march wind rattled the storm windows taylor devonshire cabot reveled in the security and warmth of his walnutpaneled study in his sprawling manchesterbythesea home north of boston massachusetts harriette livingston cabot taylors wife was in the kitchen supervising the final stages of dinner scheduled to be served at seventhirty sharp on the arm of taylors chair balanced a cutcrystal glass of neat singlemalt whiskey a fire crackled in the fireplace as wagner played on the stereo the volume turned low in addition there were three builtin televisions tuned respectively to a local news station cnn and espn taylor was the picture of contentment hed spent a busy but productive day at the world headquarters of gensys a relatively new biotechnology firm hed started eight years previously the company had constructed a new building along the charles river in boston to take advantage of the proximity of both harvard and mit for recruitment purposes the evening commute had been easier than usual and taylor hadnt had time to finish his scheduled reading knowing his employers habits rodney his driver had apologized for getting taylor home so quickly im sure youll be able to come up with a significant delay tomorrow night to make up taylor had quipped ill do my best rodney had responded so taylor wasnt listening to the stereo or watching the tvs instead he was carefully reading the financial report scheduled to be released at the gensys stockholders meeting scheduled the following week but that didnt mean he was unaware of what was going on around him he was very much aware of the sound of the wind the sputtering of the fire the music and alert to the various reporters banters on the tvs so when the name carlo franconi was mentioned taylors head snapped up the first thing taylor did was lift the remote and turn up the sound of the central television it was the local news on the cbs affiliate the anchors were jack williams and liz walker jack williams had mentioned the name carlo franconi and was going on to say that the station had obtained a videotape of the killing of this known mafia figure who had some association with boston crime families this tape is quite graphic jack warned parental discretion is recommended you might remember that a few days ago we reported that the ailing franconi had disappeared after his indictment and many had feared hed jumped bail but then hed just reappeared yesterday with the news that hed struck a deal with the new york citys das office to pleabargain and enter the witnessprotection program however this evening while emerging from a favorite restaurant the indicted racketeer was fatally shot taylor was transfixed as he watched an amateur video of an overweight man emerge from a restaurant accompanied by several people who looked like policemen with a casual wave the man acknowledged the crowd whod assembled and then headed to an awaiting limousine he assiduously ignored questions from any journalists angling to get close to him just as he was bending to enter the car franconis body jerked and he staggered backward with his hand clasping the base of his neck as he fell to his right his body jerked again before hitting the ground the men whod accompanied him had drawn their guns and were frantically turning in all directions the pursuing journalists had all hit the deck whoa jack commented what a scene sorta reminds me of the killing of lee harvey oswald so much for police protection i wonder what effect this will have on future similar witnesses liz asked not good im sure jack said taylors eyes immediately switched to cnn which was at that moment about to show the same video he watched the sequence again it made him wince at the end of the tape cnn went live to a reporter outside the office of the chief medical examiner for the city of new york the question now is whether there were one or two assailants the reporter said over the sound of the traffic on first avenue its our impression that franconi was shot twice the police are understandably chagrined over this episode and have refused to speculate or offer any information whatsoever we do know that an autopsy is scheduled for tomorrow morning and we assume that ballistics will answer the question taylor turned down the sound on the television then picked up his drink walking to the window he gazed out at the angry dark sea franconis death could mean trouble he looked at his watch it was almost midnight in west africa snatching up the phone taylor called the operator at gensys and told him he wanted to speak with kevin marshall immediately replacing the receiver taylor returned his gaze out the window hed never felt completely comfortable about this project although financially it was looking very profitable he wondered if he should stop it the phone interrupted his thoughts picking the receiver back up taylor was told that mr marshall was available after some static kevins sleepy voice crackled over the line is this really taylor cabot kevin asked do you remember a carlo franconi taylor demanded ignoring kevins question of course kevin said hes been murdered this afternoon taylor said theres an autopsy scheduled for the morning in new york city what i want to know is could that be a problem there was a moment of silence taylor was about to question whether the connection had been broken when kevin spoke up yes it could be a problem kevin said someone could figure out everything from an autopsy its possible kevin said i wouldnt say probable but it is possible i dont like possible taylor said he disconnected from kevin and called the operator back at gensys taylor said he wanted to speak immediately to dr raymond lyons he emphasized that it was an emergency new york city excuse me the waiter whispered hed approached dr lyons from the left side having waited for a break in the conversation the doctor was engaged in with his young blond assistant and current lover darlene poison between his gracefully graying hair and conservative apparel the good doctor looked like the quintessential soapopera physician he was in his early fifties tall tanned and enviably slender with refined patrician good looks im sorry to intrude the waiter continued but there is an emergency call for you can i offer you our cordless phone or would you prefer to use the phone in the hall raymonds blue eyes darted back and forth between darlenes affable but bland face and the considerate waiter whose impeccable demeanor reflected aureoles service rating in zagats restaurant guide raymond did not look happy perhaps i should tell them you are not available the waiter suggested no ill take the cordless raymond said he couldnt imagine who could be calling him on an emergency basis raymond had not been practicing medicine since hed lost his medical license after having been convicted of a major medicare scam hed been carrying on for a dozen years hello raymond said with a degree of trepidation this is taylor cabot theres a problem raymond visibly stiffened and his brow furrowed taylor quickly summarized the carlo franconi situation and his call to kevin marshall this operation is your baby taylor concluded irritably and let me warn you it is small potatoes in the grand scheme of things if there is trouble ill scrap the entire enterprise i dont want bad publicity so handle it but what can i do raymond blurted out frankly i dont know taylor said but youd better think of something and youd better do it fast things couldnt be going any better from my end raymond interjected just today i made positive contact with a physician in la who treats a lot of movie stars and wealthy west coast businessmen shes interested in setting up a branch in california maybe you didnt hear me taylor said there isnt going to be a branch anyplace if this franconi problem isnt resolved so youd better get busy id say you have about twelve hours the resounding click of the disconnection made raymonds head jerk he looked at the phone as if it had been responsible for the precipitate termination of the conversation the waiter whod retreated to an appropriate distance stepped forward to retrieve the phone before disappearing trouble darlene questioned oh god raymond voiced nervously he chewed the quick of his thumb it was more than trouble it was potential disaster with his attempts at retrieving his medical license tied up in the quagmire of the judicial system his current work situation was all he had and things had only recently been clicking it had taken him five years to get where he was he couldnt let it all go down the drain what is it darlene asked she reached out and pulled raymonds hand away from his mouth raymond quickly explained about the upcoming autopsy on carlo franconi and repeated taylor cabots threat to scrap the entire enterprise but its finally making big money darlene said he wont scrap it raymond gave a short mirthless laugh it isnt big money to someone like taylor cabot and gensys he said hed scrap it for certain hell it was difficult to talk him into it in the first place then you have to tell them not to do the autopsy darlene said raymond stared at his companion he knew she meant well and hed never been attracted to her for her brain power so he resisted lashing out but his reply was sarcastic you think i can just call up the medical examiners office and tell them not to do an autopsy on such a case give me a break but you know a lot of important people darlene persisted ask them to call please dear raymond said condescendingly but then he paused he began to think that unwittingly darlene had a point an idea began to germinate what about dr levitz darlene said he was mr franconis doctor maybe he could help i was just thinking the same thing raymond said dr daniel levitz was a park avenue physician with a big office high overhead and a dwindling patient base thanks to managed care hed been easy to recruit and had been one of the first doctors to join the venture on top of that hed brought in many clients some of them in the same business as carlo franconi raymond stood up extracted his wallet and plopped three crisp onehundreddollar bills on the table he knew that was more than enough for the tab and a generous tip come on he said weve got to make a house call but i havent finished my entree darlene complained raymond didnt respond instead he whisked darlenes chair out from the table forcing her to her feet the more he thought about dr levitz the more he thought the man could be the savior as the personal physician of a number of competing new york crime families levitz knew people who could do the impossible chapter march am new york city jack stapleton bent over and put more muscle into his pedaling as he sprinted the last block heading east along thirtieth street about fifty yards from first avenue he sat up and coasted nohands before beginning to brake the upcoming traffic light was not in his favor and even jack wasnt crazy enough to sail out into the mix of cars buses and trucks racing uptown the weather had warmed considerably and the five inches of slush that had fallen two days previously was gone save for a few dirty piles between parked cars jack was pleased the roads were clear since hed not been able to commute on his bike for several days the bike was only three weeks old it was a replacement for one that had been stolen a year previously originally jack had planned on replacing the bike immediately but hed changed his mind after a terrifyingly close encounter with death made him temporarily conservative about risk the episode had nothing to do with bike riding in the city but nonetheless it scared him enough to acknowledge that his riding style had been deliberately reckless but time dimmed jacks fears the final prod came when he lost his watch and wallet in a subway mugging a day later jack bought himself a new cannondale mountain bike and as far as his friends were concerned he was up to his old tricks in reality he was no longer tempting fate by squeezing between speeding delivery vans and parked cars he no longer slalomed down second avenue and for the most part he stayed out of central park after dark jack came to a stop at the corner to wait for the light and as his foot touched down on the pavement he surveyed the scene almost at once he became aware of a bevy of tv vans with extended antennae parked on the east side of first avenue in front of his destination the office of the chief medical examiner for the city of new york or what some people called simply the morgue jack was an associate medical examiner and hed been in that position for almost a year and a half so hed seen such journalistic congestion on numerous occasions generally it meant that there had been a death of a celebrity or at least someone made momentarily famous by the media if it wasnt a single death then it was a mass disaster like an airplane crash or a train wreck for reasons both personal and public jack hoped it was the former with a green light jack pedaled across first avenue and entered the morgue through the receiving dock on thirtieth street he parked his bike in his usual location near the hart island coffins used for the unclaimed dead and took the elevator up to the first floor it was immediately apparent to jack that the place was in a minor uproar several of the day secretaries were busily manning the phones in the communications room they normally didnt arrive until eight their consoles were awash with blinking red lights even sergeant murphys cubicle was open and the overhead light was on and his usual modus operandi was to arrive sometime after nine with curiosity mounting jack entered the id room and headed directly for the coffeepot vinnie amendola one of the mortuary techs was hiding behind his newspaper as per usual but that was the only normal circumstance for that time of the morning generally jack was the first pathologist to arrive but on this particular day the deputy chief dr calvin washington dr laurie montgomery and dr chet mcgovern were already there the three were involved in a deep discussion along with sergeant murphy and to jacks surprise detective lieutenant lou soldano from homicide lou was a frequent visitor to the morgue but certainly not at seventhirty in the morning on top of that he looked like hed never been to bed or if he had hed slept in his clothes jack helped himself to coffee no one acknowledged his arrival after adding a dollop of halfandhalf as well as a cube of sugar to his cup jack wandered to the door to the lobby he glanced out and as hed expected the area was filled to overflowing with media people talking among themselves and drinking takeout coffee what he didnt expect was that many were also smoking cigarettes since smoking was strictly taboo jack told vinnie to go out there and inform them youre closer vinnie said without looking up from his newspaper jack rolled his eyes at vinnies lack of respect but had to admit vinnie was right so jack walked over to the locked glass door and opened it before he could call out his no smoking pronouncement he was literally mobbed jack had to push the microphones away that were thrust into his face the simultaneous questions precluded any real comprehension of what the questions were other than about an anticipated autopsy jack shouted at the top of his lungs that there was no smoking then had to literally peel hands off his arm before he was able to get the door closed on the other side the reporters surged forward pressing colleagues roughly against the glass like tomatoes in a jar of preserves disgusted jack returned to the id room will someone clue me in to whats going on he called out everyone turned in jacks direction but laurie was the first to respond you havent heard now would i be asking if id heard jack said its been all over the tv for crissake calvin snapped jack doesnt own a tv laurie said his neighborhood wont allow it where do you live son sergeant murphy asked ive never heard of neighbors not allowing each other to have a television the aging redfaced irish policeman had a pronounced paternal streak hed been assigned to the medical examiners office for more years than he was willing to admit and thought of all the employees as family he lives in harlem chet said actually his neighbors would love him to get a set so they could permanently borrow it enough you guys jack said fill me in on the excitement a mafia don was gunned down yesterday late afternoon calvins booming voice announced its stirred up a hornets nest of trouble since hed agreed to cooperate with the das office and was under police protection he was no mafia don lou soldano said he was nothing but a midlevel functionary of the vaccarro crime family whatever calvin said with a wave of his hand the key point is that he was whacked while literally boxed in by a number of new yorks finest which doesnt say much about their ability to protect someone in their charge he was warned not to go to that restaurant lou protested i know that for a fact and its almost impossible to protect someone if the individual refuses to follow suggestions any chance he could have been killed by the police jack asked one of the roles of a medical examiner was to think of all angles especially when situations of custody were concerned he wasnt under arrest lou said guessing what was going through jacks mind hed been arrested and indicted but he was out on bail so whats the big deal jack asked the big deal is that the mayor the district attorney and the police commissioner are all under a lot of heat calvin said amen lou said particularly the police commissioner thats why im here its turning into one of those publicrelations nightmares that the media loves to blow way out of proportion weve got to apprehend the perpetrator or perpetrators asap otherwise heads are going to roll and not to discourage future potential witnesses jack said yeah that too lou said i dont know laurie calvin said getting back to the discussion theyd been having before jacks interruption i appreciate you coming in early and offering to do this autopsy but maybe bingham might want to do it himself but why laurie complained look its a straightforward case and ive recently done a lot of gunshot wounds besides with dr binghams budget meeting this morning at city hall he cant be here until almost noon by then i can have the autopsy done and whatever information i come up with will be in the hands of the police with their time constraint it makes the most sense calvin looked at lou do you think five or six hours will make a difference with the investigation it could lou admitted hell the sooner the autopsy is done the better i mean just knowing if were looking for one or two people will be a big help calvin sighed i hate this kind of decision he shifted his massive twohundredandfiftypound muscular bulk from one foot to the other trouble is half the time i cant anticipate binghams reaction but what the hell go for it laurie the case is yours thanks calvin laurie said gleefully she snatched up the folder from the table is it okay if lou observes by all means calvin said come on lou laurie said she rescued her coat from a chair and started for the door lets head downstairs do a quick external exam and have the body xrayed in the confusion last night it apparently wasnt done im right behind you lou said jack hesitated for a moment then hurried after them he was mystified why laurie was so interested in doing the autopsy from his perspective she would have done better to stay clear such politically charged cases were always hot potatoes you couldnt win laurie was moving quickly and jack didnt catch up to her and lou until they were beyond communications laurie stopped abruptly to lean into janice jaegers office janice was one of the forensic investigators also called physicians assistants or pas janice ran the graveyard shift and took her job very seriously she always stayed late will you be seeing bart arnold before you leave laurie asked janice bart arnold was the chief of the pas i usually do janice said she was a tiny darkhaired woman with prominent circles under her eyes do me a favor laurie said ask him to call cnn and get a copy of the video of carlo franconis assassination id like to have it as soon as possible will do janice said cheerfully laurie and lou continued on their way hey slow down you two jack said he had to run a couple of steps to catch up to them weve got work to do laurie said without breaking stride ive never seen you so eager to do an autopsy jack said he and lou flanked her as she hurried to the autopsy room whats the attraction a lot of things laurie said she reached the elevator and pressed the button give me an example jack said i dont mean to rain on your parade but this is a politically sensitive case no matter what you do or say youll be irritating someone i think calvin was right this one ought to be done by the chief youre entitled to your opinion laurie said she hit the button again the back elevator was inordinately slow but i feel differently with the work ive been doing on the forensics of gunshot wounds im fascinated to have a case where there is a video of the event to corroborate my reconstruction of what happened i was planning on writing a paper on gunshot wounds and this could be the crowning case oh dear jack moaned raising his eyes heavenward and her motivations were so noble then looking back at laurie he said i think you should reconsider my intuition tells me youre only going to get yourself into a bureaucratic headache and theres still time to avoid it all you have to do is turn around and go back and tell calvin youve changed your mind im warning you youre taking a risk laurie laughed you are the last person to advise me about risk she reached out and touched jack on the end of his nose with her index finger everyone who knows you me included pleaded with you not to get that new bike youre risking your life not a headache the elevator arrived and laurie and lou boarded jack hesitated but then squeezed through the doors just before they closed you are not going to talk me out of this laurie said so save your breath okay jack said raising his hands in mock surrender i promise no more advice now im just interested in watching this story unfold its a paper day for me today so if you dont mind ill watch you can do more than that if you want laurie said you can help im sensitive about horning in on lou his double entendre was intended lou laughed laurie blushed but the comment went unacknowledged you implied there were other reasons for your interest in this case jack said if you dont mind my asking what are they laurie cast a quick glance at lou that jack saw but couldnt interpret hmmm jack said im getting the feeling theres something going on here that isnt any of my business nothing like that lou volunteered its just an unusual connection the victim carlo franconi had taken the place of a midlevel crime hoodlum named pauli cerino cerinos position had become vacant after cerino was thrown in the slammer mostly due to lauries persistence and hard work and yours too laurie added as the elevator jerked to a stop and the doors opened yeah but mostly yours lou said the three got off on the basement level and headed in the direction of the mortuary office did the cerino case involve that series of overdoses youve made reference to jack asked laurie im afraid so laurie said it was awful the experience terrified me and the problem is some of the characters are still around including cerino although hes in jail and not likely to be released for a long time lou added or so id like to believe laurie said anyway im hoping that doing the post on franconi might provide me with some closure i still have nightmares occasionally they sealed her in a pine coffin to abduct her from here lou said she was taken away in one of the mortuary vans my god jack said to laurie you never told me about that i try not to think about it laurie said then without missing a beat she added you guys wait out here laurie ducked into the mortuary office to get a copy of the list of refrigerator compartments assigned to the cases that had come in the previous night i cant imagine getting closed in a coffin jack said he shuddered heights were his main phobia but tight confining spaces came a close second nor can i lou agreed but she was able to recover remarkably an hour or so after being released she had the presence of mind to figure out how to save us both that was particularly humbling since id gone there to save her jeez jack said with a shake of his head up until this minute i thought my getting handcuffed to a sink by a couple of killers who were arguing over who was going to do me in was the worstcase scenario laurie came out of the office waving a sheet of paper compartment one eleven she said and i was right the body wasnt xrayed laurie took off like a power walker jack and lou had to hustle to catch up with her she made a beeline for the proper compartment once there she slipped the autopsy folder under her left arm and used her right hand to release the latch in one smooth practiced motion she swung open the door and slid out the tray on its ball bearings lauries brow furrowed thats odd she remarked the tray was empty save for a few blood stains and hardened secretions laurie slid the tray back in and closed the door she rechecked the number thered been no mistake it was compartment one eleven after looking at the list once again to make certain shed not misread the number she reopened the compartment door shielded her eyes from the glare of the overhead lights and peered into the depths of the dark interior there was no doubt the compartment did not contain carlo franconis remains what the hell laurie complained she slammed the insulated door and just to be sure there wasnt some stupid logistic error she opened up all the neighboring compartments one after the other in those which contained bodies she checked the names and accession numbers but it soon became obvious carlo franconi was not among them i dont believe this laurie said with angry frustration the damn body is gone a smile had appeared on jacks face from the moment compartment one eleven had proved to be empty now facing lauries exasperated frown he couldnt help himself he laughed heartily unfortunately his laughter further piqued laurie im sorry jack managed my intuition told me this case was going to give you a bureaucratic headache i was wrong its going to give the bureaucracy a headache chapter march pm cogo equatorial guinea kevin marshall put down his pencil and looked out the window above his desk in contrast to his inner turmoil the weather outside was rather pleasant with the first patches of blue sky that kevin had seen for months the dry season had finally begun of course it wasnt dry it just didnt rain nearly as much as during the wet season the downside was that the more consistent sun made the temperature soar to ovenlike levels at the moment it hovered at one hundred and fifteen degrees in the shade kevin had not worked well that morning nor had he slept during the night the anxiety hed felt the previous day at the commencement of the surgery had not abated in fact it had gotten worse especially after the unexpected call from the gensys ceo taylor cabot kevin had only spoken with the man on one previous occasion most people in the company equated the experience with talking with god adding to kevins unease was seeing another wisp of smoke snaking its way up into the sky from isla francesca hed noticed it when hed first arrived at the lab that morning as near as he could tell it was coming from the same location as the day before the sheer side of the limestone escarpment the fact that the smoke was no longer apparent failed to comfort him giving up on any attempt at further work kevin peeled off his white lab coat and draped it over his chair he wasnt particularly hungry but he knew his housekeeper esmeralda would have made lunch so he felt obliged to make an appearance kevin descended the three flights of stairs in a preoccupied daze several coworkers passed him and said hello but it was as if kevin did not see them he was too preoccupied in the last twentyfour hours hed come to realize that he would have to take action the problem wasnt going to pass as hed hoped it would a week previously when hed first glimpsed the smoke unfortunately he had no idea what to do he knew he was no hero in fact over the years hed come to think of himself as a coward of sorts he hated confrontation and avoided it as a boy he had even shunned competition except for chess hed grown up pretty much a loner kevin paused at the glass door to the exterior across the square he could see the usual coterie of equatoguinean soldiers beneath the arches of the old town hall they were up to their usual sedentary pursuits aimlessly passing the time of the day some were sitting in old rattan furniture playing cards others were leaning up against the building arguing with each other in strident voices almost all of them were smoking cigarettes were part of their wages they were dressed in soiled junglecamouflage fatigues with scuffed combat boots and red berets all of them had automatic assault rifles either slung over their shoulders or within arms reach from the moment of kevins arrival at cogo five years previously the soldiers had scared him cameron mcivers head of security who had initially shown kevin around told him that gensys had hired a good portion of the equatoguinean army for protection later cameron had admitted that the armys socalled employment was in reality an additional payoff to the government as well as to the minister of defense and the minister of territorial administration from kevins perspective the soldiers looked more like a bunch of aimless teenagers than protectors their complexions were like burnished ebony their blank expressions and arched eyebrows gave them a look of superciliousness that reflected their boredom kevin always had the uncomfortable sense they were itching to have an excuse to use their weapons kevin pushed through the door and walked across the square he didnt look in the direction of the soldiers but from past experience he knew at least some of them were watching him and it made his skin crawl kevin didnt know a word of fang the major local dialect so he had no idea what they were saying once out of sight of the central square kevin relaxed a degree and slowed his pace the combination of heat and hundredpercent humidity was like a perpetual steam bath any activity caused a sweat after only a few minutes kevin could feel his shirt beginning to adhere to his back kevins house was situated a little more than halfway between the hospitallab complex and the waterfront a distance of only three blocks the town was small but had obviously been charming in its day the buildings had been constructed primarily of brightly colored stucco with red tile roofs now the colors had faded to pale pastels the shutters were the type that hinged at the top most were in a terrible state of disrepair except for the ones on the renovated buildings the streets had been laid out in an unimaginative grid but had been paved over the years with imported granite that had served as sailing ships ballast in spanish colonial times the towns wealth had come from agriculture particularly cocoa and coffee production and it had graciously supported a population of several thousand people but the towns history changed dramatically after the year of equatorial guineas independence the new president macias nguema quickly metamorphosed from a popularly elected official to the continents worst sadistic dictator whose atrocities managed to outclass even those of idi amin of uganda and jeanbedel bokassa of the central african republic the effect on the country was apocalyptic after fifty thousand people were murdered a third of the population of the entire country fled including all the spanish settlers most of the countrys towns were decimated particularly cogo which had been completely abandoned the road connecting cogo to the rest of the country fell into ruin and quickly became impassable for a number of years the town was fated to be a mere curiosity for the occasional visitor arriving by small motorboat from the coastal town of acalayong the jungle had begun to reclaim the land by the time a representative of gensys had happened upon it seven years previously this individual recognized cogos isolation and its limitless surrounding rain forest as the perfect spot for gensys intended primate facility returning to malabo the capital of equatorial guinea the gensys official immediately commenced negotiations with the current equatoguinean government since the country was one of the poorest of africa and consequently desperate for foreign exchange the new president was eager and negotiations proceeded apace kevin rounded the last corner and approached his house it was three stories like most of the other buildings in the town it had been tastefully renovated by gensys to give it storybook appeal in fact it was one of the more desirable houses in the whole town and a source of envy of a number of the other gensys employees particularly head of security cameron mcivers only siegfried spallek manager of the zone and bertram edwards chief veterinarian had accommodations that were equivalent kevin had attributed his good luck to intercession on his behalf by dr raymond lyons but he didnt know for certain the house had been built in the midnineteenth century by a successful importexporter in traditional spanish style the first floor was arched and arcaded like the town hall and had originally housed shops and storage facilities the second floor was the main living floor with three bedrooms three baths a large throughandthrough living room a dining room a kitchen and a tiny maids apartment it was surrounded by a veranda on all four sides the third floor was an enormous open room with wideplank flooring illuminated with two huge castiron chandeliers it was capable of holding a hundred people with ease and had apparently been used for mass meetings kevin entered and climbed a central stairway that led up to a narrow hall from there he went into the dining room as he expected the table had been laid for lunch the house was too big for kevin especially since he didnt have a family hed said as much when hed first been shown the property but siegfried spallek had told him the decision had been made in boston and warned kevin not to complain so kevin accepted the assignment but his coworkers envy often made him feel uncomfortable as if by magic esmeralda appeared kevin wondered how she did it so consistently it was as if she were always on the lookout for his approaching the house she was a pleasant woman of indeterminate age with rounded features and sad eyes she dressed in a shift of brightly colored print fabric with a matching scarf wrapped tightly around her head besides her native tongue she spoke fluent spanish and passable english that improved on a daily basis esmeralda lived in the maids quarters monday through friday over the weekend she stayed with her family in a village that gensys had constructed to the east along the banks of the estuary to house the many local workers employed in the zone as the area occupied by gensyss equatoguinean operation was called she and her family had been moved there from bata the main city on the equatoguinean mainland the capital of the country malabo was on an island called bioko kevin had encouraged esmeralda to go home in the evenings during the week if she so desired but she declined when kevin persisted she told him shed been ordered to remain in cogo there is a phone message for you esmeralda said oh kevin said nervously his pulse quickened phone messages were rare and in his current state he did not need any more unexpected events the call in the middle of the night from taylor cabot had been disturbing enough it was from dr raymond lyons in new york esmeralda said he wants you to call him back the fact that the call was from overseas did not surprise kevin with the satellite communications gensys had installed in the zone it was far easier to call europe or the us than bata a mere sixty miles to the north calls to malabo were almost impossible kevin started for the living room the phone was on a desk in the corner will you be eating lunch esmeralda asked yes kevin said he still wasnt hungry but he didnt want to hurt esmeraldas feelings kevin sat down at his desk with his hand on the phone he quickly calculated it was about eight oclock in the morning in new york he pondered what dr lyons had called about but guessed it had something to do with his brief conversation with taylor cabot kevin did not like the idea of an autopsy on carlo franconi and he didnt imagine that raymond lyons would either kevin had first met raymond six years previously it was during a meeting in new york of the american association for the advancement of science where kevin presented a paper kevin hated giving papers and rarely did but on this occasion hed been forced to do so by the chief of his department at harvard dating back to his phd thesis his interest was the transposition of chromosomes a process by which chromosomes exchanged bits and pieces to enhance species adaption and hence evolution this phenomenon happened particularly frequently during the generation of sex cells a process known as meiosis by coincidence during the same meeting and at the same time kevin was scheduled to present james watson and francis crick gave an immensely popular talk on the anniversary of their discovery of the structure of dna consequently very few people came to hear kevin one of the attendees had been raymond it was after this talk that raymond first approached kevin the conversation resulted in kevins leaving harvard and coming to work for gensys with a slightly shaky hand kevin picked up the receiver and dialed raymond answered on the first ring suggesting hed been hovering over the phone the connection was crystal clear as if he were in the next room ive got good news raymond said as soon as he knew it was kevin theres to be no autopsy kevin didnt respond his mind was a jumble arent you relieved raymond asked i know cabot called you last night im relieved to an extent kevin said but autopsy or no autopsy im having second thoughts about this whole operation now it was raymonds turn to be silent no sooner had he solved one potential problem than another was rearing its unwelcome head maybe weve made a mistake kevin said what i mean is maybe ive made a mistake my conscience is starting to bother me and im getting a little scared im really a basic science person this applied science is not my thing oh please raymond said irritably dont complicate things not now i mean youve got that lab youve always wanted ive beat my brains out getting you every damn piece of equipment that youve asked for and on top of that things are going so well especially with my recruiting hell with all the stock options youre amassing youll be a rich man ive never intended on being rich kevin said worse things could happen raymond said come on kevin dont do this to me and what good is being rich when i have to be out here in the heart of darkness kevin said unwittingly his mind conjured up the image of the manager siegfried spallek kevin shuddered he was terrified of the man its not forever raymond said you told me yourself youre almost there that the system is nearly perfect when it is and youve trained someone to take your place you can come back here with your money youll be able to build the lab of your dreams ive seen more smoke coming from the island kevin said just like last week forget the smoke raymond said youre letting your imagination run wild instead of working yourself up into a frenzy over nothing concentrate on your work so you can finish if youve got some free time start fantasizing about the lab youll be building back here stateside kevin nodded raymond had a point part of kevins concern was that if what hed been involved with in africa became common knowledge he might never be able to go back to academia no one would hire him much less give him tenure but if he had his own lab and an independent income he wouldnt have to worry listen raymond said ill be coming to pick up the last patient when hes ready which should be soon well talk again then meanwhile just remember that were almost there and money is pouring into our offshore coffers all right kevin said reluctantly just dont do anything rash raymond said promise me all right kevin repeated with slightly more enthusiasm kevin hung up the phone raymond was a persuasive person and whenever kevin spoke to him kevin inevitably felt better kevin pushed back from the desk and walked back to the dining room following raymonds advice he tried to think of where hed build his lab there were some strong arguments for cambridge massachusetts because of the associations kevin had with both harvard and mit but then again maybe it would be better to be out in the countryside like up in new hampshire lunch was a white fish that kevin didnt recognize when he inquired about it esmeralda gave him only the name in fang which meant nothing to kevin he surprised himself by eating more than hed expected the conversation with raymond had had a positive effect on his appetite the idea of having his own lab still held inordinate appeal after eating kevin changed his damp shirt for a clean freshly ironed one he was eager to get back to work as he was about to descend the stairs esmeralda inquired when he wanted dinner he told her seven the usual time while kevin had been lunching a leaden group of gray lavender clouds had rolled in from the ocean by the time he emerged from his front door it was pouring and the street in front of his house was a cascade as the runoff raced down to the waterfront looking south over the estuario del muni kevin could see a line of bright sunshine as well as the arch of a complete rainbow the weather in gabon was still clear kevin was not surprised there had been times when it had rained on one side of the street and not the other guessing the rain would continue for at least the next hour kevin skirted his house beneath the protection of the arcade and climbed into his black toyota utility vehicle although it was a ridiculously short drive back to the hospital kevin felt it was better to ride than be wet for the rest of the afternoon chapter march am new york city well what do you want to do franco ponti asked while looking at his boss vinnie dominick in the rearview mirror they were in vinnies lincoln towncar vinnie was in the backseat leaning forward with his right hand holding onto the overhead strap he was looking out at east th street it was a brownstone built in a french rococo style with higharched multipaned windows the firstfloor windows were heavily barred for protection looks like pretty posh digs vinnie said the good doctor is doing okay for himself should i park franco asked the car was in the middle of the street and the taxi behind them was honking insistently park vinnie said franco drove ahead until he came to a fire hydrant he pulled to the curb the taxi went past the driver frantically giving them the finger angelo facciolo shook his head and made a disparaging comment about expatriate russian taxi drivers angelo was sitting in the front passenger seat vinnie climbed out of the car franco and angelo quickly followed suit all three men were impeccably dressed in long salvatore ferragamo overcoats in varying shades of gray you think the car will be okay franco asked i anticipate this will be a short meeting vinnie said but put the police benevolent association commendation on the dash might as well save fifty bucks vinnie walked back to number franco and angelo trailed in their perpetually vigilant style vinnie looked at the door intercom its a duplex vinnie said i guess the doctor isnt doing quite as well as i thought vinnie pressed the button for dr raymond lyons and waited hello a feminine voice inquired im here to see the doctor vinnie said my name is vinnie dominick there was a pause vinnie played with a bottle cap with the tip of his gucci loafer franco and angelo looked up and down the street the intercom crackled back to life hello this is dr lyons can i help you i believe so vinnie said i need about fifteen minutes of your time im not sure i know you mr dominick raymond said could you tell me what this is in reference to its in reference to a favor i did for you last night vinnie said the request had come through a mutual acquaintance dr daniel levitz there was a pause i trust you are still there doctor vinnie said yes of course raymond said a raucous buzzing sounded vinnie pushed open the heavy door and entered his minions followed i dont think the good doctor is terribly excited to see us vinnie quipped as they rode up in the small elevator the three men were pressed together like cigars in a triple pack raymond met his visitors as they exited the lift he was obviously nervous as he shook hands with all three after the introductions he gestured for them to enter his apartment and then showed them into a small mahoganypaneled study coffee anyone raymond asked franco and angelo looked at vinnie i wouldnt turn down an expresso if its not too much trouble vinnie said franco and angelo said theyd have the same raymond used his desk phone to place the order raymonds worst fears had materialized the moment hed caught sight of his uninvited guests from his perspective they appeared like stereotypes from a gradeb movie vinnie was about fiveten darkly complected and handsome with full features and slickedback hair he was obviously the boss the other two men were both over six feet and gaunt their noses and lips were thin and their eyes were beady and deeply set they could have been brothers the main difference in their appearance was the condition of angelos skin raymond thought it looked like the far side of the moon can i take your coats raymond asked we dont intend on staying too long vinnie said at least sit down raymond said vinnie relaxed into a leather armchair franco and angelo sat stiffly on a velvetcovered settee raymond sat behind his desk what can i do for you gentlemen raymond said trying to assume a confident air the favor we did for you last night was not easy to pull off vinnie said we thought youd like to know how it was arranged raymond let out a little mirthless laugh through a weak smile he held up his hands as if to ward off something coming his way thats not necessary im certain you we insist vinnie interrupted it makes good business sense you see we wouldnt like you to think that we didnt make a significant effort on your behalf i wouldnt think that for a moment raymond said well just to be sure vinnie said you see getting a body out of the morgue is no easy task since they are open for business twentyfour hours a day and they have a uniformed security man on duty at all times this isnt necessary raymond said id rather not be privy to the details but im very appreciative of your efforts be quiet dr lyons and listen vinnie said he paused for a moment to organize his thoughts we were lucky because angelo here knows a kid named vinnie amendola who works in the morgue this kid was beholden to pauli cerino a guy angelo used to work for but who is currently in jail angelo now works for me and knowing what he knows he was able to convince the kid to tell us exactly where mr franconis remains were stored the kid was also able to tell us some other information so wed have some reason to be there in the middle of the night at that moment the expresses arrived they were brought in by darlene poison whom raymond introduced as his assistant as soon as the coffees were distributed darlene left goodlooking assistant vinnie said shes very efficient raymond commented unconsciously he wiped his brow i hope were not making you feel uncomfortable vinnie said no not at all raymond said a bit too quickly so we got the body out okay vinnie said and we disposed of it so it is gone but as you can understand it was not a walk in the park in fact it was one big pain in the ass since we had so little time to plan it well if there is ever some favor i can do for you raymond commented after an uncomfortable pause in the conversation thank you doctor vinnie said he polished off his expresso like he was drinking a shot he put the cup and saucer on the corner of the desk youve said exactly what i was hoping youd say which brings me to why im here now you probably know im a client just like franconi was more important my elevenyearold son vinnie junior is also a client in fact hes more apt to need your services than i am so were facing two tuitions as you people call it what id like to propose is that i dont pay anything this year what do you say raymonds eyes dropped to his desk surface what were talking about is a favor for a favor vinnie said its only fair raymond cleared his throat ill have to talk to the powers that be he said now thats the first unfriendly thing youve said vinnie added my information is that you are the socalled powers that be so i find this footdragging insulting ill change my offer i wont pay any tuition this year or next year i hope you comprehend the direction this conversation is taking i understand raymond said he swallowed with obvious effort ill take care of it vinnie stood up franco and angelo did likewise thats the spirit vinnie said so ill count on your talking with dr daniel levitz and let him know about our understanding of course raymond said he got to his feet thank you for the coffee vinnie said it hit the spot my compliments to your assistant raymond closed the apartment door after the hoodlums had left and leaned against it his pulse was racing darlene appeared in the doorway leading to the kitchen was it as bad as you feared she asked worse raymond said they behaved perfectly in character now ive got to deal with petty mobsters demanding a free ride i tell you what else can go wrong raymond pushed off the door and started toward his study after only two steps he wobbled darlene reached out and supported his arm are you okay she demanded raymond waited for a moment before nodding yeah im all right he said just a bit dizzy thanks to this franconi flap i didnt sleep a wink last night maybe you should put off the meeting youve planned with the new prospective doctor darlene suggested i think youre right raymond said in this state i probably couldnt convince anyone to join our group even if they were on their way to bankruptcy court chapter march pm new york city laurie finished preparing the salad greens put a paper towel over the bowl and slipped it into the refrigerator then she mixed the dressing a simple combination of olive oil fresh garlic and white vinegar with just a touch of balsamic she put that in the refrigerator as well turning her attention to the lamb loin she trimmed off the small amount of fat the butcher had left put the meat into a marinade shed made earlier and then stuck it into the refrigerator with the other makings the last chore was preparing the artichokes it took only a moment to cut off the excess base and a few of the large stringy leaves wiping her hands on the dish towel laurie glanced up at the wall clock familiar with jacks schedule she thought it was exactly the time to call she used the wall phone next to the sink as the connection went through she could imagine jack coming up the cluttered stairwell in his dilapidated building although she thought she understood why hed originally rented his apartment she had trouble comprehending why he stayed the building was so depressing on the other hand as she glanced around at her own flat she had to admit there wasnt a lot of difference once jack got inside his unit except he had almost double the space the phone rang at the other end laurie counted the rings when she got to ten she began to doubt her familiarity with his schedule she was about to hang up when jack answered yeah he said unceremoniously he was out of breath tonights your lucky night laurie said who is this jack asked is that you laurie you sound out of breath laurie said does that mean you lost at basketball no it means i ran up four flights of stairs to get the phone jack said whats happening dont tell me youre still at work heavens no laurie said ive been home for an hour so why is this my lucky night jack asked i stopped by gristedes on the way home and picked up the makings of your favorite dinner laurie said its all ready to go into the broiler all you have to do is shower and get yourself down here and i thought i owed you an apology for laughing at the vanishing mafioso jack said if amends are needed its surely from my side theres no atonement involved laurie said i would just enjoy your company but theres one condition uhoh jack said what no bike tonight laurie said you have to come by cab or the deals off taxis are more dangerous than my bike jack complained no argument laurie said take it or leave it if and when you slide under a bus and end up on a slab in the pit i dont want to feel responsible laurie felt her face flush it was an issue she didnt even like to joke about okay jack said agreeably i should be there in thirtyfive to forty minutes shall i bring some wine that would be great laurie said laurie was pleased shed been unsure if jack would accept the invitation over the previous year they had been seeing each other socially and several months ago laurie had admitted to herself that shed fallen in love with him but jack seemed reluctant to allow the relationship to progress to the next level of commitment when laurie tried to force the issue jack had responded by distancing himself feeling rejected laurie had responded with anger for weeks they only spoke on a professional basis over the last month their relationship had slowly improved they were seeing each other again casually this time laurie realized that she had to bide her time the problem was that at age thirtyseven it was not easy laurie had always wanted to become a mother someday with forty fast approaching she felt she was running out of time with the dinner essentially prepared laurie went around her small onebedroom apartment straightening up that meant putting odd books back into their spots on the shelves stacking medical journals neatly and emptying toms litter box tom was her sixandahalfyearold tawny tabby who was still as wild as hed been as a kitten laurie straightened the klimt print that the cat always knocked askew on his daily route from the bookcase to the top of the valence over the window next laurie took a quick shower changed into a turtleneck and jeans and put on a touch of makeup as she did so she glared at the crows feet that had been developing at the corners of her eyes she didnt feel any older than when shed gotten out of medical school yet there was no denying the advance of years jack arrived on schedule when laurie looked through the peephole all she could see was a bloated image of his broadly grinning face which he had positioned a mere inch from the lens she smiled at his antics as she undid the host of locks that secured her door get in here you clown laurie said i wanted to be sure you recognized me jack said as he stepped past her my chipped upperleft incisor has become my trademark just as laurie was closing her door she caught a glimpse of her neighbor mrs engler whod cracked her door to see who was visiting laurie laurie glared at her she was such a busybody the dinner was a success the food was perfect and the wine was okay jacks excuse was that the liquor store closest to his apartment specialized in jug wine not the better stuff during the course of the evening laurie had to continually bite her tongue to keep the conversation away from sensitive areas she would have loved to talk about their relationship but she didnt dare she sensed that some of jacks hesitance stemmed from his extraordinary personal tragedy six years previously his wife and two daughters had been tragically killed in a commuterplane crash jack had told laurie about it after they had been dating for several months but then refused to talk about it again laurie sensed that this loss was the biggest stumbling block to their relationship in a way this belief helped her to take jacks reluctance to commit himself less personally jack had no trouble keeping the conversation light hed had a good evening playing pickup basketball at his neighborhood playground and was happy to talk about it by chance hed been teamed up with warren an allaround impressive africanamerican who was the leader of the local gang and by far the best player jack and warrens team didnt lose all evening how is warren laurie asked jack and laurie had frequently doubledated with warren and his girlfriend natalie adams laurie hadnt seen either of them since before she and jack had their fallingout warrens warren jack said he shrugged hes got so much potential ive tried my best to get him to take some college courses but he resists he says my value system isnt his so ive given up and natalie fine i guess jack said i havent seen her since we all went out we should do it again laurie said i miss seeing them thats an idea jack said evasively there was a pause laurie could hear toms purring after eating and cleaning up jack moved to the couch laurie sat across from him in her artdeco club chair shed purchased in the village laurie sighed she felt frustrated it seemed juvenile that they couldnt talk about emotionally important issues jack checked his watch uhoh he said he moved himself forward so that he was sitting on the very edge of the couch its quarter to eleven jack added ive got to be going its a school night and bed is beckoning more wine laurie asked she held up the jug theyd only drunk a quarter of it i cant jack said ive got to keep my reflexes sharp for the cab ride home he stood up and thanked laurie for the meal laurie put down the wine and got to her feet if you dont mind id like to ride with you as far as the morgue what jack questioned he scrunched up his face in disbelief youre not going to work at this hour i mean youre not even on call i just want to question the night mortuary tech and security laurie said as she went to the hall closet for their coats what on earth for jack asked i want to figure out how franconis body disappeared laurie said she handed jack his bomber jacket i talked to the evening crew when they came on this afternoon and what did they tell you not a whole bunch laurie said the body came in around eight fortyfive with an entourage of police and media apparently it was a circus i guess thats why the x ray was overlooked identification was made by the mothera very emotional scene by all reports by ten fortyfive the body was placed in the fridge in compartment one eleven so i think its pretty clear the abduction occurred during the night shift from eleven to seven why are you worrying yourself about this jack said this is the front offices problem laurie pulled on her coat and got her keys lets just say that ive taken a personal interest in the case jack rolled his eyes as they exited into the hall laurie he intoned youre going to get yourself in trouble over this mark my word laurie pushed the elevator button then glared at mrs engler whod cracked her door as usual that woman drives me crazy laurie said as they boarded the elevator youre not listening to me jack said im listening laurie said but im still going to look into this between this stunt and my runin with franconis predecessor it irks me that these twobit mobsters think they can do whatever they please they think laws are for other people pauli cerino the man lou mentioned this morning had people killed so that he didnt have to wait too long to have corneal transplants that gives you an idea of their ethics i dont like the idea that they think they can just come into our morgue and walk off with the body of a man they just killed they emerged onto nineteenth street and walked toward first avenue laurie put up her collar there was a breeze off the east river and it was only in the twenties what makes you think the mobsters are behind this jack asked you dont have to be a rocket scientist to assume as much laurie said she put up her hand as a cab approached but it zoomed past without slowing franconi was going to testify as part of a plea bargain the higherups of the vaccarro organization got angry or scared or both its an old story so they killed him jack said why take the body laurie shrugged im not going to pretend i can put my mind into a mobsters she said i dont know why they wanted the body maybe to deny him a proper burial maybe theyre afraid an autopsy would provide a clue to the killers identity hell i dont know but ultimately it doesnt matter why i have a sense the why might be important jack said i think by getting involved youll be skating on thin ice maybe so laurie said she shrugged again i get caught up in things like this i suppose part of the problem is that at the moment my main focus in life is my job here comes a free cab jack said deliberately avoiding having to respond to lauries last comment he sensed the implications and was reluctant to get drawn into a more personal discussion it was a short cab ride down to the corner of first avenue and thirtieth street laurie climbed out and was surprised when jack did the same you dont have to come laurie said i know jack said but im coming anyway in case you havent guessed you have me concerned jack leaned back inside the cab and paid the driver laurie was still insisting that jacks presence was not needed as they walked between the health and hospitals mortuary vans they entered the morgue through the thirtieth street entrance i thought you told me your bed was beckoning it can wait jack said after lous story about your getting carted out of here nailed in a coffin i think i should tag along that was a totally different situation laurie said oh yeah jack questioned it involved mobsters just like now laurie was about to protest further when jacks comment struck a chord she had to admit there were parallels the first person they came to was the night security man sitting in his cubbyhole office carl novak was an elderly affable grayhaired man who appeared to have shrunk inside his uniform that was at least two sizes too big he was playing solitaire but looked up when laurie and jack passed by his window and stopped in his open doorway can i help you carl asked then he recognized laurie and apologized for not having done so sooner laurie asked him if hed been informed of franconis bodys disappearance by all means carl said i got called at home by robert harper head of security he was up in arms about it and asked me all sorts of questions it didnt take laurie long to learn that carl had little light to shed on the mystery he insisted that nothing out of the ordinary happened bodies had come in and bodies had gone out just the way they did every night of the year he admitted having left his post twice during his shift to visit the mens room he emphasized that on both occasions hed only been gone for a few minutes and that each time hed informed the night mortuary tech mike passano what about meals laurie asked carl pulled open a file drawer of his metal desk and lifted out an insulated lunch box i eat right here laurie thanked him and moved on jack followed the place certainly looks different at night jack commented as they passed the wide hall that led down to the refrigerators and the autopsy room its a bit sinister without the usual daytime hubbub laurie admitted they looked into the mortuary office and found mike passano busy with some receiving forms a body had recently been brought in that had been fished out of the ocean by the coast guard he looked up when he sensed company mike was in this early thirties spoke with a strong long island accent and looked decidedly southern italian he was slight of build with sharply defined facial features he had dark hair dark skin and dark eyes neither laurie nor jack had worked with him although they had met him on multiple occasions did you docs come in to see the floater mike asked no jack said is there a problem no problem mike said its just in bad shape weve come to talk about last night laurie said what about it mike asked laurie posed the same questions shed put to carl to her surprise mike quickly became irritated she was about to say as much when jack tugged on her arm and motioned for her to retreat to the hall ease off jack recommended when they were beyond earshot ease off from what laurie asked im not being confrontational i agree jack said i know im the last person to be an expert in office politics or interpersonal relations but mike sounds defensive to me if you want to get any information out of him i think you have to take that into consideration and tread lightly laurie thought for a minute then nodded maybe youre right they returned to the mortuary office but before laurie could say anything mike said in case you didnt know dr washington telephoned this morning and woke me up about all this he read me the riot act but i did my normal job last night and i certainly didnt have anything to do with that body disappearing im sorry if i implied that you did laurie said all im saying is that i believe the body disappeared during your shift thats not saying you are responsible in any way it sorta sounds that way mike said i mean im the only one here besides security and the janitors did anything happen out of the ordinary laurie asked mike shook his head it was a quiet night we had two bodies come in and two go out what about the bodies that arrived laurie asked did they come in with our people yup with our vans mike said jeff cooper and peter molina both bodies were from local hospitals what about the two bodies that went out laurie asked what about them well who was it that came to pick them up mike grabbed the mortuary logbook from the corner of his desk and cracked it open his index finger traced down the column then stopped spoletto funeral home in ozone park and dickson funeral home in summit new jersey what were the names of the deceased laurie asked mike consulted the book frank gleason and dorothy kline their accession numbers are and anything else were you expecting these particular funeral homes to come laurie asked yeah of course mike said theyd called beforehand just like always so you had everything ready for them sure mike said i had the paperwork all done they just had to sign off and the bodies laurie asked they were in the walkin cooler as usual mike said right in the front on gurneys laurie looked at jack can you think of anything else to ask jack shrugged i think youve pretty well covered the bases except when mike was off the floor good point laurie said turning back to mike she said carl told us that when he left for the mens room twice last night he contacted you do you contact carl whenever you need to leave your post always mike said were often the only ones down here we have to have someone guarding the door were you away from the office very long last night laurie asked nope mike said no more than usual couple of times to the head and a half hour for lunch up on the second floor im telling you it was a normal night what about the janitors laurie asked were they around not during my shift mike said generally they clean down here evenings the night shift is upstairs unless there is something out of the ordinary going on laurie tried to think of additional questions but couldnt thanks mike she said no problem mike said laurie started for the door but stopped turning around she asked by any chance did you happen to see franconis body mike hesitated a second before admitting that he had what was the circumstance laurie asked when i get to work marvin the evening tech usually briefs me about whats going on he was kind of psyched about the franconi situation because of all the police and the way the family carried on anyway he showed me the body when you saw it was it in compartment one eleven yup tell me mike laurie said if you had to guess how do you think the body disappeared i dont have the foggiest idea mike said unless he walked out of here he laughed then seemed embarrassed i dont mean to joke around im as confused as everybody else all i know is only two bodies went out of here last night and they were the two i checked out and you never looked at franconi again after marvin showed him to you of course not mike said why would i no reason laurie said do you happen to know where the van drivers are upstairs in the lunchroom mike said thats where they always are laurie and jack took the elevator as they were riding up laurie noticed jacks eyelids were drooping you look tired laurie commented no surprise i am jack said why dont you go home laurie said ive stuck it out this far jack said i think ill see it to the bitter end the bright fluorescent lighting of the lunchroom made both laurie and jack squint they found jeff and pete at a table next to the vending machines poring over newspapers while snacking on potato chips they were dressed in rumpled blue coveralls with health and hospital corporation patches on their upper arms both had ponytails laurie introduced herself explained about her interest in the missing body and asked if there was anything unique about the previous night particularly about the two bodies theyd brought in jeff and pete exchanged a look then pete responded mine was a mess pete said i dont mean the bodies themselves laurie said im wondering if there was anything unusual about the process did you see anyone in the morgue you didnt recognize did anything out of the ordinary happen pete glanced again at jeff then shook his head nope it was just like usual do you remember what compartment you put your body into laurie asked pete scratched the top of his head not really he said was it near to one eleven laurie asked pete shook his head no it was around the other side something like fiftyfive i dont remember exactly but its written downstairs laurie turned to jeff my body went into twentyeight jeff said i remembered because thats how old i am did either of you see franconis body laurie asked the two drivers again exchanged glances jeff spoke yeah we did what time around now jeff said what was the circumstance laurie said you guys dont normally see bodies that you dont transport after mike told us about it we wanted to look because of all the excitement but we didnt touch anything it was only for a second pete added we just opened the door and looked in were you with mike laurie asked no pete said he just told us which compartment has dr washington talked to you about last night laurie asked yeah and mr harper too jeff said did you tell dr washington about looking at the body laurie asked no jeff said why not laurie asked he didnt ask jeff said i guess we know were really not supposed to do it i mean we dont usually but as i said with all the commotion we were curious maybe you should tell dr washington laurie suggested just so he has all the facts laurie turned around and headed back to the elevator jack dutifully followed what do you think laurie asked its getting harder and harder for me to think the closer it gets to midnight jack said but i wouldnt make anything of those two peeking at the body but mike didnt mention it laurie said true jack said but they all know they were bending the rules its human nature in such a situation not to be completely forthcoming maybe so laurie said with a sigh where to now jack asked as they boarded the elevator im running out of ideas laurie said thank god jack said dont you think i should ask mike why he didnt tell us about the van drivers looking at franconi laurie asked you could but i think youre just spinning your wheels jack said truly i cant imagine it was anything but harmless curiosity then lets call it a night laurie said bed is sounding good to me too chapter march am cogo equatorial guinea kevin replaced the tissue culture flasks in the incubator and closed the door hed been working since before dawn his current quest was to find a transponase to handle a minor histocompatibility gene on the y chromosome it had been eluding him for over a month despite his use of the technique that had resulted in his finding and isolating the transponases associated with the short arm of chromosome kevins usual schedule was to arrive at the lab around eightthirty but that morning hed awakened at four am and had not been able to fall back to sleep after tossing and turning for threequarters of an hour hed decided he might as well use the time for good purpose hed arrived at his lab at five am while it was still pitch dark what was troubling kevins sleep was his conscience the nagging notion that hed made a promethean mistake resurfaced with a vengeance although dr lyonss mention of building his own lab had assuaged him at the time it didnt last lab of his dreams or no he couldnt deny the horror he feared was evolving on isla francesca kevins feelings had nothing to do with seeing more smoke he hadnt but as dawn broke hed also consciously avoided looking out the window much less in the direction of the island kevin realized he couldnt go on like this he decided that the most rational course of action would be to find out if his fears were justified the best way to do it he surmised was to approach someone close to the situation who might be able to shed some light on kevins area of concern but kevin didnt feel comfortable talking with many people in the zone hed never been very social especially in cogo where he was the sole academician but there was one working in the zone with whom he felt slightly more comfortable mainly because he admired his work bertram edwards the chief veterinarian impulsively kevin removed his lab coat draped it over his chair and headed out of his office descending to the first floor he exited into the steamy heat of the parking area north of the hospital the morning weather was clear with white puffy cumuli clouds overhead there were some dark rain clouds looming but they were out over the ocean in a clump along the western horizon if they brought rain it wouldnt be before the afternoon kevin climbed into his toyota fourwheel drive and turned right out of the hospital parking lot traversing the north side of the town square he passed the old catholic church gensys had renovated the building to function as the recreational center on friday and saturday nights they showed movies monday nights they had bingo in the basement was a commissary serving american hamburgers bertram edwardss office was at the veterinary center that was part of the far larger animal unit the entire complex was bigger than cogo itself it was situated north of the town in a dense equatorial rain forest and separated from the town by a stretch of virgin jungle kevins route took him east as far as the motorpool facility where he turned north the traffic which was considerable for such a remote spot reflected the difficult logistics of running an operation the size of the zone everything from toilet paper to centrifuge tubes had to be imported which necessitated moving a lot of goods most supplies came by truck from bata where there was a crude deepwater port and an airport capable of handling large jet aircraft the estuario del muni with access to libreville gabon was only served by motorized canoes at the edge of town the granite cobblestone street gave way to newly laid asphalt kevin let out a sigh of relief the sound and the vibration that came up the steering column from the cobblestones was intense after fifteen minutes of driving through a canyon of dark green vegetation kevin could see the first buildings of the stateoftheart animal complex they were constructed of prestressed concrete and cinder block that was stuccoed and painted white the design had a spanish flare to complement the colonial architecture of the town the enormous main building looked more like an airport terminal than a primate housing facility its front facade was three stories tall and perhaps five hundred feet long from the back of the structure projected multiple wings that literally disappeared into the canopy of vegetation several smaller buildings faced the main one kevin wasnt sure of their purpose except for two buildings in the center one housed the complexs contingent of equatoguinean soldiers just like their comrades in the town square these soldiers were aimlessly sprawled about with their rifles cigarettes and cameroonean beer the other building was the headquarters of a group that kevin found even more disturbing than the teenage soldiers these were moroccan mercenaries who were part of the equatoguinean presidential guard the local president didnt trust his own army these foreign specialforces commandos dressed in inappropriate and illfitting dark suits and ties with obvious bulges from their shoulder holsters every one of them had dark skin piercing eyes and a heavy mustache unlike the soldiers they were rarely seen but their presence was felt like a sinister evil force the sheer size of the gensys animal center was a tribute to its success recognizing the difficulties attached to primate biomedical research gensys had sited their facility in equatorial africa where the animals were indigenous this move cleverly sidestepped the industrialized wests inconvenient web of importexport restrictions associated with primates as well as the disruptive influence of animalrights zealots as an added incentive the foreign exchangestarved local government and its venal leaders were inordinately receptive to all a company like gensys had to offer obstructive laws were conveniently overlooked or abolished the legislature was so accommodating that it even passed a law making interference with gensys a capital offense the operation proved to be extraordinarily successful so quickly that gensys expanded it to serve as a convenient spot for other biotechnology companies especially pharmaceutical giants to outsource their primate testing the growth shocked the gensys economic forecasters from every point of view the zone was an impressive financial success kevin parked next to another fourwheeldrive vehicle he knew it was dr edwardss from the bumper sticker that said man is an ape he pushed through the double doors with veterinary center stenciled on the glass dr edwardss office and examining rooms were just inside the door martha blummer greeted him dr edwards is in the chimpanzee wing she said martha was the veterinary secretary her husband was one of the supervisors at the motor pool kevin set off for the chimpanzee wing it was one of the few areas in the building he was at all acquainted with he went through a second pair of double doors and walked the length of the central corridor of the veterinary hospital the facility looked like a regular hospital down to its employees who were all dressed in surgical scrubs many with stethoscopes draped over their necks a few people nodded others smiled and some said hello to kevin he returned the greetings selfconsciously he didnt know any of these people by name another pair of double doors brought him into the main part of the building that housed the primates the air had a slightly feral odor intermittent shrieks and howls reverberated in the corridor through doors with windows of wireembedded glass kevin caught glimpses of large cages where monkeys were incarcerated outside the cages were men in coveralls and rubber boots pulling hoses the chimpanzee wing was one of the ells that extended from the back of the building into the forest it too was three stories tall kevin entered on the first floor immediately the sounds changed now there was as much hooting as shrieking cracking a door off the central corridor kevin got the attention of one of the workers in the coveralls he asked about dr edwards and was told the vet was in the bonobo unit kevin found a stairwell and climbed to the second floor he thought it was a coincidence that dr edwards happened to be in the bonobo unit just when kevin was looking for him it was through bonobos that kevin and dr edwards had met six years ago kevin had never heard of a bonobo but that changed rapidly when bonobos were selected as the subjects for his gensys project he now knew they were exceptional creatures they were cousins of chimpanzees but had lived in isolation in a twentyfivethousandsquaremile patch of virginal jungle in central zaire for one and a half million years in contrast to chimps bonobo society was matriarchal with less male aggression hence the bonobos were able to live in larger groups some people called them pygmy chimpanzees but the name was a misnomer because some bonobos were actually larger than some chimpanzees and they were a distinct species kevin found dr edwards in front of a relatively small acclimatization cage he was reaching through the bars making tentative contact with an adult female bonobo another female bonobo was sitting against the back wall of the cage her eyes were nervously darting around her new accommodations kevin could sense her terror dr edwards was hooting softly in imitation of one of the many bonobo and chimpanzee sounds of communication he was a relatively tall man a good three or four inches over kevins five foot ten his hair was a shocking white which contrasted dramatically with his almost black eyebrows and eyelashes the sharply demarcated eyebrows combined with a habit of wrinkling his forehead gave him a perpetually surprised look kevin watched for a moment dr edwardss obvious rapport with the animals had been something kevin had appreciated from their first meeting kevin sensed it was an intuitive talent and not something learned and it always impressed him excuse me kevin said finally dr edwards jumped as if hed been frightened even the bonobo shrieked and fled to the back of the cage im terribly sorry kevin said dr edwards smiled and put a hand to his chest no need to be sorry i was just so intent i didnt hear you approach i certainly didnt mean to frighten you dr edwards kevin began but i kevin please if ive told you once ive told you a dozen times my name is bertram i mean weve known each other for five years dont you think first names are more appropriate of course kevin said its serendipitous you should come bertram said meet our two newest breeding females bertram gestured toward the two apes whod inched away from the back wall kevins arrival had frightened them but they were now curious kevin gazed in at the dramatically anthropomorphic faces of the two primates bonobos faces were less prognathous than their cousins the chimpanzees and hence considerably more human kevin always found looking into bonobos eyes disconcerting healthyappearing animals kevin commented not knowing how else to respond they were just trucked in from zaire this morning bertram said its about a thousand miles as the crow flies but by the circuitous route they had to take to get across the borders of the congo and gabon they probably traveled three times that thats the equivalent of driving across the us kevin said in terms of distance bertram agreed but here they probably didnt see more than short stretches of pavement its an arduous trip no matter how you look at it they look like they are in good shape kevin said he wondered how hed appear if hed made the journey jammed into wooden boxes and hidden in the back of a truck by this time ive got the drivers pretty well trained bertram said they treat em better than they treat their own wives they know if the apes die they dont get paid its a pretty good incentive with our demand going up theyll be put to good use kevin said youd better believe it bertram said these two are already spoken for as you know if they pass all the tests which im certain they will well be over to your lab in the next couple of days i want to watch again i think you are a genius and melanie well ive never seen such handeye coordination even if you include an eye surgeon i used to know back in the states kevin blushed at the reference to himself melanie is quite talented he said to deflect the conversation melanie becket was a reproductive technologist gensys had recruited her mainly for kevins project shes good bertram said but the few of us lucky enough to be associated with your project know that you are the hero bertram looked up and down the space between the wall of the corridor and the cages to make sure that none of the coverallclad workers were in earshot you know when i signed on to come over here i thought my wife and i would do well bertram said moneywise i thought it would be as lucrative as going to saudi arabia but were doing better than id ever dreamed through your project and the stock options that come along with it were going to get rich just yesterday i heard from melanie that we have two more clients from new york city that will put us over one hundred i hadnt heard about the two additional clients kevin said no well its true bertram said melanie told me last night when i bumped into her at the rec center she said she spoke with raymond lyons im glad she informed me so i could send the drivers back to zaire for another shipment all i can say is that i hope our pygmy colleagues in lomako can keep up their end of the bargain kevin looked back into the cage at the two females they returned his stare with pleading expressions that melted kevins heart he wished he could tell them that they had nothing to fear all that would happen to them was that they would become pregnant within the month during their pregnancies theyd be kept indoors and would be treated to special nutritious diets after their babies were born theyd be put in the enormous bonobo outdoor enclosure to rear the infants when the youngsters reached age three the cycle would be repeated they sure are humanlooking bertram said interrupting kevins musing sometimes you cant help but wonder what they are thinking or worry what their offspring are capable of thinking kevin said bertram glanced at kevin his black eyebrows arched more than usual i dont follow he said listen bertram kevin said i came over here specifically to talk to you about the project how marvelously convenient bertram said i was going to call you today and have you come over to see the progress weve made and here you are come on bertram pulled open the nearest door to the corridor motioned for kevin to follow and set out with long strides kevin had to hurry to catch up progress kevin questioned although he admired bertram the mans tendency toward manic behavior was disconcerting under the best of circumstances kevin would have had trouble discussing what was on his mind just broaching the issue was difficult and bertram was not helping in fact he was making it impossible you betcha progress bertram said enthusiastically we solved the technical problems with the grid on the island its on line now as youll see we can locate any individual animal with the push of a button its just in time i might add with twelve square miles and almost a hundred individuals it was fast becoming impossible with the handheld trackers part of the problem is that we didnt anticipate the creatures would split into two separate sociological groups we were counting on their being one big happy family bertram kevin said between breaths marshaling his courage i wanted to talk to you because ive been anxious its no wonder bertram said as kevin paused id be anxious too if i put in the hours that you put in without any form of relaxation or release hell sometimes i see the light in your lab as late as midnight when the wife and i come out of the rec center after a movie weve even commented on it weve invited you to dinner at our house on several occasions to draw you out a little how come you never come kevin groaned inwardly this was not the conversation he wanted to get into all right you dont have to answer bertram said i dont want to add to your anxiety wed enjoy having you over so if you change your mind give us a call but what about the gym or the rec center or even the pool ive never seen you in any of those places being stuck here in this hothouse part of africa is bad enough but making yourself a prisoner of your lab or house just makes it worse im sure you are right kevin said but of course im right bertram said but there is another side to this that i should warn you about people are talking what do you mean kevin asked talking about what people are saying that youre aloof because you think you are superior bertram said you know the academician with all his fancy degrees from harvard and mit its easy for people to misinterpret your behavior especially if they are envious why would anybody be envious of me kevin asked he was shocked very easy bertram said you obviously get special treatment from the home office you get a new car every two years and your quarters are as good as siegfried spalleks the manager for the entire operation thats bound to raise some eyebrows particularly from people like cameron mcivers who was stupid enough to bring his whole damn family out here plus you got that nmr machine the hospital administrator and i have been lobbying for an mri since day one i tried to talk them out of giving me the house kevin said i said it was too big hey you dont have to defend your perks to me bertram said i understand because im privy to your project but very few other people are and some of them arent happy even spallek doesnt quite understand although he definitely likes participating in the bonus your project has brought those of us who are lucky enough to be associated before kevin could respond bertram was stopped for a series of corridor consultations he and bertram had been traversing the veterinary hospital kevin used the interruption to ponder bertrams comments kevin had always thought of himself as being rather invisible the idea that hed engendered animosities was hard to comprehend sorry bertram offered after the final consult he pushed through the last of the double doors kevin followed passing his secretary martha he picked up a small stack of phone messages he leafed through them as he waved kevin into his inner office he closed his door youre going to love this bertram said tossing the messages aside he sat down in front of his computer and showed kevin how to bring up a graphic of isla francesca it was divided into a grid now give me the number of whatever creature you want to locate mine kevin said number one coming up bertram said he entered the information and clicked suddenly a red blinking light appeared on the map of the island it was north of the limestone escarpment but south of the stream that had been humorously dubbed rio diviso the stream bisected the sixbytwomile island lengthwise flowing east to west in the center of the island was a pond theyd called lago hippo for obvious reasons pretty slick huh bertram said proudly kevin was captivated it wasnt so much by the technology although that interested him it was more because the red light was blinking exactly where he would have imagined the smoke to have been coming from bertram got up and pulled open a file drawer it was filled with small handheld electronic devices that looked like miniature notepads with small lcd screens an extendable antenna protruded from each these work in a similar fashion bertram said he handed one to kevin we call them locators of course they are portable and can be taken into the field it makes retrieval a snap compared to the struggles we had initially kevin played with the keyboard with bertrams help he soon had the island graphic with the red blinking light displayed bertram showed how to go from successive maps with smaller and smaller scales until the entire screen represented a square fifty feet by fifty feet once you are that close you use this bertram said he handed kevin an instrument that looked like a flashlight with a keypad on this you type in the same information what it does is function as a directional beacon it pings louder the closer it comes to pointing at the animal youre looking for when there is a clear visual sighting it emits a continuous sound then all you have to do is use the dart gun how does this tracking system operate kevin asked having been immersed in the biomolecular aspects of the project hed not paid any attention to the logistics hed toured the island five years previously at the commencement of the venture but that had been it hed never inquired about the nuts and bolts of everyday operation its a satellite system bertram said i dont pretend to know the details of course each animal has a small microchip with a longlasting nickel cadmium battery embedded just under the derma the afferent signal from the microchip is minuscule but its picked up by the grid magnified and transmitted by microwave kevin started to give the devices back to bertram but bertram waved them away keep them he said weve got plenty of others but i dont need them kevin protested come on kevin bertram chided playfully while thumping kevin on the back the blow was hard enough to knock kevin forward loosen up youre much too serious bertram sat at his desk picked up his phone messages and absently began to arrange them in order of importance kevin glanced at the electronic devices in his hands and wondered what hed do with them they were obviously costly instruments what was it about your project that you wanted to discuss with me bertram asked he looked up from his phone messages people are always complaining i dont allow them to get a word in edgewise whats on your mind im concerned kevin stammered about what bertram asked things couldnt be going any better ive seen the smoke again kevin managed what you mean like that wisp of smoke you mentioned to me last week bertram asked exactly kevin said and from the same spot on the island ah its nothing bertram declared with a wave of his hand weve been having electrical storms just about every other night lightning starts fires everybody knows that as wet as everything is kevin said i thought lightning starts fires in savannas during the dry season not in dank equatorial rain forests lightning can start a fire anyplace bertram said think of the heat it generates remember thunder is nothing but expansion of air from the heat its unbelievable well maybe kevin said he was unconvinced but even if it were to start a fire would it last youre like a dog with a bone bertram commented have you mentioned this crazy idea to anybody else only to raymond lyons kevin said he called me yesterday about another problem and what was his response bertram asked he told me not to let my imagination run wild kevin said id say that was good advice bertram said i second the motion i dont know kevin said maybe we should go out there and check no bertram snapped for a fleeting moment his mouth formed a hard line and his blue eyes blazed then his face relaxed i dont want to go to the island except for a retrieval that was the original plan and by golly were sticking with it as well as everything is going i dont want to take any chances the animals are to remain isolated and undisturbed the only person who goes there is the pygmy alphonse kimba and he goes only to pull supplementary food across to the island maybe i could go by myself kevin suggested it wouldnt take me long and then i can stop worrying absolutely not bertram said emphatically im in charge of this part of the project and i forbid you or anyone else to go on the island i dont see that it would make that much difference kevin said i wouldnt bother the animals no bertram said there are to be no exceptions we want these to be wild animals that means minimal contact besides with as small as this enclave is visits will provoke talk and we dont want that and on top of that it could be dangerous dangerous kevin questioned id stay away from the hippos and the crocs the bonobos certainly arent dangerous one of the pygmy bearers was killed on the last retrieval bertram said weve kept that very quiet for obvious reasons how was he killed kevin asked by a rock bertram said one of the bonobos threw a rock isnt that unusual kevin asked bertram shrugged chimps are known to throw sticks on occasion when they are stressed or scared no i dont think its unusual it was probably just a reflex gesture the rock was there so he threw it but its also aggressive kevin said thats unusual for a bonobo especially one of ours all apes will defend their group when attacked bertram said but why should they have felt they were being attacked kevin asked that was the fourth retrieval bertram said he shrugged again maybe theyre learning what to expect but whatever the reason we dont want anyone going to the island spallek and i have discussed this and hes in full agreement bertram got up from the desk and draped an arm over kevins shoulders kevin tried to ease himself away but bertram held on come on kevin relax this kind of wild flight of imagination of yours is exactly what i was talking about earlier youve got to get out of your lab and do something to divert that overactive mind of yours youre going stircrazy and youre obsessing i mean this fire crap is ridiculous the irony is that the project is going splendidly how about reconsidering that offer for coming over for dinner trish and i would be delighted ill give it serious thought kevin said he felt distinctly uncomfortable with bertrams arm around his neck good bertram said he gave kevin a final pat on his back maybe the three of us could take in a movie as well theres a terrific doublefeature scheduled for this week i mean you ought to take advantage of the fact that we get the latest movies its a big effort on gensyss part to fly them in here on a weekly basis what do you say i guess kevin said evasively good bertram said ill mention it to trish shell give you a call okay okay kevin said he smiled weakly five minutes later kevin climbed back into his vehicle more confused than before hed come to see bertram edwards he didnt know what to think maybe his imagination was working overtime it was possible but short of visiting isla francesca there was no way of knowing for sure and on top of that was this new worry that people were feeling resentful towards him braking at the exit of the parking area kevin glanced up and down the road in front of the animal complex he waited for a large truck to rumble by as he was about to pull out his eye caught the sight of a man standing motionlessly in the window of the moroccan headquarters kevin couldnt see him well because of the sunlight reflecting off the glass but he could tell it was one of the mustached guards he could also tell the man was watching him intently kevin shivered without exactly knowing why the ride back to the hospital was uneventful and quick but the seemingly impenetrable walls of dark green vegetation gave kevin an uncomfortable claustrophobic feeling kevins response was to press down on the accelerator he was relieved to reach the edge of town kevin parked in his spot he opened his door but hesitated it was close to noon and he debated heading home for lunch or going up to his lab for an hour or so the lab won out esmeralda never expected him before one just with the short walk from the car to the hospital kevin could appreciate the intensity of the noontime sun it was like an oppressive blanket that made all movement more difficult even breathing until hed come to africa hed never experienced true tropical heat once inside enveloped with cool airconditioned air kevin grasped the edge of his collar and pulled his shirt away from his back he started up the stairs but he didnt get far dr marshall a voice called kevin looked behind him he wasnt accustomed to being accosted in the stairwell shame on you dr marshall a woman said standing at the base of the stairs her voice had a lilting quality that suggested she was being less than serious she was clad in surgical scrubs and a white coat the sleeves of the coat were rolled up to her midforearms excuse me kevin said the woman looked familiar but he couldnt place her you havent been to see the patient the woman said with other cases you came each day well thats true kevin said selfconsciously hed finally recognized the woman it was the nurse candace brickmann she was part of the surgical team that flew in with the patient this was her fourth trip to cogo kevin had met her briefly on all three previous visits youve hurt mr winchesters feelings candace said wagging her finger at kevin she was a vivacious gamine in her late twenties with fine lightblond hair done up in a french twist kevin couldnt remember a time hed seen her that she wasnt smiling i didnt think hed notice kevin stammered candace threw back her head and laughed then she covered her mouth with her hand to suppress further giggles when she saw kevins confused expression im only teasing she said im not even sure mr winchester remembers meeting you on that hectic day of arrival well i meant to come and see how he was doing kevin said ive just been too busy too busy in this place in the middle of nowhere candace asked well i guess its more that ive been preoccupied kevin admitted a lot has been happening like what candace asked suppressing a smile she liked this shy unassuming researcher kevin made some fumbling gestures with his hands while his face flushed all sorts of things he said finally you academic types crack me up candace said but teasing aside im happy to report that mr winchester is doing just fine and i understand from the surgeon thats largely thanks to you i wouldnt go that far kevin said oh modest too candace commented smart cute and humble thats a killing combination kevin stuttered but no words came out would it be out of bounds for me to invite you to join me for lunch candace said i thought id walk over and get a hamburger im a little tired of the hospital cafeteria food and it would be nice to get a little air now that the sun is out what do you say kevins mind whirled the invitation was unexpected and under normal circumstances he would have found reason to decline for that reason alone but with bertrams comments fresh in his mind he wavered cat got your tongue candace asked she lowered her head and flirtatiously peered at him beneath arched eyebrows kevin gestured up toward his lab then mumbled words to the effect that esmeralda was expecting him cant you give her a call candace asked she had the intuitive feeling kevin wanted to join her so she persisted i guess kevin said i suppose i could call from my lab fine candace said do you want me to wait here or come with you kevin had never met such a forward female not that he had a lot of opportunity or experience his last and only love other than a couple of high school crushes had been a fellow doctorate candidate jacqueline morton that relationship had taken months to develop out of long hours working together shed been as shy as kevin candace came up the five stairs to stand next to kevin she was about fivethree in her nikes if you cant decide and its all the same to you why dont i come up okay kevin said kevins nervousness quickly abated usually what bothered him in social circumstances with females was the stress of trying to think of things to talk about with candace he didnt have time to think she maintained a running conversation during the ascent of the two flights of stairs she managed to bring up the weather the town the hospital and how the surgery had gone this is my lab kevin said after opening the door fantastic candace said with sincerity kevin smiled he could tell she was truly impressed you go ahead and make your call candace said ill just look around if its okay if youd like kevin said although kevin was concerned about giving esmeralda so little warning hed not be there for lunch she surprised him with her equanimity her only response was to ask when kevin wanted dinner at the usual time kevin said then after a brief hesitation he surprised himself by adding i might have company would that be a problem not at all esmeralda said how many persons just one kevin said he hung up the phone and wiped his palms together they were a little damp are we on for lunch candace called from across the room lets go kevin said this is some lab she commented i never would have expected to find it here in the heart of tropical africa tell me what is it that youre doing with all this fantastic equipment im trying to perfect the protocol kevin said cant you be more specific candace asked you really want to know kevin asked yes candace said im interested at this stage im dealing with minor histocompatibility antigens you know proteins that define you as a unique separate individual and what do you do with them well i locate their genes on the proper chromosome kevin said then i search for the transponase thats associated with the genes if theres any so i can move the genes candace let out a little laugh youve lost me already she admitted i havent the foggiest notion what a transponase is in fact im afraid a lot of this molecular biology is over my head it really isnt kevin said the principles arent that complicated the critical fact few people realize is that some genes can move around on their chromosome this happens particularly in b lymphocytes to increase the diversity of antibodies other genes are even more mobile and can change places with their twins you do remember that there are two copies of every gene yup candace said just like there are two copies of each chromosome our cells have twentythree chromosome pairs exactly kevin said when genes exchange places on their chromosome pairs its called homologous transposition its a particularly important process in the generation of sex cells both eggs and sperms what it does is help increase genetic shuffling and hence the ability of species to evolve so this homologous transposition plays a role in evolution candace said absolutely kevin agreed anyway the gene segments that move are called transposons and the enzymes that catalyze their movement are called transponases okay candace said i follow you so far well right now im interested in transposons that contain the genes for minor histocompatibility antigens kevin said i see candace said nodding her head im getting the picture youre goal is to move the gene for a minor histocompatibility antigen from one chromosome to another exactly kevin said the trick of course is finding and isolating the transponase thats the difficult step but once ive found the transponase its relatively easy to locate its gene and once ive located and isolated the gene i can use standard recombinant dna technology to produce it meaning getting bacteria to make it for you candace said bacteria or mammalian tissue culture kevin said whatever works best phew candace commented this brain game is reminding me how hungry i am lets get some hamburgers before my blood sugar bottoms out kevin smiled he liked this woman he was even starting to relax descending the hospital stairs kevin felt a little giddy while listening and responding to candaces entertaining nonstop questions and chatter he couldnt believe he was going to lunch with such an attractive engaging female it seemed to him that more things had happened in the last couple of days than during the previous five years hed been in cogo he was so preoccupied he didnt give a thought to the equatoguinean soldiers as he and candace crossed the square kevin had not been in the rec center since his initial orientation tour hed forgotten its quaintness hed also forgotten how blasphemous it was that the church had been recycled to provide worldly diversion the altar was gone but the pulpit was still in place off to the left it was used for lectures and for calling out the numbers on bingo night in place of the altar was the movie screen an unintended sign of the times the commissary was in the basement and was reached by a stairway in the narthex kevin was surprised at how busy it was a babble of voices echoed off the harsh concrete ceiling he and candace had to stand in a long line before ordering then after theyd gotten their food they had to search in the confusion for a place to sit the tables were all long and had to be shared the seats were benches attached like picnic tables there are some seats candace called out over the chatter she pointed toward the rear of the room with her tray kevin nodded kevin glanced furtively at the faces in the crowd as he weaved his way after candace he felt selfconscious given bertrams insight into popular opinion yet no one paid him the slightest attention kevin followed candace as she squeezed between two tables he held his tray high to avoid hitting anyone then put it down at an empty spot he had to struggle to get his legs over the seat and under the table by the time he was situated candace had already introduced herself to the two people sitting on the aisle kevin nodded to them he didnt recognize either one lively place candace said she reached for catsup do you come here often before kevin could respond someone called out his name he turned and recognized the lone familiar face it was melanie becket the reproductive technologist kevin marshall melanie exclaimed again im shocked what are you doing here melanie was about the same age as candace shed celebrated her thirtieth birthday the previous month where candace was light she was dark with mediumbrown hair and coloration that seemed mediterranean her dark brown eyes were nearly black kevin struggled to introduce his lunchmate and was horrified to realize that for the moment he couldnt remember her name im candace brickmann candace said without missing a beat she reached out a hand melanie introduced herself and asked if she could join them by all means candace said candace and kevin were sitting side by side melanie sat opposite are you responsible for our local geniuss presence at the ptomaine palace melanie asked candace melanie was a sharpwitted playfully irreverent woman whod grown up in manhattan i guess candace said is this unusual for him thats the understatement of the year melanie said whats your secret ive asked him to come over here so many times to no avail that i finally gave up and that was several years ago you never asked me specifically kevin said in his own defense oh really melanie questioned what did i have to dodraw you a map i used to ask if you wanted to grab a burger wasnt that specific enough well candace said straightening up in her seat this must be my lucky day melanie and candace fell into easy conversation exchanging job descriptions kevin listened but concentrated on his hamburger so were all three part of the same project melanie commented when she heard that candace was the intensivecare nurse of the surgical team from pittsburgh three peas in a pod youre being generous candace said im just one of the low men on the therapeutic totem pole i wouldnt put myself on the same level with you guys youre the ones that make it all possible if you dont mind my asking how on earth do you do it shes the hero kevin said speaking up for the first time and nodding toward melanie come on kevin melanie complained i didnt develop the techniques i use the way you did there are lots of people who could have done my job but only you could have done yours it was your breakthrough that was key no arguing you two candace said just tell me how its done ive been curious from day one but everything has been so hushhush kevins explained the science to me but i still dont understand the logistics kevin gets a bonemarrow sample from a client melanie said from that he isolates a cell preparing to divide so that the chromosomes are condensed preferably a stem cell if im correct its pretty rare to find a stem cell kevin said well then you tell her what you do melanie said to kevin with a dismissive wave of her hand ill get it all balled up i work with a transponase that i discovered almost seven years ago kevin said it catalyzes the homologous transposition or crossing over of the short arms of chromosome six whats the short arm of chromosome six candace asked chromosomes have whats called a centromere that divides them into two segments melanie explained chromosome six has particularly unequal segments the little ones are called the short arms thank you candace said so kevin said trying to organize his thoughts what i do is add my secret transponase to a clients cell that is preparing to divide but i dont let the crossingover go to completion i halt it with the two short arms detached from their respective chromosomes then i extract them wow candace remarked you actually take these tiny tiny strands out of the nucleus how on earth can you do that thats another story kevin said actually i use a monoclonal antibody system that recognizes the backside of the transponase this is getting over my head candace said well forget how he gets the short arms out melanie said just accept it okay candace said what do you do with these detached short arms kevin pointed toward melanie i wait for her to work her magic its not magic melanie said im just a technician i apply in vitro fertilization techniques to the bonobos the same techniques that were developed to increase the fertility of captive mountain gorillas actually kevin and i have to coordinate our efforts because what he wants is a fertilized egg that has yet to divide timing is important i want it just ready to divide kevin said so its melanies schedule that determines mine i dont start my part until she gives me the green light when she delivers the zygote i repeat exactly the same procedure that id just done with the clients cell after removing the bonobo short arms i inject the clients short arms into the zygote thanks to the transponase they hook right up exactly where they are supposed to be and thats it candace said well no kevin admitted actually i introduce four transponases not one the short arm of chromosome six is the major segment that were transferring but we also transfer a relatively small part of chromosomes nine twelve and fourteen these carry the genes for the abo blood groups and a few other minor histocompatibility antigens like cd adhesion molecules but that gets too complicated just think about chromosome six its the most important part thats because chromosome six contains the genes that make up the major histocompatibility complex candace said knowledgeably exactly kevin said he was impressed and smitten not only was candace socially adept she was also smart and informed would this protocol work with other animals candace asked what kind would you have in mind kevin asked pigs candace said i know other centers in the us and england have been trying to reduce the destructive effect of complement in transplantation with pig organs by inserting a human gene compared with what we are doing thats like using leeches melanie said its so oldfashioned because it is treating the symptom not eliminating its cause its true kevin said in our protocol there is no immunological reaction to worry about histocompatibilitywise were offering an immunological double especially if i can incorporate a few more of the minor antigens i dont know why you are agonizing over them melanie said in our first three transplants the clients havent had any rejection reaction at all zilch i want it perfect kevin said im asking about pigs for several reasons candace said first i think using bonobos may offend some people second i understand there arent very many of them thats true kevin said the total world population of bonobos is only about twenty thousand thats my point candace said whereas pigs are slaughtered for bacon by the hundred of thousands i dont think my system would work with pigs kevin said i dont know for sure but i doubt it the reason it works so well in bonobos or chimps for that matter is that their genomes and ours are so similar in fact they differ by only one and a half percent thats all candace questioned she was amazed its kind of humbling isnt it kevin said its more than humbling candace said its indicative of how close bonobos chimps and humans are evolutionarily melanie said its thought we and our primate cousins have descended from a common ancestor who lived around seven million years ago that underscores the ethical question about using them candace said and why some people might be offended by their use they look so human i mean doesnt it bother you guys when one of them has to be sacrificed this liver transplant with mr winchester is only the second that required a sacrifice melanie said the other two were kidneys and the animals are fine well how did this case make you feel candace asked most of us on the surgical team were more upset this time even though we thought we were prepared especially since it was the second sacrifice kevin looked at melanie his mouth had gone dry candace was forcing him to face an issue hed struggled to avoid it was part of the reason the smoke coming from isla francesca upset him so much yeah it bothers me melanie said but i guess im so thrilled with the involved science and what it can do for a patient that i try not to think about it besides we never expect to have to use many of them they are more like insurance in case the clients might need them we dont accept people who already need transplant organs unless they can wait the three plus years it takes for their double to come of age and we dont have to interact with these creatures they live off on an island by themselves thats by design so that no one here has the chance to form emotional bonds of any sort kevin swallowed with difficulty in his minds eye he could see the smoke lazily snaking its way into the dull leaden sky he could also imagine the stressed bonobo picking up a rock and throwing it with deadly accuracy at the pygmy during the retrieval process whats the term when animals have human genes incorporated into them candace asked transgenic melanie said right candace said i just wish we could be using transgenic pigs instead of bonobos this procedure bothers me as much as i like the money and the gensys stock im not so sure im going to stick with the program theyre not going to like that melanie said remember you signed a contract i understand they are sticklers about holding people to their original agreements candace shrugged ill give them back all the stock options included i can live without it ill just have to see how i feel id be much happier if we were using pigs when we put that last bonobo under anesthesia i could have sworn he was trying to communicate with us we had to use a ton of sedative oh come on kevin snapped suddenly furious his face was flushed melanies eyes opened wide what in heavens name has gotten into you kevin instantly regretted his outburst sorry he said his heart was still pounding he hated the fact that he was always so transparent or felt he was melanie rolled her eyes for candaces benefit but candace didnt catch it she was watching kevin i have a feeling you were as bummed out as i was she said to him kevin breathed out noisily then took a bite of hamburger to avoid saying anything hed later regret why dont you want to talk about it candace asked kevin shook his head while he chewed he guessed his face was still beetred dont worry about him melanie said hell recover candace faced melanie the bonobos are just so human she commented going back to one of her original points so i guess we shouldnt be shocked that their genomes differ by only one and a half percent but something just occurred to me if you guys are replacing the short arms of chromosome six as well as some other smaller segments of the bonobo genome with human dna what percentage do you think youre dealing with melanie looked at kevin while she made a mental calculation she arched her eyebrows hmmm she said thats a curious point that would be over two percent yeah but the one and a half percent is not all on the short arm of chromosome six kevin snapped again hey calm down bucko melanie said she put down her soft drink reached across the table and put her hand on kevins shoulder youre out of control all were doing is having a conversation you know its sort of normal for people to sit and talk i know you find that weird since youd rather interact with your centrifuge tubes but whats wrong kevin sighed it went against his nature but he decided to confide in these two bright confident women he admitted he was upset as if we didnt know melanie said with another roll of her eyes cant you be more specific whats bugging you just what candace is talking about kevin said shes said a lot of things melanie said yeah and theyre all making me feel like ive made a monumental mistake melanie took her hand away and stared into the depths of kevins topazcolored eyes in what regard she questioned by adding so much human dna kevin said the short arm of chromosome six has millions of base pairs and hundreds of genes that have nothing to do with the major histocompatibility complex i should have isolated the complex instead of taking the easy route so the creatures have a few more human proteins melanie said big deal thats exactly how i felt at first kevin said at least until i put an inquiry out over the internet asking if anyone knew what other kinds of genes were on the short arm of chromosome six unfortunately one of the responders informed me there was a large segment of developmental genes now i have no idea what ive created of course you do candace said youve created a transgenic bonobo i know kevin said with his eyes blazing he was breathing rapidly and perspiration had appeared on his forehead and by doing so im terrified ive overstepped the bounds chapter march pm cogo equatorial guinea bertram pulled his threeyearold jeep cherokee into the parking area behind the town hall and yanked on the brake the car had been giving him trouble and had spent innumerable days being repaired in the motor pool but the problem had persisted and that fact made him particularly irritated when kevin marshall pretended not to know how lucky he was to get a new toyota every two years bertram wasnt scheduled for a new car for another year bertram took the stairs that rose up behind the firstfloor arcade to reach the veranda that ringed the building from there he walked into the central office by siegfried spalleks choice it had not been airconditioned a large ceiling fan lazily rotated with a particular wavering hum the long flat blades kept the sizable rooms warm moist air on the move bertram had called ahead so siegfrieds secretary a broadfaced black man named aurielo from the island of bioko was expecting him and waved him into the inner office aurielo had been trained in france as a schoolteacher but had been unemployed until gensys founded the zone the inner office was larger than the outer and extended the entire width of the building it had shuttered windows overlooking the parking lot in the back and the town square in the front the front windows yielded the impressive view of the new hospitallaboratory complex from where bertram was standing he could even see kevins laboratory windows sit down siegfried said without looking up his voice had a harsh guttural quality with a slight germanic accent it was commandingly authoritarian he was signing a stack of correspondence ill be finished in a moment bertrams eyes wandered around the cluttered office it was a place that never made him feel comfortable as a veterinarian and moderate environmentalist he did not appreciate the decor covering the walls and every available horizontal surface were glassyeyed stuffed heads of animals many of which were endangered species there were cats such as lions leopards and cheetahs there was a bewildering variety of antelope more than bertram knew existed several enormous rhino heads peered blankly down from positions of prominence on the wall behind spallek on top of the bookcase were snakes including a rearing cobra on the floor was an enormous crocodile with its mouth partially ajar to reveal its fearsome teeth the table next to bertrams chair was an elephants foot topped with a slab of mahogany in the corners stood crossed elephant tusks even more bothersome to bertram than the stuffed animals were the skulls there were three of them on siegfrieds desk all three had their tops sawn off one had an apparent bullet hole through the temple they were used respectively for paper clips ashtray and to hold a large candle although the zones electric power was the most reliable in the entire country it did go off on rare occasions because of lightning strikes most people especially visitors from gensys assumed the skulls were from apes bertram knew differently they were human skulls of people executed by the equatoguinean soldiers all three of the victims had been convicted of the capital offense of interfering with gensys operations in actuality they had been caught poaching wild chimps on the zones designated hundredsquaremile land siegfried considered the area his own private hunting reserve years previously when bertram had gently questioned the wisdom of displaying the skulls siegfried had responded by saying that they kept the native workers on their toes its the kind of communication they comprehend siegfried had explained they understand such symbols bertram didnt wonder that they got the message especially in a country which had suffered the atrocities of a diabolically cruel dictator bertram always remembered kevins response to the skulls kevin had said that they reminded him of the deranged character kurtz in joseph conrads heart of darkness there siegfried said pushing the signed papers aside with his accent it sounded more like zair whats on your mind bertram i hope you dont have a problem with the new bonobos not at all the two breeding females are perfect bertram said he eyed the zones site boss his most obvious physical trait was a grotesque scar that ran from beneath his left ear down across his cheek and under his nose over the years its gradual contraction had pulled up the corner of siegfrieds mouth in a perpetual sneer bertram did not technically report to siegfried as the chief vet of the worlds largest primate research and breeding facility bertram dealt directly with a gensys senior vice president of operations back in cambridge massachusetts who had direct access to taylor cabot but on a daytoday basis particularly in relation to the bonobo project it was in bertrams best interest to maintain a cordial working relationship with the site boss the problem was siegfried was shorttempered and difficult to deal with hed started his african career as a white hunter who for a price could get a client anything he wanted such a reputation required a move from east africa to west africa where game laws were less rigidly enforced siegfried had built up a large organization and things went well until some trackers failed him in a crucial situation resulting in his being mauled by an enormous bull elephant and the client couple being killed the episode ended siegfrieds career as a white hunter it also left him with his facial scar and a paralyzed right arm the extremity hung limp and useless from its shoulder connection rage over the incident had made him a bitter and vindictive man still gensys had recognized his bushbased organizational skills his knowledge of animal behavior and his heavyhanded but effectual way of dealing with the indigenous african personality they thought he was the perfect individual to run their multimilliondollar african operation theres another wrinkle with the bonobo operation bertram said is this new concern in addition to the weird worry of yours that the apes have divided into two groups siegfried asked superciliously recognizing a change in social organization is a damn legitimate concern bertram said his color rising so you said siegfried remarked but ive been thinking about it and i cant imagine it matters what do we care if they hang out in one group or ten all we want them to do is stay put and stay healthy i disagree bertram said splitting up suggests they are not getting along that would not be typical bonobo behavior and it could spell trouble down the road ill let you the professional worry about it siegfried said he leaned back in his chair and it squeaked i personally dont care what those apes do as long as nothing threatens this windfall money and stock options the project is turning into a gold mine the new problem has to do with kevin marshall bertram said now what in gods name could that skinny simpleton do to get you to worry siegfried asked with your paranoia its a good thing you dont have to do my job the nerd has worked himself up because hes seen smoke coming from the island bertram said hes come to me twice once last week and then again this morning whats the big deal about smoke siegfried asked why does he care he sounds worse than you he thinks the bonobos might be using fire bertram said he hasnt said so explicitly but im sure thats what is on his mind what do you mean using fire siegfried asked he leaned forward you mean like making a campfire for warmth or cooking siegfried laughed without disturbing his omnipresent sneer i dont know about you urban americans out here in the bush youre scared of your own shadow i know its preposetrous bertram said of course no one else has seen it or if they have its probably from a lightning storm the problem is he wants to go out there no one goes near the island siegfried growled only during a harvest and its only the harvest team thats a directive from the home office there are no exceptions save for kimba the pygmy delivering the supplementary food i told him the same thing bertram said and i dont think hell do anything on his own still i thought i should tell you about it just the same its good that you did siegfried said irritably the little prick hes a goddamned thorn in my side there is one other thing bertram said he told raymond lyons about the smoke siegfried slapped the surface of his desk with his good hand loud enough to cause bertram to jump he stood up and stepped to the shuttered window overlooking the town square he glared over at the hospital hed never liked the epicene bookish researcher from their first meeting when hed learned kevin was to be coddled and accommodated in the second best house in the town siegfried had boiled over hed wanted to assign the house as a perk to one of his loyal underlings siegfried balled his good hand into a fist and gritted his teeth what a meddling pain in the ass he said his research is almost done bertram said it would be a shame if he was to muck things up just when everything is going so well what did lyons say siegfried asked nothing bertram said he accused kevin of letting his imagination run wild i might have to have someone watch kevin siegfried said i will not have anyone destroy this program thats all there is to it its too lucrative bertram stood up thats your department he said he started for the door confident hed planted the appropriate seed chapter march am new york city the combination of cheap red wine and little sleep slowed jacks pace on his morning bicycle commute his customary time of arrival in the id room of the medical examiners office was sevenfifteen but as he got off the elevator on the first floor of the morgue en route to the id room he noticed it was already seven twentyfive and it bothered him it wasnt as if he were late it was just that jack liked to keep to a schedule discipline in relation to his work was one of the ways hed learned to avoid depression his first order of business was to pour himself a cup of coffee from the communal pot even the aroma seemed to have a beneficial effect which jack attributed to pavlovian conditioning he took his first sip it was a heavenly experience though he doubted the caffeine could work quite so quickly he felt like his mild hangover headache was already on the mend he stepped over to vinnie amendola the mortuary tech whose day shift overlapped the night shift he was ensconced as usual at one of the offices governmentissued metal desks his feet were parked on the corner and his face hidden behind his morning newspaper jack pulled the edge of the paper down to expose vinnies italianate features to the world he was in his late twenties in sorry physical shape but handsome his dark thick hair was something jack envied jack had been noticing over the previous year a decided thinning of his graystreaked brown hair on the crown of his head hey einstein whats the paper say about the franconi body incident jack asked jack and vinnie worked together on a frequent basis both appreciating the others flippancy quick wit and black humor i dont know vinnie said he tried to pull his beloved paper from jacks grasp he was embroiled in the knicks stats from the previous nights basketball game jacks forehead furrowed vinnie might not have been an academic genius but about current news items he was something of a resident authority he read the newspapers cover to cover every day and had impressive recall theres nothing about it in the paper jack questioned he was shocked hed imagined the media would have had a field day with the embarrassment of the body disappearing from the morgue bureaucratic mismanagement was a favorite journalistic theme i didnt notice it vinnie said he yanked harder freed the paper and reburied his face jack shook his head he was truly surprised and wondered how harold bingham the chief medical examiner had managed such a media coverup just as jack was about to turn away he caught the headlines it said mob thumbs nose at authority the subhead read vaccarro crime family kills one of its own then steals the body out from under the noses of city officials jack snatched the entire paper from the surprised vinnies grasp vinnies legs fell to the floor with a thump hey come on he complained jack folded the paper then held it so that vinnie was forced to stare at the front page i thought you said the story wasnt in the paper jack said i didnt say it wasnt in there vinnie said i said i didnt see it its the headlines for crissake jack said he pointed at them with his coffee cup for emphasis vinnie lunged out to grab his paper jack pulled it away from his grasp come on vinnie whined get your own freakin paper youve got me curious jack said as methodical as you are youd have read this frontpage story on your subway ride into town whats up vinnie nothing vinnie said i just went directly to the sports page jack studied vinnies face for a moment vinnie looked away to avoid eye contact are you sick jack asked facetiously no vinnie snapped just give me the paper jack slipped out the sports pages and handed them over then he went over to the scheduling desk and started the article it began on the front page and concluded on the third as jack anticipated it was written from a sarcastic mocking point of view it cast equal aspersion on the police department and the medical examiners office it said the whole sordid affair was just another glowing example of the gross incompetence of both organizations laurie breezed into the room and interrupted jack as she removed her coat she told him that she hoped he felt better than she probably not jack admitted it was that cheap wine i brought over im sorry it was also the five hours of sleep laurie said i had a terrible time hauling myself out of bed she put her coat down on a chair good morning vinnie she called out vinnie stayed silent behind his sports page hes pouting because i violated his paper jack said jack got up so laurie could sit down at the scheduling desk it was lauries week to divvy up the cases for autopsy among the staff the headlines and cover story are about the franconi incident i wouldnt wonder laurie said it was all over the local news and i heard it announced that bingham will be on good morning america to attempt damage control hes got his hands full jack said have you looked at todays cases laurie asked as she started glancing through the twenty or so folders i just got here myself jack admitted he continued reading the article oh this is good jack commented after a moments silence theyre alleging that there is some kind of conspiracy between us and the police department they suggest we might have deliberately disposed of the body for their benefit can you imagine these media people are so paranoid that they see conspiracy in everything its the public who is paranoid laurie said the media likes to give them what they want but that kind of wild theory is exactly why im going to find out how that body disappeared the public has to know we are impartial i was hoping youd have a change of heart and given up on that quest after a nights sleep jack mumbled while continuing to read not a chance laurie said this is crazy jack said slapping the page of newsprint first they suggest we here at the me office were responsible for the body disappearing and now they say the mob undoubtedly buried the remains in the wilds of westchester so they will never be found the last part is probably correct laurie said unless the body turns up in the spring thaw with the frost its hard to dig more than a foot below the surface gads what trash jack commented as he finished the article here you want to read it he offered the front pages of the paper to laurie laurie waved them off thanks but i already read the version in the times she said it was caustic enough i dont need the new york posts point of view jack went back over to vinnie and quipped that he was willing to return his paper to its virginal state vinnie took the pages without comment you are awfully sensitive today jack said to the tech just leave me alone vinnie snapped whoa watch out laurie jack said i think vinnie has premental tension hes probably planning on doing some thinking and its got his hormones all out of whack uhoh laurie called out heres that floater that mike passano mentioned last night who should i assign it to trouble is i dont think im mad at anyone and to forestall guilt ill probably end up doing it myself give it to me jack said you dont care laurie asked she hated floaters especially those which had been in the water for a long time such autopsies were unpleasant and often difficult jobs nah jack said once you get past the smell you got it licked please laurie murmured thats disgusting seriously jack said they can be a challenge i like them better than gunshot wounds this one is both laurie commented as she put jack down for the floater how delightful jack commented he walked back to the scheduling desk and looked over lauries shoulder theres a presumptive close range shotgun blast to the upperright quadrant laurie said its sounding better and better jack said whats the victims name no name laurie said in fact that will be part of your challenge the head and the hands are missing laurie handed jack the folder he leaned on the edge of the desk and slid out the contents there wasnt much information what there was came from the forensic investigator janice jaeger janice wrote that the body had been discovered in the atlantic ocean way out off coney island it had been inadvertently found by a coast guard cutter which had been lying in wait under the cover of night for some suspected drug runners the coast guard had acted on an anonymous tip and at the time of the discovery had been essentially dead in the water with their lights out and radar on the cutter had literally bumped up against the body the presumption was that it was the remains of the drug runnerinformer not a lot to go on jack said all the more challenge laurie teased jack slipped off the desk and headed for the communications room en route to the elevator come on grouchy he called to vinnie he gave vinnies paper a slap and his arm a tug as he passed times a wasting but at the door he literally bumped into lou soldano the detective lieutenant had his mind on his goal the coffee machine jeez jack commented you should try out for the new york giants some of his coffee had sloshed out onto the floor sorry lou said im in sorry need of some java both men went to the coffeepot jack used some paper towels to dab at the spill down the front of his corduroy jacket lou filled a styrofoam cup to the brim with a shaky hand then sipped enough to allow for plenty of cream and sugar lou sighed its been a grueling couple of days have you been partying all night again jack said lous face was stubbled with a heavy growth of whiskers he had on a wrinkled blue shirt with the top button undone and his tie loosened and askew his colombostyle trench coat looked like something a homeless person would wear i wish lou grunted ive seen about three hours of sleep in the last two nights he walked over said hello to laurie and sat down heavily in a chair next to the scheduling desk any progress on the franconi case laurie asked nothing that pleases the captain the area commander or the police commissioner lou said dejectedly what a mess the worry is some heads are going to roll we in homicide are starting to worry we might be set up as scapegoats unless we can come up with a break in the case it wasnt your fault franconi was murdered laurie said indignantly tell that to the commissioner lou commented he took a loud sip from his coffee mind if i smoke he looked at laurie and jack forget it he said the moment he saw their expressions i dont know why i asked must have been a moment of temporary insanity what have you learned laurie asked laurie knew that prior to being assigned to homicide lou had been with the organized crime unit with his experience there was no one more qualified to investigate the case it was definitely a vaccarro hit lou said we learned that from our informers but since franconi was about to testify wed already assumed as much the only real lead is that we have the murder weapon that should help laurie said not as much as youd think lou said its not so unusual during a mob hit that the weapon is left behind we found it on a rooftop across from the positano restaurant it was a scoped remington with two rounds missing from its magazine the two casings were on the roof fingerprints laurie asked wiped clean lou said but the crime boys are still going over it traceable jack asked yeah lou said with a sigh we did that the rifle belonged to a hunting freak out in menlo park but it was the expected dead end the guys place had been robbed the day before the only thing missing was the rifle so whats next laurie asked were still following up leads lou said plus there are more informers that weve not been able to contact but mostly were just keeping our fingers crossed for some sort of break what about you guys any idea how the body walked out of here not yet but im looking into it personally laurie said hey dont encourage her jack said thats for bingham and washington to do hes got a point laurie lou said damn straight i got a point jack said last time laurie got involved with the mob she got carried out of here nailed in a coffin at least thats what you told me that was then and this is now laurie said im not involved in this case the way i was in that one i think it is important to find out how the body disappeared for the sake of this office and frankly im not convinced either bingham or washington will make the effort from their point of view it is better to let the episode just fade i can understand that lou said in fact if the goddamned media would only let up the commissioner might even want us to ease up who knows im going to find out how it happened laurie repeated with conviction well knowing the who and the how could help my investigation lou said it was most likely the same people from the vaccarro organization it just stands to reason jack threw up his hands im getting out of here he said i can tell neither of you will listen to reason he again tugged on vinnies shirt on the way out the door jack poked his head into janices office anything i should know about this floater thats not in the folder he asked the investigator the little there is is all there janice said except for the coordinates where the coast guard picked up the body they told me that someone would have to call today to make sure it wasnt classified or something but i cant imagine that information will matter its not like anyone could go out there and find the head and the hands i agree jack said but have someone call anyway just for the record ill leave a note for bart janice said bart arnold was the chief forensic investigator thanks janice jack said now get out of here and get some sleep janice was so committed to her job that she always worked overtime wait a second janice called out there was one other thing that i forgot to note in my report when the body was picked up it was naked not a stitch of clothing jack nodded that was a curious piece of information undressing a corpse was added effort on the part of the murderer jack pondered for a moment and when he did he decided it was consistent with the murderers wish to hide the victims identity a fact made obvious by the missing head and hands jack waved goodbye to janice dont tell me were doing a floater vinnie whined as he and jack headed for the elevator you sure do tune out when you read the sports page jack said laurie and i discussed it for ten minutes they boarded the elevator and started down to the autopsy room floor vinnie refused to make eye contact with jack you are in a weird mood jack said dont tell me youre taking this franconi disappearance personally lay off vinnie said while vinnie went off to don his moon suit lay out all the paraphernalia necessary to do the autopsy and then get the body into the morgue and onto the table jack went through the rest of the folder to make absolutely certain hed not missed anything then he went and found the x rays that had been taken when the body had arrived jack put on his own moon suit unplugged the power source that had been charging over night and hooked himself up he hated the suit in general but to work on a decomposing floater he hated it less as hed teased with laurie earlier the smell was the worst part at that time in the morning jack and vinnie were the only ones in the autopsy room to vinnies chagrin jack invariably insisted on getting a jump on the day frequently jack was finishing his first case when his colleagues were just starting theirs the first order of business was to look at the x rays and jack snapped them up on the viewer with his hands on his hips jack took a step back and gazed at the anterioposterior fullbody shot with no head and no hands the image was decidedly abnormal like the x ray of some primitive nonhuman creature the other abnormality was a bright dense blob of shotgun pellets in the area of the right upper quadrant jacks immediate impression was that there had been multiple shotgun blasts not just one there were too many beebeelike pellets the pellets were opaque to the x rays and obscured any detail they covered on the light box they appeared white jack was about to switch his attention to the lateral x ray when something about the opacity caught his attention at two locations the periphery appeared strange more lumpy than the usual beebee contour jack looked at the lateral film and saw the same phenomena his first impression was that the shotgun blasts might have carried some radioopaque material into the wound perhaps it had been some part of the victims clothing whenever youre ready maestro vinnie called out he had everything prepared jack turned from the xray view box and approached the autopsy table the floater was ghastly pale in the raw fluorescent light whoever the victim had been hed been relatively obese and had not made any recent trips to the caribbean to use one of your favorite quotes vinnie said it doesnt look like hes going to make it to the prom jack smiled at vinnies black humor it was much more in keeping with his personality suggesting that he had recovered from his earlymorning pique the body was in sad shape although bobbing around in the water had washed it clean the good news was that it had obviously been in the water for only a short time the trauma went far beyond the multiple shotgun blasts to the upper abdomen not only were the head and the hands hacked off but there was a series of wide deep gashes in the torso and thighs that exposed swaths of greasy adipose tissue the edges of all the wounds were ragged looks like the fish have been having a banquet jack said oh gross vinnie commented the shotgun blasts had bared and damaged many of the internal abdominal organs some strands of intestines were visible as was one dangling kidney jack picked up one of the arms and looked at the exposed bones a hacksaw would be my guess he said what are all these huge cuts vinnie asked somebody try to slice him up like a holiday turkey nah id guess hed been run over with a boat jack said they look like propeller injuries jack then began a careful examination of the exterior of the corpse with so much obvious trauma he knew it was easy to miss more subtle findings he worked slowly frequently stopping to photograph lesions his meticulousness paid off at the ragged base of the neck just anterior to the collarbone he found a small circular lesion he found another similar one on the left side below the rib cage what are they vinnie asked i dont know jack said puncture wounds of some sort how many times do you suppose they shot him in the abdomen vinnie asked hard to say jack said boy they werent taking any chances vinnie said they sure as hell wanted him dead a half hour later when jack was about to commence the internal part of the autopsy the door opened and laurie walked in she was gowned and held a mask to her face but she didnt have on her moon suit since she was a stickler for rules and since moon suits were now required in the pit jack was immediately suspicious at least your case wasnt in the water for long laurie said looking down at the corpse its not decomposed at all just a refreshing dip jack quipped what a shotgun wound laurie marveled gazing at the fearsome wound then looking at the multiple gashes she added these look like they were done by a propeller jack straightened up laurie whats on your mind you didnt come down here just to help us did you no laurie admitted her voice wavered behind her mask i guess i wanted a little moral support about what jack questioned calvin just reamed me out laurie said apparently the night tech mike passano complained that i had been in last night accusing him of being involved in the theft of franconis body can you imagine anyway calvin was really angry and you know how i hate confrontation i ended up crying which made me furious at myself jack blew out through pursed lips he tried to think of something to say other than i told you so but nothing came to mind im sorry jack said limply thanks laurie said so you shed a few tears jack said dont be so hard on yourself but i hate it laurie complained its so unprofessional ah i wouldnt worry about it jack said sometimes i wish i could shed tears maybe if we could do some kind of partial trade wed both be better off anytime laurie said with conviction this was the closest jack had come to an admission of what laurie had long suspected his bottledup grief was the major stumbling block for his own happiness so at least now youll drop your minicrusade jack said heavens no laurie said if anything it makes me more committed because it suggests just what i feared calvin and bingham are going to try to sweep the episode under the carpet its not right oh laurie jack moaned please this little runin with calvin will only be the beginning youre going to bring yourself nothing but grief its the principle laurie said so dont lecture me i came to you for support jack sighed fogging up his plastic face mask for a moment okay he said what do you want me to do nothing in particular laurie said just be there for me fifteen minutes later laurie left the autopsy room jack had showed her all the external findings on his case including the two puncture wounds shed listened with half an ear obviously preoccupied with the franconi business jack had had to restrain himself to keep from telling her again how he felt enough of this external stuff jack said to vinnie lets move on to the internal part of the autopsy its about time vinnie complained it was now after eight and bodies were coming in along with their assigned techs and medical examiners despite the early start he and jack were not significantly ahead of the others jack ignored the friendly banter evoked by his hapless corpse with all the obvious trauma jack had to vary the traditional autopsy technique and that took concentration in contrast to vinnie jack was oblivious to the passage of time but again his meticulousness paid off although the liver had essentially been obliterated by the shotgun blasts jack discovered something extraordinary that might have been missed by someone doing a more haphazard cursory job he found the tiny remains of surgical sutures in the vena cava and in the ragged end of the hepatic artery sutures in such an area were uncommon the hepatic artery brought blood to the liver whereas the vena cava was the largest vein in the abdomen jack didnt find any sutures in the portal vein because that vessel was almost entirely obliterated chet get over here jack called chet mcgovern was jacks office mate he was busy at a neighboring table chet put down his scalpel and stepped over to jacks table vinnie moved to the head to give him space whatcha got chet asked something interesting he peered into the hole where jack was working i sure do jack said i got a bunch of shotgun pellets but i also have some vascular sutures where chet asked he couldnt make out any anatomical landmarks here jack said he pointed with the handle of a scalpel okay i see them chet said with admiration nice pickup theres not a lot of endothelialization id say they werent that old thats my thought jack said probably within a month or two six months at the extreme what do you think it means i think the chances of me making an identification just went up a thousand percent jack said he straightened up and stretched so the victim had abdominal surgery chet said lots of people have had abdominal surgery not the kind of surgery this guy apparently had jack said with sutures in the vena cava and the hepatic artery im betting hes in a pretty distinguished group my guess is that hed had a liver transplant not too long ago chapter march am new york city raymond lyons pulled up his cufflinked sleeve and glanced at his waferthin piaget watch it was exactly ten oclock he was content he liked to be punctual especially for business meetings but he did not like to be early as far as he was concerned being early reeked of desperation and raymond had a penchant for bargaining from a position of strength for the previous few minutes hed been standing on the corner of park avenue and seventyeighth street waiting for the hour to arrive now that it had he straightened his tie adjusted his fedora and started walking toward the entrance of park avenue im looking for dr andersons office raymond announced to the liveried doorman whod opened the heavy wroughtiron and glass door the doctors office has its own entrance the doorman replied he reopened the door behind raymond stepped out onto the sidewalk and pointed south raymond touched the tip of his hat in appreciation before moving down to this private entrance a sign of engraved brass read please ring and then enter raymond did as he was told as the door closed behind him raymond was immediately pleased the office looked and even smelled like money it was sumptuously appointed with antiques and thick oriental carpets the walls were covered with nineteenthcentury art raymond advanced to an elegant boullework french desk a welldressed matronly receptionist glanced up at him over her reading glasses a nameplate sat on the desk facing raymond it said mrs arthur p auchincloss raymond gave his name being sure to emphasize the fact that he was a physician he was well aware that some doctors receptionists could be uncomfortably imperious if they didnt know a visitor was a member of the trade the doctor is expecting you mrs auchincloss said then she politely asked raymond to wait in the waiting room its a beautiful office raymond said to make conversation indeed mrs auchincloss said is it a large office raymond asked yes of course mrs auchincloss said dr anderson is a very busy man we have four full examining rooms and an xray room raymond smiled it wasnt difficult for him to guess the astronomical overhead that dr anderson had been duped into assuming by socalled productivity experts during the heyday of feeforservice medicine from raymonds point of view dr anderson was the perfect quarry as a potential partner although the doctor undoubtedly still had a small backlog of wealthy patients willing to pay cash to retain their old comfortable relationship dr anderson had to have been being squeezed by managed care i suppose that means a large staff raymond said were down to one nurse mrs auchincloss said its hard to find appropriate help these days yeah sure raymond mused one nurse for four examining rooms unquestionably meant the doctor was struggling but raymond didnt vocalize his thoughts instead he let his eyes roam around the carefully wallpapered walls and said ive always admired these oldschool park avenue offices they are so civilized and serene they cant help but impart a feeling of trust im sure our patients feel the same way mrs auchincloss said an interior door opened and a bejeweled guccidraped elderly woman stepped into the reception area she was painfully thin and had suffered so many facelifts that her mouth was drawn into a taut unremitting smirk behind her was dr waller anderson raymonds and wallers eyes crossed for a fleeting moment as the doctor guided his patient to the receptionist and gave instructions of when he should see her next raymond assessed the doctor he was tall and had a refined look that raymond sensed he possessed as well but waller wasnt tanned in fact his complexion had a grayish cast and he looked strained with sad eyes and hollow cheeks as far as raymond was concerned hard times were written all over his face after warm goodbyes to his patient waller motioned raymond to follow him he led down a long corridor that gave access to the examining rooms at the end he preceded raymond into his private office then closed the door after them waller introduced himself cordially but with obvious reserve he took raymonds hat and coat which he carefully hung in a small closet coffee waller asked by all means raymond said a few minutes later both with coffee and with waller behind his desk and raymond sitting in a chair in front raymond began his pitch these are tough times to be practicing medicine raymond said waller made a sound that was akin to a laugh but it was bereft of humor obviously he wasnt amused we can offer you an opportunity to significantly augment your income as well as provide a stateoftheart service to select patients raymond said for the most part raymonds presentation was a practiced speech that hed perfected over the years is there anything illegal about this waller interjected his tone was serious almost irritable if there is im not interested nothing illegal raymond assured him just extremely confidential from our phone call you said you would be willing to keep this conversation just among you me and dr daniel levitz as long as my silence is not felonious in and of itself waller said i will not be duped into being an accessory no need to worry raymond said he smiled but if you do decide to join our group you will be asked to sign an affidavit concerning confidentiality only then will you be told the specific details i dont have any trouble with signing an affidavit waller said as long as im not breaking any law well then raymond said he put his coffee cup on the edge of wallers desk to free up his hands he fervently believed that hand gestures were important for impact he started by telling about his chance meeting seven years previously with kevin marshall whod given a poorly attended presentation at a national meeting that dealt with homologous transposition of chromosome parts between cells homologous transposition waller questioned what the devil is that having been through medical school prior to the revolution in molecular biology he was unfamiliar with the terms raymond patiently explained and used for his example the short arms of chromosome so this kevin marshall developed a way to take a piece of chromosome from one cell and exchange it for the same piece in the same location of another cell waller said exactly raymond said and for me it was like an epiphany i immediately saw the clinical application suddenly it was potentially possible to create an immunological double of an individual as im sure you are aware the short arm of chromosome six contains the major histocompatibility complex like an identical twin waller said with growing interest even better than an identical twin raymond said the immunological double is created in an appropriately sized animal species that can be sacrificed on demand few people would be able to have an identical twin sacrificed why wasnt this published waller asked dr marshall fully intended to publish raymond said but there were some minor details he wanted to work out before he did so it was his department head that forced him to present at the meeting lucky for us after hearing the talk i approached him and convinced him to go private it wasnt easy but what tipped the scales in our favor was that i promised him the lab of his dreams with no interference from academia i assured him that he would be given any and every piece of equipment he wanted you had such a lab waller asked not at the time raymond admitted once i had agreement from him i approached an international biotechnology giant which will go nameless until you agree to join our group with some difficulty i sold them on the idea of creatively marketing this phenomenon and how is that done waller asked raymond moved forward in his chair and locked eyes with waller for a price we create an immunological double for a client he said as you can well imagine it is a significant price but not unreasonable for the peace of mind it affords but how we really make money is that the client must pay a yearly tuition to maintain his double sort of like an initiation fee and then dues waller said thats another way to look at it raymond agreed how do i benefit waller asked myriad ways raymond said ive constructed the business like a merchandizing pyramid for every client you recruit you get a percentage not only of the initial price but each year from the tuition on top of that we will encourage you to recruit other physicians like yourself with collapsing patient bases but who still have a number of wealthy healthconscious cashpaying patients with every successful physician recruitment you get percentages from each of his recruitment efforts for instance if you choose to join dr levitz who recommended you will receive percentages from all your successes you dont have to be an accountant to understand that with a little effort you could be earning a substantial income and as an added incentive we can offer the payments offshore so they will accrue taxfree why all the secrecy waller asked for obvious reasons as far as the offshore accounts are concerned raymond said as for the whole program there have been ethical issues that have been overlooked consequently the biotechnology company that is making this all possible is paranoid about bad publicity frankly the use of animals for transplantation offends some people and we certainly do not want to be forced to deal with animalrights zealots besides this is an expensive operation and can be made available to only a few highly select people that violates the concept of equality may i ask how many clients have taken advantage of this plan laymen or physicians raymond asked laymen waller said around one hundred raymond said has anybody had to utilize the resource as a matter of fact four have raymond said two kidneys and two livers have been transplanted all are doing superbly without medication and without any signs of rejection and i might add there is a substantial additional charge for the harvest and transplantation and the involved physicians get the same percentages of these fees how many physicians are involved waller asked fewer than fifty raymond said we started slowly on recruitment but it is now speeding up how long has this program been going on waller asked about six years raymond said its been a significant outlay of capital and a lot of effort but it is now beginning to pay off handsomely i should remind you that you will be getting in at a relatively early date so the pyramid structure will benefit you greatly it sounds interesting waller said god knows i could use some additional income with my falling patient base ive got to do something before i lose this office it would be a pity raymond agreed can i think about it for a day or so waller asked raymond stood up experience told him hed made another score by all means he said graciously id also invite you to call dr levitz hed recommended you highly and hes extraordinarily satisfied with the arrangements five minutes later raymond exited onto the sidewalk and turned south down park avenue his walk had an extra bounce to it with the blue sky the clear air and the hint of spring he felt on top of the world especially with the pleasurable rush of adrenaline that a successful recruitment always gave him even the unpleasantness of the previous couple of days seemed insignificant the future was bright and full of promise but then near disaster came out of nowhere distracted by his victory raymond almost stepped from the curb into the path of a speeding city bus wind from the hurling vehicle blew off his hat while filthy gutter water sprayed the front of his cashmere coat raymond staggered back dazed from his narrow escape from what might have been a horrible death new york was a city of sudden extremes you okay buddy a passerby asked he handed raymond his dented fedora im fine thank you raymond said he looked down at the front of his coat and felt ill the episode seemed metaphorical and brought back the anxiety hed experienced over the unfortunate franconi business the muck reminded him of having to deal with vinnie dominick feeling chastened raymond crossed the street with much more care life was full of dangers as he walked toward sixtyfourth street he began to worry about the other two transplant cases hed never considered the problem an autopsy posed to his program until the franconi dilemma all at once raymond decided hed better check the status of the other patients there was no doubt in his mind that taylor cabots threat had been real if one of the patients happened to be autopsied sometime in the future for whatever reason and the media got hold of the results it could spell disaster gensys would probably drop the whole operation raymond quickened his pace one patient lived in new jersey the other in dallas he thought hed better get on the phone and talk with the recruiting doctors chapter march pm cogo equatorial guinea hello candaces voice called out anybody home kevins hand flinched at the unexpected noise the lab techs had long since left for the day and the laboratory had been silent save for the low hum of the refrigeration units kevin had stayed to run another southern blot analysis to separate dna fragments but at the sound of candaces voice hed missed one of the wells with the micropipette the fluid had run out over the surface of the gel the test was ruined hed have to start again over here kevin yelled he put down the pipette and stood up through the reagent bottles atop the lab bench he could see candace across the room standing in the doorway am i coming at a bad time candace asked as she approached no i was just finishing up kevin said he hoped he wasnt being too transparent although he was frustrated about the wasted time hed spent on the procedure kevin was pleased to see candace during lunch that day hed worked up the courage to invite candace and melanie to his house for tea both had accepted with alacrity melanie had admitted that shed always been curious to see what the house looked like on the inside the afternoon had been a big success undoubtedly the key ingredient for the afternoons success was the personalities of the two ladies there was never a pause in the conversation another contributing factor had been the wine that theyd all decided upon instead of tea as a member of the zones elite kevin was given a regular allotment of french wine which he rarely drank consequently he had an impressive cellar the major topic of conversation had been the us a favorite pastime for temporary american expatriates each of the three had extolled and argued the virtues of their hometown melanie loved new york and contended it was in a class all its own candace said that pittsburghs quality of life was rated one of the highest and kevin praised the intellectual stimulation of boston what they had purposefully avoided discussing was kevins emotional outburst at the commissary during lunch at the time both candace and melanie questioned what hed meant by being terrified of overstepping the bounds but they didnt persist when it became clear that kevin was overly upset and reluctant to explain intuitively the women had decided it best to change the subject at least for the time ive come to see if i can drag you over to meet mr horace winchester candace said i told him about you and hed like to thank you in person i dont know if that is a good idea kevin said he could feel himself tense on the contrary candace said after what you said at lunch i think you should see the good side of what you have been able to accomplish im sorry that what i said made you feel so terrible candaces remark was the first reference to kevins lunch outburst since its occurrence kevins pulse quickened it wasnt your fault he said id been upset before your comments then come meet horace candace said his recovery is fantastic hes doing so well in fact that an intensivecare nurse like me is just about unnecessary i wouldnt know what to say kevin mumbled oh it doesnt matter what you say candace said the man is so thankful just a few days ago he was so sick he thought he was going to die now he feels like hes been given a new lease on life come on it cant help but make you feel good kevin struggled to think up a reason not to go and then was saved by another voice it was melanie ah my two favorite drinking buddies melanie said coming into the room shed caught sight of candace and kevin through the open door shed been on her way to her own lab down the hall she was dressed in blue coveralls which had animal center embroidered on the breast pocket are either of you guys hungover melanie asked ive still got a little buzz god we went through two bottles of wine can you believe it neither candace or kevin responded melanie looked back and forth between their faces she sensed something was wrong what is thisa wake she asked candace smiled she loved melanies outspoken irreverence hardly candace said kevin and i are at a standoff i was just trying to talk him into going over to the hospital to meet mr winchester hes already out of bed and feeling chipper i told him about you guys and hed like to meet both of you i hear he owns a string of resort hotels melanie said with a wink hey maybe we can finagle some vouchers for complimentary drinks as appreciative and as wealthy as he is you could very well do better than that candace said the problem is that kevin doesnt want to go how come sport melanie asked i thought it would be a good idea for him to see the good side of what hes been able to accomplish candace added candace caught melanies eye melanie understood candaces motivations immediately yeah melanie said lets get some positive feedback from a real live patient that should justify all this hard work and give us a boost i think it will make me feel worse kevin said ever since getting back to the lab hed been trying to concentrate on basic research to avoid facing his fears the ploy had worked to an extent until his curiosity made him call up the isla francesca graphic on his computer terminal playing with the data had had an effect as bad as the smoke melanie put her hands on her hips why she asked i dont understand its hard to explain kevin said evasively try me melanie challenged because seeing him will remind me of things im trying not to think about kevin said like what happened to the other patient you mean his double the bonobo melanie asked kevin nodded his face was now flushed almost as bad as it had been at the commissary youre taking this animalrights issue even more seriously than i am candace remarked im afraid it goes beyond animal rights kevin said a tense silence intervened melanie glanced at candace candace shrugged suggesting she was at a loss okay enough is enough melanie said with sudden resolve she reached up placed both hands on kevins shoulders and pushed him down onto his laboratory stool up until this afternoon i thought we were just colleagues she said she leaned over and put her sharpfeatured face close to kevins but now i feel differently i got to know you a little bit which i must say i appreciated and i no longer think of you as an icy aloof intellectual snob in fact i think we are friends am i right kevin nodded he was forced to look up into melanies black marblelike eyes friends talk to each other melanie said they communicate they dont hide their feelings and make others feel uncomfortable do you know what im saying i think so kevin said hed never considered the idea his behavior was capable of making others uncomfortable think so melanie chided how can i explain it so that you know so kevin swallowed i guess i know so melanie rolled her eyes in frustration you are so evasive it drives me bananas but thats okay i can deal with it what i cant deal with is your outburst at lunch and when i tried to ask you whats wrong you gave some vague comment about overstepping the bounds and then clammed up unable to talk about it you cant let this fester whatever it is thats bothering you it will only hurt you and impede your friendships candace nodded agreement with all that melanie had expressed kevin looked back and forth between the two outspoken and tenacious women as much as he resisted expressing his fears at the moment he didnt think he had much choice especially with melanies face inches away from his own not knowing how to begin he said ive seen smoke coming from isla francesca whats isla francesca candace asked its the island where the transgenic bonobos go once they reach age three melanie said so whats with smoke kevin stood and motioned for the women to follow him he walked over to his desk with his index finger he pointed out the window toward isla francesca ive seen the smoke three times he said its always from the same place just to the left of the limestone ridge its only a little curl snaking up into the sky but it persists candace squinted she was mildly nearsighted but for vanity reasons didnt wear glasses is it the farthest island she asked she thought she could just make out some brownish smudges on its spine that could have been rock in the lateafternoon sunlight the other islands in the chain appeared like homogeneous mounds of dark green moss thats the one kevin said so big deal melanie commented a couple of little fires with all the lightning around here its no wonder thats what bertram edwards suggested kevin said but it cant be lightning whos bertram edwards candace asked why cant it be lightning melanie asked ignoring candace maybe theres some metal ore in that rocky ridge ever hear the expression lightning never strikes the same place twice kevin questioned the fire is not from lightning besides the smoke persisted and has never moved maybe some native people live out there candace said gensys was very sure that was not the case before choosing the island kevin said maybe some local fishermen visit candace suggested all the locals know it is forbidden kevin said because of the new equatoguinean law it would be a capital offense theres nothing out there that would be worth dying for then who started the fires candace asked good god kevin melanie exclaimed suddenly im beginning to get an idea what youre thinking but let me tell you its preposterous whats preposterous candace asked will someone clue me in let me show you something else kevin said he turned to his computer terminal and with a few keystrokes called up the graphic of the island he explained the system to the women and as a demonstration brought up the location of melanies double the little red light blinked just north of the escarpment very close to where his own had the day before you have a double candace asked she was dumbfounded kevin and i were the guinea pigs melanie said our doubles were the first we had to prove that the technology really works okay now that you women know how the locator system operates kevin said let me show you what i did an hour ago and well see if we get the same disturbing result kevins fingers played over the keyboard what im doing is instructing the computer to automatically locate all seventythree of the doubles sequentially the creatures numbers will occur in the corner followed by the blinking light on the graphic now watch kevin clicked to start the system worked smoothly with only a short delay between the number appearing and then the red blinking light i thought there were closer to a hundred animals candace said there are kevin said but twentytwo of them are less than three years old they are in the bonobo enclosure at the animal center okay melanie said after a few minutes of watching the computer function its working just as you said whats so disturbing just hold on kevin said all at once the number appeared but no blinking red light after a few moments a prompt flashed onto the screen it said animal not located click to recommence melanie looked at kevin wheres number thirtyseven kevin sighed whats left is in the incinerator he said number thirtyseven was mr winchesters double but thats not what i wanted to show you kevin clicked and the program restarted then it stopped again at fortytwo was that mr franconis double candace asked the other liver transplant kevin shook his head he pressed several keys asking the computer the identity of fortytwo the name warren prescott appeared so wheres fortytwo melanie asked i dont know for sure but i know what i fear kevin said kevin clicked and again the numbers and red lights alternately flashed on the screen when the entire program had run its course it had indicated that seven of the bonobo doubles were unaccounted for not including franconis which had been sacrificed is this what you found earlier melanie asked kevin nodded but it wasnt seven it was twelve and although some of the ones that were missing this morning are still missing most of them have reappeared i dont understand melanie said how can that be when i toured that island way back before all this started kevin said i remember seeing some caves in that limestone cliff what im thinking is that our creations are going into the caves maybe even living in them its the only way i can think of to explain why the grid would fail to pick them up melanie brought up a hand to cover her mouth her eyes reflected a flicker of horror and dismay candace saw melanies reaction hey come on guys she pleaded whats wrong what are you thinking melanie lowered her hand her eyes were locked on kevins what kevin was referring to when he said he was terrified hed overstepped the bounds she explained in a slow deliberate voice was the fear that hed created a human youre not serious candace exclaimed but a glance at kevin and then at melanie indicated that she was for a full minute no one spoke finally kevin broke the silence im not suggesting a real human being in the guise of an ape kevin said finally im suggesting that ive inadvertently created a kind of protohuman maybe something akin to our distant ancestral forebears who spontaneously appeared in nature from apelike animals four or five million years ago maybe back then the critical mutations responsible for the change occurred in the developmental genes ive subsequently learned are on the short arm of chromosome six candace found herself blankly gazing out the window while her mind replayed the scene two days previous in the or when the bonobo was about to be inducted under anesthesia hed made curious humanlike sounds and tried desperately to keep his hands free so that he could continue to make the same wild gesture hed been constantly opening and closing his fingers and then sweeping his hands away from his body youre talking about some early hominidlike creature something on the order of homo erectus melanie said its true we noticed the infant transgenic bonobos tended to walk upright more than their mothers at the time we just thought it was cute not so early a hominid as not to have used fire kevin said only true early man has used fire and thats what im worried ive been seeing on the island campfires so to put it bluntly candace said turning away from the window weve got a bunch of cavemen out there like back in prehistoric time something like that kevin said as hed expected the women were aghast strangely he actually felt a little better now that hed voiced his anxieties what are we going to do candace demanded im certainly not going to be involved with sacrificing any more until this is resolved one way or the other i was having a hard enough time dealing with the situation when i thought the victim was an ape wait a sec melanie said she spread her hands with fingers apart her eyes were blazing anew maybe were jumping to conclusions here theres no proof of all this everything weve been talking about is circumstantial at best true but theres more kevin said he turned back to the computer and instructed it to display the locations of all the bonobos on the island simultaneously within seconds two red splotches began pulsating one was in the location where melanies double had been the other was north of the lake kevin looked up at melanie what does this data suggest to you it suggests there are two groups she said do you think it is permanent it was the same earlier kevin said i think it is a real phenomenon even bertram mentioned it thats not typical of bonobos they get along in larger social groups than chimps plus these are all relatively young animals they should all be in one group melanie nodded over the previous five years shed learned a lot about bonobo behavior and there is something else more upsetting kevin said bertram told me one of the bonobos killed one of the pygmies on the retrieval of winchesters double it wasnt an accident the bonobo aggressively threw a rock that kind of aggression is more associated with human behavior than with bonobos id have to agree melanie said but its still circumstantial all of it circumstantial or not candace said im not going to have it on my conscience i feel the same way melanie said ive spent today getting two new female bonobos started on the eggcollection protocol im not going to proceed until we find out if this wild idea about these possible protohumans is valid or not thats not going to be easy kevin said to prove it somebody has to go to the island the trouble is there are only two people who can authorize a visit bertram edwards or siegfried spallek i already tried to talk with bertram and even though i brought up the issue about the smoke he made it very clear that no one was allowed near the island accept for a pygmy who brings supplementary food did you tell him what you are worried about melanie asked not in so many words kevin said but he knew im sure of it he wasnt interested the problem is that he and siegfried have been included in the project bonuses consequently they are going to make damn sure nothing threatens it im afraid theyre venal enough not to care whats on the island and on top of their venality we have to weigh in siegfrieds sociopathy is he that bad candace asked id heard rumors whatever you heard its ten times worse melanie said hes a major sleazeball to give you an example he executed some impoverished equatoguinean men because theyd been caught poaching in the zone where he likes to hunt he killed them himself candace questioned with shock and revulsion not by himself melanie said he had the men tried in a kangaroo court here in cogo then they were executed by a handful of equatoguinean soldiers at the soccer field and to add insult to injury kevin said he uses the skulls as bowls for odds and ends on his desk sorry i asked candace said with a shiver what about dr lyons melanie asked kevin laughed forget it hes more venal than bertram this whole operation is his baby i tried to talk to him about the smoke too he was even less receptive claimed it was my imagination frankly i dont trust him although i have to give him credit for being generous with bonuses and stocks hes cleverly given everyone connected with the project a real stake in the venture particularly bertram and siegfried so that leaves it all up to us melanie said lets find out if its your imagination or not what do you say the three of us take a quick trip to isla francesca youre joking kevin said its a capital offense without authorization its a capital offense for locals melanie said that cant apply to us in our case siegfried has to answer to gensys bertram specifically forbade visits kevin said i offered to go by myself and he said no well big deal melanie said so he gets mad what is he going to do fire us ive been here long enough so that i dont think that would be half bad besides they cant do without you thats the reality do you think it might be dangerous candace asked bonobos are peaceful creatures melanie said much more so than chimps and chimps arent dangerous unless you corner them what about the man who was killed candace said that was during a retrieval kevin said they had to get close enough to shoot a dart gun also it was the fourth retrieval all we want to do is observe melanie said okay how do we get there candace asked drive i guess melanie said thats how they go when they do a release or a retrieval there must be some kind of bridge theres a road that goes east along the coast kevin said its paved to the native village then it becomes a track thats how i went on the visit to the island before we started the program for a hundred feet or so the island and the mainland are only separated by a channel thirty feet wide back then there was a wire suspension bridge stretched between two mahogany trees maybe we can view the animals without even going across candace said lets do it you ladies are fearless kevin remarked hardly melanie said but i dont see any problem with driving up there and checking the situation out once we know what were dealing with we can make a better decision about what we want to do when do you want to do this kevin questioned id say now melanie replied she glanced at her watch theres no better time ninety percent of the population of the town is either at the waterfront chickee bar splashing around in the pool or sweating buckets at the athletic center kevin sighed let his arms fall limply to his sides and capitulated whose car should we take he asked yours melanie said without hesitation mine doesnt even have fourwheel drive as the trio descended the stairs and made their way across the sweltering blacktop of the parking area kevin had the gnawing sense they were making a mistake but in the face of the womens resolve he felt reluctant to voice his reservations on the east exit of the town they passed the athletic centers tennis courts which were chockful of players between the humidity and heat the players looked as drenched as if theyd jumped into a swimming pool with their tennis outfits on kevin drove melanie sat in the front passenger seat while candace sat in the back the windows were all open since the temperature had fallen into the high eighties the sun was low in the west directly behind them and peeking in and out of clouds along the horizon just beyond the soccer field the vegetation closed in around the road brightly colored birds flitted in and out of the deepening shadows large insects annihilated themselves against the windshield like miniature kamikaze pilots the jungle looks dense candace said shed never traveled east from the town you have no idea kevin said when hed first arrived hed tried to take some hikes in the area but with the profusion of vines and creepers it was all but impossible without a machete i just had a thought about the aggression issue melanie said the passivity of bonobo society is generally attributed to its matriarchal character because of the skewed demand for male doubles our program has a population thats mostly male there has to be a lot of competition for the few females thats a good point kevin agreed he wondered why bertram hadnt thought of it sounds like my type of place candace joked maybe i should book isla francesca instead of club med on my next vacation melanie laughed lets go together she said they passed a number of equatoguineans on their way home from work in cogo most of the women carried jugs and parcels on top of their heads the men were generally emptyhanded its a strange culture melanie commented the women do the lions share of the work growing the food carrying the water raising the kids cooking the meals taking care of the house what do the men do candace asked sit around and discuss metaphysics melanie said i just had an idea kevin said i dont know why i didnt think of it before maybe we should talk to the pygmy who takes out the food to the island first and hear what he has to say sounds like a good idea to me melanie said do you know his name alphonse kimba kevin said when they reached the native village they pulled to a stop in front of the busy general store and got out kevin went inside to inquire after the pygmy this place is almost too charming candace said as she looked around the neighborhood it looks african but like something youd see in disneyland gensys had built the village with the cooperation of the equatoguinean minister of the interior the homes were circular whitewashed mud brick with thatched roofs corrals for domestic animals were made of reed mats lashed to wooden stakes the structures appeared traditional but every one of them was new and spotless they also had electricity and running water buried underground were powerlines and modern sewers kevin returned quickly no problem he said he lives close by come on well walk the village was alive with men women and children traditional cooking fires were in the process of being lit everyone acted happy and friendly from having been recently freed from the captivity of the interminable rainy season alphonse kimba was less than five feet tall with skin as black as onyx a constant smile dominated his wide flat face as he welcomed his unexpected visitors he tried to introduce his wife and child but they were shy and shrunk back into the shadows alphonse invited his guests to sit on a reed mat he then got four glasses and poured a dollop of clear fluid into each from an old green bottle that had at one time contained motor oil his visitors warily swirled the fluid they didnt want to seem ungrateful but they were reluctant to drink alcohol kevin asked oh yes alphonse said his smile broadened it is lotoko from corn very good i bring it from my home in lomako he sipped with intense enjoyment in contrast to the equatoguineans alphonses english was accented with french not spanish he was a member of the mongandu people from zaire hed been brought to the zone with the first shipment of bonobos since the drink contained alcohol which would presumably kill potential microorganisms the guests cautiously tasted the brew all of them made faces in spite of good intentions not to do so the drink was powerfully pungent kevin explained that they had come to ask about the bonobos on the island he didnt mention his concern that their number included a strain of protohumans he asked only if alphonse thought they were acting like bonobos back in his home province in zaire they are all very young alphonse said so they are very unruly and wild do you go on the island often kevin asked no i am forbidden alphonse said only when we retrieve or release and only then with dr edwards how do you get the extra food to the island melanie asked there is a small float alphonse said i pull it across the water with a rope then pull it back are the bonobos aggressive with the food or do they share melanie asked very aggressive alphonse said they fight like crazy especially for the fruit i also saw one kill a monkey why kevin asked i think to eat alphonse said he carried it away after the food i brought was all gone that sounds more like a chimp melanie said to kevin kevin nodded where on the island have the retrievals taken place he asked all have been on this side of the lake and stream alphonse said none have been over by the cliff kevin asked no never alphonse said how do you get to the island for the retrieval kevin asked does everybody use the float alphonse laughed heartily he had to dry his eyes with his knuckle the float is too small wed all be supper for the crocs we use the bridge why dont you use the bridge for the food melanie asked because dr edwards has to make the bridge grow alphonse said grow melanie questioned yes alphonse said the three guests exchanged glances they were confused have you seen any fire on the island kevin asked changing the subject no fire alphonse said but ive seen smoke and what did you think kevin asked me alphonse questioned i didnt think anything have you ever seen one of the bonobos do this candace asked she opened and closed her fingers then swept her hand away from her body in imitation of the bonobo in the operating room yes alphonse said many do that when they finish dividing up the food how about noise melanie asked do they make a lot of sounds a lot alphonse said like the bonobos back in zaire kevin asked more alphonse said but back in zaire i dont see the same bonobos so often as i do here and i dont feed them back home they get their own food in the jungle what kind of noise do they make candace asked can you give us an example alphonse laughed selfconsciously he glanced around at his wife to make sure she wasnt listening then he softly vocalized eeee ba da loo loo tad tat he laughed again he was embarrassed do they hoot like chimps melanie asked some alphonse said the guests looked at each other theyd run out of questions for the moment kevin got up the women did the same they thanked alphonse for his hospitality and handed back their unfinished drinks if alphonse was offended he didnt show it his smile didnt falter theres one other thing alphonse said just before his guests departed the bonobos on the island like to show off whenever they come for the food they make themselves stand up all the time kevin asked mostly alphonse said the group walked back through the village to the car they didnt talk until kevin had started the motor well what do you guys think kevin asked should we continue the suns already set i vote yes melanie said weve come this far i agree candace said im curious to see this bridge that grows melanie laughed me too what a charming fellow kevin drove away from the store which was now busier than earlier but he wasnt sure of his direction the road into the village had simply expanded into the parking area for the store and there was no indication of the track leading further east to find it he had to cruise the parking lots perimeter once on the track they were impressed with how much easier it had been to travel on the improved road the track was narrow bumpy and muddy grass about three feet tall grew down the median strip frequently branches stretched from one side to the other slapping against the windshield and poking through the open windows to avoid being hit by the snapping branches they had to raise the windows kevin clicked on the air conditioner and the lights the beams reflected off the surrounding vegetation and gave the impression of driving through a tunnel how far do we have to go on this cow path melanie asked only three or four miles kevin said its a good thing we have fourwheel drive candace remarked she was holding on tightly to the overhead strap and still bouncing around the seat belt wasnt helping the last thing id want to do is get stuck out here she glanced out the side window at the inky black jungle and shivered it was eerie she couldnt see a thing despite patches of luminous sky above and then there was the noise just during their short visit with alphonse the night creatures of the jungle had commenced their loud and monotonous chorus what did you make of the things alphonse said kevin asked finally id say the jury is still out melanie said but theyre certainly deliberating i think his comment about the bonobos being bipedal when they come to get the food is very disturbing kevin said the circumstantial evidence is adding up the suggestion that they are communicating impressed me candace said yeah but chimps and gorillas have been taught sign language melanie said and we know bonobos are more bipedal than any other apes what impressed me was the aggressive behavior although i stand by my idea that it might be from our mistake not to have produced more females to maintain the balance can chimps make those sounds that alphonse imitated candace asked i dont think so kevin said and thats an important point it suggests maybe their larynges are different do chimps really kill monkeys candace asked they do occasionally melanie said but ive never heard of a bonobo doing so hang on kevin shouted as he braked the car lurched over a log strewn across the track are you okay he asked candace while glancing up into the rearview mirror no problem candace said although shed been severely jolted luckily the seat belt had worked and it had kept her head from hitting the roof kevin slowed considerably for fear of encountering another log fifteen minutes later they entered a clearing which marked the termination of the track kevin came to a halt directly ahead the headlight beams washed the front of a singlestory cinderblock building with an overhead garage door is this it melanie questioned i guess kevin said the building is new to me kevin switched off the lights and the engine with the clearing open to the sky the level of illumination was adequate for a moment no one moved whats the story kevin asked are we going to check it out or what might as well melanie said weve come this far she opened her door and got out kevin did the same i think ill stay in the car candace said kevin went to the building and tried the door it was locked he shrugged i cant imagine whats in there kevin slapped a mosquito on his forehead how do we get to the island melanie asked kevin pointed to the right theres a track over there its only about fifty yards to the waters edge melanie glanced up at the sky it was a pale lavender its going to be dark pretty soon do you have a flashlight in the car i think so kevin said more important i have some mosquito spray were going to get eaten alive out here unless we use it they went back to the car just as they arrived candace climbed out i cant stay in here by myself she said its too spooky kevin got the mosquito spray while the women doused themselves he searched for the flashlight he found it in the glove compartment after spraying himself kevin motioned for the women to follow him stay close he said the crocodiles and the hippos come out of the water at night is he joking candace asked melanie i dont think so melanie said as soon as they entered the path the illumination fell considerably although it was still light enough to walk without the flashlight kevin led while the two women crowded behind the closer they got to the water the louder the chorus of insects and frogs became how did i get myself into this candace questioned im no outdoors person i cant even conceive of a crocodile or a hippo outside of a zoo hell any bug bigger than my thumbnail terrifies me and spiders forget it all of the sudden there was a crashing noise off to the left candace let out a muffled scream as she grabbed melanie who then did likewise kevin whimpered and switched on the light he pointed the beam in the direction of the noise but it only penetrated a few feet what was that candace demanded when she could find her voice probably a duiker kevin said theyre a small breed of antelope antelope or elephant candace said it scared me it scared me too kevin said maybe we should go back and return in the daytime weve come all this way for crissake melanie said were there i can hear the water for a moment no one moved sure enough they could hear water lapping against the shore what happened to all the night creatures candace asked good question kevin said the antelope must have scared them as well turn the light off melanie said as soon as kevin did they all could see the shimmering surface of the water through the vegetation it looked like liquid silver melanie led the way as the chorus of night creatures recommenced the path opened up into another clearing at the edge of the river in the middle of the clearing was a dark object almost the size of the garage back where theyd left the car kevin walked up to it it wasnt hard to figure out what it was it was the bridge its a telescoping mechanism kevin said thats why alphonse said that it could grow about thirty feet across the water was isla francesca in the fading light its dense vegetation appeared midnightblue directly across from the telescoping bridge was a concrete structure that served as the support for the bridge when it was extended beyond that was an expansive clearing that extended to the east try extending the bridge melanie suggested kevin switched on the flashlight he found the control panel there were two buttons one red the other green he pushed the red one when nothing happened he pushed the green when there still wasnt a reaction he noticed a keyhole with the slot aligned with off you need a key he called melanie and candace had walked over to the waters edge theres a bit of current melanie said leaves and other debris floated by slowly candace looked up the top branches of some of the trees that lined either bank almost touched why do the creatures stay on the island she asked apes and monkeys dont go in the water particularly deep water melanie explained thats why zoos only need a moat for their primate exhibits what about crossing in the trees candace asked kevin joined the women at the riverbank the bonobos are relatively heavy fellows he explained particularly ours most of them are already over a hundred pounds and the branches up there arent nearly strong enough to support their weight back before we put the first animals on the island there were a couple of questionable places so those trees were cut down but colobus monkeys still go back and forth what are all those square objects in the field melanie asked kevin shined the flashlight its beam wasnt strong enough to make much difference at that distance he turned it off and squinted in the half light they look like transport cages from the animal center he said i wonder what they are doing out there melanie asked therere so many of them no idea kevin said how can we get some of the bonobos to appear candace asked by this time theyre probably settling down for the night kevin said i doubt if we can what about the float melanie asked the mechanism that pulls it across must be like a clothesline if it makes noise they might hear it it would be like a dinner bell and might bring them around guess its worth a try kevin said he glanced up and down the waters edge trouble is we dont have any idea where the float may be i cant imagine it would be far melanie said you go east ill go west kevin and melanie walked in opposite directions candace stayed were she was wishing she were back in her room in the hospital quarters here it is melanie called out shed followed a path in the dense foliage for a short distance before coming to a pulley attached to a thick tree a heavy rope hung around the pulley one end disappeared into the water the other end was tied to a fourfoot square float nestled against the shore kevin and candace joined her kevin shined the flashlight across to the island on the other side a similar pulley was attached to a similar tree kevin handed the flashlight to melanie and grasped the rope that drooped into the water when he pulled he could see the pulley on the other side swing out from the trunk of the tree kevin pulled on the rope hand over hand the pulleys complained bitterly with highpitched squeaking noises the float immediately moved away from the shore on its way to the other side this might work kevin said while he pulled melanie swept the other shore with the flashlight beam when the float was halfway across there was a loud splash to their right as a large object dropped into the water from the island melanie shined the light in the direction of the splash two glowing slits of light reflected back from the surface of the water peering at them was a large crocodile good lord candace said as she stepped back from the water its okay kevin said he let go of the rope reached down and picked up a stout stick he threw the stick at the croc with another loud splash the crocodile disappeared beneath the water oh great candace said now we have no idea where he is hes gone kevin said theyre not dangerous unless youre in the water or theyre very hungry whos to say hes not hungry candace commented theres plenty for them to eat out here kevin said as he picked up the rope and recommenced pulling when the float reached the other side he switched ropes and started pulling it back ah its too late he said this isnt going to work the closest nesting area we saw on the computer graphic is over a mile away well have to try this in the daytime no sooner had these words escaped from his mouth when the night was shattered by a number of fearsome screams at the same time there was wild commotion in the bushes on the island as if a stampeding elephant was about to appear kevin dropped the rope both candace and melanie fled back along the path a few steps before stopping with pulses pounding they froze waiting for another scream with a shaking hand melanie shined the flashlight at the area where the commotion had occurred everything was still not a leaf moved ten tense seconds passed that seemed more like ten minutes the group strained their ears to pick up the slightest sound there was nothing but utter silence all the night creatures had fallen silent it was as if the entire jungle was waiting for a catastrophe what in heavens name was that melanie asked finally im not sure i want to find out candace said lets get out of here it must have been a couple of the bonobos kevin said he reached out and grabbed the rope the float was being buffeted in midstream he quickly hauled it in i think candace is right melanie said its gotten too dark to see much even if they did appear im spooked lets go youll not get an argument from me kevin said as he made his way over to the women i dont know what were doing here at this hour well come back in the daylight they hurried along the path to the clearing as best they could melanie led with the flashlight candace was behind her holding on to her blouse kevin brought up the rear it would be great to get a key for this bridge kevin said as they passed the structure and how do you propose to do that melanie asked borrow bertrams kevin said but you told us he forbid anyone to go to the island melanie said hes certainly not going to lend the key well have to borrow it without his knowledge kevin said oh yeah sure melanie said sarcastically they entered the tunnellike path leading up to the car halfway to the parking area melanie said god its dark am i holding the light okay for you guys its fine candace said melanie slowed then stopped whats the matter kevin asked theres something strange she said she cocked her head to the side listening now dont get me scared candace warned the frogs and crickets havent restarted their racket melanie said in the next instant all hell broke loose a loud repetitive stuttering noise splintered the jungle stillness branches twigs and leaves rained down on the group kevin recognized the noise and reacted by reflex extending his arms he literally tackled the women so that all three fell to the moist insectinfested earth the reason kevin recognized the sound was because he once had inadvertently witnessed the equatoguinean soldiers practicing the noise was the sound of a machine gun chapter march pm new york city excuse me laurie cheryl myers said standing in the doorway to lauries office cheryl was one of the forensic investigators we just received this overnight package and i thought you might want it right away laurie stood up and took the parcel she was curious about what it could be she looked at the label to find out the sender it was cnn thanks cheryl laurie said she was perplexed she had no idea for the moment what cnn could have sent her i see dr mehta is not in cheryl said i brought up a chart for her that came in from university hospital should i put it on her desk dr riva mehta was lauries office mate theyd shared the space since both had started at the medical examiners office six and a half years previously sure laurie said preoccupied with her parcel she got her finger under the flap and pulled it open inside was a videotape laurie looked at the label it said carlo franconi shooting march after having finished her final autopsy that morning laurie had been ensconced in her office trying to complete some of the twentyodd cases that she had pending shed been busy reviewing microscopic slides laboratory results hospital records and police reports and for several hours had not thought of the franconi business the arrival of the tape brought it all back unfortunately the video was meaningless without the body laurie tossed the tape into her briefcase and tried to get back to work but after fifteen minutes of wasted effort she turned the light off under her microscope she couldnt concentrate her mind kept toying with the baffling question of how the body had disappeared it was as if it had been an amazing magic trick one minute the body was safely stored in compartment one eleven and viewed by three employees then poof it was gone there had to be an explanation but try as she might laurie could not fathom it laurie decided to head down to the basement to visit the mortuary office shed expected at least one tech to be available but when she arrived the room was unoccupied undaunted laurie went over to the large leatherbound log flipping the page she looked for the entries that mike passano had shown her the previous night she found them without difficulty taking a pencil from a collection in a coffee mug and a sheet of scratch paper laurie wrote down the names and accession numbers of the two bodies that had come in during the night shift dorothy kline and frank gleason she also wrote down the names of the two funeral homes spoletto in ozone park new york and the dickson in summit new jersey laurie was about to leave when her eye caught the large rolodex on the corner of the desk she decided to call each home after identifying herself she asked to speak to the managers what had sparked her interest in telephoning was the outside chance that either one of the pickups could have been bogus she thought the chances were slim since the night tech mike passano had said the homes had called before coming and presumably he was familiar with the people as laurie expected the pickups indeed were legitimate both managers attesting to the fact that the bodies had come in to their respective homes and were at that time on view laurie went back to the logbook and looked again at the names of the two arrivals to be complete she copied them down along with their accession numbers the names were familiar to her since shed assigned them as autopsies the following morning to paul plodgett but she wasnt as interested in the arrivals as the departures the arrivals had come in with longtime me employees whereas the bodies that had gone out had done so with strangers feeling frustrated laurie drummed her pencil on the desk surface she was sure she had to be missing something once again her eye caught the rolodex which was open to the spoletto funeral home in the very back of lauries mind the name made a hazy association for a moment she struggled with her memory why was that name familiar then she remembered it had been during the cerino affair a man had been murdered in the spoletto funeral home on orders from paul cerino franconis predecessor laurie pocketed her memo pushed away from the desk and returned to the fifth floor she walked directly to jacks office the door was ajar she knocked on the jamb both jack and chet looked up from their respective labors i had a thought laurie said to jack just one jack quipped laurie threw her pencil at him which he easily evaded she plopped down in the chair to his right and told him about the mob connection with the spoletto funeral home good grief laurie jack complained just because there is a mob hit in a funeral home doesnt mean that it is mobconnected you dont think so laurie asked jack didnt have to answer she could see by his expression and now that she thought about her idea she understood it was a ridiculous notion shed been grabbing for straws besides jack said why wont you just leave this alone i told you laurie said its a personal thing maybe i can channel your efforts into a more positive direction jack said he motioned toward his microscope take a look at a frozen section tell me what you think laurie got up from the chair and leaned over the microscope what is this the shotgun entrance wound she asked just as sharp as usual jack commented youre right on the money well its not a hard call laurie said id say the muzzle was within inches of the skin my opinion exactly jack said anything else my gosh theres absolutely no extravasation of blood laurie said none at all so this had to have been a postmortem wound she raised her head and looked at jack she was amazed shed assumed it had been the mortal wound ah the power of modern science jack commented this floater you foisted on me is turning into a bastard of a case hey you volunteered laurie said im teasing jack said im glad i got the case the shotgun wounds were definitely postmortem so was the decapitation and removal of the hands of course the propeller injuries were too what was the cause of death laurie asked two other gunshot wounds jack said one through the base of the neck he pointed to an area just above his right collarbone and another in the left side that shattered the tenth rib the irony was that both slugs ended up in the mass of shotgun pellets in the right upper abdominal area and were difficult to be seen on the x ray now thats a first laurie said bullets hidden by shotgun pellets amazing the beauty of this job is that you see new things every day the best is yet to come jack said this is a beaut chet said hed been listening to the conversation itll be perfect for one of the forensic pathology dinner seminars i think the shotgun blasts were an attempt to shield the victims identity as much as the decapitation and removal of the hands jack said in what way laurie asked i believe this patient had had a liver transplant jack said and not that long ago the killer must have understood that such a procedure put the patient in a relatively small group and hence jeopardized the chances of hiding the victims identity was there much liver left laurie asked very little jack said most of it was destroyed by the shotgun injury and the fish helped chet said laurie winced but i was able to find some liver tissue jack said well use that to corroborate the transplant as we speak ted lynch ip in dna is running a dq alpha well have the results in an hour or so but for me the clincher was the sutures in the vena cava and the hepatic artery whats a dq alpha laurie asked jack laughed makes me feel better that you dont know he said because i had to ask ted the same question he told me it is a convenient and rapid dna marker for differentiating two individuals it compares the dq region of the histocompatibility complex on chromosome six what about the portal vein laurie asked were there sutures in it as well unfortunately the portal vein was pretty much gone jack said along with a lot of the intestines well laurie said this should all make identification rather easy my thought exactly jack said ive already got bart arnold hot on the trail hes been in contact with the national organ procurement organization unos hes also in the process of calling all the centers actively doing liver transplants especially here in the city thats a small list laurie said good job jack jacks face reddened slightly and laurie was touched she thought he was immune to such compliments what about the bullets laurie asked same gun weve packed them off to the police lab for ballistics jack said it was hard to say if they came from the same gun or not because of their distortion one of them made direct contact with the tenth rib and was flattened even the second one wasnt in good shape i think it grazed the vertebral column what calibre laurie asked couldnt tell from mere observation jack said what did vinnie say laurie asked hes become pretty good at guessing vinnies worthless today jack said hes been in the worst mood ive ever seen him in i asked him what he thought but he wouldnt say he told me it was my job and that he wasnt paid enough to be giving his opinions all the time you know i had a case similar to this back during that awful cerino affair laurie said she stared off and for a moment her eyes glazed over the victim was a secretary of the doctor who was involved with the conspiracy of course shed not had a liver transplant but the head and the hands were gone and i did make the identification because of her surgical history someday youll have to tell me that whole grisly story jack said you keep dropping tantalizing bits and pieces laurie sighed i wish i could just forget the whole thing it still gives me nightmares raymond glanced at his watch as he opened the fifth avenue door to dr daniel levitzs office it was two fortyfive raymond had called the doctor three times starting just after eleven am without success on each occasion the receptionist had promised dr levitz would phone back but he hadnt in his agitated state raymond found the discourtesy aggravating since dr levitzs office was just around the corner from raymonds apartment raymond thought it was better to walk over than sit by the phone dr raymond lyons raymond said with authority to the receptionist im here to see dr levitz yes dr lyons the receptionist said she had the same cultivated matronly look as dr andersons receptionist i dont have you down on my appointment sheet is the doctor expecting you not exactly raymond said well ill let the doctor know you are here the receptionist said noncommitally raymond took a seat in the crowded waiting room he picked up one of the usual doctor waitingroom magazines and flipped the pages without focusing on the images his agitation was becoming tinged with irritation and he began to wonder if it had been a bad decision to come to dr levitzs office the job of checking on the first of the other two transplant patients had been easy with one phone call raymond had spoken with the recruiting doctor in dallas texas the doctor had assured raymond that his kidneytransplant patient a prominent local businessman was doing superbly and was in no way a possible candidate for an autopsy before hanging up the doctor had promised raymond to inform him if the situation were ever to change but with dr levitzs failure to return raymonds phone call raymond had not been able to check on the last case it was frustrating and anxietyproducing raymonds eyes roamed the room it was as sumptuously appointed as dr andersons with original oils deep burgundycolored walls and oriental carpets the patients patiently waiting were all obviously welltodo as evidenced by their clothes bearing and jewels as the minutes ticked by raymond found his irritation mounting what was adding insult to injury at the moment was dr levitzs obvious success it reminded raymond of the absurdity of his own medical license being in legal limbo just because hed gotten caught padding his medicare claims but here was dr levitz working away in all this splendor with at least part of his receipts coming from taking care of a number of crime families obviously it all represented dirty money and on top of that raymond was sure levitz padded his medicare claims hell everybody did a nurse appeared and cleared her throat expectantly raymond moved to the edge of his seat but the nurse called out another name while the summoned patient got up replaced his magazine and disappeared into the bowels of the office raymond slouched back against the sofa and fumed being at the mercy of such people made raymond long for financial security all the more with this current doubles program he was so close he couldnt let the whole enterprise crumble for some stupid unexpected easily remedied reason it was threefifteen when finally raymond was ushered into daniel levitzs inner sanctum levitz was a small balding man with multiple nervous tics he had a mustache but it was sparse and decidedly unmanly raymond had always wondered what it was about the man that apparently inspired confidence in so many patients its been one of those days daniel said by way of explanation i didnt expect you to drop by i hadnt planned on it myself raymond said but when you didnt return my calls i didnt think i had a choice calls daniel questioned i didnt get any calls from you ill have to have another talk with that receptionist of mine good help is so difficult to come by these days raymond was tempted to tell daniel to cut the bull but he resisted after all he was finally talking to the man and turning the meeting into a confrontation wouldnt solve anything besides as irritating as daniel levitz could be he was also raymonds most successful recruit he had signed up twelve clients for the program as well as four doctors what can i do for you daniel asked his head twitched several times in its usual and disconcerting way first i want to thank you for helping out the other night raymond said from the absolute pinnacles of power it was thought to be an emergency publicity at this point would have meant an end to the whole enterprise i was glad to be of service daniel said and pleased that mr vincent dominick was willing to help out to preserve his investment speaking of mr dominick raymond said he paid me an unexpected visit yesterday morning i hope on a cordial note daniel said he was quite familiar with dominicks career as well as his personality and surmised that extortion would not be out of the question yes and no raymond admitted he insisted on telling me details i didnt want to know then he insisted on paying no tuition for two years it could have been worse daniel said what does that mean to my percentage the percentage stays the same raymond said its just that it becomes a percentage of nothing so i help and then get penalized daniel complained thats hardly fair raymond paused hed not thought about daniels loss of his cut of dominicks tuition yet it was something that had to be faced at present raymond was reluctant to upset the man you have a valid point raymond conceded lets say well discuss it in the near future at the moment i have another concern whats the status of cindy carlson cindy carlson was the sixteenyearold daughter of albright carlson the wall street junkbond mogul daniel had recruited albright and his daughter as clients as a youngster the daughter had suffered from glomerulonephritis the malady had worsened during the girls early teens to the point of kidney failure consequently daniel not only had the record number of clients he also had the record number of harvests two carlo franconi and cindy carlson shes been doing fine daniel said at least healthwise why do you ask this franconi business has made me realize how vulnerable the enterprise is raymond admitted i want to be sure there are no other possible loose ends dont worry about the carlsons daniel said they certainly arent going to cause us any trouble they couldnt be any more grateful in fact just last week albright was talking about getting his wife out to the bahamas to give a bonemarrow sample so she can become a client as well thats encouraging raymond said we can always use more clients but its not the demand side of the enterprise that has me worried financially we couldnt be doing any better were ahead of all projections its the unexpected that has me worried like franconi daniel nodded and then twitched theres always uncertainty he said philosophically thats life the lower the level of uncertainty the better ill feel raymond said when i asked you about cindy carlsons status you qualified your positive response as healthwise why because shes a basket case mentally daniel said how do you mean raymond asked once again his pulse quickened its hard to imagine a kid not being a bit crazy growing up with a father like albright carlson daniel said think about it and then add the burden of a chronic illness whether that contributed to her obesity i dont know the girl is quite overweight thats tough enough for anybody but especially so for a teen the poor kid is understandably depressed how depressed raymond asked depressed enough to attempt suicide on two occasions daniel said and they werent just childish bids for attention they were bona fide attempts and the only reason shes still with us is because she was discovered almost immediately and because shed tried drugs the first time and hanging herself the second if shed had a gun she surely would have succeeded raymond groaned out loud whats the matter daniel asked all suicides are medical examiner cases raymond said i hadnt thought of that daniel said this is the kind of loose end i was referring to raymond said damn just our luck sorry to be the bearer of bad tidings daniel said its not your fault raymond said the important thing is that we recognize it for what it is and that we understand we cant sit idly by and wait for catastrophe i dont think we have much choice daniel said what about vincent dominick raymond said hes helped us once and with his own child ill he has a vested interest in our programs future dr daniel levitz stared at raymond are you suggesting raymond didnt reply this is where i draw the line daniel said he stood up im sorry but i have a waitingroom full of patients couldnt you call mr dominick and just ask raymond said he felt a wave of desperation wash over him absolutely not daniel said i might take care of a number of criminally connected individuals but i certainly dont get involved with their business but you helped with franconi raymond complained franconi was a corpse on ice at the medical examiners office daniel said then give me mr dominicks phone number raymond said ill call him myself and ill need the carlsons address ask my receptionist daniel said just tell her youre a personal friend thank you raymond said but just remember daniel said i deserve and want the percentages that are due to me regardless of what happens between you and vinnie dominick at first the receptionist was reluctant to give raymond the phone number and the addresses but after a quick call to her boss she relented wordlessly she copied the information onto the back of one of dr daniel levitzs business cards and handed it to raymond raymond wasted no time getting back to his apartment on sixtyfourth street as he came through the door darlene asked how the meeting with the doctor had gone dont ask raymond said curtly he went into his paneled study closed the door and sat down at his desk nervously he dialed the phone in his minds eye he could see cindy carlson either scrounging around in the medicine cabinet for her mothers sleeping pills or hanging out in the local hardware store buying a length of rope yeah what is it a voice said on the other end of the line id like to speak to mr vincent dominick raymond said with as much authority as he could muster he detested the necessity to deal with the likes of these people but he had little choice seven years of intense labor and commitment were on the line not to mention his entire future whos calling dr raymond lyons there was a pause before the man said hang on to raymonds surprise he was put on hold with one of beethovens sonatas playing in the background to raymond it seemed like some sort of oxymoron a few minutes later vinnie dominicks dulcet voice came over the line raymond could picture the mans practiced and deceptive banality as if vinnie were a welldressed character actor playing himself how did you get this number doctor vinnie asked his tone was nonchalant yet somehow more threatening because of it raymonds mouth went bonedry he had to cough dr levitz gave it to me raymond managed what can i do for you doctor vinnie asked another problem has come up raymond croaked he cleared his throat again id like to see you to discuss it there was a pause that went on for longer than raymond could tolerate just when he was about to ask if vinnie was still there the mobster responded when i got involved with you people i thought it was supposed to give me peace of mind i didnt think it was supposed to make my life more complicated these are just minor growing pains raymond said in actuality the project is going extremely well ill meet you in the neopolitan restaurant on corona avenue in elmhurst in a half hour vinnie said think you can find it im certain i can raymond said ill take a cab and ill leave immediately see you there vinnie said before hanging up raymond rummaged hastily through the top drawer of his desk for his new york city map that included all five boroughs he spread the map out on his desk and using the index located corona avenue in elmhurst he estimated that he could make it easily in half an hour provided the traffic wasnt bad on the queensborough bridge that was a concern because it was almost four oclock the beginning of rush hour as raymond came flying out of his study pulling his coat back on darlene asked him where he was going he told her he didnt have time to explain he said hed be back in an hour or so raymond ran to park avenue where he caught a cab it was a good thing hed brought his map along because the afghan taxi driver had no idea even where elmhurst was much less corona avenue the trip was not easy just getting across the east side of manhattan took almost a quarter of an hour and then the bridge was stopandgo by the time raymond was supposed to be at the restaurant his cab had just reached queens but from there it was easy going and raymond was only fifteen minutes late when he walked into the restaurant and pushed aside a heavy velvet curtain it was immediately apparent the restaurant was not open for business most of the chairs were upside down on top of the tables vinnie dominick was sitting by himself in one of the curved red velvetupholstered booths that lined the walls in front of him were a newspaper and a small cup of expresso a lighted cigarette lay in a glass ashtray four other men were smoking at the bar sprawled on bar stools two of them raymond recognized from their visit to his apartment behind the bar was an overweight bearded man washing glassware the rest of the restaurant was empty vinnie waved raymond to his booth sit down doc vinnie said a coffee raymond nodded as he slid into the banquette it took some effort because of the nap of the velvet the room was chilly damp and smelled of the previous nights garlic and the accumulated smoke of fiveyears worth of cigarettes raymond was happy to keep on his hat and coat two coffees vinnie called out to the man behind the bar wordlessly the man turned to an elaborate italian expresso machine and began manipulating the controls you surprised me doc vinnie said i truly never expected to hear from you again as i mentioned on the phone theres another problem raymond said he leaned forward and spoke in a low voice just above a whisper vinnie spread his hands im all ears as succinctly as he could raymond outlined the situation with cindy carlson he emphasized the fact that all suicides were medical examiner cases and had to be autopsied there were no exceptions the overweight man from behind the bar brought out the coffees vinnie didnt respond to raymonds monologue until the bartender had gone back to his glassware is this cindy carlson the daughter of albright carlson vinnie asked the wall street legend raymond nodded thats partly why this situation is so important he said if she commits suicide it will undoubtedly garner considerable media attention the medical examiners will be particularly vigilant i get the picture vinnie said as he took a sip of his coffee what is it exactly that you would want us to do i wouldnt presume to offer any suggestions raymond said nervously but you can appreciate that this problem is on a par with the franconi situation so you want this sixteenyearold girl to just conveniently disappear vinnie said well she has tried to kill herself twice raymond said limply in a way wed just be doing her a favor vinnie laughed he picked up his cigarette took a drag and then ran his hand over the top of his head his hair was slicked back smoothly from his forehead he regarded raymond with his dark eyes youre a piece of work doc vinnie said i gotta give you credit for that perhaps i can offer another year of free tuition raymond said thats very generous of you vinnie said but you know something doc its not enough in fact im getting a little fed up with this whole operation and ill tell you straight if it werent for vinnie juniors kidney problems id probably just ask for my money back and wed go our separate ways you see im already looking at potential problems from the first favor i did for you i got a call from my wifes brother who runs the spoletto funeral home hes all upset because a dr laurie montgomery called asking embarrassing questions tell me doc do you know this dr laurie montgomery no i dont raymond said he swallowed loudly hey angelo come over here vinnie called out angelo slid off his bar stool and came to the table sit down angelo vinnie said i want you to tell the good doctor here about laurie montgomery raymond had to move farther into the booth to give room for angelo he felt distinctly uncomfortable being sandwiched between the two men laurie montgomery is a smart persistent individual angelo said with his husky voice to put it bluntly shes a pain in the ass raymond avoided looking at angelo his face was mostly scar tissue since his eyes didnt close properly they were red and rheumy angelo had an unfortunate runin with laurie montgomery a few years back vinnie explained angelo tell raymond what you learned today after we heard from the funeral home i called vinnie amendola our contact in the morgue angelo said he told me that laurie montgomery specifically said that she was going to make it her personal business to find out how franconis body disappeared needless to say hes very concerned see what i mean vinnie said we got a potential problem here just because we did you a favor im very sorry raymond said lamely he couldnt think of any other response it brings us back to this tuition issue vinnie said under the circumstances i think the tuition should just be waived in other words no tuition for me or vinnie junior forever i do have to answer to the parent corporation raymond squeaked he cleared his throat fine vinnie said doesnt bother me in the slightest explain to them its a valid business expense hey maybe you could even use it as a deduction on your taxes vinnie laughed heartily raymond shuddered imperceptibly he knew he was being unfairly muscled yet he had little choice okay he managed thank you vinnie said gosh i guess this is going to work out after all weve become sorta business partners now i trust you have cindy carlsons address raymond fumbled in his pocket and produced dr levitzs business card vinnie took it copied down the address from the back and handed it back vinnie gave the address to angelo englewood new jersey angelo said reading aloud is that a problem vinnie asked angelo shook his head then its arranged vinnie said looking back at raymond so much for your latest problem but i advise you not to come up with any more with our current tuition understanding it seems to me youre out of bargaining chips a few minutes later raymond was out on the street he realized he was shaking as he looked at his watch it was close to five and getting dark stepping off the curb he raised his hand to flag a cab what a disaster he thought somehow he would have to absorb the cost of maintaining vinnie doinicks and his sons double for the rest of their lives a cab pulled over raymond climbed in and gave his home address as he sped away from the neopolitan restaurant he began to feel better the actual cost of maintaining the two doubles was minuscule since the animals lived in isolation on a deserted island so the situation wasnt that bad especially since the potential problem with cindy carlson was now solved by the time raymond entered his apartment his mood had improved significantly at least until he got in the door youve had two calls from africa darlene reported problems raymond asked there was something about darlenes voice that set off alarm bells there was good news and bad news darlene said the good news was from the surgeon he said that horace winchester is doing miraculously and that you should start planning on coming to pick him and the surgical team up whats the bad news raymond asked the other call was from siegfried spallek darlene said he was a little vague he said there was some trouble with kevin marshall what kind of trouble raymond asked he didnt elaborate darlene said raymond remembered specifically asking kevin not to do anything rash he wondered if the researcher had not heeded his warning it must have had something to do with that stupid smoke kevin had seen did spallek want me to call back tonight raymond asked it was eleven oclock his time when he called darlene said he said he could talk to you tomorrow raymond groaned inwardly now hed have to spend the entire night worrying he wondered when it was all going to end chapter march pm cogo equatorial guinea kevin heard the heavy metal door open at the top of the stone stairs and a crack of light cascaded in two seconds later the string of bare lightbulbs in the ceiling of the corridor went on through the bars of his cell he could see melanie and candace in their respective cells they were squinting as he was in the sudden glare heavy footfalls on the granite stairs preceded siegfried spalleks appearance he was accompanied by cameron mcivers and mustapha aboud chief of the moroccan guards its about time mr spallek melanie snapped i demand to be let out of here this instant or youll be in serious trouble kevin winced it was not the way to talk with siegfried spallek on any occasion much less in their current circumstance kevin melanie and candace had been huddling in utter blackness in separate cells in the oppressively hot dank jail in the basement of the town hall each cell had a small arched window that opened into a window well in the rear arcade of the building the openings were barred but without glass so vermin could pass through unimpeded all three prisoners had been terrified by the sounds of scampering creatures especially since theyd seen several tarantulas before the lights had been turned out the only source of comfort had been that they could easily talk to each other the first five minutes of the evenings ordeal had been the worst as soon as the sound of the burst of machinegun fire died out kevin and the women were blinded by large handheld lights when their eyes had finally adjusted they saw that theyd walked into an ambush of sorts they were surrounded by a jeering group of youthful equatoguinean soldiers whod delighted in casually aiming their aks at them several had been brazen enough to poke the women with the muzzles of their weapons fearing the worst kevin and the others hadnt moved a muscle theyd been scared witless by the indiscriminate gunfire and terrified it might begin again at the slightest provocation only at the appearance of several of the moroccan guards did the unruly soldiers back off kevin had never imagined the intimidating arabs as potential saviors but thats how it had turned out the guards had assumed custody of kevin and the women then the guards drove them in kevins car first to the moroccan guard building across from the animal center where theyd been placed in a windowless room for several hours and then finally into town where theyd been incarcerated in the old jail this is outrageous treatment melanie persisted on the contrary siegfried said i have been assured by mustapha that you have been treated with all due respect respect melanie sputtered to be shot at with machine guns and kept in this shithole in the dark thats respect you were not shot at siegfried corrected those were merely a few warning shots directed over your heads you had after all violated an important rule here in the zone isla francesca is offlimits everyone knows that siegfried motioned to cameron toward candace cameron opened her cell with a large antique key candace wasted no time getting out of the cell she hastily dusted off her clothes to make sure there were no bugs she was still dressed in her surgical scrubs from the hospital my apologies to you siegfried said to candace i imagine you were led astray by our resident researchers perhaps you were not even aware of the rule against visiting the island area cameron opened melanies cell and then kevins as soon as i heard about your detention i tried to call dr raymond lyons siegfried said i wanted to ask his opinion as to the best way to handle this situation since he was unavailable i have to take responsibility myself i am releasing you all on your own recognizance i trust that you now know the seriousness of your actions under equatoguinean law it could be considered a capital offense oh bull melanie spat kevin cringed he was afraid melanie would anger siegfried enough to order them back into the cells benevolence was not a part of siegfrieds character mustapha extended kevins car keys to him your vehicle is out back he said with a heavy french accent kevin took the keys his hand shook enough to cause them to jingle until he got his hand and the keys into his pocket im sure i will be speaking to dr lyons sometime tomorrow siegfried said i will contact you individually you may go melanie started to speak again but kevin surprised himself by grabbing her arm and propelling her toward the stairs ive had enough manhandling melanie sputtered she tried to pull her arm from kevins grasp lets just get into the car kevin whispered harshly through clenched teeth he forced her to keep moving what a night melanie complained at the base of the stairs she managed to yank her arm free irritably she started up kevin waited for candace to precede him then followed the women up to the ground floor they emerged into an office used by the equatoguinean soldiers that were constantly seen lounging in front of the town hall there were four of them present with the base manager the head of security and the chief of the moroccan guards in the building the soldiers were a good deal more attentive than usual all four were standing in their interpretation of attention with their assault rifles over their shoulders when kevin and the women appeared their expressions suggested they were confused melanie gave them the finger as kevin herded her and candace out the door into the parking lot please melanie kevin begged dont provoke them whether the soldiers did not understand the meaning of melanies gesture or were bewildered by the anomalous circumstances kevin didnt know one way or the other they didnt come flying out after them as kevin feared they might they got to the car kevin opened the passengerside door candace climbed in eagerly but not melanie she turned to kevin with her eyes blazing in the dim light give me the keys she demanded what kevin asked even though hed heard her i said give me the keys melanie repeated confused by this unexpected request but not wishing to incite her more than she already was kevin handed her the car keys melanie immediately went around to the other side of the car and got in behind the wheel kevin climbed into the passenger seat he didnt care who drove as long as they got themselves out of there melanie started the car spun the tires and drove out of the parking lot jeez melanie kevin said slow down im pissed melanie said as if i couldnt tell kevin said im not going home just yet melanie said but id be happy to take you guys home if you want where do you want to go kevin asked its almost midnight im going out to the animal center melanie said im not going to tolerate being treated like this without finding out what the hell is going on whats at the animal center kevin asked the keys to that goddamned bridge melanie said i want one because for me this affair has gone beyond curiosity maybe we should stop and talk about this kevin suggested melanie jammed on the brakes bringing them to a lurching stop both kevin and candace had to push themselves back into their respective seats im going to the animal center melanie repeated you guys can either come along or ill drop you off its your call why tonight kevin asked one because im really ticked off right now melanie said and two because they wouldnt suspect it obviously they intend for us to go home and quake in our beds thats why we were so mistreated but you know something thats not my style thats my style kevin said i think melanie is right candace said from the backseat they were deliberately trying to scare us and i think they did a damn good job kevin said or am i the only sane one in the group lets do it candace said oh no kevin groaned im outnumbered well take you home melanie said no problem she started to put the car in reverse kevin reached out and stayed her hand how do you propose to get the keys you dont even know where theyd be i think its pretty clear theyd be in bertrams office melanie said hes the one in charge of logistics for the bonobo program hell youre the one who suggested he had them okay theyre in bertrams office kevin said but what about security offices are locked melanie reached into the breast pocket of her animalcenter coveralls and pulled out a magnetic card youre forgetting that im part of the animalcenter hierarchy this is a master card and not the kind that competes with visa this thing gets me in every door of the animal center twentyfour hours a day remember my work with the bonobo project is only a part of the fertility work i do kevin looked over the back of his seat at candace her blond hair was luminous in the half light of the car interior if youre game candace i guess im game he said lets go candace said melanie accelerated and turned north beyond the motor pool the motor pool was in full operation with huge mercuryvapor lamps illuminating the entire staging area the motor pools night shift was larger than either the day or evening shifts since thats when truck traffic between the zone and bata was at its peak melanie zipped past a number of tractor trailers until the turnoff to bata fell behind from that point all the way to the animal center they didnt see another vehicle the animal center worked three shifts just like the motor pool did although in the animal center the night shift was the smallest the majority of the night staff worked in the veterinary hospital melanie took advantage of this fact by pulling kevins toyota up to one of the animalhospital doors there the car had lots of company melanie turned off the ignition and gazed at the animalcenter entrance that led directly into the veterinary hospital she drummed her fingers on the steering wheel well kevin said were here whats the plan im thinking melanie said i cant decide whats best whether you guys wait here or come with me this place is huge candace said shed leaned forward and was gazing at the building in front of them it ran from the street all the way back to where it disappeared into the jungle foliage for as many times as ive been to cogo ive never been out here at the animal center i didnt have any idea it was so large is this part were facing the hospital yup melanie said this whole wing id be interested to see it candace said ive never been in a veterinary hospital let alone one thats so palatial its stateoftheart melanie said you should see the ors oh my god kevin sighed he rolled his eyes ive been ensnared by the insane weve just had the most harrowing experience in our lives and youre talking about taking a tour its not going to be a tour melanie said as she alighted from the car come on candace im sure i can use your help kevin you can wait here if youd like fine by me kevin said but it only took him a few moments of watching the women trudge toward the entrance before he too climbed out of the car he decided that the anxiety of waiting would be worse than the stress of going wait up kevin called out he had to run a few steps until hed caught up with the others i dont want to hear any complaining melanie told kevin dont worry kevin said he felt like a teenager being chastised by his mother i dont anticipate any problems melanie said bertram edwardss office is in the administration part of the building which at this time will be deserted but just to be sure we dont arouse any suspicion once were inside well head down to the locker room i want you guys in animal center coveralls okay i mean its not really the time anyone would expect to encounter visitors sounds like a good idea to me candace said all right bertram said into the phone his eye caught the luminous dial of his bedside clock it was quarter past midnight ill meet you at your office in five minutes bertram swung his legs over the edge of the bed and parted the mosquito netting trouble trish his wife asked shed pushed herself up on one elbow just a nuisance bertram said go back to sleep ill be back in a half hour or so bertram closed the door to the bedroom before turning on the dressingroom light he dressed quickly although hed downplayed the situation to trish bertram was anxious he had no idea what was going on but it had to be trouble siegfried had never called him in the middle of the night with a request to come to his office outside it was as bright as daytime with a nearly full moon having risen in the east the sky was filled with silverypurple cumulus clouds the night air was heavy and humid and perfectly still the sounds of the jungle were an almost constant cacophony of buzzes chirps and squawks interrupted with occasional short screams it was a noise bertram had grown accustomed to over the years and it didnt even register in his mind despite the distance to the town hall being only a few hundred yards bertram drove he knew it would be faster and every minute that passed raised his curiosity as he pulled into the parking lot he could see that the usually lethargic soldiers were strangely agitated moving around the army post clutching their rifles they eyed him nervously as he turned off his headlights and alighted from the car approaching the building on foot bertram could see meager light flickering through the slats of the shutters covering siegfrieds secondfloor office windows he went up the stairs passed through the dark reception area normally occupied by aurielo and entered siegfrieds office siegfried was sitting at his desk with his feet propped up on the corner in the hand of his good arm he held and was gently swirling a brandy snifter cameron mcivers head of security was sitting in a rattan chair with a similar glass the only illumination in the room was coming from the candle in the skull the low level of shimmering light cast dark shadows and gave a lifelike quality to the menagerie of stuffed animals thanks for coming out at such an ungodly hour siegfried said with his usual german accent how about a splash of brandy do i need it bertram asked as he pulled a rattan chair over to the desk siegfried laughed it can never hurt cameron got the drink from a sideboard he was a hefty fullbearded scotsman with a bulbous red nose and a strong bias toward alcohol of any sort although scotch was understandably his favorite he handed the snifter to bertram and reclaimed his seat and his own drink usually when im called out in the middle of the night it is a medical emergency with an animal bertram said he took a sip of the brandy and breathed in deeply tonight i have the sense it is something else entirely indeed siegfried said first i have to commend you your warning this afternoon about kevin marshall was wellfounded and timely i asked cameron to have him watched by the moroccans and sure enough this evening he melanie becket and one of the surgical nurses drove all the way out to the landing area for isla francesca damnation bertram exclaimed did they go on the island no siegfried said they merely played with the food float theyd also stopped to talk with alphonse kimba this irritates me to death bertram exclaimed i dont like anyone going near that island and i dont like anyone talking to that pygmy nor do i siegfried agreed where are they now bertram questioned we let them go home siegfried said but not before putting the fear of god into them i dont think they will be doing it again at least not for a while this is not what i need bertram complained i hate to have to worry about this on top of the bonobos splitting into two groups this is worse than the animals living in two groups siegfried said theyre both bad bertram said both have the potential of interrupting the smooth operation of the program and possibly putting an end to it i think my idea of caging them all and bringing them into the animal center should be reconsidered ive got the cages out there it wouldnt be difficult and it will make retrievals a hell of a lot easier from the moment bertram had determined the bonobos were living in two social groups hed thought it best to round up the animals and keep them in separate cages where they could be watched but hed been thwarted by siegfried bertram had considered going over siegfrieds head by appealing to his boss in cambridge massachusetts but had decided against it doing so would have alerted the gensys hierarchy that there was potential trouble with the bonobo program were not opening that discussion siegfried said emphatically were not giving up on the idea of keeping them isolated on the island we all decided back when this started that was the best idea i still think it is but with this episode with kevin marshall the bridge has me worried why bertram asked its locked where are the keys siegfried asked in my office bertram said i think they should be here in the main safe siegfried said most of your staff has access to your office including melanie becket perhaps you have a point bertram said im glad you agree siegfried said so id like you to get them how many are there i dont recall exactly bertram said four or five something like that i want them here siegfried said fine bertram said agreeably i dont have a problem with that good siegfried said he let his legs drop from the desk and stood up lets go ill come with you you want to go now bertram asked with disbelief why put off until tomorrow what you can do today siegfried said isnt that an expression you americans espouse with the keys in the safe i know ill sleep a lot better tonight would you want me to come along as well cameron asked its not necessary siegfried said im sure bertram and i can handle it kevin looked at himself in the fulllength mirror at the end of the banks of lockers in the mens room the trouble with the coveralls was that the small was too small and the medium was a little too big he had to roll up the sleeves and the pant legs what the hell are you doing in there melanies voice called out shed pushed open the door from the hall im coming kevin said he closed the locker where hed stored his own clothes and hurried out into the hall i thought women were supposed to take a long time dressing melanie complained i couldnt decide which size was best kevin said did anybody come in while you were in there melanie asked not a soul kevin said good melanie said same for us in the ladies room lets go melanie motioned for the others to follow her as she started up the stairs to get to the administration area from here we have to pass through part of the veterinary hospital i think its best to avoid the main floor which has the emergency room and the acutecare unit theres always a lot of activity there so lets go up to the second floor and go through the fertility unit i can even say im checking on patients if someone asks cool candace said they passed the first floor and climbed to the second entering the main corridor they encountered their first animalcenter employee if the man thought that there was anything abnormal about kevin and candaces presence in the middle of the night he didnt give any evidence he passed by with merely a nod that was easy candace whispered its the coveralls melanie said they turned left through a set of double doors and entered a brightly lit narrow hallway lined with a number of blank doors melanie cracked one of them and stuck her head inside quietly she closed the door its one of my patients shes a lowland gorilla whos almost ready for egg retrieval they can get a little rambunctious with the hormone level we have to achieve but shes sleeping soundly can i see candace asked i suppose melanie said but be quiet and dont make any sudden movements candace nodded melanie opened the door and slipped inside candace followed kevin stayed by the door holding it open shouldnt we be doing what we came here for kevin whispered melanie put her finger to her lips there were four large cages in the room only one of which was occupied a large gorilla was sleeping on a bed of straw the illumination came from overhead recessed lighting that was dimmed down to a point of being almost off gently touching the bars of the cage candace leaned forward to get a better look shed never been so close to a gorilla if shed been inclined she could have touched the huge animal with speed that defied belief the female gorilla awoke and then bounced off the front of the cage in the next instant she was pounding the floor with her fists like kettle drums and shrieking candace let out a scream of her own as she leapt back out of harms way melanie grabbed her its okay melanie said the gorilla then made another lunge for the front of the cage she also hurled a handful of fresh feces in the process which splattered against the far wall melanie directed candace out the door and kevin let it shut im terribly sorry melanie said to candace candaces nordic complexion was even paler than usual are you all right i guess candace said she checked the front of her coveralls a little pms im afraid melanie said she didnt hit you with any of her poop did she i dont think so candace said she ran a hand through her hair and then examined it lets get the keys kevin said were pushing our luck they walked the length of the fertility unit and pushed through a second pair of swinging doors to enter a large room divided into bays each bay had several cages and most of the cages were occupied by youthful primates of different species this is the pediatric unit melanie whispered just act natural there were four people working in the unit they were all dressed in surgical scrubs with stethoscopes draped around their necks everyone was friendly but busy and preoccupied and the trio passed through garnering nothing more than a couple of smiles and nods after another set of double doors and a short corridor they came to a heavy locked fire door melanie had to use her card to open it here we are melanie whispered as she let the fire door close quietly behind them after the bustle theyd just witnessed the silence and darkness seemed absolute this is the administration area the stairwell is down the hall to the left so hold on there was groping in the dark until candace got her hand on melanies shoulder and kevin got his on candaces come on melanie encouraged she began to inch her way along the corridor while running her hand against the wall the others allowed themselves to be pulled along gradually their eyes adjusted and by the time the group neared the door to the stairwell they could appreciate the small amount of moonlight that seeped through the cracks inside the stairwell it was comparatively bright large windows on each landing flooded the stairs with moonlight the firstfloor hall was much easier to walk in than the secondfloor hall because of the windows in the mainentrance doors melanie led them to a position just outside bertrams office now comes the acid test kevin said as melanie tried her card in the lock there was an immediate reassuring click the door opened no problem melanie said buoyantly the three stepped inside the room and were again thrust into almost complete darkness the only light was a meager glow that filtered through the open door into the inner office what now kevin questioned were not going to find anything in the dark i agree melanie said she felt along the wall for the switch as soon as her finger touched it she switched it on for a moment they blinked at each other whoa seems awfully bright melanie said i hope it doesnt wake up those moroccan guards across the street kevin said dont even joke about it melanie said she walked into the inner office and turned on the light kevin and candace joined her i think we should be methodical about this melanie said ill take the desk candace you take the file cabinet and kevin why dont you take the outer office and while youre at it keep an eye on the hall give a yell if anybody appears now thats a happy thought kevin said siegfried turned left at the motor pool and accelerated his new toyota landcruiser toward the animal center the vehicle had been modified for his disability so that he could shift with his left hand does cameron have any idea why we are so concerned about the security of isla francesca bertram asked no not at all siegfried said has he asked no hes not that kind of person he takes orders he doesnt question them what about telling him and cutting him in on a small percentage bertram suggested he could be very helpful im not diluting our percentages siegfried said dont even suggest it besides cameron is already helpful he does whatever i tell him to do what worries me the most about this episode with kevin marshall is that he must have said something to those women bertram said the last thing i want is for them to start thinking the bonobos on the island are using fire if that gets out its just a matter of time before we have animalrights zealots coming out of the woodwork gensys will shut the program down faster than you can blink your eye what do you think we should do siegfried asked i could arrange to have the three of them just disappear bertram glanced at siegfried and shivered he knew the man was not joking no that could be worse bertram said he looked back out through the windshield that might stimulate a major stateside investigation im telling you i think we should dart the bonobos put them in the cages i brought out there and bring them in sure as hell they wont be using fire in the animal center no goddamn it siegfried snapped the animals stay on the island if theyre brought in you wont be able to keep it a secret even if they dont use fire we know theyre cunning little bastards from the problems weve had during retrievals and maybe theyll start doing something else equally as weird if they do handlers will start talking well be in worse shape bertram sighed and ran a nervous hand through his white hair reluctantly he admitted to himself that siegfried had a point still he thought it best to bring the animals in mainly to keep them isolated from each other ill be talking to raymond lyons tomorrow siegfried said i tried to call him earlier i figured that since kevin marshall had already talked to him we might as well get his opinion about what to do after all this whole operation is his creation he doesnt want trouble any more than we do true bertram said tell me something siegfried said if the animals are using fire how do you think they got it you still think it was lightning im not sure bertram said it could have been lightning but then again they managed to steal a bunch of tools rope and other stuff when we had the crew out there constructing the island side of the bridge mechanism no one even thought about the possibility of theft i mean everything was secured in toolboxes anyway they might have gotten matches of course i have no idea how they could have figured out how to use them you just gave me an idea siegfried said why dont we tell kevin and the women theres been a crew going out to the island over the past week to do some kind of work like cutting trails we can say that weve just found out that they have been starting the fires now thats a damn good idea bertram said it makes perfect sense weve even considered putting a bridge over the rio diviso why the hell didnt we think of it earlier siegfried questioned its so obvious ahead the landcruisers headlights illuminated the first of the animalcenters buildings where do you want me to park siegfried asked pull right up to the front bertram said you can wait in the air it will only take me a second siegfried took his foot off the accelerator and began to brake what the hell bertram said whats the matter theres a light on in my office bertram answered this looks promising candace called out as she pulled a large folder from the top drawer of the file cabinet the folder was dark blue and closed with an attached elastic in the upper righthand corner it said isla francesca melanie pushed in the drawer of the desk shed been searching and walked over to candace kevin appeared from the outer office and joined them candace snapped off the elastic and opened the folder she slid the contents out onto a library table there were wiring diagrams of electronic equipment computer printouts and numerous maps there was also a large and lumpy manila envelope that had the words stevenson bridge written across its top now were cooking candace said she opened the envelope reached in and pulled out a ring with five identical keys voilÃ  melanie said she took the ring and began to remove one of the keys kevin peeked at the maps and picked up a detailed contour map he had it partially unfolded when he became aware of a flickering light out of the corner of his eye glancing at the window he saw the reflections of headlight beams dancing along the slats of the half open blinds stepping over to the window he peeked out uhoh kevin croaked its siegfrieds car quick melanie said get this all back into the file cabinet melanie and candace hastily crammed everything back into the folder got the folder into the file cabinet and closed the drawer no sooner was it closed than they heard the rattle of the front door of the building as it was opened this way melanie whispered frantically she motioned toward a door behind bertrams desk quickly the three went through the door as kevin closed it he could hear the door to the outer office being pulled open they had entered one of bertrams examining rooms it was constructed of white tile and had a central stainlesssteel examining table like bertrams inner office it had windows covered with blinds enough light filtered in to allow them to rush over to the door to the hall unfortunately en route kevin kicked a stainlesssteel pail standing on the floor next to the examining table the pail clanged up against the table leg in the stillness it sounded like a gong at an amusement park melanie reacted by throwing open the door to the hall and racing toward the stairwell candace followed as kevin dashed into the hall he heard the door to bertrams office slam open he had no idea if hed been seen or not in the stairwell melanie descended as fast as the moonlight would allow she could hear candace and kevin behind her she slowed at the foot of the stairs to grope for the door to the basement level she got it open none too soon above they heard the firstfloor stairwell door open followed by heavy footfalls on the metal stairs the basement was utterly black save for a dim rectangular outline of light in the distance holding on to each other they made their way toward the light it wasnt until they had reached it that kevin and candace realized it was a fire door with light seeping around its periphery melanie had it open with her magnetic card once shed located the slot beyond the fire door was a brightly lit hallway which allowed them to run full tilt melanie pulled them to an abrupt halt halfway down the narrow passageway there she opened a door marked pathology inside melanie barked wordlessly everyone complied closing the door melanie locked it with a throw bolt they were standing in an anteroom for two autopsy theaters there were scrub sinks several desks and a large insulated door leading to a refrigerated room why did we come in here kevin said with panic in his voice were trapped not quite melanie said breathlessly this way she motioned for them to follow her around the corner to kevins surprise there was an elevator melanie pounded the callbutton which brought forth an immediate whine of its machinery at the same time the floor indicator illuminated to show the elevator cab was on the third floor come on melanie pleaded as if her urging could speed up the apparatus since it was a freight elevator it was agonizingly slow it was just passing the second floor when the door to the hallway rattled on its hinges followed by a muffled expletive the three exchanged panicky glances theyll be in here in the next few seconds kevin said is there another way out melanie shook her head only the elevator we have to hide kevin said what about the refrigerator candace offered with no time to argue the three darted to the refrigerator kevin got the door open a cool mist flowed out to layer itself along the floor candace went in first followed by melanie and then kevin kevin pulled the door shut its hardware clicked soundly the room was twenty feet square with stainlesssteel shelving from floor to ceiling that lined the periphery as well as forming a central island the hulks of a number of dead primates lay on the shelves the most impressive was the body of a huge silverback male gorilla on the middle shelf of the central island the illumination in the room came from bare light bulbs within wire cages attached to the ceiling at intervals along the walkways instinctively the three rushed around to the back of the central island and squatted down their heavy breathing formed fleeting spheres of mist in the frigid temperature the smell was not pleasant with a hint of ammonia but it was tolerable surrounded by heavy insulation kevin and the others could not hear a sound inside the refrigerator not even the whine of the elevator at least not until they heard the unmistakable click of the refrigerator doors latch kevin felt his heart skip a beat as the door was pulled open preparing himself to see the sneering face of siegfried kevin slowly raised his head to look over the bulk of the dead gorilla to his surprise it wasnt siegfried it was two men in scrub suits carrying in the body of a chimpanzee wordlessly the men placed the remains of the dead ape on a shelf to the right just inside the door and then left once the door was closed kevin looked down at melanie and sighed this has to have been the worst day of my life its not over yet melanie said we still have to get out of here but at least we got what we came for she opened her fist and held up the key light glinted off its chromecolored surface kevin looked at his own hand without realizing it he was still clutching the detailed contour map of isla francesca bertram turned on the light in the hallway as he exited the stairwell hed gone up to the second floor and had entered the pediatric unit hed asked the crew if anybody had just run through the answer was no entering his examination room he switched on the light in there as well siegfried appeared at the door to bertrams office well siegfried questioned i dont know if someone was in here or not bertram said he looked down at the stainlesssteel pail that had moved from its normal position under the edge of the examining table did you see anyone siegfried asked not really bertram said he shook his head maybe the janitorial crew left the lights on well it underlines my concerns about the keys siegfried said bertram nodded he reached out with his foot and pushed the stainlesssteel bucket back to its normal position he turned out the light in the examining room before following siegfried back into his office bertram opened the top drawer of the file cabinet and pulled out the isla francesca folder he unsnapped the securing elastic and pulled out the contents whats the matter siegfried asked bertram had hesitated as a compulsively neat individual he could not imagine having crammed everything into the folder so haphazardly fearing the worst it was with some relief that he lifted the stevenson bridge envelope and felt the lump made by the ring of keys chapter march pm new york city this is the damndest thing jack said he was peering into his microscope at one particular slide and had been doing so intently for the previous half hour chet had tried to talk with him but had given up when jack was concentrating it was impossible to get his attention im glad you are enjoying yourself chet said hed just stood up in preparation to leave and was about to heft his briefcase jack leaned back and shook his head everything about this case is screwy he looked up at chet and was surprised to see he had his coat on oh are you leaving yeah and ive been trying to say goodbye for the last fifteen minutes take a look at this before you go jack said he motioned toward his microscope as he pushed away from the desk to give chet room chet debated he checked his watch he was due at his gym for a seven oclock aerobics class hed had his eye on one of the girls who was a regular in an effort to build up the courage to approach her hed been taking the class himself the problem was that she was in far better shape than he so that at the end of the class he was always too winded to talk come on sport jack said give me your golden opinion chet let go of his briefcase leaned over and peered into the eyepieces of jacks microscope with no explanation from jack he first had to figure out what the tissue was so youre still looking at this frozen section of liver he said its been entertaining me all afternoon jack said why not wait for the regular fixed sections chet said these frozen sections are so limiting ive asked maureen to get them out as soon as she can jack said but meanwhile this is all i have what do you think of the area under the pointer chet played with the focus one of the many problems with frozen sections was they were often thick and the cellular architecture appeared fuzzy id say it looks like a granuloma chet said a granuloma was the cellular sign of chronic cellmediated inflammation that was my thought as well jack said now move the field over to the right it will show a part of the liver surface what do you see there chet did as he was told while worrying that if he was late to the gym there wouldnt be a spot in the aerobics class the instructor was one of the most popular i see what looks like a large scarred cyst chet said does it look at all familiar jack asked cant say it does chet said in fact id have to say it looks a little weird well said jack remarked now let me ask you a question chet raised his head and looked at his office mate jacks domed forehead was wrinkled with confusion does this look like a liver that youd expect to see in a relatively recent transplant hell no chet said id expect some acute inflammation but certainly not a granuloma especially if the process could be seen grossly as suggested by the collapsed surface cyst jack sighed thank you i was beginning to question my judgment its reassuring to hear youve come to the same conclusion knock knock a voice called out jack and chet looked up to see ted lynch the director of the dna lab standing in the doorway he was a big man almost in calvin washingtons league hed been an allamerican tackle for princeton before going on to graduate school i got some results for you jack ted said but im afraid its not what you want to hear so i thought id come down and tell you in person i know youve been thinking youve got a liver transplant here but the dq alpha was a perfect match suggesting it was the patients own liver jack threw up his hands i give up he said now there was still a chance it was a transplant ted said there are twentyone possible genotypes of the dq alpha sequence and the test fails to discriminate about seven percent of the time but i went ahead and ran the abo blood groups on chromosome nine and it was a perfect match as well combining the two results the chances are mighty slim its not the patients own liver im crushed jack said with his fingers intertwined he let his hands fall onto the top of his head i even called a surgeon friend of mine and asked if there would be any other reason to find sutures in the vena cava the hepatic artery and the biliary system he said no that it had to be a transplant what can i say ted commented of course for you id be happy to fudge the results he laughed and jack pretended to take a swipe at him with his hand jacks phone jangled insistently jack motioned for ted to stay while he picked up the receiver what he said rudely im out of here chet said he waved to jack and pushed past ted jack listened intently slowly his expression changed from exasperation to interest he nodded a few times as he glanced up at ted for teds benefit he held up a finger and mouthed one minute yeah sure jack said into the phone if unos suggests we try europe give it a try he glanced at his watch of course its the middle of the night over there but do what you can jack hung up the phone that was bart arnold he said ive had the entire forensics department searching for a missing recent liver transplant whats unos ted asked united national organ sharing jack said any luck ted asked nope jack said its baffling barts even checked with all the major centers doing liver transplants maybe it wasnt a transplant ted said im telling you the probability of my two tests matching by chance is very small indeed im convinced it was a transplant jack said theres no rhyme or reason to take out a persons liver and then put it back youre sure of course im sure jack said you seem committed to this case ted commented jack gave a short derisive laugh ive decided that im going to unravel this mystery come hell or high water he said if i cant ill lose respect for myself there just arent that many liver transplants i mean if i cant solve this one i might as well hang it up all right ted said ill tell you what i can do i can run a polymarker which compares areas on chromosome four six seven nine eleven and nineteen a chance match will be in the billions to one and for my own peace of mind ill even sequence the dq alpha on both the liver sample and the patient to try to figure out how they could have matched ill be appreciative whatever you can do jack said ill even go up and start tonight ted said that way i can have the results tomorrow what a sport jack said he put out his hand and ted slapped it after ted left jack switched off the light under his microscope he felt as if the slide had been mocking him with its puzzling details hed been looking at it for so long his eyes hurt for a few minutes jack sat at his desk and gazed at the clutter of unfinished cases folders were stacked in uneven piles even his own conservative estimate had the figure somewhere between twentyfive and thirty that was more than usual paperwork had never been jacks forte and it got worse when he became enmeshed in a particular case cursing under his breath from frustration at his own ineptitude jack pushed back from his desk and grabbed his bomber jacket from the hook on the back of his office door hed had as much sitting and thinking as he was capable of he needed some mindless hard exercise and his neighborhood basketball court was beckoning the view of the new york city skyline from the george washington bridge was breathtaking franco ponti tried to turn his head to appreciate it but it was difficult because of the rushhour traffic franco was behind the wheel of a stolen ford sedan on the way to englewood new jersey angelo facciolo was sitting in the front passenger seat staring out the windshield both men were wearing gloves get a load of the view to the left franco said look at all those lights you can see the whole freakin island even the statue of liberty yeah ive seen it already angelo said moodily whats the matter with you franco asked youre acting like youre on the rag i dont like this kind of job angelo said it reminds me of when cerino went berserk and sent me and tony ruggerio all over the goddamn city doing the same kind of shit we should stick to our usual work dealing with the usual people vinnie dominick is not pauli cerino franco said and whats so bad about picking up some easy extra cash the cash is fine angelo agreed its the risk i dont like what do you mean franco questioned theres no risk were professionals we dont take risks theres always the unexpected angelo said and as far as im concerned the unexpected has already occurred franco glanced over at angelos scarred face silhouetted in the half light of the cars interior he could tell that angelo was dead serious what are you talking about he questioned the fact that this laurie montgomery is involved angelo said she gives me nightmares tony and i tried to whack her but we couldnt it was like god was protecting her franco laughed in spite of angelos seriousness this laurie montgomery would be flattered that someone with your reputation has nightmares about her thats hilarious i dont find it funny at all angelo said dont get sore at me franco said besides shes hardly involved in what were doing here its related angelo said and she told vinnie amendola that shes going to make it her personal business to find out how we managed to get franconis body out of the morgue but how is she going to do that franco said and worse comes to worse we sent freddie capuso and richie herns to do the actual dirty work i think youre jumping to conclusions here oh yeah angelo questioned you dont know this woman shes one persistent bitch all right franco said with resignation you want to be bummed out fine by me as they reached the new jersey side of the bridge franco bore right onto the palisades interstate parkway with angelo insisting on sulking he reached over and turned on the radio after pushing a few buttons he found a station that played oldies but goodies turning up the volume up he sang sweet caroline along with neil diamond by the second refrain angelo leaned forward and turned off the radio you win he said ill cheer up if you promise not to sing you dont like that song franco questioned as if he were hurt its got such sweet memories for me he smacked his lips as if he were tasting it reminds me of making out with maria provolone im not going to touch that one angelo said laughing despite himself he appreciated working with franco ponti franco was a professional he also had a sense of humor which angelo knew he himself lacked franco exited the parkway onto palisades avenue passed route w and headed west down a long hill into englewood new jersey the environment quickly changed from franchise fastfood restaurants and service stations to upperclass suburban you got the map and the address handy franco asked i got it right here angelo said he reached up and turned on the map light were looking for overlook place he said it will be on the left overlook place was easy to find and five minutes later they were cruising along a winding treelined street the lawns that stretched up to the widely spaced houses were so expansive they looked like fairways on a golf course can you imagine living in a place like this franco commented his head swinging from side to side hell id get lost trying to find the street from my front door i dont like this angelo said its too peaceful were going to stick out like a sore thumb now dont get yourself all bent out of shape franco said at this point all were doing is reconnoitering what number are we looking for angelo consulted the piece of paper in his hand number eight overlook place that means its going to be on our left franco said they were just passing number twelve a few moments later franco slowed and pulled over to the right side of the road he and angelo stared up a serpentine driveway lined with carriage lamps to a massive tudorstyle house set against a backdrop of soaring pine trees most of the multipaned windows were aglow with light the property was the size of a football field looks like a goddamn castle angelo complained i must say its not what i was hoping for franco said well what are we going to do angelo asked we cant just sit here we havent seen a car since we pulled off the main drag back there franco put the car in gear he knew angelo was right they couldnt wait there someone would undoubtedly spot them become suspicious and call the police theyd already passed one of those stupid neighborhood watch signs with the silhouette of a guy wearing a bandana lets find out more about this sixteenyearold chick angelo said like where she goes to school what she likes to do and who are her friends we cant risk going up to the house no way franco grunted in agreement just as he was about to press on the accelerator he saw a tiny figure come out the front of the house from such a distance he couldnt tell if it was male or female somebody just came out he said i noticed angelo said the two men watched in silence as the figure descended a few stone stairs and then started down the driveway whoever it is is kind of fat franco said and they got a dog angelo said holy madonna franco said after a few moments its the girl i dont believe this angelo said do you think it really is cindy carlson im not used to things happening this easy astounded the two men watched as the girl continued down the driveway as if she were coming directly to greet them ahead of her walked a tiny caramelcolored toy poodle with its little pompom tail sticking straight up what should we do franco questioned he didnt expect an answer he was thinking out loud how about the police act angelo suggested it always worked for tony and me sounds good franco said he turned to angelo and stuck out his hand let me use your ozone park police badge angelo reached into the vest pocket of his brioni suit and handed over the walletlike badge cover you stay put for the moment franco said no reason to scare her right off the bat with that face of yours thanks for the compliment angelo said sourly angelo cared about his appearance and dressed to the nines in a vain attempt to compensate for his face which was severely scarred from a combination of chicken pox as a child severe acne as a teenager and thirddegree burns from an explosion five years previously ironically the explosion had been ignited thanks to laurie montgomery ah dont be so touchy franco teased he cuffed angelo on the back of the head you know we love you even though you look like you should be in a horror movie angelo fended off francos hand there were only two people he allowed even to make reference to his facial problem franco and his boss vinnie dominick still he didnt appreciate it the girl was now nearing the street she was dressed in a pink downfilled ski parka which only made her look heavier her facial features indented a puffy face with mild acne her hair was straight and parted down the middle she look anything like maria provolone angelo questioned to get in a dig at franco very funny franco said he reached for the door handle and got out of the car excuse me franco called out as sweetly as possible having smoked heavily from age eight he had a voice that normally had a harsh raspy quality could you by any chance be the popular cindy carlson maybe the teenager said who wants to know shed stopped at the foot of the driveway the dog lifted his leg against the gate post were police officers franco said he held up the badge so that the light from the streetlamp glinted off its polished surface were investigating several of the boys in town and we were told you might be able to help us really cindy questioned absolutely franco said please come over here so my colleague can talk to you cindy glanced up and down the street even though not a car had passed in the last five minutes she crossed the street pulling her dog whod been intently sniffing the base of an elm tree franco moved out of the way so that cindy carlson could bend over to look into the front seat of the car at angelo before a word was spoken franco pushed her into the car headfirst cindy let out a squeal but it was quickly smothered by angelo who wrestled her into the car franco swiftly yanked the leash out of cindys hand and shooed the dog away then he squeezed into the front seat crushing cindy against angelo he put the car in gear and drove away laurie had surprised herself after the delivery of the franconi videotape shed been able to redirect her attention to her paperwork shed worked efficiently and made significant progress there was now a gratifying stack of completed folders on the corner of her desk taking the remaining tray of histology slides she started on the final case which could be completed with the material and reports she had as she peered into her microscope to examine the first slide she heard a knock on her open door it was lou soldano what are you doing here so late lou asked he sat down heavily in the chair next to lauries desk he made no effort to take off his coat or hat which was tipped way back on his head laurie glanced at her watch my gosh she remarked i had no idea of the time i tried to call you at home as i was coming across the queensborough bridge lou said when i didnt get you i decided to stop here i had a sneaking suspicion youd still be at it you know you work too hard you should talk laurie said with playful sarcasm look at you when was the last time you got any sleep and im not talking about a catnap at your desk lets talk about more pleasant things lou suggested how about grabbing a bite to eat ive got to run down to headquarters to do about an hours worth of dictating then id love to go out someplace the kids are with their aunt god love her what do you say to some pasta are you sure youre up for going out laurie questioned the circles under lous dark eyes were touching his smile creases his stubble was more than a five oclock shadow laurie guessed it was at least two days worth i gotta eat lou said are you planning on working much longer im on my last case laurie said maybe another half hour you gotta eat too lou said have you made any progress in the franconi case laurie asked lou let out an exasperated puff of air i wish he said and the trouble is with these mob hits if you dont score quickly the trail cools mighty fast we havent gotten the break ive been hoping for im sorry laurie said thanks lou said how about you any more of an idea how franconis body got out of here that trail is about equally as cool laurie said calvin even gave me a reaming out for interrogating the night mortuary tech all i did was talk to the man im afraid administration just wants the episode to fade so jack was right about telling you to lay off lou said i suppose laurie reluctantly agreed but dont tell him that i wish the commissioner would let it fade lou said hell i might get demoted over this thing i did have one thought laurie said one of the funeral homes that picked up a body the night franconi disappeared is called spoletto its in ozone park somehow the name was familiar to me then i remembered that one of the more grisly murders of a young mobster took place there back during the cerino case do you think that its just a coincidence they happened to be making a pickup here the night franconi disappeared yeah lou said and ill tell you why im familiar with that funeral home from my years in queens fighting organized crime there is a loose and innocent connection by marriage with the spoletto funeral home and the new york crime establishment but its with the wrong family its with the lucia people not with the vaccarros who killed franconi oh well laurie said it was just a thought hey im not knocking your questioning it lou said your recall always impresses me im not sure i would have made the association anyway what about some dinner as tired as you look how about just coming over to my apartment for some spaghetti laurie suggested lou and laurie had become best of friends over the years after being thrust together on the cerino case five years previously theyd flirted with a romantic relationship but it hadnt worked out becoming friends had been a mutual decision in the years since they made it a point to have dinner together every couple of weeks you wouldnt mind lou asked the idea of kicking back on lauries couch sounded like heaven not at all laurie said in fact id prefer it ive got some sauce in the freezer and plenty of salad makings great lou said ill grab some chianti on my way downtown ill give you a call when im leaving headquarters perfect laurie said after lou had left laurie went back to her slide but lous visit had broken her concentration by reawakening the franconi business besides she was tired of looking through the microscope leaning back she rubbed her eyes damn it all she murmured she sighed and gazed up a at the cobwebbed ceiling every time she questioned how franconis body could have gotten out of the morgue she agonized anew she also felt guilty that she couldnt provide even a modicum of help to lou laurie got up and got her coat snapped shut her briefcase and walked out of her office but she didnt leave the morgue instead she went down for another visit to the mortuary office there was a question that was nagging her and which shed forgotten to ask marvin fletcher the evening mortuary tech the previous late afternoon she found marvin at his desk busily filling out the required forms for the scheduled pickups for that evening marvin was one of lauries favorite coworkers hed been on the day shift before bruce pomowskis tragic murder during the cerino affair after that event marvin had been switched to evenings it had been a promotion because the evening mortuary tech had a lot of responsibility hey laurie whats happening marvin said the moment he caught sight of her marvin was a handsome africanamerican with the most flawless skin laurie had ever seen it seemed to glow as if lit internally laurie chatted with marvin for a few minutes catching him up on the intraoffice gossip of the day before getting down to business marvin ive got to ask you something but i dont want you to feel defensive laurie couldnt help remembering mike passanos reaction to her questioning and she certainly didnt want marvin complaining to calvin about what marvin asked franconi laurie said i wanted to ask why you didnt xray the body what are you talking about marvin questioned just what i said laurie remarked there was no xray slip in the autopsy folder and there were no films down here with others when i looked prior to finding out that the body had disappeared i took x rays marvin said he acted hurt that laurie would suggest that he hadnt i always take x rays when a body comes in unless one of the doctors tells me otherwise then wheres the slip and where are the films laurie asked hey i dont know what happened to the slip marvin said but the films they went with doctor bingham bingham took them laurie questioned even that was odd yet she recognized that bingham probably was planning on doing the post the following morning he told me he was taking them up to his office marvin said what am i supposed to do tell the boss he cant take the x rays no way not this dude right of course laurie said vaguely she was preoccupied here was a new surprise x rays existed of franconis body of course it didnt matter much without the body itself but she wondered why shed not been told then again shed not seen bingham until after it was known that franconis body had been stolen well im glad i spoke to you laurie said coming out of her musing and i apologize for suggesting that youd forgotten to take the films hey its cool marvin said laurie was about to leave when she thought about the spoletto funeral home on a whim she asked marvin about it marvin shrugged what do you want to know he asked i dont know much ive never been there you know what im saying what are the people like who come here from the home laurie asked normal marvin said with another shrug ive probably only seen them a couple of times i mean i dont know what you want me to say laurie nodded it was a silly question i dont know why i asked laurie left the mortuary office and exited the morgue through the loading area onto thirtieth street it seemed to her that nothing about the franconi case was routine as laurie commenced walking south along first avenue another whim hit her suddenly the idea of visiting the spoletto funeral home seemed very appealing she hesitated for a second while considering the idea and then stepped out into the street to hail a cab where to lady the driver asked laurie could see from his hackney license that his name was michael neuman do you know where ozone park is laurie asked sure its over in queens michael said he was an older man who laurie guessed was in his late sixties he was sitting on a foam rubberstuffed pillow with a lot of foam rubber visible his backrest was constructed of wooden beads how long would it take to get there laurie asked if it was going to take hours she wouldnt do it michael made a questioning expression by compressing his lips while thinking not long he said vaguely traffics light in fact i was just out at kennedy airport and it was a breeze lets go laurie said as michael promised the trip took only a short time especially once they got on the van wyck expressway while they were traveling laurie found out that michael had been driving a cab for over thirty years he was a loquacious and opinionated man who also exuded a paternal charm would you know where gold road is in ozone park laurie asked she felt privileged to have found an experienced taxi driver shed remembered the address of the spoletto funeral home from the rolodex in the mortuary office the street name had stuck in her mind as making a metaphorical statement about the undertaking business gold road michael said no problem its a continuation of eightyninth street you looking for a house or what im looking for the spoletto funeral home laurie said ill have you there in no time michael said laurie sat back with a contented feeling only half listening to michaels nonstop chatter for the moment luck seemed to be on her side the reason shed decided to visit the spoletto funeral home was because jack had been wrong about it the home did have a mob connection and even though it was with the wrong family according to lou the fact that it was associated at all was suspicious to laurie true to his promise within a surprisingly short time michael pulled up to a threestoried white clapboard house wedged between several brick tenements it had greekstyle columns holding up the roof of a wide front porch a glazed internally lit sign in the middle of a postage stampsized lawn read spoletto funeral home a family business two generations of caring the establishment was in full operation lights were on in all the windows a few cigarette smokers were on the porch other people were visible through the groundfloor windows michael was about to terminate the meter when laurie spoke up would you mind waiting for me she asked im certain ill only be a few minutes and i imagine it would be hard catching a cab from here sure lady michael said no problem would you mind if i left my briefcase laurie asked theres absolutely nothing of value in it it will be safe just the same michael said laurie got out and started up the front walk feeling unnerved she could remember as if it were yesterday the case dr dick katzenburg had presented at the thursday afternoon conference five years earlier a man in his twenties had been essentially embalmed alive in the spoletto funeral home after having been involved in throwing battery acid in pauli cerinos face laurie shuddered but forced herself up the front steps she was never going to be completely free from the cerino affair the people smoking cigarettes ignored her soft organ music could be heard through the closed front door laurie tried the door it was unlocked and she walked in save for the music there was little sound the floors were heavily carpeted small groups of people were standing around the entrance hall but they conversed in hushed whispers to lauries left was a room full of elaborate coffins and urns on display to the right was a viewing room with people seated in folding chairs at the far end of the room was a coffin resting on a bed of flowers may i help you a soft voice enquired a thin man about lauries age with an ascetic face and sad features had come up to her he was dressed in black except for his white shirt he was obviously part of the staff to laurie he looked like her image of a puritan preacher are you here to pay respects to jonathan dibartolo the man asked no laurie said frank gleason excuse me the man enquired laurie repeated the name there was a pause and your name is the man asked dr laurie montgomery just one moment if you will the man said as he literally ducked away laurie looked around at the mourners this was a side of death that shed experienced only once it was when her brother had died from an overdose when he was nineteen and laurie was fifteen it had been a traumatic experience for her in all regards but especially since shed been the one who had found him dr montgomery a soft unctuous voice intoned im anthony spoletto i understand you are here to pay respects to mr frank gleason thats correct laurie said she turned to face a man also dressed in a black suit he was obese and as oily as his voice his forehead glistened in the soft incandescent light im afraid that will be impossible mr spoletto said i called this afternoon and was told he was on view laurie said yes of course mr spoletto said but that was this afternoon at the familys request this afternoons four pm to six pm viewing was to be the last i see laurie said nonplussed shed not had any particular plan in mind concerning her visit and had intended on viewing the body as a kind of jumpingoff place now that the body was not available she didnt know what to do perhaps i could just sign the register book anyway laurie said im afraid that too is impossible mr spoletto said the family has already taken it well i guess thats it laurie said with a limp gesture of her arms unfortunately returned mr spoletto would you know when the burial is planned laurie asked not at the moment mr spoletto said thank you laurie said not at all mr spoletto said he opened the door for laurie laurie walked out and got into the cab now where michael asked laurie gave her address on nineteenth street and leaned forward to look out at the spoletto funeral home as the taxi pulled away it had been a wasted trip or had it after shed been talking with mr spoletto for a moment shed realized that his forehead wasnt oily the man had been perspiring despite the temperature inside the funeral parlor being decidedly on the cool side laurie scratched her head wondering if that meant anything or if it were just another example of her grabbing at straws was it a friend michael asked was who a friend the deceased michael said laurie let out a little mirthless laugh hardly she said i know what you mean michael said looking at laurie in the rearview mirror relationships today are very complicated and ill tell you why it is laurie smiled as she settled back to listen she loved philosophical taxi drivers and michael was a regular plato of his profession when the cab pulled up outside lauries building laurie saw a familiar figure in the foyer it was lou soldano slouched over against the mailboxes clutching a bottle of wine in a straw basket laurie paid michael the fare along with a generous tip then hurried inside im sorry laurie offered i thought you were going to call before you came over lou blinked as if hed been asleep i did he said after a brief coughing spree i got your answering machine so i left the message that i was on my way laurie glanced at her watch as she unlocked the inner door shed only been gone for a little over an hour which was what shed expected i thought you were only going to work for another half hour lou said i wasnt working laurie said as she called for the elevator i took a trip out to the spoletto funeral home lou frowned now dont give me extra grief laurie said as they boarded the elevator so what did you find franconi lying in state lou asked sarcastically im not going to tell you a thing if youre going to act that way laurie complained okay im sorry lou said i didnt find anything laurie admitted the body i went to see was no longer on view the family had cut it off at six pm the elevator opened while laurie struggled with her locks lou curtsied for debra engler whose door opened against its chain as usual but the director acted a little suspicious laurie said at least i think he did how so lou asked as they entered lauries apartment tom came running out of the bedroom to purr and rub against lauries leg laurie put her briefcase on the small half moonshaped hall console table in order to bend down to scratch tom vigorously behind his ear he was perspiring while i was talking with him laurie said lou paused with his coat half off is that all he asked the man was perspiring yes thats it laurie said she knew what lou was thinking it was written all over his face did he start perspiring after you asked him difficult and incriminating questions about franconis body lou asked or was he perspiring before you began talking with him before laurie admitted lou rolled his eyes whoa another sherlock holmes incarnate he said maybe you should take over my job i dont have your powers of intuition and inductive reasoning you promised not to give me grief laurie said i never promised lou said all right it was a wasted trip laurie said lets get some food im starved lou switched the bottle of wine from one hand to the other allowing him to swing his arm out of his trench coat when he did he clumsily knocked lauries briefcase to the floor the impact caused it to spring open and scatter the contents the crash terrified the cat who disappeared back into the bedroom after a desperate struggle to gain traction on the highly polished wood floor what a klutz lou said im sorry he bent down to retrieve the papers pens microscope slides and other paraphernalia and bumped into laurie in the process maybe its best you just sit down laurie suggested with a laugh no i insist lou said after theyd gotten most of the contents back into the briefcase lou picked up the videotape whats this your favorite xrated feature hardly laurie commented lou turned it over to read the label the franconi shooting he questioned cnn sent you this outoftheblue laurie straightened up no i requested it i was going to use the tape to corroborate the findings when i did the autopsy i thought it could make an interesting paper to show how reliable forensics can be mind if i look at it lou asked of course not laurie said didnt you see it on tv along with everyone else lou said but it would still be interesting to see the tape im surprised you dont have a copy at police headquarters laurie said hey maybe we do lou said i just havent seen it man this aint your night warren teased jack you must be getting too old jack had decided when hed gotten to the playground late and had had to wait to get into the game that he was going to win no matter whom he was teamed up with but it didnt happen in fact jack lost every game he played in because warren and spit had gotten on the same team and neither could miss their team had won every game including the last which had just been capped off with a sweet give and go that gave spit an easy final layup jack walked over to the sidelines on rubbery legs hed played his heart out and was perspiring profusely he pulled a towel from where hed jammed it into the chainlink fence and wiped his face he could feel his heart pounding in his chest come on man warren teased from the edge of the court where he was dribbling a basketball back and forth between his legs one more run well let you win this time yeah sure jack called back you never let nobody win nothing jack made it a point to adapt his syntax for the environment im outa here warren sauntered over and hooked one of his ringers through the fence and leaned against it whats up with your shortie he asked natalies been driving me up the wall asking questions about her since we havent seen nothing of you guys you know what im saying jack looked at warrens sculpted face to add insult to injury as far as jack was concerned warren wasnt even perspiring nor was he breathing particularly heavily and to make matters worse hed been playing before jack had arrived the only evidence of exertion was a tiny triangle of sweat down the front of his cutoff sweatshirt reassure natalie that lauries fine jack said she and i were just taking a little vacation from each other it was mostly my fault i just wanted to cool things down a bit i hear you warren said i was with her last night jack added and things are looking up she was asking me about you and natalie so you werent alone warren nodded you sure youre finished or do you want to run one more im finished jack said take care man warren said as he pushed off the fence then he yelled out to the others lets run you bad asses jack shook his head in dismay as he watched warren amble away he was envious of the mans stamina warren truly wasnt tired jack pulled on his sweatshirt and started for home hed not won a single game and although during the play the inability to win had seemed overwhelmingly frustrating now it didnt matter the exercise had cleared his mind and for the hour and a half hed played he hadnt thought about work but jack wasnt even all the way across th street when the tantalizing mystery of his floater began troubling him again as he climbed his refusestrewn stairs he wondered if there was a chance that ted had made a mistake with the dna analysis as far as jack was concerned the victim had had a transplant jack was rounding the thirdfloor landing when he heard the telltale sound of his phone he knew it was his because denise the single mother of two who lived on his floor didnt have a phone with some effort jack encouraged his tired quadriceps to propel him up the final flight clumsily he fumbled with his keys at his door the moment he got it open he heard his answering machine pick up with a voice that jack refused to believe was his own he got to the phone and snatched it up cutting himself off in midsentence hello he gasped after an hour and a half of fullcourt allout basketball the dash up the final flight of stairs had put him close to collapse dont tell me youre just coming in from your basketball laurie said its going on nine oclock thats way off your schedule i didnt get home until after seventhirty jack explained between breaths he wiped his face to keep his perspiration from dripping on the floor that means you havent eaten yet laurie said you got that right jack said lou is over here and we were going to have salad and spaghetti laurie said why dont you join us i wouldnt want to break up the party jack said jokingly at the same time he felt a mild stab of jealousy he knew about lauries and lous brief romantic involvement and half wondered if the two friends were starting something up jack knew he had no right to such feelings considering the ambivalence he had about becoming involved with any woman after the loss of his family hed been unsure if he ever wanted to make himself vulnerable to such pain again at the same time hed come to admit both his loneliness and how much he enjoyed lauries company you wont be breaking up any party laurie assured him its going to be a very very casual dinner but we have something we want to show you something that is going to surprise you and maybe even make you want to give yourself a boot in the rear end as you can probably tell were pretty excited oh jack questioned his mouth had gone dry hearing lou laughing in the background and putting two and two together jack knew what they wanted to show him it had to be a ring lou must have proposed are you coming laurie asked its kind of late jack said ive got to shower hey you old sawbones lou said hed snatched the phone from laurie get your ass over here laurie and i are dying to share this with you okay jack said with resignation ill jump in the shower and be there in forty minutes see ya dude lou said jack hung up the phone dude he mumbled that didnt sound like lou jack mused that the detective must be on cloud nine i wish i knew what i could do to cheer you up darlene said shed made the effort to put on a slinky silk teddy from victorias secret but raymond hadnt even noticed raymond was stretched out on the sofa with an ice pack on his head and his eyes closed are you sure you dont want anything to eat darlene asked she was a tall woman over five feet ten with bleached blond hair and a curvaceous body she was twentysix years old and as she and raymond joked halfway to his fiftytwo shed been a fashion model before raymond had met her in a cosy east side bar called the auction house raymond slowly took his ice pack off and glared at darlene her bubbly vivaciousness was only an irritation my stomach is in a knot he said deliberately im not hungry is that so difficult to understand well i dont know why you are so upset darlene persisted you just got a call from the doctor in los angeles and shes decided to come on board that means well soon have some movie stars as clients i think we should celebrate raymond replaced the ice pack and closed his eyes the problems havent been about the business side thats all been going like clockwork its these unexpected snafus like franconi and now kevin marshall raymond was loath to explain about cindy carlson in fact hed been trying to avoid even thinking about the girl himself why are you still worried about franconi darlene asked that problem has been taken care of listen raymond said trying to be patient maybe it would be best if you go watch some tv and let me suffer in peace how about some toast or a little cereal darlene asked leave me alone raymond shouted hed sat up suddenly and was clutching his ice pack in his hand his eyes were bulging and his face was flushed okay i can tell when im not wanted darlene pouted as she was leaving the room the phone rang she looked back at raymond want me to get it she asked raymond nodded and told her to take the call in the study he also said that if the call was for him she should be vague about where he was since he wasnt up to talking with anyone darlene reversed her direction and disappeared into the study raymond breathed a sigh of relief and put the ice pack back on his head lying back he tried to relax he was just getting comfortable when darlene returned its the intercom not the phone she said theres a man downstairs who wants to see you his name is franco ponti and he said it was important i told him that id see if you were here what do you want me to say raymond sat back up with a new jolt of anxiety for a moment he couldnt place the name but he didnt like the sound of it then it hit him it was one of vinnie dominicks men whod accompanied the mobster to the apartment the previous morning well darlene questioned raymond swallowed loudly ill talk to him raymond reached behind the couch and picked up the telephone extension he tried to sound authoritative when he said hello howdy doc franco said i was going to be disappointed if you hadnt been at home im about to go to bed raymond said its rather late for you to be calling my apologies for the hour franco said but angelo facciolo and i have something wed like to show you why dont we do this tomorrow raymond said say between nine and ten it cant wait franco said come on doc dont give us a hard time its vinnie dominicks express wish that you become intimately acquainted with our services raymond struggled to come up with an excuse to avoid going downstairs but given his headache nothing came to mind two minutes franco said thats all im asking im awfully tired raymond said im afraid hold on doc franco said listen i have to insist you come down here or youre going to be very sorry i hope im making myself clear all right raymond said recognizing the inevitable he was not naive enough to believe that vinnie dominick and his people made idle threats ill be right down raymond went to the hall closet and got his coat darlene was amazed youre going out it appears that i dont have a lot of choice raymond said i suppose i should be happy theyre not demanding to come inside as raymond descended in the elevator he tried to calm himself but it was difficult since his headache had only gotten worse this unexpected unwanted visit was just the kind of turn that was making his life miserable he had no idea what these people wanted to show him although he guessed it had something to do with how they were going to deal with cindy carlson good evening doc franco said as raymond appeared sorry to trouble you lets just make this short raymond said sounding more confident than he felt it will be short and sweet trust me franco said if you dont mind he pointed up the street where the ford sedan had been pulled to the curb next to a fire hydrant angelo was halfsitting halfleaning against the trunk smoking a cigarette raymond followed franco to the car angelo responded by straightening up and stepping to the side we just want you to take a quick look in the trunk franco said he reached the car and keyed the luggage compartment come right over here so you can see the lights not so good raymond stepped between the ford and the car behind it literally inches away from the trunks lid as franco raised it in the next second raymond thought his heart had stopped the instant he glimpsed the ghoulish sight of cindy carlsons dead body crammed into the trunk there was a flash of light raymond staggered back he felt sick with the image of the obese girls porcelain face imprinted in his brain and dizzy from the flash of light which he quickly realized was from a polaroid camera franco closed the trunk and wiped his hands howd the picture come out he asked angelo gotta wait a minute angelo said he was holding the edges of the photo as it was developing just a second longer franco said to raymond raymond involuntarily moaned under his breath while his eyes scanned the immediate area he was terrified anybody else had seen the corpse looks good angelo said he handed the picture to franco who agreed franco reached out with the photo so raymond could see it id say thats your best side franco said raymond swallowed the picture accurately depicted his shocked terror as well as the awful image of the dead girl franco pocketed the picture there thats it doc he said i told you we wouldnt need a lot of your time why did you do this raymond croaked it was vinnies idea franco said he thought it best to have a record of the favor hed done for you just in case in case of what raymond asked franco spread his hands in case of whatever franco and angelo got into the car raymond stepped up onto the sidewalk he watched until the ford had gone to the corner and disappeared good lord raymond murmured he turned and headed back to his door on unsteady legs every time he solved one problem another emerged the shower had revived jack since laurie had not included any injunction about riding his bike this time jack decided to ride he cruised south at a good clip given the bad experiences hed had in the park the previous year he stayed on central park west all the way to columbus circle from columbus circle jack shot across fiftyninth street to park avenue at that time of the evening park avenue was a dream and he took it all the way to lauries street he secured his bike with his collection of locks and went to lauries door before ringing her bell he took a moment to compose himself determining how best to act and what to say laurie met him at the door with a wide grin on her face before he could even say a word she threw her free arm around his neck to give him a hug in her other hand she was balancing a glass of wine uhoh she said stepping back she eyed the wild state of his closecropped hair i forgot about the bike issue dont tell me you rode down here jack shrugged guiltily well at least you made it laurie said she unzipped his leather jacket and peeled it off his back jack could see lou sitting on the sofa with a grin that rivaled the cheshire cats laurie took jacks arm and pulled him into the living room do you want the surprise first or do you want to eat first she asked lets have the surprise jack said good lou said he bounded off the couch and went to the tv laurie guided jack to the spot lou had just vacated do you want a glass of wine jack nodded he was confused he hadnt seen any ring and lou was intently studying the vcr remote laurie disappeared into the kitchen but was soon back with jacks wine i dont know how to do this lou complained at home my daughter runs the vcr laurie took the remote then told lou that he had to turn on the tv first jack took a sip of the wine it wasnt much better than what hed brought the previous night laurie and lou joined jack on the couch jack looked from one to the other but they were ignoring him they were intently watching the tv screen whats this surprise jack asked just watch laurie said pointing toward the electronic snow on the tv more confused than ever jack looked at the screen all of a sudden there was music and the cnn logo followed by the image of a moderately obese man coming out of a manhattan restaurant jack recognized as positano the man was surrounded by a group of people should i put on the sound laurie asked nah its not necessary lou said jack watched the sequence when it was over he looked at laurie and lou both had huge smiles what is going on here jack questioned how much wine have you two been drinking do you recognize what youve just seen laurie asked id say it was somebody getting shot jack said its carlo franconi laurie said after watching it does it remind you of anything sort of reminds me of those old tapes of lee harvey oswald getting shot jack said show it to him again lou suggested jack watched the sequence for the second time he divided his attention between the screen and watching laurie and lou they were captivated after the second runthrough laurie again turned to jack and said well jack shrugged i dont know what you want me to say let me run certain sections in slow motion laurie said she used the remote to isolate the sequence to where franconi was about to climb into the limo she ran it in slow motion and then stopped it exactly at the moment he was shot she walked up to the screen and pointed at the base of the mans neck theres the entry point she said using the remote again she advanced to the moment of the next impact when the victim was falling to his right well ill be damned jack remarked with astonishment my floater might be carlo franconi laurie spun around from facing the tv her eyes were blazing exactly she said triumphantly obviously we havent proved it yet but with the entrance wounds and the paths of the bullets in the floater id be willing to bet five dollars whoa jack commented ill take you up on a fivedollar wager but i want to remind you thats a hundred percent higher than any bet youve ever made in my presence im that sure laurie said laurie is so fast at making associations said lou she picked up on the similarities right away she always makes me feel stupid get out of here laurie said giving lou a friendly shove is this the surprise you guys wanted to tell me about jack asked cautiously he didnt want to get his hopes up yes laurie said whats the matter arent you as excited as we are jack laughed with relief oh im just tickled pink i can never tell when you are serious laurie said she detected a certain amount of jacks typical sarcasm in his reply its the best news ive heard in days jack added maybe weeks all right lets not overdo it laurie said she turned off the tv and the vcr enough of the surprise lets eat over dinner the conversation turned to why no one even considered that the floater might be franconi for me it was the shotgun wound laurie said which i knew franconi didnt have also i was thrown off by the bodys being found way out off coney island now if it had been fished out of the east river it might have been a different story i suppose i was thrown off for the same reasons jack said and then when i realized the shotgun wound was postmortem i was already engrossed in the issue about the liver by the way lou did franconi have a liver transplant not that i know of lou said hed been sick for a number of years but i never knew the diagnosis i hadnt heard anything about a liver transplant if he didnt have a liver transplant then the floater isnt franconi jack said even though the dna lab is having a hard time confirming it im personally convinced the floater has a donated liver what else can you people do to confirm that the floater and franconi are the same person lou asked we can request a blood sample from the mother laurie said comparing the mitochondrial dna which all of us inherit only from our mothers we could tell right away if the floater is franconi im sure the mother will be agreeable since shed been the one to come to identify the body initially too bad an x ray wasnt taken when franconi came in jack said that would have done it but there was an x ray laurie said with excitement i just found out this evening marvin had taken one where the hell did it go jack asked marvin said that bingham took it laurie said it must be in his office then i suggest we make a little foray to the morgue jack said id like to settle this issue binghams office will be locked laurie said i think this situation calls for some creative action jack said amen lou said this might be that break ive been hoping for as soon as they had finished eating and cleaning up the kitchen which jack and lou had insisted on doing the three took a cab down to the morgue they entered through the receiving dock and went directly into the mortuary office my god marvin commented when he saw both jack and laurie it was rare for two medical examiners to show up at the same time during the evening has there been a natural disaster where are the janitors jack asked in the pit last time i looked marvin asked seriously whats up an identity crisis jack quipped jack led the others to the autopsy room and cracked the door marvin had been right both janitors were busy mopping the expansive terrazzo floor i assume you guys have keys to the chiefs office jack said yeah sure daryl foster said daryl had been working for the medical examiners office for almost thirty years his partner jim odonnel was a relatively new employee weve got to get in there jack said would you mind opening it daryl hesitated the chiefs kinda sensitive about people being in his office he said ill take responsibility jack said this is an emergency besides we have lieutenant detective soldano with us from the police department who will keep our thievery to a minimum i dont know daryl said he was obviously uncomfortable as well as unimpressed with jacks humor then give me the key jack said he stuck out his hand that way you wont be involved with obvious reluctance daryl removed two keys from his key chain and handed them to jack ones for the outer office and one is for dr binghams inner office ill have them back for you in five minutes jack said daryl didnt respond i think the poor guy was intimidated lou commented as the three rose up to the first floor in the elevator once jack is on a mission look out laurie said bureaucracy irks me jack said theres no excuse for the x ray to be squirreled away in the chiefs office in the first place jack opened the front offices outer door and then dr binghams inner door he turned on the lights the office was large with a big desk beneath high windows to the left and a large library table to the right teaching paraphernalia including a blackboard and an xray view box were at the head of the table where should we look laurie asked i was hoping theyd just be on that view box jack said but i dont see them i tell you what ill take the desk and the file cabinet you look around the view box fine laurie said what do you want me to do lou asked you just stand there and make sure we dont steal anything jack scoffed jack pulled out several of the file drawers but closed them quickly the fullbody x rays that were taken by the morgue came in large folders it wasnt something easily hidden this looks promising laurie called out shed found a stash of x rays in the cabinet directly under the view box lifting the folders out onto the library table she scanned the names she found franconis and pulled them free of the others returning to the basement level jack got the x rays of the floater and took both folders back to the autopsy room he gave binghams office keys to daryl and thanked him daryl merely nodded okay everybody jack said walking over to the view box the critical moment has arrived first he slipped up franconis x rays and then the headless floaters what do you know jack said after only a seconds inspection i owe laurie five dollars laurie gave a cry of triumph as jack gave her the money lou scratched his head and leaned closer to the light box to stare at the films how can you guys tell so quickly he asked jack pointed out the lumpy shadows of the bullets almost obscured by the mass of shotgun pellets in the floaters x rays and showed how they corresponded to the bullets on the franconi films then he pointed to identical healed clavicular fractures that appeared on the x rays of the two bodies this is great lou said rubbing his hands together with enthusiasm that almost matched lauries now that we have a corpus delicti we might be able to make some headway in this case and ill be able to figure out what the hells going on concerning this guys liver jack said and maybe ill go on a shopping spree with my money laurie said giving the fivedollar bill a kiss but not until i figure out the how and the why this body left here in the first place unable to sleep despite having taken two sleeping pills raymond slipped out of bed so as not to disturb darlene not that he was terribly worried darlene was such a sound sleeper that the ceiling could fall in without her so much as moving raymond padded into the kitchen and turned on the light he wasnt hungry but he thought that perhaps a little warm milk might help to settle his roiling stomach ever since the shock of having been forced to view the terrible sight in the trunk of the ford hed been suffering with heartburn hed tried maalox pepcid ac and finally peptobismol nothing had helped raymond was not handy in the kitchen mainly because he didnt know where anything was located consequently it took him some time to heat the milk and find an appropriate glass when it was ready he carried it into his study and sat at his desk after taking a few sips he noticed that it was threefifteen in the morning despite the fuzziness in his brain from the sleeping pills he was able to figure out that at the zone it was after nine a good time to call siegfried spallek the connection was almost instantaneous at that hour phone traffic with north america was at a minimum aurielo answered promptly and put raymond through to the director you are up early siegfried commented i was going to call you in four or five hours i couldnt sleep raymond said whats going on over there whats the problem with kevin marshall i believe the problem is over siegfried said siegfried summarized what had happened and gave credit to bertram edwards for alerting him about kevin so that he could be followed he said that kevin and his friends had been given such a scare that they wouldnt dare go near the island again what do you mean friends raymond asked kevin has always been such a loner he was with the reproductive technologist and one of the surgical nurses siegfried said frankly even that surprised us since hes always been such a schlemiel or what do you americans call such a socially inept person a nerd raymond said thats it siegfried said and presumably the stimulus for this attempted visit to the island was the smoke thats been bothering him thats what bertram edwards says siegfried said and bertram had a good idea were going to tell kevin that weve had a work crew our there building a bridge over the stream that divides the island in two but you havent raymond said of course not siegfried said the last work crew we had out there was when we built the landing for the extension bridge to the mainland of course bertram had some people there when he moved those hundred cages out there i dont know anything about cages on the island raymond said what are you talking about bertram has been lobbying lately to give up on the island isolation idea siegfried said he thinks that the bonobos should be brought to the animal center and somehow hidden i want them to stay on the island raymond said emphatically that was the agreement i worked out with gensys they could shut the program down if we bring the animals in theyre paranoid about publicity i know siegfried said thats exactly what i told bertram he understands but wants to leave the cages there just in case i dont see any harm in that in fact it is good to be prepared for unexpected contingencies raymond ran a nervous hand through his hair he didnt want to hear about any unexpected contingencies i was going to ask you how you wanted us to handle kevin and the women siegfried said but with this explanation about the smoke and having given them a good scare i think the situation is under control they didnt get onto the island did they raymond asked no they were only at the staging area siegfried said i dont even like people nosing around there raymond said i understand siegfried said i dont think kevin will go back for the reasons ive given but just to be on the safe side im leaving a moroccan guard and a contingent of the equatoguinean soldiers out there for a few days provided you think its a good idea thats fine raymond said but tell me whats your feeling about smoke coming out of the island assuming that kevin is right about it me siegfried questioned i couldnt care less what those animals do out there as long as they stay there and stay healthy does it bother you not in the slightest raymond said maybe we should send over a bunch of soccer balls siegfried said that might keep them entertained he laughed heartily i hardly think this is a laughing matter raymond said irritably raymond was not fond of siegfried although he appreciated his disciplined managerial style raymond could picture the director at his desk surrounded by his stuffed menagerie and those skulls dotting his desk when are you coming for the patient siegfried asked ive been told hes doing fantastically well and ready to go so ive heard raymond said i put in a call to cambridge and as soon as the gensys plane is available ill be over it should be in a day or so let me know siegfried said ill have a car waiting for you in bata raymond replaced the receiver and breathed a small sigh of relief he was glad hed called africa since part of his current anxiety had stemmed from siegfrieds disturbing message about there being a problem with kevin it was good to know the crisis had been taken care of in fact raymond thought that if he could just get the image of that snapshot of him hovering over cindy carlsons body out of his mind hed feel almost like himself again chapter march noon cogo equatorial guinea kevin was totally unaware of the time when a knock interrupted the intense concentration hed been directing toward his computer screen for several hours he opened his laboratory door and was promptly greeted by melanie as she swooped into the room she was carrying a large paper bag where are your techs she asked i gave them the day off kevin said there was no way i was going to get any work done today so i told them to enjoy the sun its been a long rainy season and it will be back before we know it wheres candace melanie asked she put down her parcel on the lab bench i dont know kevin said i havent seen or talked with her since we dropped her off at the hospital this morning it had been a long night after having hid in the pathology cooler for over an hour melanie had talked both kevin and candace into sneaking up to the oncall room melanie had at the animal center the three had stayed there getting very little sleep until the earlymorning shift change blending in with all the employees coming and going the group had made it back to cogo without incident do you know how to get in touch with her melanie asked i guess just call the hospital and have her paged kevin suggested unless shes in her room in the inn which is what id guess since horace winchester is doing so well the inn was the name given to the temporary quarters for transient hospital personnel it was physically part of the hospitallaboratory complex good point melanie said she picked up the phone and had the operator put her through to candaces room candace answered on the third ring it was apparent shed been asleep kevin and i are going to the island melanie said without preamble you want to come or hang in here what are you talking about kevin asked nervously melanie motioned for him to be quiet when candace asked as soon as you get over here melanie said were in kevins lab it will take me a good half hour candace said ive got to shower well be waiting melanie said she hung up the phone melanie are you crazy kevin said weve got to let some time go by before we hazard another try at the island this girl doesnt think so melanie said giving herself a poke in the chest the sooner we go the better if bertram finds out a key is missing he could change the lock and well be back to square one besides like i said last night they expect us to be terrified going out there right away will catch them offguard i dont think im up for this kevin said oh really melanie questioned superciliously hey youre the one whos brought up this worry about what weve created and now im really worried i saw some more circumstantial evidence this morning like what kevin asked i went into the bonobo enclosure out at the animal center melanie said i made sure no one saw me go in so dont get yourself all worked up it took me over an hour but i managed to find a mother with one of our infants and kevin questioned he wasnt sure he wanted to hear the rest the infant walked around on its hindlegsjust like you and ithe whole time i was able to observe melanie said her dark eyes flashed with emotion akin to anger behavior we used to call cute is definitely bipedal kevin nodded and looked away he found melanies intensity unnerving and her conversation was underlining all his own fears we have to find out for sure what the status is of these creatures melanie said and we can do that only by going out there kevin nodded so i made some sandwiches melanie said pointing toward the paper bag shed brought in with her well call it a picnic i came across something disturbing this morning as well kevin said let me show you he grabbed a stool and pushed it over to his computer terminal he motioned for melanie to sit down while he took his own chair his fingers played over the keyboard soon the screen displayed the computer graphic of isla francesca i programmed the computer to follow all seventythree bonobos on the island for several hours of realtime activity kevin explained then i had the data condensed so i could watch it in fastforward look what resulted kevin clicked his mouse to start the sequence the multitude of little red dots rapidly traced out weird geometric designs it only took a few seconds looks like a bunch of chicken scratches melanie said except for these two dots kevin said he pointed to two pinpoints they apparently didnt move much melanie said exactly kevin said creature number sixty and creature number sixtyseven kevin reached over and picked up the detailed contour map hed inadvertently taken from bertrams office i located creature number sixty to a marshy clearing just south of lago hippo according to the map there are no trees there whats your explanation melanie asked hang on kevin said what i did next was reduce the scale of the grid so that it represented a fiftybyfiftyfoot portion of the island right where creature number sixty was located let me show you what happened kevin keyed in the information and then clicked to start the sequence again once again the red light for creature number sixty was a pinpoint he didnt move at all melanie said im afraid not kevin said you think hes sleeping in the middle of the morning kevin asked and with such a scale even turning over in his sleep should result in some movement the system is that sensitive if hes not sleeping what is he doing melanie asked kevin shrugged i dont know maybe he found a way to remove his computer chip i never thought of that melanie said thats a scary idea the only other thing i could think of is the bonobo died kevin said i suppose thats a possibility melanie said but i dont think it is very probable those are young extraordinarily healthy animals weve made sure of that and they are in an environment without natural enemies and have more than enough food kevin sighed whatever it is it is disturbing and when we go out there i think we should check it out i wonder if bertram knows about this melanie asked it doesnt bode well for the program in general i suppose i should tell him kevin said lets wait until we make our visit melanie said obviously kevin said did you come across anything else with this realtime program yup kevin said i pretty much confirmed my earlier suspicion they are using the caves watch kevin changed the coordinates of the displayed grid on the computer screen to correspond to a specific portion of the limestone escarpment he then asked the computer to trace the activity of his own double creature number one melanie watched as the red dot traced a geometric shape then disappeared it then reappeared at the identical spot and traced a second shape then a similar sequence repeated itself for a third time i guess id have to agree melanie said it sure looks like your double is going in and out of the rock face when we go out there i think we should make it a point to see our doubles kevin said they are the oldest of the creatures and if any of the transgenic bonobos are acting like protohumans it should be them melanie nodded the idea effacing my double gives me the creeps but were not going to have a lot of time out there and given the twelvesquaremile island it will be extraordinarily difficult for us to find a specific creature youre wrong kevin said ive got the instruments they use for retrievals he got up from the computer and went to his desk when he returned he was carrying the locator and the directional beacon that bertram had given to him he showed the apparatuses to melanie and explained their use melanie was impressed where is that girl melanie asked as she checked her watch i wanted to get this island visit over during lunch hour did siegfried talk to you this morning kevin asked no bertram did melanie said he acted really mad and said he was disappointed in me can you imagine i mean is that suppose to break me up or what did he give you any explanation about the smoke ive seen kevin asked oh yeah melanie said he went on at length how hed just been told that siegfried had a work crew out there building a bridge and burning trash he said it was being done without his knowledge i thought so kevin said siegfried called me over just after nine he gave me the same story he even told me hed just talked with dr lyons and that dr lyons was disappointed in us as well its enough to make you cry melanie said i dont think he was telling the truth about the work crew kevin said of course he wasnt melanie said i mean bertram makes it a point to know everything thats going on about isla francesca it makes you wonder if they think we were born yesterday kevin stood up fidgeted and stared out his window at the distant island whats wrong now melanie questioned siegfried kevin said he looked back at melanie about his warning to apply equatoguinean law to us he reminded us that going to the island could be considered a capital offense dont you think we should take that threat seriously hell no melanie said how can you be so sure kevin said siegfried scares me hed scare me too if i was an equatoguinean melanie said but were not were americans while were here in the zone good old american law applies to us the worst thing that can happen is we get fired and as i said last night im not sure i wouldnt welcome it manhattan is sounding awfully good to me these days i wish i felt as confident as you kevin said has your playing around with the computer this morning confirmed that the bonobos are remaining in two groups kevin nodded the first group is the largest and stays around the caves it includes most of the older bonobos including your double and mine the other group is in a forest area on the north side of the rio diviso its composed mostly of younger animals although the third oldest is with them thats raymond lyonss double very curious melanie said hi everybody candace called out while coming through the door without knocking howd i do timewise i didnt even blowdry my hair instead of her normal french twist her damp hair was combed back straight off her forehead you did great melanie assured her and you were the only smart one to get some sleep i have to admit im exhausted did siegfried spallek get in touch with you kevin asked at about ninethirty candace said he woke me up out of a sound sleep i hope i made sense what did he say kevin asked he was very nice actually candace said he even apologized for what happened last night he also had an explanation about the smoke coming from the island he said it was from a work crew burning brush we got the same message kevin said whats your take on it candace asked we dont buy it melanie said its too convenient i sort of assumed as much candace said melanie grabbed her paper bag lets get this show on the road do you have the key kevin questioned he picked up the locator and the directional beacon of course i have the key melanie said as they went out the door melanie told candace shed brought some lunch for them great candace said im famished hold on a second kevin said when they reached the stairs something just dawned on me we must have been followed yesterday thats the only way i can explain the way they surprised us of course that really means i must have been followed since i was the one who talked about the smoke situation with bertram edwards thats a good point melanie said the three people stared at each other for a moment what should we do candace asked we dont want to be followed the first thing is that we shouldnt use my car kevin said wheres yours melanie with this dry weather we can manage without fourwheel drive downstairs in the parking lot melanie said i just drove in from the animal center was anybody following you who knows melanie said i wasnt watching hmmm kevin pondered i still think theyll be following me if they follow anybody so melanie go down and get in your car and head home what will you guys do theres a tunnel in the basement that goes all the way out to the power station wait about five minutes at your house and pick us up at the power station theres a side door that opens directly onto the parking lot you know where i mean i think so melanie said all right kevin said see you there they split up at the first floor with melanie going out into the noonday heat while candace and kevin descended to the basement level after walking for fifteen minutes candace commented on what a maze the hallways were all the power comes from the same source kevin explained the tunnels connect all the main buildings except for the animal center which has its own power station one could get lost down here candace said i did kevin admitted a number of times but during the middle of the rainy season i find these tunnels handy theyre both dry and cool as they neared the power station they could hear and feel the vibration of the turbines a flight of metal steps took them up to the side door as soon as they appeared melanie whod been parked under a malapa tree cruised over and picked them up kevin got in the back so candace could climb into the front melanie pulled away immediately the cars airconditioning felt good given the heat and hundredpercent humidity see anything suspicious kevin asked not a thing melanie said and i drove around for a while pretending i was on errands there wasnt anyone following me im ninetynine percent sure kevin looked out the back window of melanies honda and watched the area around the power station as it fell behind then disappeared as they rounded a corner no people had appeared and there were no cars in pursuit id say it looks good kevin said he scrunched down on the backseat to be out of sight melanie drove around the north rim of the town while she did so candace broke out the sandwiches not bad candace said taking a bite of a tuna fish on whole wheat i had them made up at the animalcenter commissary melanie explained there are drinks in the bottom of the bag you want some kevin candace called i suppose kevin said he stayed on his side candace passed him a sandwich and a soft drink between the front bucket seats they were soon on the road that led east out of town toward the native village from kevins perspective all he could see was the tops of the lianacovered trees that lined the road plus a strip of hazy blue sky after so many months of cloud cover and rain it was good to see the sun anybody following us kevin asked after theyd driven for some time melanie glanced in the rearview mirror i havent seen a car she said thered been no vehicular traffic in either direction although there were plenty of native women carrying various burdens on their heads after they passed the parking lot in front of the general store at the native village and entered the track that led to the island staging area kevin sat up he was no longer worried about being seen every few minutes he looked behind to make sure they werent being followed although he didnt admit it to the women he was a nervous wreck that log we hit last night should be coming up soon kevin warned but we didnt go over it when they brought us out melanie said they must have moved it youre right kevin said he was impressed that melanie remembered after the machinegun fire the details of the previous night were murky in kevins mind guessing they were getting close kevin moved forward so he could see out the front windshield between the two front seats despite the noontime sun the ability to see into the dense jungle lining the road was hardly any better than it had been the evening before little light penetrated the vegetation it was like moving between two walls they drove into the clearing and stopped the garage stood to their left while to the right they could see the mouth of the track that led down to the waters edge and the bridge should i drive down to the bridge melanie asked kevins nervousness increased coming into a dead end bothered him he debated driving down to the waters edge but guessed there wouldnt be enough room to turn around that would mean theyd have to back out my suggestion would be to park here kevin said but lets turn the car around first kevin expected an argument but melanie put the car in gear without so much as a whimper they left unspoken the fact that they would now have to walk past the spot where theyd been fired upon melanie completed her threepoint turn okay everybody here we are she said airily as she pulled on the emergency brake she was trying to buoy everyones spirits they were all tense i just had an idea which i dont like kevin said now what melanie asked looking at him in the rearview mirror maybe i should quietly walk down to the bridge and make sure no one is around kevin said like who melanie asked but the thought of unwanted company had occurred to her as well kevin took a deep breath to bolster his sagging courage and climbed out anybody he said even alphonse kimba he hiked up his pants and started off the track down toward the water was so thickly shrouded with vegetation it was even more like a tunnel than the track in from the road as soon as kevin entered it it twisted to the right the canopy of trees and vines blocked out much of the light the center strip of vegetation was so tall that the track was more like two parallel trails kevin rounded the first bend then stopped the unmistakable sound of boots running on the damp ground combined with the jingling of metal against metal made his stomach turn ahead the track turned to the left kevin held his breath in the next instant he saw a group of equatoguinean soldiers in their camouflage fatigues rounding the bend and coming in his direction all were carrying chinese assault rifles kevin spun on his heels and sprinted back up the trail like hed never sprinted before as he reached the clearing he yelled to melanie to get the hell out of there reaching the car he threw open the rear door and dived in melanie was trying to start the car what happened she screamed soldiers kevin croaked a bunch of them the car engine caught and roared to life at the same time the soldiers spilled into the clearing one of them yelled as melanie stomped on the accelerator the little car leaped forward and melanie fought the wheel there was a burst of gunfire and the rear window of the honda shattered into a million cubic shards kevin flattened himself against the backseat candace screamed as her window was blown out as well the track turned left just beyond the clearing melanie managed to keep the car in the tracks and then pushed the car to its limit after theyd gone seventy yards there was another distant burst of gunfire a few stray bullets whined over the car as melanie navigated another slight turn good god kevin said as he sat up and brushed the glass from the rear window off his torso now im really mad melanie said that was hardly a burst over our heads look at that rear window i think i want to retire kevin said ive always been afraid of those soldiers and now i know why i guess the key to the bridge is not going to do us much good candace said what a waste after all the effort we went through to get it its damn irritating melanie agreed were just going to have to come up with an alternate plan im going to bed kevin said he couldnt believe these women they seemed fearless he put a hand over his heart it was beating more rapidly than it ever had before chapter march am new york city with a burst of speed jack made the green light at the intersection of first avenue and thirtieth street and sailed across without slowing down angling the bike up the morgues driveway he didnt brake until the last minute moments later he had the bike locked and was on his way to the office of janice jaeger the night forensic investigator jack was keyed up after near conclusive identification of his floater as carlo franconi jack had gotten little sleep hed been on and off the phone with janice finally imploring her to get copies of all of franconis records from the manhattan general hospital her preliminary investigation had determined that franconi had been hospitalized there jack had also had janice get the phone numbers of the european human organ distribution organizations from bart arnolds desk because of the sixhourtime difference jack had started calling after three am he was most interested in the organization called euro transplant foundation in the netherlands when they had no record of a carlo franconi as a recent liver recipient jack called all the national organizations whose numbers he had they included organizations in france england italy sweden hungary and spain no one had heard of carlo franconi on top of that most of the people he had spoken with said that it would be rare for a foreign national to get such a transplant because most of the countries had waiting lists comprised of their own citizens after only a few hours of sleep jacks curiosity had awakened him unable to get back to sleep hed decided to get into the morgue early to go over the material that janice had collected my word you are eager janice commented as jack came into her office this is the kind of case that makes forensics fun jack said howd you do at the mgh i got a lot of material janice said mr franconi had multiple admissions over the years mostly for hepatitis and cirrhosis ah the plot thickens jack said when was the last admission about two months ago janice said but no transplant there is mention of it but if he had one he didnt have it at the mgh she handed jack a large folder jack hefted the package and smiled guess i got a lot of reading to do it looked pretty repetitive to me janice said what about his doctor jack asked has he had one in particular or has he been playing the field one for the most part janice said dr daniel levitz on fifth avenue between sixtyfourth and sixtyfifth street his office number is written on the outside of your parcel you are efficient jack said i try to do my best janice said have any luck with those european organ distribution organizations a complete strikeout jack said have bart give me a call as soon as he comes in we have to go back and retry all the transplant centers in this country now that we have a name if barts not in by the time i leave ill put a note on his desk janice said jack whistled as he walked through communications on his way to the id room he could taste the coffee already while dreaming of the euphoria that the first cup of the day always gave him but when he arrived he could see he was too early vinnie amendola was just in the process of making it hurry up with that coffee jack said as he dropped his heavy package onto the metal desk vinnie used to read his newspaper its an emergency this morning vinnie didnt answer which was out of character and jack noticed are you still in a bad mood he asked vinnie still didnt answer but jacks mind was already elsewhere hed seen the headlines on vinnies paper franconis body found beneath the headline in slightly smaller print was franconis corpse languishing in the medical examiners office for twentyfour hours before identity established jack sat down to read the article as usual it was written in a sarcastic bent with the implication that the citys medical examiners were bunglers jack thought it was interesting that while the journalist had had enough information to write the article he didnt appear to know that the body had been headless and handless in a deliberate attempt to conceal its identity nor did it mention anything about the shotgun wound to its right upper quadrant after finishing with the coffee preparation vinnie came over to stand next to the desk while jack read impatiently he shifted his weight from one foot to the other when jack finally looked up vinnie said irritably do you mind id like to have my paper you see this article jack asked slapping the front page yeah i seen it vinnie said jack resisted the temptation to correct his english instead he said did it surprise you i mean when we did the autopsy yesterday did it ever cross your mind it might have been the missing franconi no why should it vinnie said im not saying it should jack said im just asking if it did no vinnie said let me have my paper why dont you buy your own youre always reading mine jack stood up pushed vinnies paper toward him and lifted the bundle from janice you really are out of sorts lately maybe you need a vacation youre fast becoming a grumpy old man at least im not a cheapskate vinnie said he picked up his paper and readjusted the pages that jack had gotten out of alignment jack went to the coffeemaker and poured himself a brimming cup he took it over to the scheduling desk while sipping contentedly he went through the multitude of franconis hospital admissions on his first perusal of the material he just wanted the basics so he read each discharge summary page as janice had already told him the admissions were mostly due to liver problems starting from a bout of hepatitis he contracted in naples italy laurie arrived next before she even had her coat off she asked jack if hed seen the paper or heard the morning news jack told her hed seen the post was it your doing laurie asked as she folded her coat and put it on a chair what are you talking about the leak that we tentatively identified franconi with your floater laurie said jack gave a little laugh of disbelief im surprised youd even ask why would i do such a thing i dont know except you were so excited about it last night laurie said but i didnt mean any offense i was just surprised to see it in the news so quickly you and me both jack said maybe it was lou i think that would surprise me even more than you laurie said why me jack said he sounded hurt last year you leaked the plague story laurie said that was a completely different situation jack said defensively that was to save people well dont get mad laurie said to change the subject she asked what kind of cases do we have for today i didnt look jack admitted but the pile is small and i have a request if possible id like to have a paper day or really a research day laurie bent over and counted the autopsy folders only ten cases no problem she said i think ill only do one myself now that franconis body is back im even more interested to find out how it left here in the first place the more ive thought about it the more i believe it had to have been an inside job in some form or fashion there was a splashing sound followed by loud cursing both laurie and jack looked over at vinnie whod jumped up to a standing position hed spilled his coffee all over his desk and even onto his lap watch out for vinnie jack warned laurie hes again in a foul mood are you all right vinnie laurie called out im okay vinnie said he walked stifflegged over to the coffeepot to get some paper towels im a little confused jack said to laurie why does franconis return make you more interested in his disappearance mainly because of what you found during the autopsy laurie said at first i thought that whoever stole the body had done it out of pure spite like the killer wanted to deny the man a proper funeral something like that but now it seems that the body was taken to destroy the liver thats weird initially i thought that solving the riddle of how the body disappeared was simply a challenge now i think if i can figure out how the body disappeared we might be able to find out who did it im beginning to understand what lou said about feeling stupid about your ability to make associations jack said with franconis disappearance i always thought the why was more important than the how youre suggesting they are related exactly laurie said the how will lead to the who and the who will explain the why and you think someone who works here is involved jack said im afraid i do laurie said i dont see how they could have pulled it off without someone on the inside but i still have no clue how it happened after his call to siegfried raymonds brain had finally succumbed to the high levels of hypnotic medication circulating in his bloodstream from the two sleeping pills he slept soundly through the remaining early hours the next thing he was aware of was darlene opening the curtains to let in the daylight it was almost eight oclock the time hed asked to be awakened feel better dear darlene asked she made raymond sit forward so she could fluff up his pillow i do raymond admitted although his mind was fuzzy from the sleeping pills i even made you your favorite breakfast darlene said she went over to the bureau and lifted a wicker tray she carried it over to the bed and placed it across raymonds lap raymonds eyes traveled around the tray there was freshsqueezed orange juice two strips of bacon a singleegg omelette toast and fresh coffee in a side pocket was the morning paper hows that darlene asked proudly perfect raymond said he reached up and gave her a kiss let me know when you want more coffee darlene said then she left the room with childlike pleasure raymond buttered his toast and sipped his orange juice as far as he was concerned there was nothing quite so wonderful as the smell of coffee and bacon in the morning taking a bite of both bacon and omelette at the same time to savor the combined tastes raymond lifted the paper opened it and glanced at the headlines he gasped inadvertently inhaling some of his food he coughed so hard he bucked the wicker tray off the bed it crashed upside down on the carpet darlene came running into the room and stood wringing her hands while raymond went through series of coughing jags that turned him tomato red water he squeaked between fits darlene dashed into the bathroom and returned with a glass raymond clutched it and managed to drink a small amount the bacon and egg that hed had in his mouth was now distributed in an arc around the bed are you all right darlene asked should i call the wrong way down raymond croaked he pointed to his adams apple it took raymond five minutes to recover by that time his throat was sore and his voice hoarse darlene had cleaned up most of the mess hed caused except for the coffee stain on the white carpet did you see the paper raymond asked darlene she shook her head so raymond spread it out for her oh my she said oh my raymond repeated sarcastically and you were wondering why i was still worried about franconi raymond forcibly crumpled the paper what are you going to do darlene asked i suppose i have to go back and see vinnie dominick raymond said he promised me the body was gone some job he did the phone rang and raymond jumped do you want me to answer it darlene asked raymond nodded he wondered who could be calling so early darlene picked up the phone and said hello followed by several yeses then she put the phone on hold its dr waller anderson darlene said with a smile he wants to come on board raymond exhaled until then hed not been aware hed been holding his breath tell him were pleased but that ill have to call him later darlene did as she was told and then hung up the phone at least that was good news she said raymond rubbed his forehead and audibly groaned i just wish everything would go as well as the business side the phone rang again raymond motioned for darlene to answer it after saying hello and listening for a moment her smile quickly faded she put the phone on hold and told raymond it was taylor cabot raymond swallowed hard his already irritated throat had gone dry he took a quick swig of water and took the receiver hello sir raymond managed his voice was still hoarse im calling from my car phone taylor said so i wont be too specific but i have just been informed of the reemergence of a problem i thought had been taken care of what i said earlier about this issue still stands i hope you understand of course sir raymond squeaked i will raymond stopped speaking he took the phone away from his ear and looked at it taylor had cut him off just what i need raymond said as he handed the phone back to darlene another threat from cabot to close down the program raymond put his feet over the side of the bed as he stood up and slipped on his robe he could still feel the remnants of yesterdays headache i have to go find vinnie dominicks number i need another miracle by eight oclock laurie and the others were down in the pit starting their autopsies jack had stayed in the id room to read through the records of carlo franconis hospital admissions when he noticed the time he went back to the forensics area to find out why the chief investigator bart arnold had not come in that day jack was surprised when he found the man in his office didnt janice talk to you this morning jack asked he and bart were good enough friends so that jack thought nothing of marching right into barts office and plopping himself down i just came in fifteen minutes ago bart said janice was already gone wasnt there a message on your desk jack asked bart started to peek around under the clutter barts desk looked strikingly similar to jacks bart pulled out a note which he read aloud important call jack stapleton immediately it was signed janice sorry bart said id have seen it eventually he smiled weakly knowing there was no excuse i suppose youve heard that my floater has been just about conclusively identified as carlo franconi jack said so ive heard bart said that means i want you to go back to unos and all the centers that do liver transplantation with the name thats a lot easier than asking them to check if any of their recent transplants is missing bart said with all the phone numbers handy i can do that in a flash i spent most of the night on the phone with the organizations in europe responsible for organ allocation jack said i came up with zilch did you talk to euro transplant in the netherlands bart asked i called them first jack said they had no record of a franconi then its pretty safe to say that franconi didnt have his transplant in europe bart said euro transplant keeps tabs on the whole continent the next thing i want is for someone to go visit franconis mother and talk her into giving a blood sample i want ted lynch to run a mitochondrial dna match with the floater that will clinch the identity so it will no longer be presumptive also have the investigator ask the woman if her son had a liver transplant it will be interesting to hear what she has to say bart wrote jacks requests down what else bart asked i think thats it for now jack said janice told me franconis doctors name is daniel levitz is that anyone you have come in contact with if its the levitz on fifth then ive come in contact with him what was your take jack asked highprofile practice with wealthy clientele hes a good internist as far as i could tell the curious thing is that he takes care of a lot of the crime families so its not surprising he was taking care of carlo franconi different families jack questioned even families in competition with each other strange isnt it bart said it must be one big headache for the poor receptionist who does the scheduling can you imagine having two rival crime figures with their bodyguards in the waiting room at the same time lifes stranger than fiction jack said do you want me to go to dr levitz and get what i can on franconi bart asked i think ill do that myself jack said i have a sneaking suspicion that when talking with franconis doctor whats unsaid is going to be more important than what is said you concentrate on finding out where franconi got his transplant i think thats going to be the key piece of information in this case who knows it might just explain everything there you are a robust voice boomed both jack and bart looked up to see the doorway literally filled with the imposing figure of dr calvin washington the deputy chief ive been looking all over for you stapleton calvin growled come on the chief wants to see you jack gave bart a wink before getting to his feet probably just another of the many awards hes given me i wouldnt be so glib if i were you calvin snapped as he made room for jack to pass once again you got the old man all riled up jack followed calvin to the administration area just before going into the front office jack caught a glimpse of the waiting room there were more than the usual number of journalists something going on jack asked as if i have to tell you calvin grunted jack didnt understand but he didnt have a chance to ask more calvin was already asking mrs sanford binghams secretary if they could go into the chiefs office as it turned out the timing wasnt good and jack was relegated to sitting on the bench that faced mrs sanfords desk obviously she was as upset as her boss and treated jack to several disapproving looks jack felt like a naughty schoolboy waiting to see the principal calvin used the time by disappearing into his own office to make a few phone calls having a reasonable idea of what the chief was upset about jack tried to come up with an explanation unfortunately none came to mind after all he could have waited to get franconis x rays until binghams arrival that morning you can go in now mrs sanford said without looking up from her typing shed noticed the light on her extension phone had gone out meaning the chief was off the phone jack entered the chiefs office with a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu a year ago during a series of infectious disease cases jack had managed to drive the chief to distraction and there had been several such confrontations get in here and sit down bingham said roughly jack took the seat in front of the mans desk bingham had aged in the last few years he looked considerably older than sixtythree he glared at jack through his wirerimmed glasses despite his jowls and sagging flesh jack saw that his eyes were as intense and intelligent as ever i was just beginning to think you were really fitting in around here and now this bingham said jack didnt respond he felt it best not to say anything until he was asked a question can i at least ask why bingham said obligingly in his deep husky voice jack shrugged curiosity jack said i was excited and i couldnt wait curiosity bingham roared that was the same lame excuse you used last year when you disregarded my orders and went over to the mgh at least im consistent jack said bingham moaned and now here comes the impertinence you really havent changed much have you my basketball has improved jack said jack heard the door open he turned to see calvin slip into the room calvin folded his massive arms across his chest and stood to the side like an elite harem guard im not getting anywhere with him bingham complained to calvin as if jack were no longer in the room i thought you said his behavior had improved it had until this episode calvin said he then glared down at jack what irks me calvin said finally addressing jack is that you know damn well that releases from the medical examiners office are to come from dr bingham or through public relations period you examiner grunts are not to take it upon yourselves to divulge information the reality is that this job is highly politicized and in the face of our current problems we certainly dont need more bad press time out jack said somethings not right here im not sure were talking the same language you can say that again bingham asserted what i mean is jack said i dont think we are talking about the same issue when i came in here i thought i was being called onto the carpet because i bullied the janitor into giving me keys for this office so i could find franconis films hell no bingham yelled he pointed his finger at jacks nose its because you leaked the story about franconis body being discovered here at the morgue after it had been stolen what did you think this would somehow advance your career hold up jack said first im not all that excited about advancing my career second i was not responsible for this story getting to the media youre not bingham asked certainly youre not suggesting that laurie montgomery was responsible calvin asked not at all jack said but it wasnt me look to tell you the truth i dont even think its a story thats not how the media feels bingham said nor the mayor for that matter hes already called me twice this morning asking what kind of circus were running around here this franconi business continues to make us look bad in the eyes of the entire cityparticularly when news about our own office takes us by surprise the real story about franconi isnt about his body going on an overnight out of the morgue jack said its about the fact that the man seemingly had a liver transplant that no one knows about thats hard to detect by dna analysis and that somebody wanted to hide it bingham looked up at calvin who raised his hands defensively this is the first ive heard about this he said jack gave a rapid summary of his autopsy findings and then told about ted lynchs confusing dna analysis results this sounds weird bingham said he took off his glasses and wiped his rheumy eyes it also sounds bad considering that i want this whole franconi business to fade away if there is something truly screwy going on like franconi getting an unauthorized liver then thats not going to happen ill know more today jack said ive got bart arnold contacting all the transplant centers around the country john devries up in the lab running assays for immunosuppressants maureen oconner in histology pushing through the slides and ted doing a six polymarker dna test which he contends is foolproof by this afternoon well know for sure whether thered been a transplant and if were lucky where it had taken place bingham squinted across his desk at jack and youre sure you didnt leak todays newspaper story to the media scouts honor jack said holding up two fingers to form a v all right i apologize bingham said but listen stapleton keep this all under your hat and dont go irritating everyone under the sun so that i start getting calls complaining about your behavior you have a knack for getting under peoples skin and finally promise me that nothing goes to the media unless it goes through me understand as clear as a crystal jack said jack could rarely find an excuse to get out on his mountain bike during the day so that it was with a good deal of pleasure that he pedaled with the traffic up first avenue on his way to visit dr daniel levitz there was no sun but the temperature was pleasantly in the fifties heralding the coming spring for jack spring was the best season in new york city with his bike safely secured to a no parking sign jack walked up to the sidewalk entrance of dr daniel levitzs office jack had called ahead to make sure the doctor was in but hed specifically avoided making an appointment it was jacks feeling that a surprise visit might be more fruitful if franconi had had a transplant there was definitely something surreptitious about it your name please the silverhaired matronly receptionist asked jack flashed open his medical examiner badge its shiny surface and official appearance confused most people into thinking it was a police badge in situations like this jack didnt explain the difference the badge never failed to cause a reaction i must see the doctor jack said slipping his badge back inside his pocket the sooner the better when the receptionist regained her voice she asked for jacks name when he gave it he left off the title of doctor so as not to clarify the nature of his employ the receptionist immediately scraped back her chair and disappeared into the depths of the office jacks eyes roamed the waiting room it was generous in size and lavishly decorated it was a far cry from the utilitarian waiting room hed had when hed been a practicing ophthalmologist that had been before the retraining necessitated by the managedcare invasion to jack it seemed like a previous life and in many ways it was there were five welldressed people in the waiting room all eyed jack clandestinely as they continued to peruse their respective magazines as they noisily flipped the pages jack sensed an aura of irritation as if they knew he was about to upset the schedule and relegate them to additional waiting jack hoped none of them were notorious crime figures who might consider such an inconvenience a reason for revenge the receptionist reappeared and with embarrassing subservience she guided jack back to the doctors private study once jack was inside she closed the door dr levitz was not in the room jack sat in one of the two chairs facing the desk and surveyed the surroundings there were the usual framed diplomas and licenses the family pictures and even the stacks of unread medical journals it was all familiar to jack and gave him a shudder from his current vantage point he wondered how hed lasted as long as he had in a similar confining environment dr daniel levitz came through a second door he was dressed in his white coat complete with pocket full of tongue depressors and assorted pens a stethoscope hung from his neck compared with jacks muscular thickshouldered sixfoot frame dr levitz was rather short and almost fragile in appearance jack immediately noticed the mans nervous tics which involved slight twists and nods of his head dr levitz gave no indication he was aware of these movements he shook hands stiffly with jack and then retreated behind the vast expanse of his desk im very busy dr levitz said but of course i always have time for the police im not the police jack said im dr jack stapleton from the office of the chief medical examiner of new york dr levitzs head twitched as did his sparse mustache he appeared to swallow oh he commented i wanted to talk to you briefly about one of your patients jack said my patients conditions are confidential dr levitz said as if by rote of course jack said he smiled that is of course until they have died and become a medical examiners case you see i want to ask you about mr carlo franconi jack watched as dr levitz went through a number of bizarre motions making jack glad the man had not gone into brain surgery i still respect my patients confidentiality he said i can understand your position from an ethical point of view jack said but i should remind you that we medical examiners in the state of new york have subpoena power in such a circumstance so why dont we just have a conversation who knows we might be able to clear things up what do you want to know dr levitz asked i learned from reading mr franconis extensive hospital history that hed had a long bout with liver problems leading to liver failure jack said dr levitz nodded which caused his right shoulder to jerk several times jack waited until these involuntary movements subsided to come right to the point jack said the big question is whether or not mr franconi had a liver transplant at first levitz did not speak he merely twitched jack was determined to wait the man out i dont know anything about a liver transplant dr levitz said finally when did you see him last jack asked dr levitz picked up his phone and asked one of his assistants to bring in mr carlo franconis record it will just be a moment dr levitz said in one of mr franconis hospital admissions about three years ago you specifically wrote that it was your opinion that a transplant would be necessary do you remember writing that not specifically dr levitz said but i was aware of a deteriorating condition as well as mr franconis failure to stop drinking but you never mentioned it again jack said i found that surprising when it was easy to see a gradual but relentless deterioration in his liver function tests over the next couple of years a doctor can only do so much to influence his patients behavior dr levitz said the door opened and the deferential receptionist brought in a fat folder wordlessly she placed it on dr levitzs desk and withdrew dr levitz picked it up and after a quick glance said that hed seen carlo franconi a month previously what did you see him for an upper respiratory infection dr levitz said i prescribed some antibiotic apparently it worked did you examine him of course dr levitz said with indignation i always examine my patients had he had a liver transplant well i didnt do a complete physical dr levitz explained i examined him appropriately in reference to his complaint and his symptoms you didnt even feel his liver knowing his history jack asked i didnt write it down if i did dr levitz said did you do any blood work that would reflect liver function jack asked only a bilirubin dr levitz said why only a bilirubin hed been jaundiced in the past dr levitz said he looked better but i wanted to document it what was the result jack asked it was within normal limits dr levitz said so except for his upper respiratory infection he was doing quite well jack said yes i suppose you could say that dr levitz said almost like a miracle jack said especially as youve already mentioned the man was unwilling to curb his alcohol intake perhaps he finally had stopped dr levitz said after all people can change would you mind if i looked at his record jack asked yes i would mind dr levitz said ive already stated my ethical position about confidentiality if you want these records you will have to subpoena them im sorry i dont mean to be obstructive thats quite all right jack said agreeably he stood up ill let the states attorneys office know how you feel meanwhile thanks for your time and if you dont mind ill probably be talking with you in the near future theres something very strange about this case and i intend to get to the bottom of it jack smiled to himself as he undid the locks on his bike it was so obvious that dr levitz knew more than he was willing to say how much more jack didnt know but certainly it added to the intrigue jack had an intuitive sense that not only was this the most interesting case hed had so far in his forensics career it might be the most interesting case hed ever have returning to the morgue he stashed his bike in the usual location went up to his office to drop off his coat then went directly to the dna lab but ted wasnt ready for him i need a couple more hours ted said and ill call you you dont have to come up here disappointed but undeterred jack descended a floor to histology and checked on the progress of his permanent microscopic sections on what was now labeled the franconi case my god maureen complained what do you expect miracles im rushing your slides through ahead of everybody else but still youll be lucky to get them today still trying to keep his spirits up and his curiosity at bay jack rode the elevator down to the second floor and sought out john devries in the lab the assays for cyclosporin a and fk are not easy john snapped besides were backed up as it is you cant expect instant service with the budget i have to work with okay jack said agreeably as he backed out of the lab he knew that john was an irascible individual and if aroused he could be passive aggressive if that happened it might be weeks before jack got the test results descending yet another floor jack went into bart arnolds office and implored the man to give him something since hed struck out every place else ive made a lot of calls bart said but you know the situation with voice mail you almost never get anyone on the phone anymore so i got a lot of messages out there waiting for callbacks jeez jack complained i feel like a teenage girl with a new dress waiting to get asked to the prom sorry bart said if its any consolation we did manage to get a blood sample from franconis mother its already up in the dna lab was the mother asked whether her son had a liver transplant absolutely bard said mrs franconi assured the investigator that she didnt know anything about a transplant but she did admit that her son had been much healthier lately to what did she attribute his sudden health jack asked she says he went away to a spa someplace and came back a new man did she happen to say where jack questioned she didnt know bart said at least thats what she told the investigator and the investigator told me that she thought she was telling the truth jack nodded as he got to his feet figures he said getting a bona fide tip from the mother would have been much too easy ill keep you informed as soon as i start getting callbacks bart said thanks jack said feeling frustrated jack walked through communications to the id room he thought maybe some coffee would cheer him up he was surprised to find lieutenant detective lou soldano busily helping himself to a cup uhoh lou said caught redhanded jack eyed the homicide detective he looked better than he had in days not only was the top button of his shirt buttoned but his tie was cinched up in place on top of that he was close shaven and his hair was combed you look almost human today jack said i feel that way lou said i got my first decent nights sleep in days wheres laurie in the pit i presume jack said i gotta pat her on the back again for making that association with your floater after watching the video lou said all of us down at headquarters think it might lead to a break in this case already weve gotten a couple of good tips from our informers because its stimulated a lot of talk in the streets especially over in queens laurie and i were surprised to see it in the papers this morning jack commented that was a lot faster than we expected do you have any idea who was the source i was lou said innocently but i was careful not to give any details other than the fact that the body had been identified why is there a problem only that bingham went mildly ballistic jack said and i was hauled in as the culprit gosh im sorry lou said it didnt dawn on me it could cause a problem here i guess i should have run it by you well i owe you forget it jack said its already patched up he poured himself some coffee shoveled in some sugar and added a dollop of cream at least it had the desired effect on the street lou said and we learned something important already the people who killed him were definitely not the same people who took his body and mauled it doesnt surprise me jack said no lou questioned i thought that was the general consensus around here at least thats what laurie said she now thinks the people that took the body did it because they didnt want anyone to know hed had a liver transplant jack said i still favor the idea it was done to conceal the individuals identity really lou said pensively sipping his coffee that doesnt make any sense to me you see were reasonably sure the body was taken on orders from the lucia crime family the direct competitors of the vaccarros who we understand had franconi killed good grief jack exclaimed are you sure about that reasonably lou said the informer who divulged it is usually reliable of course we dont have any names thats the frustrating part just the idea that organized crime is involved is appalling jack said it means that the lucia people are somehow involved in organ transplants if that doesnt make you lose sleep nothing will calm down raymond yelled into the phone the moment hed been about to leave the apartment the phone had rung when he heard it was dr daniel levitz on the line hed taken the call dont tell me to calm down daniel shouted back youve seen the papers they have franconis body and already a medical examiner by the name of dr jack stapleton has been in my office asking for franconis records you didnt give them did you raymond asked of course not daniel snapped but he condescendingly reminded me that he could subpoena them im telling you this guy was very direct and very aggressive and he vowed to get to the bottom of the case he suspects franconi had a transplant he asked me directly do your records have any information at all about his transplant or our program raymond asked no i followed your suggestions in that regard to the letter daniel said but its going to look very strange if anybody looks at my records after all id been documenting franconis deteriorating status for years then all of a sudden his liver function studies are normal without any explanation nothing not even a comment im telling you therell be questions and i dont know whether i can handle them im very upset i wish id never gotten involved in all this now lets not get carried away raymond said with a calmness that he himself did not feel theres no way stapleton could get to the bottom of the case our concern about an autopsy was purely hypothetical and based on an infinitesimally small chance someone with the iq of einstein could figure out the source of the transplant its not going to happen but i appreciate your calling me about dr stapletons visit as it turns out im on my way this very minute to have a meeting with vinnie dominick with his resources im sure hell be able to take care of everything after all to a large measure hes responsible for the present situation as soon as he could raymond got off the phone appeasing dr daniel levitz wasnt doing anything for his own anxiety after advising darlene what to say in the unlikely chance taylor cabot called back he left the apartment catching a taxi at the corner of madison and sixtyfourth he instructed the cabbie how to get to corona avenue in elmhurst the scene at the neopolitan restaurant was exactly the same as it had been the day before with the addition of the stale smell of a couple of hundred more cigarettes vinnie dominick was sitting in the same booth and his minions were lounging on the same bar stools the obese bearded man was again busily washing glassware raymond lost no time after coming through the heavy red velvet drape at the door he made a beeline for vinnies booth and slid in without invitation he pushed forward the crumpled newspaper which hed painstakingly smoothed out across the table vinnie gazed down at the headlines nonchalantly as you can see theres a problem raymond said you promised me the body was gone obviously you screwed up vinnie picked up his cigarette took a long drag then blew the smoke at the ceiling doc vinnie said you never fail but to amaze me you either have a lot of nerve or youre crazy i dont tolerate this kind of disrespect even from my trusted lieutenants either you reword what you just said to me or get up and get yourself lost before i get really pissed raymond swallowed hard while he got a finger between his neck and his shirt and adjusted his collar remembering to whom he was speaking gave him a chill a mere nod from vinnie dominick could find him bobbing around in the east river im sorry raymond said meekly im not myself im very upset after i saw the headlines i got a call from the ceo of gensys threatening the whole program i also got a call from franconis doctor who told me hed been approached by one of the medical examiners an me named jack stapleton dropped by his office wanting to see franconis records angelo vinnie called out come over here angelo ambled over to the booth vinnie asked him if he knew a dr jack stapleton at the morgue angelo shook his head ive never seen him angelo said but vinnie amendola mentioned him when he called this morning he said stapleton was all fired up about franconi because franconi is his case you see ive gotten a few calls myself vinnie said not only did i get a call from vinnie amendola whos still sweating it because we leaned on him to help us get franconi out of the morgue i also got another call from my wifes brother who runs the funeral home that took the body out seems that dr laurie montgomery paid a visit and was asking about a body that doesnt exist im sorry that this has all gone so badly raymond said you and me both vinnie said to tell you the truth i cant understand how they got the body back we went to some effort knowing the ground was too hard to bury it out in westchester so we took it way the hell out off coney island and dumped it into the ocean obviously something went wrong raymond said with all due respect what can be done at this point as far as the body is concerned we cant do anything vinnie amendola told angelo that the autopsy was already done so thats that raymond moaned and cradled his head his headache had intensified just a second doc vinnie said i want to reassure you about something since i knew the reason why an autopsy might cause problems for your program i had angelo and carlo destroy franconis liver raymond raised his head a ray of hope had appeared on the horizon how did you do that he asked with a shotgun vinnie said they blasted the hell out of the liver they totally destroyed this whole portion of the abdomen vinnie made a circling motion with his hand over his right upper quadrant right angelo angelo nodded the entire magazine of a pump action remington the guys gut looked like hamburger so i dont think you have as much to worry about as you think vinnie said to raymond if franconis liver was totally destroyed why is jack stapleton asking whether franconi had a transplant raymond asked is he vinnie asked he asked dr levitz directly raymond said vinnie shrugged he must have gotten a clue some other way at any rate the problem now seems to be focused on these two characters dr jack stapleton and dr laurie montgomery raymond raised his eyebrows expectantly as i already told you doc vinnie continued if it werent for vinnie junior and his bum kidneys i wouldnt have gotten involved in all this the fact that ive since gotten my wifes brother into this situation compounds my problem now that i got him involved i cant leave him dangling you see what im saying so heres what im thinking ill have angelo and franco pay a visit to these two doctors and take care of things would you mind that angelo raymond looked hopefully at angelo and for the first time since raymond had seen angelo angelo smiled it wasnt much of a smile because all the scar tissue precluded most facial movement but it was a smile nonetheless ive been looking forward to meeting laurie montgomery for five years angelo said i suspected as much vinnie said can you get their addresses from vinnie amendola im sure hell be happy to give us dr stapletons angelo said he wants this messy situation cleared up as much as anybody as far as laurie montgomery is concerned i already know her address vinnie stubbed out his cigarette and raised his own eyebrows so doc what do you think of the idea of angelo and franco visiting the two pesky medical examiners and convincing them to see things our way they have to be convinced that they are causing us considerable inconvenience if you know what i mean a wry smile appeared on his face and he winked raymond let out a little laugh of relief i cant think of a better solution he worked his way along the curved velvet banquette seat and stood up thank you mr dominick im much obliged and apologize again for my thoughtless outburst when i first arrived hold on doc vinnie said we havent discussed compensation yet i thought this would be covered under the rubric of our prior agreement raymond said trying to sound businesslike without offending vinnie after all franconis body was not supposed to reappear thats not the way i see it vinnie said this is an extra since youve already bargained away the tuition issue im afraid were now talking about recouping some of my initiation fee what about twenty thousand that sounds like a nice round figure raymond was outraged but he managed to stifle a response he also remembered what happened the last time he tried to bargain with vinnie dominick the cost doubled it might take me a little time to get that kind of money together raymond said thats fine doc vinnie said just as long as we have an agreement from my end ill get angelo and franco right on it wonderful raymond managed to say before leaving are you serious about this angelo asked vinnie im afraid so vinnie said i guess it wasnt such a smart idea to get my brotherinlaw involved in all this although at the time we didnt have much choice one way or the other i got to clean it up otherwise my wife will have my balls the only good part is that i was able to get the good doc to pay for what id have to do anyway when do you want us to take care of those two angelo asked the sooner the better vinnie said in fact youd better do it tonight chapter march pm cogo equatorial guinea at what time did you expect your guests esmeralda asked kevin her body and head were wrapped in a handsome bright orangeandgreen fabric seven oclock kevin said happy for the distraction hed been sitting at his desk trying to fool himself into believing he was reading one of his molecular biology journals in reality he was tortured by repeatedly running through the harrowing events of that afternoon he could still see the soldiers in their red berets and jungle camouflage fatigues seemingly coming out of nowhere he could hear their boots pounding against the moist earth and the jangle of their equipment as they ran worse yet he could feel the same sickening terror that hed felt when hed turned to flee expecting at any instant to hear the sound of machinegun fire the dash across the clearing to the car and the wild ride had been somehow anticlimactic to that initial fright the windows being shot out had an almost surreal quality that somehow couldnt compare to his first glimpse of those soldiers melanie had once again responded to the event completely differently than kevin it made kevin wonder if growing up in manhattan had somehow toughened her for such experiences rather than expressing fear melanie was more angry than afraid she was furious at the soldiers wanton destruction of what she considered her property even though the car technically belonged to gensys the dinner is prepared esmeralda said i shall keep it warm kevin thanked his attentive housekeeper and she disappeared back into the kitchen tossing aside his journal kevin got up from his desk and walked out onto the veranda night had fallen and he was beginning to worry about where melanie and candace could be kevins house fronted a small grassy square illuminated by oldfashioned street lamps directly across the square was siegfried spalleks house it was similar to kevins with an arcaded first floor a veranda around the second and dormers in its steeply pitched roof at present there were lights only in the kitchen end of the house apparently the manager had not yet come home heading laughter to his left kevin turned in the direction of the waterfront there had been a tropical downpour for an hour that had just ended fifteen minutes previously the cobblestones were steaming since theyd still been hot from the sun into this lighted mist walked the two women arm in arm laughing merrily hey kevin melanie shouted spying kevin on his balcony how come you didnt send a carriage the women walked to a point directly beneath kevin who was embarrassed by their revelry what are you talking about kevin asked well you didnt expect us to get soaked did you melanie joked candace giggled come on up kevin encouraged his eyes roamed around the small square hoping that his neighbors werent being disturbed the women came up the stairs with great commotion kevin met them in the hall melanie insisted on giving kevin a kiss on both cheeks candace did likewise sorry were late melanie said but the rain forced us to take shelter at the chickee bar and a friendly group of men from the motor pool insisted on buying us piÃ±a coladas candace said gaily its okay kevin said but dinner is ready fantastic candace said im famished me too melanie said she reached down and slipped off her shoes i hope you dont mind my going barefoot my shoes got a little wet on the way up here me too candace said as she followed suit kevin motioned toward the dining room and trailed the women in esmeralda had laid the table at one end since it was large enough for twelve there was a small tablecloth just covering the area under the dishes there were also candles burning in glass holders how romantic candace commented i hope were having wine melanie said as she took the seat closest to her candace went around and sat opposite melanie leaving the head of the table for kevin white or red kevin asked any color melanie said then she laughed what are we eating candace asked its a local fish kevin said a fish how appropriate melanie said which caused both women to laugh to the point of tears i dont get it kevin said he had the distinct feeling that when he was around these two women he wasnt in control of anything and understood less than half the conversation well explain later melanie managed get the wine thats more important lets have white candace said kevin went into the kitchen and got the wine that he had earlier put into the refrigerator he avoided looking at esmeralda worried what she must be thinking with these tipsy women as guests kevin didnt know what to think himself as he opened the wine he could hear them carrying on with lively conversation and laughter the good side he reminded himself was that with melanie and candace there were never any uncomfortable silences what kind of wine are we having melanie asked when kevin reappeared kevin showed her the bottle oh my she said with feigned condescension montrachet arent we lucky tonight kevin had had no idea what hed picked from his collection of wine bottles but he was pleased melanie was impressed he poured the wine as esmeralda appeared with the first course the dinner was an unqualified success even kevin began to relax after attempting to keep up with the women as far as the wine was concerned about halfway through the meal he was forced to return to the kitchen for another bottle you cant guess who else was at the chickee hut melanie said as the entree dishes were being cleared our fearless leader siegfried kevin choked on his wine he wiped his face with his napkin you didnt talk to him did you it would have been hard not to melanie said he graciously asked if he could join us and even bought a round not only for us but also for the guys from the motor pool he was actually quite charming candace said kevin felt a chill descend down his spine the second ordeal of the afternoon which scared him almost as much as the first was a visit to siegfrieds office no sooner had they evaded the equatoguinean soldiers then melanie had insisted on driving there it made no difference what kevin said in an attempt to talk her out of it im not going to stand for this kind of treatment melanie had said as they mounted the stairs she didnt even bother to speak with aurielo she just sailed into siegfrieds office and demanded that he personally see to it that her car was repaired candace had gone in with melanie but kevin had held back watching from just beyond aurielos desk last night i lost my sunglasses melanie had said so we go out there just to see if we can find them and we get shot at again kevin had expected siegfried to explode but he didnt instead he was immediately apologetic said that the soldiers were only out there to keep people away from the island and that they shouldnt have fired their guns he agreed not only to fix melanies car but to make sure she got a loaner in the interim he also offered to have the soldiers scour the area for the lost sunglasses esmeralda appeared with the dessert the women were pleased it was made with locally grown cocoa did siegfried mention anything about what happened today kevin asked he apologized again candace said he said he spoke with the moroccan guard and assured us that there wont be any more shooting he said that if anybody wanders out there by the bridge they will just be spoken to and told that the area is offlimits likely story kevin said as triggerhappy as those kids they call soldiers are its not going to happen melanie laughed talk about the soldiers siegfried said that they spent hours searching for the nonexistent sunglasses serves them right he did ask us if we wanted to talk with some of the workers whod been on the island and whod been burning underbrush candace said can you believe it and how did you respond kevin asked we told him it wasnt necessary candace said i mean we dont want him to think were still concerned about the smoke and we definitely dont want him to think were planning on visiting the island but were not kevin said he eyed the women while they smiled at each other conspiratorially are we as far as kevin was concerned getting shot at twice had been more than enough to convince him that visiting the island was out of the question you wondered why we laughed when you told us we were having fish for dinner melanie said remember yeah kevin said with concern he had the distinct feeling he wasnt going to like what melanie was about to say we laughed because we spent a good deal of the late afternoon talking to fishermen who come to cogo a couple of times a week melanie said probably the ones who caught the fish we just ate they come from a town called acalayong about ten to twelve miles east of here i know the town kevin said it was the jumpingoff place for people going from equatorial guinea to cocobeach gabon the route was served by motorized canoes called pirogues we rented one of their boats for two or three days melanie said proudly so we dont have to even go near the bridge we can visit isla francesca by water not me kevin said emphatically ive had it frankly i think were lucky to be alive if you guys want to go go i know that nothing i could ever say would influence what you do oh thats great melanie said derisively youre giving up already if thats the case how do you intend to find out whether you and i have created a race of protohumans i mean youre the one whos raised this issue and got us all upset melanie and candace stared at kevin across the table for a few minutes no one said a word the night sounds of the jungle drifted in which until then no one had heard after feeling progressively uncomfortable kevin finally broke the silence i dont know what im going to do yet he said ill think of something like hell you will melanie said you already said the only way to find out what those animals are doing is to visit the island those were your words have you forgotten no i havent forgotten kevin said its just that well thats okay melanie said condescendingly if youre too chicken to go and find out what you might have done with your genetic tinkering fine we were counting on you coming to help run the motor in the pirogue but thats okay candace and i can manage right candace right candace said you see weve planned this out pretty carefully melanie said not only did we rent the large motorized canoe but we had them bring back a smaller paddle version as well we plan to tow the paddle boat once we get to the island well paddle up the rio diviso maybe we wont even have to go on land at all all we want to do is observe the animals for a while kevin nodded he looked back and forth between the two women who were relentlessly staring at him acutely uncomfortable he scraped back his chair and started from the room where are you going melanie asked to get more wine kevin said with strange emotion akin to anger kevin got a third bottle of white burgundy opened it and brought it back into the dining room he gestured with it toward melanie and she nodded kevin filled her glass he did the same to candace then he filled his own after taking his seat kevin took a healthy swig of wine he coughed a little after swallowing and then asked when they planned on going on their great expedition tomorrow bright and early melanie said we figure it will take a little over an hour to get to the island and wed like to be back before the sun gets really strong we already got food and drink from the commissary candace said and i got a portable cooler from the hospital to pack it in well stay far away from the bridge and the staging area melanie said so that wont be a problem i think its going to be kind of fun candace said id love to see a hippopotamus kevin took another gulp of wine i suppose you dont mind if we take those electronic gizmos to locate the animals melanie said and we could use the contour map of course well be careful with them kevin sighed and sagged in his chair all right i give up what time is this mission scheduled oh goody candace said clapping her hands together i knew youd come the sun comes up after six melanie said id like to be in the boat and on our way by then my plan is to head west then swing way out into the estuary before going east that way we wont evoke any suspicions here in town if anyone sees us getting into the boat id like them to think we were going off to acalayong what about work kevin asked wont you be missed nope melanie said i told the people in the lab id be unreachable at the animal center whereas the people in the animal center i told i get the picture kevin interjected what about you candace no problem candace said as long as mr winchester keeps doing as well as hes doing im essentially unemployed the surgeons are golfing and playing tennis all day i can do what i like ill call my head tech kevin said ill tell him im under the weather with an acute attack of insanity wait a second candace said suddenly i just thought of a problem kevin sat bolt upright what he asked i dont have any sunblock candace said i didnt bring any because on my three previous visits i never saw the sun chapter march pm new york city with all the tests on franconi pending jack had forced himself to go to his office and try to concentrate on some of his other outstanding cases to his surprise hed made reasonable headway until the phone rang at twothirty is this dr stapleton a female voice with an italian accent asked it is indeed jack said is this mrs franconi imogene franconi i got a message to call you i appreciate it mrs franconi jack said first let me extend my sympathies to you in regards to your son thank you imogene said carlo was a good boy he didnt do any of those things they said in the newspapers he worked for the american fresh fruit company here in queens i dont know where all that talk about organized crime came from the newspapers just make stuff up its terrible what theyll do to sell papers jack said the man that came this morning said that you got his body back imogene said we believe so jack said thats why we needed some blood from you to confirm it thank you for being cooperative i asked him why he didnt want me to come down there and identify it like i did last time imogene said but he told me he didnt know jack tried to think of a graceful way of explaining the identity problem but he couldnt think of any some parts of the body are still missing he said vaguely hoping that mrs franconi would be satisfied oh imogene commented let me tell you why i called jack said quickly he was afraid that if mrs franconi became offended she might not be receptive to his question you told the investigator that your sons health had improved after a trip do you remember saying that of course imogene said i was told you dont know where he went jack said is there any way you could find out i dont think so imogene said he told me it had nothing to do with his work and that it was very private do you remember when it was jack asked not exactly imogene said maybe five or six weeks ago was it in this country jack asked i dont know imogene said all he said was that it was very private if you find out where it was would you give me a call back jack asked i suppose imogene said thank you jack said wait imogene said i just remembered he did say something strange just before he left he said that if he didnt come back that he loved me very much did that surprise you jack asked well yes imogene said i thought that was a fine thing to say to your mother jack thanked mrs franconi again and hung up the phone hardly had he had his hand off the receiver when it rang again it was ted lynch i think youd better come up here ted said im on my way jack said jack found ted sitting at his desk literally scratching his head if i didnt know better id think you were trying to put one over on me ted spat sit down jack sat ted was holding a ream of computergenerated paper plus a number of sheets of developed film with hundreds of small dark bands ted reached over and dropped the mass into jacks lap what the hells this jack questioned he picked up several of the celluloid sheets and held them up to the light ted leaned over and with the eraser end of an oldfashioned wooden pencil pointed to the films these are the results of the dna polymarker test he fingered the computer printout and this mass of data compares the nucleotide sequences of the dq alpha regions of the mhc come on ted jack urged talk english to me would you please you know im a babe in the woods when it comes to this stuff fine ted exclaimed as if vexed the polymarker test shows that franconis dna and the dna of the liver tissue you found inside him could not be any more different hey thats good news jack said then it was a transplant i guess ted said without conviction but the sequence with the dq alpha is identical right down to the last nucleotide what does that mean jack asked ted spread his hands like a supplicant and wrinkled his forehead i dont know i cant explain it mathematically it couldnt happen i mean the chances are so infinitesimally small its beyond belief were talking about an identical match of thousands upon thousands of base pairs even in areas of long repeats absolutely identical thats why we got the results that we did with the dq alpha screen well the bottom line is that it was a transplant jack said thats the issue here if pressed id have to agree it was a transplant ted said but how they found a donor with the identical dq alpha is beyond me its the kind of coincidence that smacks of the supernatural what about the test with the mitochondrial dna to confirm the floater is franconi jack asked jeez you give a guy an inch and he wants a mile ted complained we just got the blood for crissake youll have to wait on the results after all we turned the lab upside down to get what you got so quickly besides im more interested in this dq alpha situation compared to the polymarker results something doesnt jibe well dont lose any sleep over it jack said he stood up and gave ted back all the material ted had dumped in his lap i appreciate what youve done thanks its the information i needed and when the mitochondrial results are back give me a call jack was elated by teds results and he wasnt worried about the mitochondrial study with the correlation of the x rays he was already confident the floater and franconi were one and the same jack got on the elevator now that hed documented that it had been a transplant he was counting on bart arnold to come up with the answers to solve the rest of the mystery as he descended jack found himself wondering about teds emotional reaction to the dq alpha results jack was aware that ted didnt get excited about too many things consequently it had to be significant unfortunately jack didnt know enough about the test to have much of an opinion he vowed that when he had the chance hed read up on it jacks elation was shortlived it faded the moment he walked into barts office the forensic investigator was on the phone but he shook his head the moment he caught sight of jack jack interpreted the gesture as bad news he sat down to wait no luck jack asked as soon as bart disconnected im afraid not bart said i really expected unos to come through and when they said that they had not provided a liver for carlo franconi and that hed not even been on their waiting list i knew the chances of tracing where hed gotten the liver fell precipitously just now i was on the phone with columbiapresbyterian and it wasnt done there so ive heard from just about every center doing liver transplants and no one takes credit for carlo franconi this is crazy jack said he told bart that teds findings confirmed that franconi had had a transplant i dont know what to say bart commented if someone didnt get their transplant in north america or europe where could it have taken place jack asked bart shrugged there are a few other possibilities australia south africa even a couple of places in south america but having talked to my contact at unos i dont think any of them are likely no kidding jack said he was not hearing what he wanted to hear its a mystery bart commented nothing about this case is easy jack complained as he got to his feet ill keep at it bart offered id appreciate it jack said jack wandered out of the forensic area feeling mildly depressed he had the uncomfortable sensation that he was missing some major fact but he had no idea what it could be or how to go about finding out what it was in the id room he got himself another cup of coffee which was more like sludge than a beverage by that time of the day with cup in hand he climbed the stairs to the lab i ran your samples john devries said they were negative for both cyclosporin a and fk jack was astounded all he could do was stare at the pale gaunt face of the laboratory director jack didnt know what was more surprising the fact that john had already run the samples or that the results were negative you must be joking jack managed to say hardly john said its not my style but the patient had to be on immunosuppressants jack said hed had a recent liver transplant is it possible you got a false negative we run controls as standard procedure john said i expected one or the other drug to be present jack said im sorry that we dont gear our results to your expectations john said sourly if youll excuse me i have work to do jack watched the laboratory director walk over to an instrument and make some adjustments then jack turned and made his way out of the lab now he was more depressed ted lynchs dna results and john devriess drug assays were contradictory if thered been a transplant franconi had to be on either cyclosporin a or fk that was standard medical procedure getting off the elevator on the fifth floor he walked down to histology while trying to come up with some rational explanation for the facts hed been given nothing came to mind well if it isnt the good doctor yet again maureen oconner said in her irish brogue what is it you only have one case is that why you are dogging us so i only have one that is driving me bananas jack said whats the story with the slides theres a few that are ready maureen said do you want to take them or wait for the whole batch ill take what i can get jack said maureens nimble fingers picked out a sampling of the sections that were dry and placed them in a microscopic slide holder she handed the tray to jack are there liver sections among these jack asked hopefully i believe so maureen said one or two the rest youll have later jack nodded and walked out a few doors down the hall he entered his office chet looked up from his work and smiled hey sport hows it going chet said not so good jack said he sat down and turned on his microscope light problems with the franconi case chet asked jack nodded he began to hunt through the slides for liver sections he only found one everything about it is like squeezing water from a rock listen im glad you came back chet said im expecting a call from a doctor in north carolina i just want to find out if a patient had heart trouble i have to duck out to get passport photos taken for my upcoming trip to india would you take the call for me sure jack said whats the patients name clarence potemkin chet said the folder is right here on my desk fine jack said while slipping the sole liver section onto his microscopes stage he ignored chet as chet got his coat from behind the door and left jack ran the microscopic objective down to the slide and was about to peer into the eyepieces when he paused chets errand had started him thinking about international travel if franconi had gotten his transplant out of the country which seemed increasingly probable there might be a way to find out where hed been jack picked up his phone and called police headquarters he asked for lieutenant detective lou soldano he expected to have to leave a message and was pleasantly surprised to get the man himself hey im glad you called lou said remember what i told you this morning about the tip it was the lucia people who stole franconis remains from the morgue we just got confirmation from another source i thought you might like to know interesting jack said now i have a question for you shoot lou said jack outlined the reasons for his belief that carlo franconi might have traveled abroad for his liver transplant he added that according to the mans mother hed taken a trip to a supposed spa four to six weeks previously what i want to know is is there a way to find out by talking to customs if franconi left the country recently and if so where did he go either customs or the immigration and naturalization lou said your best bet would be immigration unless of course he brought back so much stuff he had to pay duty besides i have a friend in immigration that way i can get the information much faster than going through the usual bureaucratic channels want me to check id love it jack said this case is bugging the hell out of me my pleasure lou said as i said this morning i owe you jack hung up the phone with a tiny glimmer of hope that hed thought of a new angle feeling a bit more optimistic he leaned forward looked into his microscope and began to focus lauries day had not gone anything like shed anticipated shed planned on doing only one autopsy but ended up doing two and then george fontworth ran into trouble with his multiple gunshot wound case and laurie volunteered to help him even with no lunch laurie didnt get out of the pit until three after changing into her street clothes laurie was on her way up to her office when she caught sight of marvin in the mortuary office hed just come on duty and was busy putting the office in order after the tumult of a normal day laurie made a detour and stuck her head in the door we found franconis x rays she said and it turned out that floater that came in the other night was our missing man i saw it in the paper marvin said far out the x rays made the identification laurie said so im extra glad you took them its my job marvin said i wanted to apologize again for suggesting you didnt take them laurie said no problem marvin said laurie got about four steps away when she turned around and returned to the mortuary office this time she entered and closed the door behind her marvin looked at her questioningly would you mind if i asked you a question just between you and me laurie asked i guess not marvin said warily obviously ive been interested in how franconis body was stolen from here laurie said thats why i talked to you the afternoon before last remember of course marvin said i also came in that night and talked with mike passano laurie said so i heard marvin said i bet you did laurie said but believe me i wasnt accusing mike of anything i hear you marvin said he can be sensitive now and then i cant figure out how the body was stolen laurie said between mike and security there was always someone here marvin shrugged i dont know either he said believe me i understand laurie said im sure you would have said something to me if you had any suspicions but thats not what i wanted to ask my feeling at this point is that there had to be some help from inside is there any employee here at the morgue that you think might have been involved in this somehow thats my question marvin thought for a minute and then shook his head i dont think so it had to have happened on mikes shift laurie said the two drivers pete and jeff do you know them very well nope marvin said i mean ive seen them around and even talked with them a few times but since were on different shifts we dont have a lot of con tact but you dont have any reason to suspect them nope no more than anybody else marvin said thanks laurie said i hope my question didnt make you feel uncomfortable no problem marvin said laurie thought for a minute while she absently chewed on her lower lip she knew she was missing something i have an idea she said suddenly maybe you should describe to me the exact sequence you go through when a body leaves here you mean everything that happens marvin said please laurie said i mean i have a general idea but i dont know the specifics where do you want me to start marvin asked right from the beginning laurie said right from the moment you get the call from the funeral home okay marvin said the call comes in and they say theyre from soandso funeral home and they want to do a pickup so they give me the name and the accession number thats it laurie asked then you hang up no marvin said i put them on hold while i enter the accession number into the computer i gotta make sure the body has been released by you guys and also find out where it is so then you go back to the phone and say what i say its okay marvin said i tell them ill have the body ready i guess i usually ask when they think theyll be here i mean no sense rushing around if theyre not going to be here for two hours or something then what laurie said i get the body and check the accession number marvin said then i put it in the front of the walkin cooler we always put them in the same place in fact we line them up in the order we expect them to go out it makes it easier for the drivers and then what happens laurie asked then they come marvin said with another shrug and what happens when they arrive laurie asked they come in here and we fill out a receipt marvin said its all got to be documented i mean they have to sign to indicate they have accepted custody okay laurie said and then you go back and get the body yeah or one of them gets it marvin said all of them have been in and out of here a million times is there any final check laurie asked you bet marvin said we always check the accession number one more time before they wheel the body out of here we have to indicate that being done on the documents it would be embarrassing if the drivers got back to the home and realized they had the wrong corpse sounds like a good system laurie said and she meant it with so many checks it would be hard to subvert such a procedure its been working for decades without a screwup marvin said of course the computer helps before that all they had was the logbook thanks marvin laurie said hey no problem doc marvin said laurie left the mortuary office before going up to her own she stopped off on the second floor to get a snack out of the vending machines in the lunch room reasonably fortified she went up to the fifth floor seeing jacks office door ajar she walked over and peeked in jack was at his microscope something interesting she asked jack looked up and smiled very he said want to take a look laurie glanced into the eyepieces as jack leaned to the side it looks like a tiny granuloma in a liver she said thats right jack said its from one of those tiny pieces i was able to find of franconis liver hmmm laurie commented continuing to look into the microscope thats weird they would have used an infected liver for a transplant youd think they would have screened the donor better are there a lot of these tiny granulomas maureen has only given me one slide of the liver so far jack said and thats the only granuloma i found so my guess would be that there arent a lot but i did see one on the frozen section also on the frozen section were tiny collapsed cysts on the surface of the liver which would have been visible to the naked eye the transplant team must have known and didnt care at least theres no general inflammation laurie said so the transplant was being tolerated pretty well extremely well jack said too well but thats another issue what do you think that is under the pointer laurie played with the focus so that she could visually move up and down in the section there were a few curious flecks of basophilic material i dont know i cant even be sure its not artifact dont know either jack said unless its what stimulated the granuloma thats a thought laurie said she straightened up what did you mean by the liver being tolerated too well the lab reported that franconi had not been taking any immunosuppressant drugs jack said that seems highly improbable since there is no general inflammation are we sure it was a transplant laurie asked absolutely jack said he summarized what ted lynch had reported to him laurie was as puzzled as jack except for identical twins i cant imagine two peoples dq alpha sequences being exactly the same she said it sounds like you know more about it than i do jack said until a couple of days ago id never even heard of dq alpha have you made any headway as to where franconi could have had this transplant laurie asked i wish jack said he then told laurie about barts vain efforts jack explained that he himself had spent a good portion of the previous night calling centers all over europe good lord laurie remarked ive even enlisted lous help jack said i found out from franconis mother that hed gone off to what she thought was a spa and came home a new man im thinking thats when he might have gotten the transplant unfortunately she has no idea where he went lous checking immigration to see if hed gone out of the country if anyone can find out lou can laurie said by the way jack said assuming a teasingly superior air lou fessed up that he was the source of the leak about franconi to the newspapers i dont believe it laurie said i got it from the horses mouth jack said so i expect an abject apology youve got it laurie said im amazed did he give any reason he said they wanted to release the information right away to see if it would smoke out any more tips from informers he said it worked to an extent they got a tip which was later confirmed that franconis body had been taken under orders from the lucia crime family good grief laurie said and shuddered this case is starting to remind me too much of the cerino affair i know what you mean jack said instead of eyes its livers you dont suppose theres a private hospital here in the united states thats doing undercover liver transplants do you laurie asked i cant imagine jack said no doubt there could be big money involved but there is the issue of supply i mean theres seven thousand plus people in this country waiting for livers as it is few of these people have the money to make it worthwhile i wish i were as confident as you laurie said the profit motive has taken over american medicine by storm but the big money in medicine is in volume jack said there are too few wealthy people who need livers the investment in the physical plant and the requisite secrecy wouldnt pay off especially without a supply of organs youd have to postulate some modern version of burk and hare and although such a scenario might work in a b movie in reality it would be too risky and uncertain no businessman in his right mind would go for it no matter how venal maybe you have a point laurie said im convinced theres something else involved here jack said there are just too many unexplained facts from the dq alpha nonsense to the fact that franconi wasnt taking any immunosuppressant drugs were missing something something key something unexpected what an effort laurie exclaimed one thing is for sure im glad i foisted this case onto you thanks for nothing jack quipped its certainly a frustrating case on a happier note last night at basketball warren told me that natalie has been asking about you what do you say that we all get together this weekend for dinner and maybe a movie provided they dont have any plans id enjoy that very much laurie said i hope you told warren that i was asking about them as well i did jack admitted not to change the subject but how was your day did you make any headway in figuring out how franconi managed to go on his overnight i mean lou telling us that a crime family was responsible isnt telling us a whole bunch we need specifics unfortunately no laurie admitted i was caught in the pit until just a little while ago ive gotten nothing done that id planned too bad jack said with a smile with my lack of progress i might have to rely on you providing the breakthrough after promises to talk with each other by phone that evening specifically about the weekend plans laurie headed to her own office with good intentions she sat down at her desk and started to go through the lab reports and other correspondence that had come in that day involving her uncompleted cases but she found it difficult to concentrate jacks generosity in crediting her with providing the breakthrough in the franconi case only made her feel guilty for not coming up with a working hypothesis about how franconis body was taken seeing the effort jack was expending on the case made her want to redouble her efforts pulling out a fresh sheet of paper laurie began to write down everything marvin had related her intuition told her that franconis mysterious abduction had to involve the two bodies that went out the same night and now that lou had said the lucia crime family was implicated she was more convinced than ever that the spoletto funeral home was somehow involved raymond replaced the phone and raised his eyes to darlene whod come into his study well darlene asked she had her blond hair pulled back into a ponytail shed been working out on an exercise bike in the other room and was clothed in sexy workout gear raymond leaned back in his desk chair and sighed he even smiled things seem to be working out he said that was the gensys operational officer up in cambridge mass the plane will be available tomorrow evening so ill be on my way to africa of course well stop to refuel but i dont know where yet can i come darlene asked hopefully im afraid not dear raymond said he reached out and took her by the hand he knew hed been difficult over the previous couple of days and felt badly he guided her around the desk and urged her to sit on his lap as soon as she did he was sorry she was after all a big woman with the patient and the surgical team therell be too many people on the plane on the return trip he managed even though his face was becoming red darlene sighed and pouted i never get to go anywhere next time raymond croaked he patted her on her back and eased her up into a standing position its just a short trip there and back its not going to be fun with a sudden burst of tears darlene fled from the room raymond considered following her to console her but a glance at his desk clock changed his mind it was after three and therefore after nine in cogo if he wanted to talk to siegfried he felt hed better try now raymond called the managers home the housekeeper put siegfried on the line things still going okay raymond asked expectantly perfectly siegfried said my last update on the patients condition was fine he couldnt be doing any better thats reassuring raymond said i suppose that means our harvest bonuses will be forthcoming siegfried said of course raymond said although he knew there would be a delay with the necessity of raising twenty thousand cash for vinnie dominick bonuses would have to wait until the next initiation fee came in what about the situation with kevin marshall raymond asked everything is back to normal siegfried said except for one incident when they went back to the staging area around lunch time that hardly sounds normal raymond complained calm down siegfried said they only went back to look for melanie beckets sunglasses nevertheless they ended up getting fired at again by the soldiers id posted out there siegfried laughed heartily raymond waited until siegfried had calmed down whats so funny raymond asked those numbskull soldiers shot out melanies rear window siegfried said it made her very angry but it had the desired effect now im really sure they wont be going out there again i should hope not raymond said besides i had an opportunity to have a drink with the two women this afternoon siegfried said i have a feeling our nerdy researcher has something risque going on what are you talking about raymond asked i dont believe hell be having the time or the energy to worry about smoke from isla francesca siegfried said i think hes got himself involved in a mÃ©nage Ã  trois seriously raymond asked such an idea seemed preposterous for the kevin marshall raymond knew in all of raymonds dealing with kevin marshall hed never expressed the slightest interest in the opposite sex the idea hed have the inclination and stamina for one woman let alone two seemed ludicrous that was the implication i got siegfried said you should have heard the two women carrying on about their cute researcher thats what they called him and they were on their way to kevins for a dinner party thats the first dinner party hes ever had as far as i know and i live right across from him i suppose we should be thankful raymond said envious is a better word siegfried said with another burst of laughter that grated on raymonds nerves ive called to say that ill be leaving here tomorrow evening raymond said i cant say when ill arrive in bata because i dont know where well refuel ill have to call from the refueling stop or have the pilots radio ahead anyone else coming with you siegfried asked not that i know of raymond said i doubt it because well be almost full on the way back well be waiting for you siegfried said see you soon raymond said maybe you could bring our bonuses with you siegfried suggested ill see if it can be arranged raymond said he hung up the phone and smiled he shook his head in amazement concerning kevin marshalls behavior you never know raymond commented out loud as he got up and started from the room he wanted to find darlene and cheer her up he thought that maybe as a consolation they should go out to dinner at her favorite restaurant jack had scoured the single liver section maureen had given him from one end to the other hed even used his oilimmersion lens to stare vainly at the basophilic specks in the heart of the tiny granuloma he still had no idea whether they were a true finding and if they were what they were having exhausted his histological and pathological knowledge with respect to the slide he was about to take it over to the pathology department at new york university hospital when his phone rang it was chets call from north carolina so jack asked the appropriate question and wrote down the response hanging up the phone jack got his jacket from the file cabinet with the jacket on he picked up the microscopic slide only to have the phone ring again this time it was lou soldano bingo lou said cheerfully i got some good news for you im all ears jack said he slipped out of his bomber jacket and sat down i put in a call to my friend in immigration and he just phoned me back lou said when i asked him your question he told me to hang on the line i could even hear him entering the name into the computer two seconds later he had the info carlo franconi entered the country exactly thirtyseven days ago on january twentyninth at teterboro in new jersey ive never heard of teterboro jack said its a private airport lou said its for general aviation but theres lots of fancy corporate jets out there because of the fields proximity to the city was carlo franconi on a corporate jet jack asked i dont know lou said all i got is the planes call letters or numbers or whatever they call it you know the numbers and letters on the airplanes tail lets see i got it right here it was nsu was there any indication where the plane had come from jack asked as he wrote down the alphanumeric characters and the date oh yeah lou said thats gotta be filed the plane came from lyon france nah it couldnt have jack said thats whats in the computer lou said why dont you think its correct because i talked with the french organ allocation organization early this morning jack said they had no record of an american with the name of franconi and they categorically denied theyd be transplanting an american since they have a long waiting list for french citizens the information that immigration has must correlate with the flight plan filed with both the faa and the european equivalent lou said at least thats how i understand it do you think your friend in immigration has a contact in france jack asked it wouldnt surprise me lou said those upperechelon guys have to cooperate with each other i can ask him why would you like to know if franconi was in france id like to find out the day he arrived jack said and id like to know any other information the french might have on where he went in the country they keep close tabs on most noneuropean foreigners through their hotels okay let me see what i can do lou said let me call him and ill call you back one other thing jack said how can we find out who owns nsu thats easy lou said all you have to do is call the faa control aviation center in oklahoma city anybody can do it but ive got a friend there too jeez you have friends in all the convenient places jack remarked it comes with the territory lou said we do favors for each other all the time if you have to wait for everything to go through channels nothing gets done its certainly convenient for me to take advantage of your web of contacts jack said so you want me to call my friend at the faa lou asked ill be much obliged jack said hey its my pleasure lou said i have a feeling that the more i help you the more im helping myself id like nothing better than to have this case solved it might save my job im leaving my office to run over to the university hospital jack said what if i call you back in a half hour or so perfect lou said before disconnecting jack shook his head like everything else with this case the information hed gotten from lou was both surprising and confusing france probably was the last country jack suspected franconi to have visited after donning his coat for the second time jack left his office given the proximity of the university hospital he didnt bother with his bike it only took ten minutes by foot inside the busy medical center jack took the elevator up to the pathology department he was hoping that dr malovar would be available peter malovar was a giant in the field and even at the age of eightytwo he was one of the sharpest pathologists jack had ever met jack made it a point to go to seminars dr malovar offered once a month so when jack had a question about pathology he didnt go to bingham because binghams strong point was forensics not general pathology instead jack went to dr malovar the professors in his lab as usual the harried pathology department secretary said you know where it is jack nodded and walked down to the aged frostedglass door which led to what was known as malovars lair jack knocked when there was no response he tried the door it was unlocked inside he found dr malovar bent over his beloved microscope the elderly man looked a little like einstein with wild gray hair and a full mustache he also had kyphotic posture as if his body had been specifically designed to bend over and peer into a microscope of his five senses only his hearing had deteriorated over the years the professor greeted jack cursorily while hungrily eyeing the slide in his hand he loved people to bring him problematic cases a fact that jack had taken advantage of on many occasion jack tried to give a little history of the case as he passed the slide to the professor but dr malovar lifted his hand to quiet him dr malovar was a true detective who didnt want anyone elses impressions to influence his own the aged professor replaced the slide hed been studying with jacks without a word he scanned it for all of one minute raising his head dr malovar put a drop of oil on the slide and switched to his oilimmersion lens for higher magnification once again he examined the slide for only a matter of seconds dr malovar looked up at jack interesting he said which was a high compliment coming from him because of his hearing problem he spoke loudly theres a small granuloma of the liver as well as the cicatrix of another looking at the granuloma i think i might be seeing some merozoites but i cant be sure jack nodded he assumed that dr malovar was referring to the tiny basophilic flecks jack had seen in the core of the granuloma dr malovar reached for his phone he called a colleague and asked him to come over for a moment within minutes a tall thin overly serious africanamerican man in a long white coat appeared dr malovar introduced him as dr colin osgood chief of parasitology whats your opinion colin dr malovar asked as he gestured toward his microscope dr osgood looked at the slide for a few seconds longer than dr malovar had before responding definitely parasitic he intoned with his eyes still glued to the eye pieces those are merozoites but i dont recognize them its either a new species or a parasite not seen in humans i recommend that dr lander hammersmith view it and render his opinion good idea dr malovar said he looked at jack would you mind leaving this overnight ill have dr hammersmith view it in the morning who is dr hammersmith jack asked hes a veterinary pathologist dr osgood said fine by me jack said agreeably having the slide reviewed by a veterinary pathologist was something hed not thought of after thanking both men jack went back out to the secretary and asked if he could use a phone the secretary directed him to an empty desk and told him to push nine for an outside line jack called lou at police headquarters hey glad you called lou said i think im getting some interesting stuff here first of all the plane is quite a plane its a g does that mean anything to you i dont think so jack said from lous tone it sounded as if it should have it stands for gulfstream lou explained its what you would call the rolls royce of the corporate jet its like twenty million bucks im impressed jack said you should be lou said okay lets see what else i learned ah here it is the plane is owned by alpha aviation out of reno nevada ever hear of them nope jack said have you not me lou said must be a leasing organization lets see what else oh yeah this might be the most interesting my friend from immigration called his counterpart in france at his home if you can believe it and asked about carlo franconis recent french holiday apparently this french bureaucrat can access the immigration mainframe from his own pc because guess what im on pins and needles jack said franconi never visited france lou said not unless he had a fake passport and fake name theres no record of his entering or departing so whats this about the plane incontrovertibly coming from lyon france jack demanded hey dont get testy lou said im not jack said i was only responding to your point that the flight plan and the immigration information had to correlate they do lou said saying the plane came from lyon france doesnt mean anybody or everybody got out it could have refueled for all i know good point jack said i didnt think of that how can we find out i suppose i can call my friend back at the faa lou said great jack said im heading back to my office at the morgue you want me to call you or you call me ill call you lou said after laurie had written down all that she could remember from her conversation with marvin concerning how bodies were picked up by funeral homes shed put the paper aside and ignored it while she did some other busy work a half hour later she picked it back up with her mind clear she tried to read it with fresh eyes on the second readthrough something jumped out at her namely how many times the term accession number appeared of course she wasnt surprised after all the accession number was to a body what a social security number was to a living individual it was a form of identification that allowed the morgue to keep track of the thousands of bodies and consequent paperwork that passed through its portals whenever a body arrived at the medical examiners office the first thing that happened was that it was given an accession number the second thing that happened was that a tag with the number was tied around the big toe looking at the word accession laurie realized to her surprise that if asked she wouldnt have been able to define it it was a word shed just accepted and used on a daily basis every laboratory slip and report every x ray film every investigators report every document intramurally had the accession number in many ways it was more important than the victims name taking her american heritage dictionary from its shelf laurie looked up the word accession as she began reading the definitions none of them made any sense in the context of the words use at the morgue until the next to last entry there it was defined as admittance in other words the accession number was just another way of saying admittance number laurie searched for the accession numbers and names of the bodies that had been picked up during the night shift of march fourth when franconis body disappeared she found the piece of scratch paper beneath a slide tray on it was written dorothy kline and frank gleason thanks to her musing about accession numbers laurie noticed something shed not paid any attention to before the fact that the accession numbers differed by over a thousand that was strange because the numbers were given out sequentially knowing the approximate volume of bodies processed through the morgue laurie estimated that there must have been several weeks separation between the arrivals of these two individuals the time differential was strange since bodies rarely stayed at the morgue more than a couple of days so laurie keyed frank gleasons accession number into her computer terminal his was the body picked up by the spoletto funeral home what popped up on the screen surprised her good grief laurie exclaimed lou was having a great time contrary to the general publics romantic image of detective work actual gumshoeing was an exhausting thankless task what lou was doing now namely sitting in the comfort of his office and making productive telephone calls was both entertaining and fulfilling it was also nice to say hello to old acquaintances my word soldano mark servert commented mark was lous contact at the faa in oklahoma city i dont hear from you for a year and then twice in the same day this must be some case its a corker lou said and i have a followup question we found out that the g plane i called you about earlier had flown from lyon france to teterboro new jersey on january twentyninth however the guy were interested in didnt pass through french immigration so were wondering if its possible to find out where nsu came from before it landed in lyon now thats a tricky question mark said i know the icao wait a second lou interrupted keep the acronyms to a minimum whats the icao international civil aviation organization mark said i know they file all flight plans in and out of europe perfect lou said anybody there you can call theres someone i can call mark said but it wouldnt do you much good the icao shreds all their files after fifteen days its not stored wonderful lou commented sarcastically the same goes for the european air traffic control center in brussels mark said theres just too much material considering all the commercial flights so theres no way lou remarked im thinking mark said you want to call me back lou said ill be here for another hour or so yeah let me do that mark said lou was about to hang up when he heard mark yell his name i just thought of something else mark said theres an organization called central flow management with offices in both paris and brussels theyre the ones who provide the slot times for takeoffs and landings they handle all of europe except for austria and slovenia who knows why those countries arent involved so if nsu came from anyplace other than austria or slovenia their flight plan should be on file do you know anybody in that organization lou asked no but i know somebody who does mark said let me see if i can find out for you hey i appreciate it lou said no problem mark said lou hung up the phone and then drummed his pencil on the surface of his scarred and battleworn graymetal desk there were innumerable burn marks where hed left smoldering cigarette butts he was thinking about alpha aviation and wondering how to run down the organization first he tried telephone information in reno there was no listing for alpha aviation lou wasnt surprised next he called the reno police department he explained who he was and asked to be connected to his equivalent the head of homicide his name was paul hersey after a few minutes of friendly banter lou gave paul a thumbnail sketch of the franconi case then he asked about alpha aviation never heard of them paul said the faa said it was out of reno nevada lou said thats because nevadas an easy state to incorporate in paul explained and here in reno weve got a slew of highpriced law firms who spend their time doing nothing else whats your suggestion about getting the lowdown on the organization lou asked call the office of the nevada secretary of state in carson city paul said if alpha aviation is incorporated in nevada it will be on public record want us to call for you ill call lou said at this point im not even sure what i want to know we can at least give you the number paul said he went off the line for a moment and lou could hear him bark an order to an underling a moment later he was back and gave lou the telephone number then he added they should be helpful but if you have any trouble call me back and if you need any assistance in carson city for whatever reason call todd arronson hes head of homicide down there and hes a good guy a few minutes later lou was on the line with the office of the nevada secretary of state an operator connected him to a clerk who couldnt have been nicer or more cooperative her name was brenda whitehall lou explained that he was interested to find out all he could about alpha aviation out of reno nevada just a moment please brenda said lou could hear the woman typing the name onto a keyboard okay here it is she added hang on and let me pull the folder lou lifted his feet up onto his desk and leaned back in his chair he felt an almost irresistible urge to light up but he fought it im back brenda said lou could hear the rustle of papers now what is it that you want to know what do you have lou asked i have the articles of incorporation brenda said there was a short period of silence while she read then she added its a limited partnership and the general partner is alpha management what does that mean in plain english lou asked im not a lawyer or a businessman it simply means that alpha management is the corporation that runs the limited partnership brenda said patiently does it have any peoples names lou asked of course brenda said the articles of incorporation have to have the names and addresses of the directors the registered agent for service of process and the officers of the corporation that sounds encouraging lou said could you give them to me lou could hear the sound of rustling papers hmmmm brenda commented actually in this instance theres only one name and address one person is wearing all those hats according to this document brenda said whats the name and address lou asked he reached for a piece of paper its samuel hartman of the firm wheeler hartman gottlieb and sawyer their address is eight rodeo drive reno that sounds like a law firm lou said it is brenda said i recognize the name thats no help lou said he knew that the chances of getting any information out of a law firm were unlikely a lot of nevada corporations are set up like this brenda explained but lets see if there are any amendments lou was already thinking of calling paul back to get the rundown on samuel hartman when brenda made a murmur of discovery there are amendments she said at the first board meeting of alpha management mr hartman resigned as president and secretary in his place frederick rouse was appointed is there an address for mr rouse lou asked there is brenda said his title is chief financial officer of the gensys corporation the address is kendall square cambridge massachusetts lou got all the information written down and thanked brenda he was particularly appreciative because he couldnt imagine getting the same service from his own secretary of states office in albany lou was about to call jack to give him the information about the ownership of the plane when the phone literally rang under his hand it was mark servert calling back already you are in luck mark said the fellow im acquainted with who knows people in the central flow management organization in europe happened to be on the job when i called him in fact hes in your neck of the woods hes out at kennedy airport helping direct air traffic across the north atlantic he talks to these central flow management people all the time so he slipped in a query about nsu on january twentyninth apparently it popped right up on the screen nsu flew into lyon from bata equatorial guinea whoa lou said wheres that beats me mark said without looking at a map id guess west africa curious lou said its also curious that as soon as the plane touched down in lyon france it radioed to obtain a slot time to depart for teterboro new jersey mark said near as i can figure it just sat on the runway until it got clearance maybe it refueled lou offered could be mark said even so i would have expected them to have filed a throughflight plan with a stop in lyon rather than two separate flight plans i mean they could have gotten hung up in lyon for hours it was taking a chance maybe they just changed their minds lou said its possible mark agreed or maybe they didnt want anyone knowing they were coming from equatorial guinea lou suggested now thats an idea that wouldnt have crossed my mind mark admitted i suppose thats why youre an engaging detective and im a boring faa bureaucrat lou laughed engaging im not on the contrary im afraid this job has made me cynical and suspicious its better than being boring mark said lou thanked his friend for his help and after they exchanged the usual wellmeaning promises to get together they hung up for a few minutes lou sat and marveled at why a twentymilliondollar airplane was carrying a midlevel crime boss from queens new york from some african country lou had never heard of such a thirdworld backwater certainly wasnt a medical mecca where a person would go to have sophisticated surgery like a liver transplant after entering frank gleasons accession number into the computer laurie sat pondering the apparent discrepancy for some time shed tried to imagine what the information meant in terms of the franconi body disappearance slowly an idea took root suddenly pushing back from her desk laurie headed to the morgue level to look for marvin he wasnt in the mortuary office she found him by stepping into the walkin cooler he was busy moving the gurneys around to prepare for body pickups the moment laurie entered the cooler she flashed on the horrid experience shed had during the cerino affair inside the walkin unit the memory made her distinctly uncomfortable and she decided against attempting to have a conversation with marvin while inside instead she asked him to meet her back in the mortuary office when he was finished five minutes later marvin appeared he plopped a sheaf of papers on the desk and then went to a sink in the corner to wash his hands everything in order laurie asked just to make conversation i think so marvin said he came to the desk and sat down he began arranging the documents in the order that the bodies were to be picked up after talking with you earlier i learned something quite surprising laurie said getting to the point of her visit like what marvin said he finished arranging the papers and sat back i entered frank gleasons accession number into the computer laurie said and i found out that his body had come into the morgue over two weeks ago there was no name associated with it it was an unidentified corpse no shit marvin exclaimed then realizing what hed said he added i mean im surprised so was i laurie said i tried to call dr besserman whod done the original autopsy i wanted to ask if the body had been recently identified as frank gleason but hes out of the office do you think it was surprising that mike passano didnt know the body was still labeled in the computer as an unidentified corpse not really marvin said im not sure i would have either i mean you enter the accession number just to find out if the body is released you dont really worry too much about the name that was the impression you gave me earlier laurie said there was also something else you said that ive been mulling over you said that sometimes you dont get the body yourself but rather one of the funeral home people does sometimes marvin said but it only happens if two people come and if theyve been here lots of times so they know the process its just a way of speeding things up one of them goes to the cooler to get the body while me and the other guy finish the documents how well do you know mike passano laurie asked as well as i know most of the other techs marvin said you and i have known each other for six years laurie said i think of us as friends yeah i suppose marvin said warily id like you to do something for me as a friend laurie said but only if it doesnt make you feel uncomfortable like what marvin said id like you to call mike passano and tell him that i found out that one of the bodies that he sent out the night franconi disappeared was an unidentified corpse thats strange man marvin said why would i be calling him rather than just waiting for him to come on duty you can act like you just heard it which is the case laurie said and you can say that you thought he should know right away since he was on duty that night i dont know man marvin said unconvinced the key thing is that coming from you it wont be confrontational laurie said if i call hell think im accusing him and im interested to hear his reaction without his feeling defensive but more important id like you to ask him if there were two people from spoletto funeral home that night and if there were two whether he can remember who actually went to get the body thats like setting him up man marvin complained i dont see it that way laurie said if anything it gives him a chance to clear himself you see i think the spoletto people took franconi i dont feel comfortable calling him marvin said hes going to know something is up why dont you call him yourself you know what im saying i already told you i think hell be too defensive laurie said last time he was defensive when i asked him purely vague questions but okay if you feel uncomfortable i dont want you to do it instead i want you to go on a little hunt with me now what marvin asked his patience was wearing thin can you produce a list of all the refrigerator compartments that are occupied at the moment laurie asked sure thats easy marvin said please laurie said while gesturing towards marvins computer terminal while youre at it make two copies marvin shrugged and sat down using a relatively rapid huntandpeck style he directed the computer to produce the list laurie wanted he handed the two sheets to her the moment they came out of the printer excellent laurie said glancing at the sheets come on as she left the mortuary office she waved over her shoulder marvin followed at her heels they walked down the stained cement corridor to the giant island that dominated the morgue on opposite sides were the banks of refrigerated compartments used to store the bodies before autopsy laurie handed one of the lists to marvin i want to search every compartment that is not occupied laurie said you take this side and ill take the other marvin rolled his eyes but took the list he started opening the compartments peering inside then slamming the doors laurie went around to the other side of the island and did the same uhoh marvin intoned after five minutes laurie paused what is it youd better come over here marvin said laurie walked around the island marvin was standing at the far end of the island scratching his head while staring at his list in front of him was an open refrigerated compartment this one is supposed to be empty marvin said laurie glanced within and felt her pulse race inside was a naked male corpse with no tag on its big toe the number of the compartment was ninetyfour it wasnt too far away from number one eleven where franconi was supposed to have been marvin slid out the tray it rattled on its ball bearings in the stillness of the deserted morgue the body was a middleaged male with signs of extensive trauma to the legs and torso well this explains it laurie said her voice reflected an improbable mixture of triumph anger and fear its the unidentified corpse hed been a hitandrun accident on the fdr drive jack stepped off the elevator and could hear a phone ringing insistently as he proceeded down the hall he became progressively aware it had to be his phone especially since his office was the only one with an open door jack picked up speed and then almost missed his door as he slid on the vinyl flooring he snapped the phone off the hook just in time it was lou where the hell have you been lou complained i got stuck over at the university hospital jack said after jack had last talked with lou dr malovar had appeared and had him look at some forensic slides for him so soon on the heels of his consulting malovar jack didnt feel he could refuse ive been calling every fifteen minutes lou remarked sorry jack said ive got some surprising information that ive been dying to give you lou said this is one weird case thats not telling me anything i didnt already know jack said what did you learn movement out of the corner of jacks eye attracted his attention turning his head he saw laurie standing in the doorway she did not look normal her eyes were blazing her mouth was set in an angry grimace and her skin was the color of ivory wait a sec jack said interrupting lou laurie what the hell is the matter i have to talk with you laurie sputtered sure jack said but could it wait for two minutes he pointed at the phone to indicate that he was talking with someone now laurie barked okay okay jack repeated it was clear to him she was as tense as a piano wire about to snap listen lou jack said into the phone laurie just came in and shes upset let me call you right back hold on laurie snapped is that lou soldano youre talking with yeah jack said hesitantly for an irrational instant he thought that laurie was overwrought because he was talking with lou where is he laurie demanded jack shrugged i guess hes in his office ask him laurie snapped jack posed the question and lou answered in the affirmative jack nodded to laurie hes there he said tell him were coming down to see him laurie said jack hesitated he was confused tell him laurie repeated tell him were leaving right away did you hear that jack asked lou laurie then disappeared down the corridor toward her office i did lou said whats going on damned if i know jack said she just barreled in unless i call you right back well be there fine lou said ill wait jack hung up the phone and rushed out into the hall laurie was already on her way back and was struggling into her coat she eyed him as she brushed past on her way to the elevators jack hustled to catch up with her whats happened jack asked hesitantly he was afraid to upset her any more than she already was im about ninetynine percent sure how franconis body was taken from here laurie said angrily and two things are becoming clear first the spoletto funeral home was involved and second the abduction was surely abetted by someone who works here and to tell you the truth im not sure which of these two things bothers me more jeez look at that traffic franco ponti said to angelo facciolo im sure as hell glad were going into manhattan instead of going out franco and angelo were in francos black cadillac heading west on the queensborough bridge it was fivethirty the height of rush hour both men were dressed as if they were going to a ritzy dinner what order do you want to do this in franco asked angelo shrugged maybe the girl first he said his face twisted into a slight smile youre looking forward to this arent you franco commented angelo raised his eyebrows as much as his facial scar tissue would allow five years ive been dreaming about seeing this broad professionally he said i guess i never thought i would get my chance i know i dont have to remind you that we follow orders franco said to the letter cerino was never so specific angelo said hed just tell us to do a job he didnt tell us how to do it thats why cerino is in jail and vinnie is running the show franco said ill tell you what angelo said why dont we do a drive by jack stapletons place ive already been inside laurie montgomerys apartment so i know what were getting ourselves into but im a little surprised by this other address west one hundredsixth street isnt where id expect a doctor to be living i think a driveby sounds smart franco said when they reached manhattan franco continued west on fiftyninth street he rounded the southern end of central park and headed north on central park west angelo thought back to the fateful day on the pier of the american fresh fruit company when laurie caused the explosion angelo had had skin problems from chicken pox and acne but it had been the burns he suffered because of laurie montgomery that had turned him into what he called a freak franco posed a question but angelo hadnt heard him because of his angry musings he had to ask him to repeat it i bet youd like to stick it to that laurie montgomery franco said if it had been me i sure would angelo let out a sarcastic laugh unconsciously he moved his left arm so that he could feel the reassuring mass of his walther tph auto pistol snuggled into its shoulder holster franco turned left onto one hundredsixth street they passed a playground on the right that was in full use particularly the basketball court there were lots of people standing on the sidelines it must be on the left franco said angelo consulted the piece of paper he was holding with jacks address its coming up he said its the building with the fancy top franco slowed and then stopped to doublepark a few buildings short of jacks on the opposite side of the street a car behind beeped franco lowered his window and motioned for the car to pass there was cursing as the car did so franco shook his head you hear that guy nobody in this city has any manners why would a doctor live there angelo said he was eyeing jacks building through the front windshield franco shook his head doesnt make any sense to me the building looks like a dump amendola said he was a little strange angelo said apparently he rides a bike from here all the way down to the morgue at first avenue and thirtieth street every day no way franco commented thats what amendola said angelo said francos eyes scanned the area the whole neighborhood is a dump maybe hes into drugs angelo opened the car door and got out where are you going franco asked i want to check to make sure he lives here angelo said amendola said his apartment is the fourth floor rear ill be right back angelo rounded the car and waited for a break in the traffic he crossed the street and climbed to the stoop in front of jacks building calmly he pushed open the outer door and glanced at the mailboxes many were broken none had locks that worked quickly angelo sorted through the mail as soon as he came across a catalogue addressed to jack stapleton he put it all back next he tried the inner door it opened with ease stepping into the front hall angelo took a breath there was an unpleasant musty odor he eyed the trash on the stairs the peeling paint and the broken light bulbs in the onceelegant chandelier up on the second floor he could hear the sounds of a domestic fight with muffled screaming angelo smiled dealing with jack stapleton was going to be easy the tenement looked like a crack house returning to the front of the house angelo took a step away to determine which underground passageway belonged to jacks building each house had a sunken corridor reached by a half dozen steps these corridors led to the backyards after deciding which was the appropriate one angelo gingerly walked its length there were puddles and refuse which threatened his bruno magli shoes the backyard was a tumult of decaying and collapsed fencing rotting mattresses abandoned tires and other trash after carefully picking his way a few feet from the building angelo turned to look at the fire escape on the fourth floor two windows had access the windows were dark the doctor wasnt at home angelo returned and climbed back into the car well franco asked he lives there all right angelo said the building is worse on the inside if you can believe it its not locked i could hear a couple fighting on the second floor and someone elses tv on full blast the place is not pretty but for our purposes its perfect itll be easy thats what i like to hear franco said should we still do the woman first angelo smiled as best he could why deny myself franco put the car in gear they headed south on columbus avenue to broadway then cut across town to second avenue soon they were on nineteenth street angelo didnt need the address he pointed out lauries building without difficulty franco found a convenient noparking zone and parked so you think we should go up the back way franco said while eyeing the building for several reasons angelo said shes on the fifth floor but her windows face the back to tell if shes there we have to go back there anyway also shes got a nosy neighbor who lives in the front and you can see her lights are on this woman opened her door to gawk at me the two times i was up at montgomerys front door besides montgomerys apartment has access to the back stairs and the back stairs dump directly into the backyard i know because we chased her out that way im convinced franco said lets do it franco and angelo got out of the car angelo opened up the backseat and lifted out his bag of lockpicking tools along with a halligan bar a tool firefighters use to get through doors in cases of emergency the two men headed for the passageway to the backyard i heard she got away from you and tony ruggerio franco said at least for a while she must be quite a number dont remind me angelo said of course working with tony was like carrying around a bucket of sand emerging into the backyard which was a dark warren of neglected gardens franco and angelo carefully moved away from the building far enough to see up to the fifth floor the windows were all dark looks like we have time to prepare a nice homecoming franco said angelo didnt answer instead he took his lockpicking tools over to the metal fire door that led to the back stairs he slipped on a tightfitting pair of leather gloves while franco readied the flashlight at first angelos hands shook from sheer anticipatory excitement of coming facetoface with laurie montgomery after five years of smoldering resentment when the lock resisted angelos efforts he made a point to control himself and concentrate the lock responded and the door opened five floors up angelo didnt bother with the lockpicking tools he knew that laurie had several dead bolts he used the halligan bar with a quiet splintering sound it made short work of the door within twenty seconds they were inside for a few minutes the two men stood motionless in the darkness of lauries pantry so that they could listen they wanted to be certain there were no sounds suggestive that their forced entry had been noticed by any of the other tenants jesus christ franco forcibly whispered something just touched my leg what is it angelo demanded hed not expected such an outburst and it caused his heart to flutter oh its only a goddamn cat franco said with relief all at once both men could hear the animal purring in the darkness arent we lucky angelo said that will be a nice touch bring it along slowly the men made their way from the pantry through the dark kitchen and into the living room there they could see significantly better with the city night light coming through the windows so far so good angelo said now we just have to wait franco said maybe ill see if theres any beer or wine in the refrigerator are you interested a beer would be nice angelo said at police headquarters laurie and jack had to get id badges and go through a metal detector before they were allowed to go up to lous floor lou was at the elevator to welcome them the first thing he did was take laurie by the shoulders look her in the eye and ask what had happened shes okay jack said patting lou reassuringly on the back shes back to her old rational calm self really lou questioned still giving laurie a close inspection laurie couldnt help but smile under lous intense scrutiny jacks right she said im fine in fact im embarrassed i made us rush down here lou breathed a sigh of relief well im happy to see both of you come on back to my palace he led the way to his office i can offer you coffee but i strongly advise against it lou said at this time of day the janitorial staff considers it strong enough to clean out sink drains were fine laurie said she took a chair jack did likewise he glanced around the spartan quarters with an unpleasant shiver the last time hed been there about a year ago it had been after hed narrowly escaped an attempt on his life i think i figured out how franconis body was taken from the morgue laurie began you teased me about suspecting the spoletto funeral home but now i think youre going to have to take that back in fact i think its time that you took over laurie then outlined what she thought had happened she told lou that she suspected that someone from the medical examiners office had given the spoletto people the accession number of a relatively recent unidentified body as well as the location of franconis remains often when two drivers come to pick up a body for a funeral home one of them goes in the walkin cooler while the other handles the paperwork with the mortuary tech laurie explained in these instances the mortuary tech prepares the body for pickup by covering it with a sheet and positioning its gurney in a convenient location just inside the cooler door in the franconi situation i believe the driver took the body whose accession number he had removed its tag stashed the body in one of the many unoccupied refrigerator compartments replaced franconis tag with that one and then calmly appeared outside the mortuary office with franconis remains all the tech did at that point was check the accession number thats quite a scenario lou said can i ask if you have any proof of this or is it all conjecture i found the body whose accession number spoletto called in laurie said it was in a compartment which was supposed to be vacant the name frank gleason was bogus ahhhh lou said becoming much more interested he leaned forward on his desk im beginning to like this very much especially considering the matrimonial association between the spoletto and the lucia people this could be something important it kinda reminds me of getting al capone on tax evasion i mean it would be fantastic if we could get some of the lucia people on body theft of course it also raises the specter of an organized crime connection to illicit liver transplantation jack said this could be a frightening association dangerous as well lou said so i must insist on no more amateur sleuthing on your part we take over from here do i have your word on that im happy to let you take over laurie said but there is also the issue of a mole in the medical examiners office i think its best i deal with that too lou said with the involvement of organized crime id expect some element of extortion or criminal coercion but ill deal directly with bingham i shouldnt have to warn you that these people are dangerous i learned that lesson all too well laurie said im too preoccupied with my end of the mystery to interfere jack said what did you learn for me plenty lou said he reached over to the corner of his desk and hefted a large book the size of a coffeetable art book with a grunt he handed it to jack with a look of confusion jack cracked the book what the hell he commented whats an atlas for because youre going to need it lou said i cant tell you how long it took me to scrounge one up here at police headquarters i dont get it jack said my contact at the faa was able to call someone who knew someone who works in a european organization that doles out landing and takeoff times all over europe lou explained they also get the flight plans and store them for over sixty days franconis g came to france from equatorial guinea where jack questioned as his eyebrows collided in an expression of total confusion i never even heard of equatorial guinea is it a country check out page one hundred fiftytwo lou said whats this about a franconi and a g laurie asked a g is a private jet lou explained i was able to find out for jack that franconi had been out of the country we thought hed been in france until i got this new information jack got to page in the atlas it was a map labeled the western congo basin covering a huge portion of western africa all right give me a hint jack said lou pointed over jacks shoulder its this little tiny country between cameroon and gabon the city that the plane flew out of is bata on the coast he pointed to the appropriate dot the atlas depicted the country as mostly uninterrupted green laurie got up from her chair and looked over jacks other shoulder i think i remember hearing about that country one time i think thats where the writer frederick forsyth went to write dogs of war lou slapped the top of his head in utter amazement how do you remember stuff like that i cant remember where i had lunch last tuesday laurie shrugged i read a lot of novels she said writers interest me this doesnt make any sense whatsoever jack complained this is an undeveloped part of africa this country must be covered with nothing but jungle in fact this whole part of africa is nothing but jungle franconi couldnt have gotten a liver transplant there that was my reaction too lou said but the other information makes a little more sense i tracked alpha aviation through its nevada management corporation to its real owner its gensys corp in cambridge massachusetts ive heard of gensys laurie said its a biotech firm thats big in vaccines and lymphokines i remember because a girlfriend of mine whos a broker in chicago recommended the stock shes forever giving me tips thinking ive got tons of money to invest a biotech company jack mused hmmm thats a new twist it must be significant although i dont quite know how nor do i know what a biotech firm would be doing in equatorial guinea whats the meaning of this indirect corporate trail in nevada laurie asked is gensys trying to hide the fact that they own an aircraft i doubt it lou said i was able to learn the connection too easily if gensys was trying to conceal ownership the lawyers in nevada would have continued to be the directors and officers of record for alpha aviation instead at the first board meeting the chief financial officer of gensys assumed the duties of president and secretary then why nevada for an airplane owned by a massachusettsbased company laurie asked im no lawyer lou admitted but im sure it has something to do with taxes and limitation of liability massachusetts is a terrible state to get sued in i imagine gensys leases its plane out for the percentage of the time it doesnt use it and insurance for a nevadabased company would be a lot less how well do you know this broker friend of yours jack asked laurie really well laurie said we went to wesleyan university together how about giving her a call and asking her if she knows of any connection between gensys and equatorial guinea jack said if she recommended the stock shed probably thoroughly researched the company without a doubt laurie said jean corwin was one of the most compulsive students i knew she made us premeds seem casual by comparison is it all right if laurie uses your phone jack asked lou no problem lou said you want me to call this minute laurie asked with surprise catch her while shes still at work jack said chances are if she has any file it would be there youre probably right laurie admitted she sat down at lous desk and called chicago information while laurie was on the phone jack quizzed lou in detail about how he was able to find out what he had he was particularly interested and impressed with the way lou had come up with equatorial guinea together they looked more closely at the map noticing the countrys proximity to the equator they even noticed that its major city presumably its capital wasnt on the mainland but rather on an island called bioko i just cant imagine what its like in a place like that lou said i can jack said its hot buggy rainy and wet sounds delightful lou quipped not the place someone would choose to vacation jack said on the other hand its off the beaten track laurie hung up the phone and twisted around in lous desk chair to face the others jean was as organized as i expected she said she was able to put her finger on her gensys material in a flash of course she had to ask me how much of the stock id bought and was crushed when i admitted i hadnt bought any apparently the stock tripled and then split is that good lou asked facetiously so good i might have missed my opportunity to retire laurie said she said this is the second successful biotech company started by its ceo taylor cabot did she have anything to say about equatorial guinea jack asked for sure laurie said she said that one of the main reasons the company has been doing so well is that it established a huge primate farm initially the farm was to do inhouse research for gensys then someone hit on the idea of creating an opportunity for other biotech companies and pharmaceutical firms to outsource their primate research to gensys apparently the demand for this service has trampled even the most optimistic forecasts and this primate farm is in equatorial guinea jack asked thats right laurie said did she suggest any reason why jack asked a memorandum she had from an analyst said that gensys chose equatorial guinea because of the favorable reception they received from the government which even passed laws to aid their operation apparently gensys has become the governments major source of muchneeded foreign currency can you imagine the amount of graft that must be involved in that kind of scenario jack asked lou lou merely whistled the memorandum also pointed out that most of the primates they use are indigenous to equatorial guinea laurie added it allows them to circumvent all the international restrictions in exportation and importation of endangered species like chimpanzees a primate farm jack repeated while shaking his head this is raising even more bizarre possibilities could we be dealing with a xenograft dont start that doctor jargon on me lou complained what in gods name is a xenograft impossible laurie said xenografts cause hyperacute rejections there was no evidence of inflammation in the liver section you showed me neither humoral nor cellmediated true jack said and he wasnt even on any immunosuppressant drugs come on you guys lou pleaded dont make me beg what the hell is a xenograft its when a transplant organ is taken from an animal of a different species laurie said you mean like that baby fae baboon heart fiasco ten or twelve years ago lou asked exactly laurie said the new immunosuppressant drugs have brought xenografts back into the picture jack explained and with considerable more success than with baby fae especially with pig heart valves laurie said of course it poses a lot of ethical questions jack said and it drives animalrights people berserk especially now that they are experimenting with inserting human genes into the pigs to ameliorate some of the rejection reaction laurie added could franconi have gotten a primate liver while he was in africa lou asked i cant imagine jack said lauries point is well taken there was no evidence of any rejection thats unheard of even with a good human match short of identical twins but franconi was apparently in africa lou said true and his mother said he came home a new man jack said he threw up his hands and stood up i dont know what to make of it its the damnest mystery especially with this organized crime aspect thrown in laurie stood up as well are you guys leaving lou asked jack nodded im confused and exhausted he said i didnt sleep much last night after we made the identification of franconis remains i was on the phone for hours i called every european organ allocation organization whose phone number i could get how about we all head over to little italy for a quick dinner lou suggested its right around the corner not me jack said ive got a bike ride ahead of me at this point a meal would do me in nor i laurie said im looking forward to getting home and taking a shower its been two late nights for me in a row and im frazzled lou admitted to having another half hour of work to do so laurie and jack said goodbye and descended to the first floor they returned their temporaryvisitor badges and left police headquarters in the shadow of city hall they caught a cab feel better jack asked laurie as they headed north up the bowery a kaleidoscope of light played across their faces much laurie admitted i cant tell you how relieved i am to dump it all in lous capable lap im sorry i got myself so worked up no need to apologize jack said its unsettling to say the least theres a potential spy in our midst and that organized crime has an interest in liver transplants and how are you bearing up laurie asked youre getting a lot of bizarre input on the franconi case its bizarre but its also intriguing jack said especially this association with a biotech giant like gensys the scary part about these corporations is that their research is all behind closed doors coldwar style secrecy is their modus operandi no one knows what they are doing in their quest for return on investment its a big difference from ten or twenty years ago when the nih funded most biomedical research in a kind of open forum in those days there was oversight in the form of peer review but not today too bad theres no one like lou that you can turn the case over to laurie said with a chuckle wouldnt that be nice jack said whats your next step laurie asked jack sighed im running out of options the only thing thats scheduled is for a veterinary pathologist to review the liver section so you already thought about a xenograft laurie asked with surprise no i didnt jack admitted the suggestion to have a veterinary pathologist look at the slide wasnt my idea it came from a parasitologist over at the hospital who thought the granuloma was due to a parasite but one he didnt recognize maybe you should mention the possibility of a xenograft to ted lynch laurie suggested as a dna expert he might have something in his bag of tricks that could say yes or no definitively excellent idea jack said with admiration how can you come up with such a great suggestion when youre so beat you amaze me my mind has already shut down for the night compliments are always welcome laurie teased especially in the dark so you cant see me blush im starting to think that the only option that might be open to me if i really want to solve this case is a quick trip to equatorial guinea laurie twisted around in the seat so she could look directly into jacks broad face in the half light it was impossible to see his eyes youre not serious i mean youre joking right well theres no way i could phone gensys or even go up to cambridge and walk into their home office and say hi folks whats going on in equatorial guinea but were talking about africa laurie said thats crazy its halfway around the world besides if you dont think youd learn anything going up to cambridge what makes you think youd learn anything going to africa maybe because they wouldnt expect it jack said i dont suppose they get many visitors oh this is insane laurie said flapping her hands into the air and rolling her eyes hey calm down jack said i didnt say i was going i just said it was something i was beginning to think about well stop thinking about it laurie said ive got enough to worry about jack smiled at her you really are concerned im touched oh sure laurie remarked cynically youre never touched by my pleas not to ride your mountain bike around the city the taxi pulled up in front of lauries apartment building and came to a halt laurie started to get some money out jack put a hand on her arm my treat all right ill get it next time laurie said she started to climb out of the cab then stopped if you were to promise to take a cab home i think we could rustle up something to eat in my apartment thanks but not tonight jack said ive got to get the bike home id probably fall asleep on a full stomach worse things could happen laurie said let me take a rain check jack said laurie climbed out of the cab and then leaned back in just promise me one thing you wont leave for africa tonight jack took a playful swipe at her but she easily evaded his hand good night jack laurie said with a warm smile good night laurie jack said ill call you later after i talk with warren oh thats right laurie said with everything thats happened id forgotten ill be waiting for your call laurie closed the taxi door and watched the cab until it disappeared around the corner on first avenue she turned toward her door musing that jack was a charming but complicated man as she rode up in her elevator laurie began to anticipate her shower and the warmth of her terrycloth robe she vowed shed turn in early laurie treated debra engler to an acid smile before keying her multiple locks she slammed her door behind her to give mrs engler an extra message moving her mail from one hand to the other she removed her coat in the darkness of the closet she groped for a hanger it wasnt until laurie entered the living room that she flipped the wall switch that turned on a floor lamp she got two steps toward the kitchen when she let out a muffled scream and dropped her mail on the floor there were two men in the living room one was in her artdeco chair the other sitting on the couch the one on the couch was petting tom who was asleep on his lap the other thing laurie noticed was a large handgun with an attached silencer on the arm of the artdeco chair welcome home dr montgomery franco said thank you for the wine and beer lauries eyes went to the coffee table there was an empty beer bottle and wineglass please come over and sit down franco said he pointed to a side chair theyd put in the middle of the room laurie didnt move she was incapable of it she thought vaguely about running into the kitchen for the phone but immediately dismissed the idea as ridiculous she even thought about fleeing back to her front door but with all the locks she knew it would be a futile gesture please franco repeated with a false politeness that only augmented lauries terror angelo moved the cat to the side and stood up he took a step toward laurie and without warning backhanded her viciously across the face the blow propelled laurie back against the wall where her legs gave way she slumped to her hands and knees a few drops of bright red blood dropped from her split upper lip splattering on the hardwood floor angelo grabbed her by the upper arm and roughly hoisted her to her feet then he powered her over to the chair and pushed her into a sitting position lauries terror made her incapable of resisting thats better franco said angelo leaned over and stuck his face in lauries recognize me laurie forced herself to look up into the mans horribly scarred face he looked like a character in a horror movie she swallowed her throat had gone dry incapable of speech all she could do was shake her head no franco questioned doctor im afraid you are going to hurt angelos feelings and under the circumstances thats a dangerous thing to do im sorry laurie squeaked but no sooner had the words come out then laurie associated the name with the fact that the man standing in front of her had been burned it was angelo facciolo cerinos main hit man now obviously out of jail ive been waiting five years angelo snarled then he struck laurie again half knocking her off the chair she ended up with her head down there was more blood this time it came from her nose and soaked into the carpet okay angelo franco said remember weve got to talk with her angelo trembled for a moment over laurie as if struggling to restrain himself abruptly he went back to the couch and sat down he picked the cat back up and began roughly petting it tom didnt mind and began to purr laurie managed to right herself with her hand she felt both her lip and her nose her lip was already beginning to swell she pinched her nose to halt the bleeding listen doctor montgomery franco said as you might imagine it was very easy for us to come in here i say this so you will comprehend how vulnerable you are you see we have a problem that you can help us with were here to ask you nicely to leave the franconi thing alone am i making myself clear laurie nodded she was afraid not to good franco said now we are very reasonable people well consider this a favor on your part and were willing to do a favor in return we happen to know who killed mr franconi and were willing to pass that information on to you you see mr franconi wasnt a nice man so he was killed end of story are you still with me laurie nodded again she glanced at angelo but quickly averted her eyes the killers name is vido delbario franco continued hes not a nice person either although he did do the world a favor in getting rid of franconi ive even taken the trouble to write the name down franco leaned forward and put a piece of paper on the coffee table so a favor for a favor franco paused and looked expectantly at laurie you do understand what im saying dont you franco asked after a moment of silence laurie nodded for the third time i mean were not asking much franco said to be blunt franconi was a bad guy he killed a bunch of people and deserved to die himself now as far as you are concerned i hope you will be sensible because in a city this size theres no way to protect yourself and angelo here would like no better than have his way with you lucky for you our boss is not heavyhanded hes a negotiator do you understand franco paused again laurie felt compelled to respond with difficulty she managed to say she understood wonderful franco said he slapped his knees and stood up when i heard how intelligent and resourceful you are doc i was confident we could see eye to eye franco slipped his handgun into his shoulder holster and put on his ferragamo coat come on angelo he said im sure the doctor wants to shower and have her dinner she looks kinda tired to me angelo got up took a step in lauries direction and then viciously wrenched the cats neck there was a sickening snap and tom went limp without a sound angelo dumped the dead cat in lauries lap and followed franco out the front door oh no laurie whimpered as she cradled her pet of six years she knew its neck had been cruelly broken she stood up on rubbery legs out in the hall she heard the elevator arrive and then descend with sudden panic she rushed to the front door and relocked all the locks while still clutching toms body then realizing the intruders had to have come in the back door she raced there only to find it wide open and splintered she forced it closed as best she could back in the kitchen she took the phone off the hook with trembling hands her first response was to call the police but then she hesitated hearing francos voice in the back of her mind warning her how vulnerable she was she also could see angelos horrid face and the intensity of his eyes recognizing she was in shock and fighting tears laurie replaced the receiver she thought shed call jack but she knew he wouldnt be home yet so instead of calling anyone for the moment she tenderly packed her pet in a styrofoam box with several trays of ice cubes then she went into the bathroom to check out her own wounds jacks bike ride from the morgue home was not the ordeal he expected in fact once he got under way he felt better than he had for most of the day he even allowed himself to cut through central park it had been the first time hed been in the park after dark for a year although he was uneasy it was also exhilarating to sprint along the dark winding paths for most of the trip hed pondered about gensys and equatorial guinea he wondered what it was really like in that part of africa hed joked earlier with lou that it was buggy hot and wet but he didnt know for sure he also thought about ted lynch and wondered what ted would be able to do the following day before jack had left the morgue hed called him at home to outline the unlikely possibility of a xenograft ted said that he thought hed be able to tell by checking an area on the dna that specified ribosomal proteins hed explained that the area differed considerably from species to species and that the information to make a species identification was available on a cdrom jack turned onto his street with the idea of going to the local bookstore to see if there was any material on equatorial guinea but as he approached the playground with its daily late afternoon and evening game of basketball under way he had another idea it occurred to him that there might be expatriate equatoguineans in new york after all the city harbored people from every country in the world turning his bike into the playground jack dismounted and leaned it up against the chainlink fence he didnt bother to lock it though most people would have thought the neighborhood a risky place to leave a thousanddollar bike in reality the playground was the only place in new york jack felt he didnt have to lock up jack walked over to the sidelines and nodded to spit and flash who were part of the crowd waiting to play the game in progress swept up and down the court as the ball changed hands or baskets were made as usual warren was dominating the play before each of his shots hed say money which was aggravating to the opponents because ninety percent of the time the ball would sail through the basket a quarter hour later the game was decided by one of warrens money shots and the losers slunk off the court warren caught sight of jack and strutted over hey man you going to run or what warren asked im thinking about it jack said but ive got a couple of questions first of all how about you and natalie getting together with laurie and me this weekend hell yes warren said anything to shut my shortie up shes been ragging on me fierce about you and laurie secondly do you know any brothers from a tiny african country called equatorial guinea man i never know whats going to come out of your mouth warren complained let me think its on the west coast of africa jack said between cameroon and gabon i know where it is warren said indignantly it was supposedly discovered by the portuguese and colonized by the spanish actually it was discovered a long time earlier by black people im impressed you know of it jack said id never heard of the country im not surprised warren said im sure you didnt take any black history courses but to answer your question yes i do know a couple of people from there and one family in particular their name is ndeme they live two doors down from you toward the park jack looked over at the building then back at warren do you know them well enough to introduce me jack asked ive developed a sudden interest in equatorial guinea yeah sure warren said the fathers name is esteban he owns the mercado market over on columbus thats his son over there with the orange kicks jack followed warrens pointing finger until he spotted the orange sneakers he recognized the boy as one of the basketball regulars he was a quiet kid and an intense player why dont you come down and run a few games warren suggested then ill take you over and introduce you to esteban hes a friendly dude fair enough jack said after being revived by the bicycle ride he was looking for an excuse to play basketball the events of the day had him in knots jack went back and got his bike hurrying over to his building he carried the bicycle up the stairs he unlocked his door without even taking it off his shoulder once inside he made a beeline for his bedroom and his basketball gear within five minutes jack was already on his way out when his phone rang for a moment he debated answering it but thinking it might be ted calling back with a bit of arcane dna trivia jack picked it up it was laurie and she was beside herself jack crammed enough bills through the plexiglas partition in the taxi to more than cover the fare and jumped out he was in front of lauries apartment building where hed been less than an hour earlier dressed in his basketball gear he raced to the front door and was buzzed in laurie met him in the elevator foyer on her floor my god jack wailed look at your lip that will heal laurie said stoically then she caught debra englers eye peering through the crack in her door laurie lunged at the woman and shouted for her to mind her own business the door snapped shut jack put his arm around laurie to calm her and led her into her apartment all right jack said after getting laurie seated on the couch tell me what happened they killed tom laurie whimpered after the initial shock laurie had cried for her pet but her tears had dried until jacks question who jack demanded laurie waited until she had her emotions under control there were two of them but i only knew one she said and hes the one who struck me and killed tom his name is angelo hes the person ive had nightmares about i had a terrible runin with him during the cerino affair i thought he was still in prison i cant imagine how or why he is out hes horrid to look at his face is terribly scarred from burns and im sure he blames me so this visit was for revenge jack asked no laurie said this was a warning for me in their words im to leave the franconi thing alone i dont believe this jack said im the one investigating the case not you you warned me ive obviously irritated the wrong people by trying to find out how franconis body was lifted from the morgue laurie said for all i know it was my visit to the spoletto funeral home that set them off im not going to take any credit for foreseeing this jack said i thought you would get in trouble with bingham not mobsters angelos warning was presented in the guise of a favor for a favor laurie said his favor was to tell me who killed franconi in fact he wrote the name down laurie lifted the piece of paper from the coffee table and handed it to jack vido delbario jack read he looked back at lauries battered face both her nose and lip were swollen and she was developing a black eye this case has been bizarre from the start now its getting out of hand i think youd better tell me everything that happened laurie related to jack the details from the moment shed walked in the door until shed called him on the phone she even told him why shed hesitated calling jack nodded i understand he said theres little the local precinct could do at this point what am i going to do laurie asked rhetorically she didnt expect an answer let me look at the back door jack said laurie led him through the kitchen and into the pantry whoa jack said because of the multiple dead bolts the entire edge split when the door had been forced ill tell you one thing youre not staying here tonight i suppose i could go home to my parents laurie said youre coming home with me jack said ill sleep on the couch laurie looked into the depths of jacks eyes she couldnt help but wonder if there were more to this sudden invitation than the issue of her safety get your things jack said and pack for a few days it will take that long to replace this door i hate to bring this up laurie said but i have to do something with poor tom jack scratched the back of his head do you have access to a shovel i have a gardening trowel laurie said what are you thinking we could bury him in the backyard jack said laurie smiled you are a softie arent you i just know what its like to lose things you love jack said his voice caught for a painful moment he recalled the phone call that had informed him of his wife and daughters death in a commuter plane crash while laurie packed her things jack paced her bedroom he forced his mind to concentrate on current concerns were going to have to tell lou about this jack said and give him vido delbarios name i was thinking the same thing laurie said from the depths of her walkin closet do you think we should do it tonight i think we should jack said then he can decide when he wants to act on it well call from my house do you have his home number i do laurie said you know this episode is disturbing for more reasons than just your safety jack said it adds to my worry that organized crime is somehow involved in liver transplantation maybe there is some kind of blackmarket operation going on laurie came out of her closet with a hangup bag but how can it be transplantation when franconi wasnt on immunosuppressant drugs and dont forget the strange results ted got with his dna testing jack sighed youre right he admitted it doesnt fit together maybe lou can make sense of it all laurie said wouldnt that be nice jack said meanwhile this episode makes the idea of going to africa a lot more appealing laurie stopped short on her way into the bathroom what on earth are you talking about she demanded i havent had any personal experience with organized crime jack said but i have with street gangs and i believe theres a similarity that i learned the hard way if either of these groups gets it in their mind to get rid of you the police cant protect you unless they are committed to guarding you twentyfour hours a day the problem is they dont have the manpower maybe it would be good for both of us to get out of town for a while it could give lou a chance to sort this out id go too laurie asked suddenly the idea of going to africa had a very different connotation shed never been to africa and it could be interesting in fact it might even be fun wed consider it a forced vacation jack said of course equatorial guinea might not be a prime destination but it would be different and perhaps in the process well be able to figure out exactly what gensys is doing there and why franconi made the trip hmmm laurie said im starting to warm to the idea after laurie had her things ready she and jack took toms styrofoam casket into the backyard in the far corner of the garden where there was loose loam they dug a deep hole the chance discovery of a rusted spade made the job easy and tom was put to rest my word jack complained as he hauled lauries suitcase out the front door what did you put in here you told me to pack for several days laurie said defensively but you didnt have to bring your bowling ball jack quipped its the cosmetics laurie said they are not travel size they caught a cab on first avenue en route to jacks they stopped at a bookstore on fifth avenue while jack waited in the taxi laurie dashed inside to get a book on equatorial guinea unfortunately there werent any and she had to settle for a guidebook for all of central africa the clerk laughed at me when i asked for a book on equatorial guinea laurie said when she got back in the cab thats one more hint its not a top vacation destination jack said laurie laughed she reached over and gave jacks arm a squeeze i havent thanked you yet for coming over she said i really appreciated it and im feeling much better im glad jack said once in jacks building jack had to struggle with lauries suitcase up the cluttered stairs after a series of exaggerated grunts and groans laurie asked him if he wanted her to carry it jack told her that her punishment for packing such a heavy bag was to listen to him complain eventually he got it outside his door he fumbled for his key got it into the cylinder and turned he heard the dead bolt snap back hmmm he commented i dont remember doublelocking the door he turned the key again to release the latch bolt and pushed open the door because of the darkness he preceded laurie into the apartment to flip on the light laurie followed and collided with him because hed stopped suddenly go ahead turn it on a voice said jack complied the silhouettes hed glimpsed a moment before were now men dressed in long dark coats they were seated on jacks sofa facing into the room oh my god laurie said its them franco and angelo had made themselves at home just as they had at lauries theyd even helped themselves to beers the halfempty bottles were on the coffee table along with a handgun and its attached silencer a straightbacked chair had been brought into the center of the room to face the couch i assume you are dr jack stapleton franco said jack nodded as his mind began to go over ways of handling the situation he knew the front door behind him was still ajar he berated himself for not being more suspicious to have found it doublelocked the problem was hed gone out so quickly he couldnt remember which locks hed secured dont do anything foolish franco admonished as if reading jacks mind we wont be staying long and if wed known that dr montgomery was going to be here we could have saved ourselves a trip to her place not to mention the effort of going over the same message twice what is it you people are afraid we might learn that makes you want to come and threaten us jack asked franco smiled and looked at angelo can you believe this guy he thinks we made all this effort to get in here to answer questions no respect angelo said doc how about getting another chair for the lady franco said to jack then we can have our little talk and well be on our way jack didnt move he was thinking about the gun on the coffee table and wondering which of the men was still armed as he tried to gauge their strength he noticed that both were on the thin side he figured they were most likely out of shape excuse me doc franco said are you with us or what before jack could answer there was commotion behind him and someone roughly bumped him to the side another person shouted nobody move jack recovered from his momentary confusion to comprehend that three africanamericans had leaped into the room each armed with machine pistols the guns were trained unwaveringly on franco and angelo these newcomers were all dressed in basketball gear and jack quickly recognized them it was flash david and spit all of whom were still sweating from activity on the playground franco and angelo were taken completely unawares they simply sat there eyes wide since they were accustomed to being on the other side of lethal weapons they knew enough not to move for a moment there was frozen silence then warren strutted in man doc keeping you alive has become a fulltime job you know what im saying and im going to have to tell you youre dragging down the neighborhood bringing in this kind of white trash warren took the machine pistol away from spit and told spit to frisk the visitors wordlessly spit relieved angelo of his walther auto pistol after frisking franco he collected the gun from the coffee table jack noisily let out a breath of air warren old sport i dont know how you manage to drop in on such a timely basis in my life but its appreciated these scumbags were seen casing this place earlier tonight warren explained its as if they think theyre invisible despite their expensive threads and that big black shiny cadillac its kind of a joke jack rubbed his hands together in appreciation of the sudden change of power he asked angelo and franco their names but got cold stares in return that one is angelo facciolo laurie said while pointing toward her nemesis spit get their wallets warren ordered spit complied and read out their names and addresses uhoh whats this he questioned when he opened the wallet containing the ozone park police badge he held it up for warren to see theyre not police officers warren said with a wave of dismissal dont worry laurie jack said i think its time to give lou a call im sure hed like nothing better than to talk with these gentlemen and tell him to bring the paddy wagon in case hed like to invite them to stay the night at the citys expense laurie disappeared into the kitchen jack walked over to angelo and towered above him stand up jack said angelo got to his feet and glowered insolently at jack to everyones surprise especially angelo jack sucker punched him as hard as he could in the face there was a crunching sound as angelo was knocked backward over the sofa to land in a heap on the floor jack winced cursed and grabbed his hand then he shook it up and down jeez he complained ive never hit anybody like that it hurts hold up warren warned jack i dont like beatin on these dog turds its not my style im all done jack said still shaking his injured hand you see that dog turd on the other side of the couch beat up on laurie earlier this evening after they broke into her apartment im sure you noticed her face angelo pushed himself up to a sitting position his nose angled to the right jack invited him to come back around the couch and sit down angelo moved slowly while cupping his hand beneath his nose to catch the dripping blood now before the police get here jack said to the two men id like to ask you guys again about what youre afraid laurie and i might learn what is going on with this franconi nonsense angelo and franco stared at jack as if he werent there jack persisted and asked what they knew about franconis liver but the men remained stone silent laurie returned from the kitchen i got lou she reported hes on his way and i have to say hes excited especially about the vido delbario tip an hour later jack found himself comfortably ensconced in esteban ndemes apartment along with laurie and warren sure ill have another beer jack said in response to estebans offer jack was feeling a pleasant buzz from his first beer and progressively euphoric that the evening had worked out so auspiciously after such a bad start lou had arrived at jacks with several patrolmen less than twenty minutes after lauries call hed been ecstatic to take angelo and franco downtown to book them on breaking and entering possession of unauthorized firearms assault and battery extortion and impersonation of a police officer his hope was to hold them long enough to get some real information out of them about new york city organized crime particularly the lucia organization lou had been disturbed by the threats laurie and jack had received so when jack mentioned that he and laurie were thinking of going out of town for a week or so lou was all for it lou was concerned enough that in the interim hed assigned a guard for laurie and jack to make the job easier jack and laurie agreed to stay together at jacks urging warren had taken him and laurie to the mercado market and to meet esteban ndeme as warren had intimated esteban was an amiable and gracious man he was close to jacks age of fortytwo but his body type was the opposite of jacks where jack was stocky esteban was slender even his facial features seemed delicate his skin was a deep rich brown many shades darker than warrens but his most noticeable physical trait was his highdomed forehead hed lost his hair in the front so that his hairline ran from ear to ear over the top of his head as soon as hed learned jack was considering a trip to equatorial guinea hed invited jack laurie and warren back to his apartment teodora ndeme had turned out to be as congenial as her husband after the group had been in the apartment for only a short time shed insisted everyone stay for dinner with savory aromas drifting from the kitchen jack sat back contentedly with a second beer what brought you and teodora to new york city he asked esteban we had to flee our country esteban said he went on to describe the reign of terror of the ruthless dictator nguema that forced a third of the population including all of spanish descent to leave fifty thousand people were murdered esteban said it was terrible we were lucky to get out i was a schoolteacher trained in spain and therefore suspect things have changed i hope jack said oh yes esteban said a coup in has changed a lot but it is a poor country although there is some talk of offshore oil as was discovered off gabon gabon is now the wealthiest country in the region have you been back jack asked several times esteban said the last time a few years ago esteban said teodora and i still have family there teodoras brother even has a small hotel on the mainland in a town called bata ive heard of bata jack said i understand it has an airport the only one on the mainland esteban said it was built in the eighties for a central african congress of course the country couldnt afford it but that is another story have you heard of a company called gensys jack asked most definitely esteban said it is the major source of foreign currency for the government especially since cocoa and coffee prices have fallen so ive heard jack said ive also heard gensys has a primate farm do you know if that is in bata no it is in the south esteban said they built it in the jungle near an old deserted spanish town called cogo they have rebuilt much of the town for their people from america and europe and they have built a new town for local people who work for them they employ many equatoguinean people do you know if gensys built a hospital jack asked yes they did esteban said they built a hospital and laboratory on the old town square facing the town hall how do you know so much about it jack asked because my cousin used to work there esteban said but he quit when the soldiers executed one of his friends for hunting a lot of people like gensys because they pay well but others dont like gensys because they have too much power with the government because of money jack said yes of course esteban said they pay a lot of money to the ministers they even pay part of the army thats cozy laurie commented if we were to go to bata would we be able to visit cogo jack asked i suppose esteban said after the spanish left twentyfive years ago the road to cogo was abandoned and became impassable but gensys has rebuilt it so the trucks can go back and forth but youd have to hire a car is that possible jack asked if you have money anything is possible in equatorial guinea esteban said when are you planning to go because its best to go in the dry season whens that jack asked february and march esteban said thats convenient jack said because laurie and i are thinking of going tomorrow night what warren spoke for the first time since theyd arrived at estebans apartment hed not been privy to jack and lous conversation i thought me and natalie were going out on the town with you guys this weekend ive already told natalie ohhhh jack commented i forgot about that hey man you gotta wait til after saturday night otherwise im in deep shit you know what im saying i told you how much shes been ragging on me to see you guys in his euphoric mood jack had another suggestion i have a better idea why dont you and natalie come along with laurie and me to equatorial guinea it will be our treat laurie blinked she wasnt sure shed heard correctly man what are you talking about warren said youre outa your friggin mind youre talking about africa yeah africa jack said if laurie and i have to go we might as well make it as fun as possible in fact esteban why dont you and your wife come too well make it a party are you serious esteban asked lauries expression was equally as incredulous sure im serious jack said the best way to visit a country is to go with someone who used to live there thats no secret but tell me do we all need visas yes but the equatorial guinean embassy is here in new york esteban said two pictures twentyfive dollars and a letter from a bank saying youre not poor gets you a visa how do you get to equatorial guinea jack asked for bata the easiest is through paris esteban said from paris there is daily service to douala cameroon from douala theres daily service to bata you can go through madrid too but thats only twice a week to malabo on bioko sounds like paris wins out jack said gaily teodora esteban called out to his wife in the kitchen youd better come in here youre crazy man warren said to jack i knew it the first day you walked out on that basketball court but you know something im beginning to like it chapter march am cogo equatorial guinea kevins alarm went off at sixfifteen it was still completely dark outside emerging from his mosquito net he turned on the light to find his robe and slippers a cottony feeling in his mouth and a mild bitemporal headache reminded him of the wine hed drunk the night before with a shaky hand he took a long drink of the water he had at his bedside thus fortified he set out on shaky legs to knock on his guest rooms doors the previous night he and the women had decided that it made sense for melanie and candace to spend the night kevin had plenty of room and they all agreed being together would make the departure in the morning far easier and probably elicit less attention consequently at about eleven pm amid lots of laughter and gaiety kevin had driven the women to their respective quarters to collect their overnight necessities a change of clothes and the food theyd gotten from the commissary while the women had been packing kevin had made a quick detour to his lab to get the locator the directional beacon a flashlight and the contour map on each guest room door kevin had to knock twice once quite softly and when there was no response he rapped more vigorously until he heard a response he sensed the women were hungover especially after it took them significantly longer than they planned to show up in the kitchen both of them poured themselves a mug of coffee and drank the first cup without conversation after breakfast they all revived significantly in fact as they emerged from kevins house they felt exhilarated as if they were setting off on a holiday the weather was as good as could be expected in that part of the world dawn was breaking and the pink and silver sky was generally clear overhead to the south there was a line of small puffy clouds on the horizon to the west there were ominous purple storm clouds but they were way out over the ocean and would most likely stay there for the day as they walked toward the waterfront they were enthralled by the profusion of bird life there were blue turacos parrots weaverbirds african fish eagles and a kind of african blackbird the air was filled with their color and shrieks the town seemed deserted there were no pedestrians or vehicles and the homes were still shuttered against the night the only person they saw was a local mopping the floor in the chickee hut bar they walked out on the impressive pier gensys had built it was twenty feet wide and six feet high the roughhewn planks were wet from the humid night air at the end of the pier there was a wooden ramp that led down to a floating dock the dock seemed to be mysteriously suspended the surface of the perfectly calm water was hidden by a layer of mist that extended as far as the eye could see as the women had promised there was a motorized thirtyfootlong pirogue languidly moored to the end of the dock long ago it had been painted red with a white interior but the paint had faded or had been scraped off in large areas a thatched roof supported by wooden poles extended over threequarters of the boats length under the shelter were benches the motor was an antique evinrude outboard tethered to the stern was a small canoe with four narrow benches extending from gunwale to gunwale not bad eh melanie said as she grabbed the mooring line and pulled the boat to the dock its bigger than i expected kevin said as long as the motor keeps going we should be fine i wouldnt want to paddle it very far worstcase scenario we float back melanie said undaunted after all we are going upriver they got the gear and food aboard while melanie continued to stand on the pier kevin made his way to the stern to examine the motor it was selfexplanatory with instructions written in english he put the throttle on start and pulled the cord to his utter surprise the engine started he motioned for melanie to hop in shifted the motor into forward and they were off as they pulled away from the pier they all looked back at cogo to see if anyone took note of their departure the only person they saw was the lone man cleaning the chickee hut and he didnt bother to look in their direction as they had planned they motored west as if they were going to acalayong kevin advanced the throttle to halfopen and was pleased at the speed the pirogue was large and heavy but it had very little draw he checked the canoe they had in tow it was riding easily in the water the sound of the motor made conversation difficult so they were content to enjoy the scenery the sun had yet to come up but the sky was brighter and the eastern ends of the cumulus clouds over gabon were edged in gold to their right the shoreline of equatorial guinea appeared as a solid mass of vegetation that abruptly dumped into the water dotted about the wide estuary were other pirogues moving ghostlike through the mist that still layered the surface of the water when cogo had fallen significantly astern melanie tapped kevin on the shoulder once she had his attention she made a wide sweeping motion with her hand kevin nodded and began to steer the boat to the south after traveling south for ten minutes kevin began a slow turn to the west they were now at least a mile offshore and when they passed cogo it was difficult to make out specific buildings when the sun did finally make its appearance it was a huge ball of reddish gold at first the equatorial mists were so dense that the sun could be examined directly without the need to shield ones eyes but the heat of the sun began to evaporate the mist which in turn rapidly made the suns rays stronger melanie was the first to slip on her sunglasses but candace and kevin quickly did the same a few minutes later everyone began to peel off layers of clothing theyd donned against the comparative morning chill to their left was the string of islands that hugged the equatoguinean coast kevin had been steering north to complete the wide circle around cogo now he pushed over the helm to point the bow directly toward isla francesca which loomed in the distance once the mists had dissipated from the suns glare a welcome breeze stirred the water and waves began to mar the hitherto glassy surface pushing into a mounting headwind the pirogue began to slap against the crests occasionally sprinkling its passengers with spray isla francesca looked different than her sister islands and the closer they got the more apparent it became besides being considerably larger isla francescas limestone escarpment gave it a much more substantial appearance there were even bits of cloudlike mist that clung to its summits an hour and fifteen minutes after they had left the pier in cogo kevin cut back on the throttle and the pirogue slowed a hundred feet ahead was the dense shoreline of the southwestern tip of isla francesca from this vantage point it looks sort of forbidding melanie yelled over the sound of the engine kevin nodded there was nothing about the island that was inviting there was no beach the entire shoreline appeared to be covered with dense mangroves weve got to find rio divisos outlet kevin yelled back after approaching the mangroves as close as he thought prudent he pushed the helm to starboard and headed along the western shore in the lee of the island the waves disappeared kevin stood up in hopes of seeing possible underwater obstructions but he couldnt the water was an impenetrable muddy color what about where all those bulrushes are candace called out from the bow she pointed ahead to an expansive marsh that had appeared kevin nodded and cut back on the throttle even farther he nosed the boat toward the sixfoot reeds can you see any obstructions underwater he called out to candace candace shook her head its too murky she said kevin turned the boat so that they were again moving parallel with the island shoreline the reeds were dense and the marsh now extended inland for a hundred yards this must be the river outlet kevin said i hope there is a channel or were out of luck theres no way we could get the canoe through those reeds ten minutes later without having found a break in the reeds kevin turned the boat around he was careful not to foul the towline for the small canoe i dont want to go any further in this direction kevin said the width of the marsh is decreasing i dont think were going to find a channel besides im afraid of getting too close to the staging area where the bridge is i agree melanie said what about going to the other end of the island where rio diviso has its inlet that was exactly my thought kevin said melanie raised her hand what are you doing kevin asked its called a high five you jerk melanie teased kevin slapped her hand with his and laughed they motored back the way theyd come and rounded the island to head east along its length kevin opened up the throttle to about half speed the route gave them a good view of the southern aspect of the islands mountainous backbone from that angle no limestone was visible the island appeared to be an uninterrupted mountain of virgin jungle all i see are birds melanie yelled over the sound of the engine kevin nodded hed seen lots of ibises and shrikes the sun had now risen enough so that the thatched shelter was useful they all crowded into the stern to take advantage of the shade candace put on some sunblock that kevin had found in his medicine cabinet do you think the bonobos on the island are going to be as skittish as bonobos normally are melanie yelled kevin shrugged i wish i knew he yelled back if they are it might be difficult for us to see any of them and all this effort will have been in vain they did have diminishing contact with humans until they were there in the bonobo enclosure at the animal center melanie yelled i think we have a good chance as long as we dont try to get too close are bonobos timid in the wild candace asked melanie very much so melanie said as much or more than chimpanzees chimps unexposed to humans are almost impossible to see in the wild theyre inordinately timid and their sense of hearing and smell is so much more acute than ours that people cannot get near them are there still truly wild areas left in africa candace asked oh my lord yes melanie said essentially from this coastal part of equatorial guinea and extending west northwest there are huge tracts that are still essentially unexplored virginal rain forest were talking about as much as a million square miles how long is that going to last candace questioned thats another story melanie said how about handing me a cold drink kevin yelled coming up candace said she moved over to the styrofoam chest and lifted the lid twenty minutes later kevin again throttled back on the motor and turned north around the eastern end of isla francesca the sun was higher in the sky and it was significantly hotter candace pushed the styrofoam chest over to the port side of the pirogue to keep it in the shade theres another marsh coming up candace said i see it kevin said kevin again guided the boat in close to the shore in terms of size the marsh appeared to be similar to the one on the western end of the island once again the jungle dropped back to approximately a hundred yards from the edge of the water just when kevin was about to announce that they had again been foiled an opening appeared in the otherwise unremitting wall of reeds kevin turned the canoe toward the opening and throttled back even more the boat slowed about thirty feet away kevin put the motor into neutral and then turned it off as the sound of the engine died off they were thrust into a heavy stillness god my ears are ringing melanie complained does it look like a channel kevin asked candace whod again gone up to the bow its hard to tell candace said kevin grabbed the back of the motor and tilted it up out of the water he didnt want to foul the propeller in underwater vegetation the pirogue entered among the reeds it scraped against the stems then glided to a halt kevin reached behind the boat to keep the towed canoe from banging into the pirogues stern it looks like it goes forward in a meandering fashion candace said she was standing on the gunwale and holding onto the thatched roof of the shelter so she could see over the top of the reeds kevin snapped off a stem and broke it into small pieces he tossed them into the water next to the boat and watched them they drifted slowly but inexorably in the direction they were pointing there seems to be some current kevin said i think thats a good sign lets give it a try with the canoe kevin moved the smaller boat alongside the larger with difficulty because of the canoes unsteadiness they managed to get themselves into the smaller boat along with their gear and the food chest kevin sat in the stern while candace took the bow melanie sat in the middle but not on one of the seats canoes made her nervous she preferred to sit on the bottom by a combination of paddling pulling on reeds and pulling on the pirogue they managed to get ahead of the larger boat once in what they hoped was the channel the going was considerably easier with kevin paddling in the rear and candace in the front they were able to move at the pace of a slow walk the narrow sixfootwide passage twisted and turned as it worked its way across the marsh the sun was now evidencing its equatorial power even though it was only eight oclock in the morning the reeds blocked the breeze effectively raising the temperature even higher therere not many trails on this island melanie commented shed unfolded the contour map and was studying it the main one is from the staging area to lago hippo kevin said there are a few more melanie said all leading away from lago hippo i suppose theyd been made to facilitate retrievals that would be my guess kevin said kevin looked into the dark water he could see strands of plant life trailing in the direction they were paddling suggesting there was current he was encouraged why dont you try the locator kevin said see if bonobo number sixty has moved since we last checked melanie entered the information and clicked he doesnt appear to have moved she said she reduced the scale until it was equivalent to the scale on the contour map then located the red dot hes still in the same spot in the marshy clearing at least we can solve that mystery even if we dont see any of the others kevin said ahead they approached the hundredfoothigh wall of jungle as they rounded the final bend in the marsh they could see the channel disappear into the riot of vegetation well be in shade in a moment candace said that should make it a lot cooler dont count on it kevin said pushing branches to the side they silently slid into the perpetual darkness of the forest contrary to candaces hopes it was like a muggy claustrophobic hot house there was not a breath of air and everything dripped moisture although the thick canopy of tree limbs twisted vines and hanging mosses completely blocked the sunlight it also held in the heat like a heavy woolen blanket some of the leaves were up to a foot in diameter everyone was shocked by how dark it was in the tunnel of vegetation until their eyes began to adjust slowly details appeared out of the dank gloom until the scene resembled late twilight just before night fall almost from the moment the first branches snapped in place behind them they were assaulted by swarms of insects mosquitoes deer flies and trigona bees melanie frantically located the insect repellant after dousing herself she passed it to the others it smells like a damn swamp melanie complained this is scary candace commented from her position in the bow i just saw a snake and i hate snakes as long as we stay in the boat well be fine kevin said so lets not tip over melanie said dont even suggest it candace moaned you guys have to remember im a newcomer youve been in this part of the world for years all we have to worry about are the crocs and hippos kevin said when you see one let me know oh great candace complained nervously and just what do we do when we see one i didnt mean to worry you kevin said i dont think well see any until we come to the lake and what then candace questioned maybe i should have asked about the dangers of this trip before i signed on they wont bother us kevin said at least thats what ive been told as long as they are in the water all we have to do is stay a reasonable distance away its when theyre caught on land that they can be unpredictably aggressive and both crocs and hippos can run faster than youd think all of a sudden im not enjoying this at all candace admitted i thought it was going to be fun it wasnt supposed to be a picnic melanie said were not sightseeing were here for a reason lets just hope were successful kevin said he could appreciate candaces state of mind kevin marveled that hed been talked into coming himself besides the insects the dominant wildlife were the birds they ceaselessly flitted among the branches filling the air with melodies on either side of the channel the forest was impenetrably dense only occasionally could kevin or the others see for more than twenty feet in any direction even the shoreline was invisible hidden behind a tangle of water plants and roots as he paddled kevin looked down into the inky water that was covered with a plethora of darting water spiders the disturbance he caused with each stroke made fetid bubbles rise to the surface the channel soon became straighter than it had been in the marsh making the paddling considerably easier by observing the rate at which they floated by the passing tree trunks kevin estimated that they were moving at about the speed of a fast walk at this rate he figured theyd arrive at the lago hippo in ten to fifteen minutes how about putting the locator on scan kevin suggested to melanie if you narrow the graphic to this area well know if there are any bonobos in the neighborhood melanie was huddled over the compact computer when there was a sudden commotion in the branches to their left a moment later deeper into the forest they heard twigs snapping candace had a hand clasped to her chest oh my she said what the hell was that id guess another one of those duikers kevin said those little antelopes are common even on these islands melanie redirected her attention to the locator soon she was able to report that there were no bonobos in the area of course not kevin said that would have been too easy twenty minutes later candace reported that she could see a lattice of sunlight coming through the branches directly ahead that must be the lake kevin said after a few more paddle strokes the canoe glided out into the open water of lago hippo the trio blinked in the bright sunlight then scrambled for their sunglasses the lake was not large in fact it was more like an elongated pond dotted with several lushly thicketed islands chockablock with white ibises the shore was lined with dense reeds here and there on the surface of the lake were pure white water lilies patches of freefloating vegetation thick enough to allow small birds to walk across them turned lazily in slow circles pushed by the gentle breezes the wall of surrounding forest dropped away on both sides to form grassy fields some as big as an acre a few of these fields were peppered with pockets of palm trees to the left above the line of the forest rim the very top of the limestone escarpment was clearly discernable against the hazy morning sky its actually quite beautiful melanie said it reminds me of paintings of prehistoric times kevin said i could almost imagine a couple of brontosauruses in the foreground oh my god i see hippos over to the left candace called out with alarm she pointed with her paddle kevin looked in the direction she was indicating sure enough the heads and small ears of a dozen of these huge mammals were just visible in the water standing on their crowns were a number of white birds preening theyre okay kevin assured candace see how they are slowly moving away from us they wont be any trouble ive never been much of a nature lover candace admitted you dont have to explain kevin said he could remember clearly his unease about wildlife during his first year in cogo according to the map there should be a trail not too far away from the left bank melanie said while studying the contour map if i remember correctly theres a trail that goes around the whole eastern end of the lake kevin said it originates at the bridge thats true but it comes closest to our left melanie said kevin angled the canoe toward the left shore and began looking for an opening in the reeds unfortunately there wasnt one i think well just have to try to paddle right through the vegetation kevin said im certainly not getting out of this boat until theres dry land melanie announced kevin told candace not to paddle as he aimed the canoe at the sixfoothigh wall of reeds and took a number of forceful strokes to everyones surprise the boat skimmed through the vegetation with no trouble at all despite the scraping noise of the reeds on the hull sooner than they expected they bumped against dry land that was easy kevin said he looked behind at the path theyd created to the lake but already the reeds were springing back to their original position am i supposed to get out candace said i cant see the ground what if there are bugs and snakes make yourself a clearing with your paddle kevin suggested as soon as candace climbed out of the bow kevin paddled against the vegetation and succeeded to force the canoe still further onto the shore melanie got out easily what about the food kevin asked as he moved forward lets leave it here melanie said just bring the bag with the directional beacon and flashlight ive got the locator and the contour map the women waited for kevin to get out of the boat then motioned for him to go ahead of them with the gear bag over his shoulder he pushed aside the reeds and began moving inland the ground was marshy and the muck sucked at his shoes but within ten feet he emerged onto the grassy field this looks like a field but its actually a swamp melanie complained as she looked down at her tennis shoes they were already black with mud and completely soaked kevin struggled with the contour map to get his bearings then pointed off to the right the transmitting chip from bonobo number sixty should be no more than a hundred feet from here in the direction of that cul de sac of trees he said lets get this over with melanie said with her new tennis shoes ruined even she was beginning to question if they should have come in africa nothing was easy kevin struck off with the women following at first walking was difficult because of the unstable footing although the grass appeared generally uniform it grew in small lumpy hummocks surrounded by muddy water but the going became easier about fifty feet from the pond where the ground rose and became comparatively drier a moment later they came across a trail they were surprised to discover that the trail looked wellused it ran parallel with the shoreline of the lake siegfried must send work crews out here more than we thought melanie said this trail has been maintained id have to agree kevin said i suppose theyd need to keep them up for retrievals the jungle is so thick and grows so fast out here lucky for us theyll certainly help us get around as well as i recall this one heads up to the limestone cliff if they come out here to maintain trails maybe there is something to siegfrieds story about workmen making the fires melanie said wouldnt that be nice kevin said i smell something bad candace said while sniffing the air in fact it smells putrid hesitantly the others sniffed and agreed thats not a good sign melanie said kevin nodded and moved off in the direction of the cul de sac a few minutes later with their fingers pinching their nostrils shut the three stared down at a disgusting sight it was the remains of bonobo number sixty the carcass was in the process of being devoured by insects larger scavengers had also taken a toll far more gruesome than the state of the corpse was the evidence of how the animal had died a wedgeshaped piece of limestone had struck the poor creature between the eyes effectively splitting his head in two the rock was still in place exposed soft eyeballs stared off in opposite directions ugh melanie said its what we didnt want to see this suggests that not only the bonobos have split into two groups but theyre killing each other i wonder if number sixtyseven is dead too kevin kicked the rock out of the decomposing head all three stared at it thats also what we didnt want to see kevin said what are you talking about candace asked that rock was shaped artificially kevin said with the toe of his shoe he pointed to an area along the side of the rock where there appeared to be freshly made gouges that suggests toolmaking more circumstantial evidence im afraid melanie said lets move upwind kevin managed before i get sick i cant stand this smell kevin got three steps away in an easterly direction when someone grabbed his arm and yanked him to a stop he turned to see melanie with her index finger pressed against her lips then she pointed to the south kevin turned his gaze in that direction then caught his breath about fifty yards away in the shadows of the very back of the cul de sac was one of the bonobos the animal was standing ramrod straight and absolutely motionless as if he were a military honor guard he appeared to be staring back at kevin and the others just as they were staring at him kevin was surprised at the creatures size the animal was well over five feet tall it also seemed oversized in terms of weight given its enormously muscular torso kevin guessed the bonobo weighed between one hundred twentyfive and one hundred fifty pounds hes taller than the bonobos that have been brought in for transplant surgery candace said at least i think he is of course the bonobos for the transplants were already sedated and strapped to a gurney by the time they got to me shhhhhh melanie admonished lets not scare him this might be our only chance to see one being careful not to move too quickly kevin pulled the gear bag off his shoulder and got out the directional beacon he turned it on to scan it began to quietly beep until he pointed it toward the bonobo then it let out a continuous note kevin looked at the lcd screen and gasped whats the matter melanie whispered she had seen kevins expression change its number one kevin whispered back its my double oh my god melanie whispered im jealous id like to see mine too i wish we could see better candace said do we dare try to get closer kevin was struck by two things first was the coincidence that the first live bonobo theyd come across would happen to be his double secondly if he had inadvertently created a race of protohumans then he was in some metamorphic way meeting himself six million years earlier this is too much kevin couldnt help but whisper aloud what are you talking about melanie asked in some ways thats me standing over there kevin answered now lets not jump the gun melanie said hes certainly standing like a human candace remarked but hes hairier than any human ive ever been out with very funny melanie said without laughing melanie use the locator to scan the area kevin said bonobos usually travel together maybe there are more around that we cant see they could be hiding in the bushes melanie played with the instrument i cant believe how still he is candace said hes probably scared stiff kevin said im sure he doesnt know what to make of us or if melanie is right about there not being enough females out here maybe hes smitten with you two that i dont find funny at all melanie said without looking up from the keyboard of the locator sorry kevin said whats he got around his waist candace asked i was wondering that too kevin said i cant make it out unless its just a vine that got caught on him when he came through the bushes look at this melanie said with excitement she held up the instrument so the others could see kevin you were right theres a whole group of bonobos in the trees behind your double why would he venture out on his own candace asked maybe hes like an alpha male in chimp society melanie said since there are so few females it stands to reason these bonobos might act more like chimps if thats the case he might be proving himself to be courageous several minutes passed the bonobo did not move this is like a mexican standoff candace complained come on lets see how close we can get what do we have to lose even if he runs off id say this little episode is encouraging that well see more all right kevin said but no sudden movement i dont want to scare him that would only ruin our chances for seeing the others you guys first candace said the three advanced carefully moving forward step by step kevin was in the lead followed immediately by melanie candace brought up the rear when they reached the midway mark between them and the bonobo they stopped now they could see the bonobo much better he had prominent eyebrows and a sloped forehead like a chimp but the lower half of his face was significantly less prognathous than even a normal bonobo his nose was flat his nostrils flared his ears were smaller than those of either chimps or bonobos and flush against the side of his head are you guys thinking what im thinking melanie whispered candace nodded he reminds me of the pictures i saw in the third grade of very early cavemen uh oh can you guys see his hands kevin whispered i think so candace said softly whats wrong with them its the thumb kevin whispered its not like a chimps his thumb juts out from the palm youre right melanie whispered and that means he might be able to oppose his thumb with his fingers good god the circumstantial evidence keeps mounting kevin whispered i suppose if the developmental genes responsible for the anatomical changes necessary for bipedalism are on the short arm of chromosome six then its entirely possible that the ones for the opposable thumb are too it is a vine around his waist candace commented now i can see it clearly lets try moving closer melanie suggested i dont know kevin said i think were pushing our luck frankly im surprised he hasnt bolted already maybe we should just sit down right here its hotter than blazes here in the sun melanie said and its not even nine oclock so itll only get worse when we decide to sit and observe i vote we do it in the shade id also like to have the food chest i agree candace said of course you agree kevin said mockingly id be surprised if you didnt kevin was becoming tired of melanie making a suggestion only to have candace eagerly support it it had already gotten him into trouble thats not very nice candace said indignantly im sorry kevin said hed not meant to hurt her feelings well im going closer melanie announced jane goodall was able to get right up next to her chimps true kevin said but that was after months of acclimatization im still going to try melanie said kevin and candace let melanie get ten feet in front of them before they looked at each other shrugged and joined her you dont have to do this for me melanie whispered actually i want to get close enough to see if my double has any facial expression kevin whispered and i want to look into his eyes with no more talk and by moving slowly and deliberately the three were able to come within twenty feet of the bonobo then they stopped again this is incredible melanie whispered without taking her eyes from the animals face the only way it was apparent the bonobo was alive was an occasional blink movements of his eyes and a flaring of his nostrils with each respiration look at those pectorals candace said it looks like hes spent most of his life in a gym how do you think he got that scar melanie asked the bonobo had a thick scar that ran down the left side of his face almost to his mouth kevin leaned forward and stared into the animals eyes they were brown just like his own since the sun was in the bonobos face his pupils were pinpoint kevin strained to detect intelligence but it was difficult to tell without the slightest warning the bonobo suddenly clapped his hands with such force that an echo reverberated between the leafy walls of the cul de sac at the same time he yelled atah kevin melanie and candace leaped from fright having worried from the start that the bonobo was about to flee at any moment theyd not considered the possibility of him acting aggressively the violent clap and yell panicked them and made them fear the animal was about to attack but he didnt he reverted back to his stonelike state after a moments confusion they recovered a semblance of their previous poise they eyed the bonobo nervously what was that all about melanie asked i dont think hes as scared of us as wed thought candace said maybe we should just back away i agree kevin said uneasily but lets go slowly dont panic following his own advice he took a few careful steps backward and motioned for the women to do likewise the bonobo responded by reaching around behind his back and grabbing a tool he had suspended by the vine around his waist he held the tool aloft over his head and cried atah again the three froze wideeyed with terror what can atah mean melanie whined after a few moments when nothing happened can it be a word could he be talking i dont have any idea kevin sputtered but at least he hasnt come toward us what is he holding candace asked apprehensively it looks like a hammer it is kevin managed its a regular carpenters clawhammer it must be one of the tools the bonobos stole when the bridge was being built look at the way he is grasping it just the way you or i would melanie said theres no question he has an opposable thumb we got to get away from here candace half cried you two promised me these creatures were timid this guy is anything but dont run kevin said keeping his eyes glued to the bonobos you can stay if you want but im going back to the boat candace said desperately well all go but slowly kevin said despite warnings not to do so candace turned on her heels and started to run but she only went a few steps before she froze and let out a scream kevin and melanie turned in her direction both of them caught their breaths when they saw what had shocked her twenty more bonobos had silently emerged from the surrounding forest and had arrayed themselves in an arc effectively blocking the exit from the cul de sac candace slowly backed up until she bumped against melanie for a full minute no one spoke or moved not even any of the bonobos then bonobo number one repeated his cry atah instantly the animals began to circle around the humans candace moaned as she kevin and melanie backed into each other forming a tight triangle the ring the animals formed around them began to close like a noose the bonobos came closer a step at a time the humans could now distinctly smell them their odor was strong and feral the animals faces were expressionless but intent their eyes flashed the animals stopped advancing when they were an arms length from the three friends their eyes ran up and down the humans bodies some of them were holding stone wedges similar to the one that had killed bonobo number sixty kevin melanie and candace did not move they were paralyzed with fear all the animals looked as powerful as bonobo number one bonobo number one remained outside the tight ring he was still clutching the clawhammer but no longer had it raised over his head he advanced and made a full circuit of the group staring at the humans between the heads of his compatriots then he let out a string of sounds accompanied by hand gestures several of the other animals answered him then one of them reached out his hand toward candace candace moaned dont move kevin managed to say i think the fact that they havent harmed us is a good sign candace swallowed with difficulty as the bonobos hand caressed her hair he seemed enthralled by its blond color it took all the resolve she could muster not to scream or duck away another animal began to speak and gesture he then pointed to his side kevin saw a long healing surgical scar its the animal whose kidney went to the dallas businessman kevin said fearfully see how hes pointing at us i think hes connecting us to the retrieval process that cant be good melanie whispered another animal reached out tentatively and touched kevins comparatively hairless forearm then he touched the directional beacon kevin was holding in his hand kevin was surprised when he didnt try to take it away from him the bonobo standing directly in front of melanie reached out and pinched the fabric of her blouse between his thumb and forefinger as if feeling its texture then he gently touched the locator she was holding with just the tip of his index finger they seem mystified by us kevin said hesitantly and strangely respectful i dont think they are going to hurt us maybe they think we are gods how can we encourage that belief melanie asked ill try to give them something kevin said kevin considered the objects he had on his person and immediately settled on his wristwatch moving slowly he put the directional beacon under his arm and slipped the watch from his wrist holding it by its bracelet he extended it toward the animal in front of him the animal tilted his head eyeing the watch then reached for it no sooner had he had it in his hand than bonobo number one vocalized the sound ot the animal with the watch responded by quickly giving it up bonobo number one examined the watch then slipped it onto his forearm my god kevin voiced my double is wearing my watch this is a nightmare bonobo number one appeared to admire the watch for a moment then he brought his thumbs and forefinger together to form a circle while saying randa one of the bonobos immediately ran off and disappeared for a moment into the forest when he reappeared he was carrying a length of rope rope kevin said with trepidation now what where did they get rope melanie asked they probably stole it with the tools kevin said what are they going to do candace asked nervously the bonobo went directly to kevin and looped the rope around his waist kevin watched with a mixture of fear and admiration as the animal tied a crude knot and then cinched it tight against kevins abdomen kevin looked up at the women dont struggle he said i think everything is going to be okay as long as we dont anger them or scare them but i dont want to be tied up candace cried as long as were not hurt its okay melanie said hoping to calm candace the bonobo roped melanie and then candace in a similar fashion when he was finished he stepped back still holding the long end of the rope obviously they want us to stay for a while kevin said trying to make light of the situation dont be mad if i dont laugh melanie said at least they dont mind our talking kevin said strangely enough they seem to find it interesting melanie said each time one of them spoke the nearest bonobo would cock its head as if listening bonobo number one suddenly opened and closed his fingers while sweeping his hands away from his chest at the same time he said arak immediately the group started moving including the animal holding the rope kevin melanie and candace were forced forward that gesture was the same as the bonobo did in the operating room candace said then it must mean go or move or away kevin said its incredible theyre speaking they left the cul de sac and moved across the field until they came to the trail at that point they were led right while they walked the bonobos remained silent but vigilant i suspect that it isnt siegfried who maintains these trails melanie said i think its the bonobos the trail curved to the south and soon entered the jungle even in the forest it was well cleared and the ground underfoot was packed smooth where are they taking us candace asked nervously i guess toward the caves kevin said this is ridiculous melanie said were being taken for a walk like dogs on a leash if theyre so impressed with us maybe we should resist i dont think so kevin said i think we should make every effort not to get them riled up candace melanie asked what are you thinking im too scared to think candace said i just want to get back to the canoe the bonobo leading with the rope turned and gave the rope a yank the tug almost knocked all three people down the bonobo repeatedly waved his hand palm down while whispering hana my god is he strong or what melanie commented as she regained her footing what do you think he means candace asked if i had to guess id say hes telling us to be quiet kevin said all at once the entire group stopped there were some hand signals among the bonobos several pointed up toward the trees to the right a small group of bonobos slipped silently into the vegetation those remaining formed a wide circle except for three who climbed directly up into the canopy of the forest with an ease that defied gravity whats happening candace whispered something important kevin said they all seem to be tense several minutes went by none of the bonobos on the ground moved or made the slightest noise then suddenly there was a tremendous commotion to the right accompanied by highpitched shrieks at once the trees were alive with desperately fleeing colobus monkeys on a course bringing them directly toward the bonobos whod climbed up into the trees the terrified monkeys tried to change direction but in their haste several of them lost their hold on the branches and fell to the ground before they could recover they were set upon by waiting bonobos on the ground who killed them instantly with stone wedges candace winced in horror then turned away id say that was a good example of coordinated hunting melanie whispered that requires a high level of cooperation despite the circumstances she couldnt help but be impressed dont rub it in kevin whispered im afraid the jury is in and the verdict is bad weve only been on the island for an hour but the question that brought us here has already been answered besides collective hunting weve seen totally upright posture opposable thumbs toolmaking and even rudimentary speech i sense they can vocalize just like you and i its extraordinary melanie whispered these animals have gone through four or five million years of human evolution in the few years theyve been out here oh shut up candace cried were prisoners of these beasts and you two are having a scientific discussion its more than a scientific discussion kevin said were acknowledging a terrible mistake and im responsible the reality is worse than i feared when i saw the smoke coming from this island these animals are protohumans i have to share some of the blame melanie said i disagree kevin said im the one who created the chimeras by adding the human chromosome segments that wasnt your doing what are they doing now candace asked kevin and melanie turned to see bonobo number one coming toward them carrying the bloodied corpse of one of the colobus monkeys he was still wearing the wristwatch which only underlined the beasts odd position between man and ape bonobo number one brought the dead monkey directly to candace and held it out toward her in both his hands and said sta candace moaned and turned her head she looked like she was about to get sick hes offering it to you melanie told candace try to respond i cant look at it candace said try melanie pleaded candace slowly turned her face reflected her disgust the monkeys head had been crushed just bow or do something melanie encouraged candace smiled weakly and bowed her head bonobo number one bowed and then withdrew incredible melanie said watching the animal leave although hes obviously the alpha male there must still be remnants of the typical matriarchal bonobo society candace you did great kevin said im a wreck candace said i knew i should have been a blond melanie said with her own attempt at humor the bonobo holding the rope gave a tug significantly less forceful than the previous one the group was on the move again and kevin melanie and candace were forced to follow i dont want to go any farther candace said tearfully pull yourself together melanie said everything is going to be okay im starting to think kevins suggestion was right they think of us like gods especially you with that blond hair they could have killed us instantly if theyd been inclined just like they killed the monkeys why did they kill the monkeys candace asked i assume for food melanie said it is a little surprising since bonobos are not carnivorous but chimps can be i was afraid they were human enough for the killing to be for sport candace said the group passed through a marshy area then began a climb fifteen minutes later they emerged from the forest twilight onto a rocky but grassy area at the foot of the limestone escarpment halfway up the rock face was the opening of a cave that appeared to be accessible only by a series of extremely steeply tiered ledges at the lip of the cave were a dozen more bonobos most were female they were striking their chests with the flat of their hands and yelling bada over and over again the bonobos with kevin melanie and candace did the same and then held up the dead colobus monkeys that resulted in hooting from the females that melanie said reminded her of chimps then the group of bonobos at the base of the cliff parted kevin melanie and candace were pulled forward at the sight of them the females above fell silent why do i have the feeling the females arent so happy to see us melanie whispered id rather think they were just confused kevin whispered back they hadnt expected company finally bonobo number one said zit and pointed up with his thumb the group surged forward pulling kevin melanie and candace along chapter march am new york city jacks lids blinked open and he was instantly awake he sat up and rubbed his gritty eyes he was still tired from the poor nights sleep the night before last and from having stayed up later than he planned the previous evening but he was too keyed up to fall back asleep getting up off the couch jack wrapped himself in his blanket against the morning chill and went to the bedroom door he listened for a moment convinced that laurie was still sound asleep he cracked the door as hed expected laurie was on her side under a mound of covers breathing deeply as quietly as possible jack tiptoed across the bedroom and entered the bathroom once the door was closed he quickly shaved and showered when he reappeared he was pleased to see that laurie had not budged getting fresh clothes from his closet and bureau jack carried them out into the living room and got dressed a few minutes later he emerged from his building into the predawn light it was raw and cold with a few snowflakes dancing in the gusts of wind across the street was a squad car with two uniformed policemen drinking coffee and reading the morning papers with the help of the interior light they recognized jack and waved jack waved back lou had kept his word jack jogged down the street to the local deli on columbus avenue one of the policemen dutifully followed jack thought about buying him a donut but decided against it he didnt want the cop to take it the wrong way with an armload of juice coffee fruit and fresh bagels he returned to the apartment laurie was up and was in the shower jack knocked on the door to announce that breakfast was served whenever she was ready laurie appeared a few minutes later clad in jacks robe her hair was still wet the sequelae from the previous nights runin with angelo did not look bad all that was apparent was a mild black eye now that youve had a nights sleep to think about this trip do you still feel the same laurie asked absolutely jack said im psyched are you really going to pay for everyones ticket she asked this could get expensive what else do i have to spend my money on jack said he glanced around his apartment certainly not my lifestyle and the bike is all paid for seriously laurie said i can understand esteban to some extent but warren and natalie the previous night when the proposal had been presented to teodora she had reminded her husband that one of them had to stay in the city to mind the market and be there for their teenage son the decision that esteban would go instead of teodora had been decided by the flip of a coin i was serious about making it fun jack said even if we dont learn anything which is a possibility it will at least be a great trip i could see in warrens eyes his interest to visit that part of africa and on the way back well spend a night or two in paris you dont have to convince me laurie said i was against your going at first but now im excited myself now all we have to do is convince bingham jack said i dont think that will be a problem laurie said neither of us has taken the vacation time theyve wanted us to and lou said hed put in his two cents about the threats hed like to get us out of town i never trust bureaucracy jack said but ill be optimistic and assuming were going lets divvy up the errands ill go ahead and get the tickets while you warren and natalie take care of the visa situation also weve got to arrange for some shots and start malaria prophylaxis we really should have more time for immunizations but well do the best we can and well take a lot of insect repellant sounds good laurie said because of laurie jack left his beloved mountain bike in his apartment together they cabbed down to the medical examiners office when they walked into the id room vinnie lowered his newspaper and looked at them as if they were ghosts what are you guys doing here he asked with a voice that broke he cleared his throat what kind of question is that jack asked we work here vinnie have you forgotten i just didnt think you two were on call vinnie said he hastily took a drink from his coffee cup before coughing again jack and laurie went to the coffee urn hes been in a weird mood for the last couple of days jack whispered laurie glanced back at vinnie over her shoulder vinnie had gone back behind his newspaper that was a strange reaction she agreed i noticed he was nervous around me yesterday jack and lauries eyes met they regarded each other for a moment are you thinking what im thinking laurie asked maybe jack said it kind of fits he certainly has access i think we should say something to lou laurie said id hate it to be vinnie but we have to find out whos been giving out confidential information around here conveniently for laurie her weeklong rotation as the day chief was over and paul plodgetts was starting paul was already at the desk going over the cases that had come in the previous night laurie and jack told him they were planning on taking vacation time and wanted to skip doing any autopsies that day unless there was a glut paul assured them that the case load was light laurie was more politically minded than jack and it was her opinion that they should approach calvin about their vacation plans before they talked with bingham jack bowed to her better judgment calvins response was to merely grunt that they could have given more notice as soon as bingham arrived laurie and jack went to his office he regarded them curiously over the tops of his wirerimmed glasses he was clutching the morning mail which he was in the process of going through you want two weeks starting today he questioned with disbelief whats the rush is this some sort of an emergency were planning on an adventuretype trip jack said wed like to leave this evening binghams watery eyes went back and forth between laurie and jack you two arent planning on getting married are you not that adventuresome jack said laurie sputtered with laughter were sorry not to have given more notice she said the reason for the haste is because last night both of us were threatened over the franconi case threatened bingham questioned does it have anything to do with that shiner youve got im afraid so laurie said shed tried to cover the bruise with makeup but had only been partially successful who was behind these threats bingham asked one of the new york crime families laurie said lieutenant louis soldano offered to fill you in on it as well as talk to you about a possible mole for the crime family here in the medical examiners office we think we have figured out how franconis body was taken from here im listening bingham said he put the mail down and leaned back in his chair laurie explained the story emphasizing that the spoletto funeral home had to have been given the accession number of the unidentified case did detective soldano think it wise for you two to leave town bingham asked yes he did laurie said fine bingham said then youre out of here am i supposed to call soldano or is he calling me it was our understanding that he was going to call you laurie said good bingham said then he looked directly at jack what about the liver issue thats up in the air jack said im still waiting on some more tests bingham nodded and commented this case is a goddamned pain in the ass just make sure im informed cf any breaking news while youre away i dont want any surprises he looked down at his desk and picked up the mail you people have a good trip and send me a postcard laurie and jack went out into the hall and smiled at each other well it looks good jack said bingham was the major potential stumbling block i wonder if we should have told him were going to africa because of the liver issue laurie asked i dont think so jack said he might have changed his mind about letting us go as far as hes concerned he wishes this case would just disappear retiring to their separate offices laurie phoned the equatoguinean embassy about the visas while jack called the airlines she quickly learned that esteban had been right about the ease of getting a visa and that it could be done that morning jack found air france happy to make all the arrangements and he agreed to stop by their office that afternoon to pick up the tickets laurie appeared in jacks office she was beaming im beginning to think this is really going to happen she said excitedly howd you do fine jack said we leave tonight at sevenfifty i cant believe this laurie said i feel like a teenager going on my first trip after making arrangements with the travel and immunization office at the manhattan general hospital they called warren he agreed to get in touch with natalie and meet them at the hospital the nurse practitioner gave each of them a battery of shots as well as prescriptions for antimalarial drugs she also urged them to wait a full week before exposure jack explained that was impossible the nurses response was to say that she was glad they were going and not she in the hall outside the travel office warren asked jack what the woman meant it takes up to a week for these shots to take effect jack explained that is except for the gamma globulin are we taking a risk then warren asked lifes a risk jack quipped seriously theres some risk but each day our immune systems will be better prepared the main problem is the malaria but i intend to take a hell of a lot of insect repellant so youre not concerned warren asked not enough to keep me home jack said after leaving the hospital they all went to a passport photo place and had snapshots taken with those in hand laurie warren and natalie left to visit the equatoguinean embassy jack caught a taxi and directed it to the university hospital once there he went directly up to dr peter malovars lab as usual he found the aged pathologist bent over his microscope jack waited respectfully until the professor had finished studying his current slide ahhh dr stapleton dr malovar said catching sight of jack im glad you came now where is that slide of yours dr malovars lab was a dusty clutter of books journals and hundreds of slide trays the wastebaskets were perennially overflowing the professor steadfastly refused to allow anybody into his work space to clean lest they disturb his structured disorder with surprising speed the professor located jacks slide on top of a veterinary pathology book his nimble fingers picked it up and slipped it under the microscopes objective dr osgoods suggestion to have this reviewed by dr hammersmith was crackerjack dr malovar said as he focused when he was satisfied he sat back picked up the book and opened it to the page indicated by a clean microscope slide he handed the book to jack jack looked at the page dr malovar indicated it was a photomicrograph of a section of liver there was a granuloma similar to the one on jacks slide its the same dr malovar said he motioned for jack to compare by looking into the microscope jack leaned forward and studied the slide the images did seem identical this is certainly one of the more interesting slides you have brought to me dr malovar said he pushed a lock of his wild gray hair out of his eyes as you can read from the book the offending organism is called hepatocystis jack straightened up from looking at his slide to glance back at the book hed never heard of hepatocystis is it rare jack asked in the new york city morgue id have to say yes dr malovar said extremely rare you see it is only found in primates and not only that but it is only found in old world primates meaning primates found in africa and southeast asia its never been seen in the new world and never in humans never jack questioned put it this way dr malovar said ive never seen it and ive seen a lot of liver parasites more important dr osgood has never seen it and he has seen more liver parasites than i with that kind of combined experience id have to say it does not exist in humans of course in the endemic areas it might be a different story but even there it would have to be rare otherwise wed have seen a case or two i appreciate your help jack said distractedly he was already wrestling with the implications of this surprising bit of information it was a much stronger suggestion that franconi had had a xenotransplant than the mere fact that hed gone to africa this would be an interesting case to present at our grand rounds dr malovar said if you are interested let me know of course jack said noncommittally his mind was in a whirl jack left the professor took the hospital elevator down to the ground floor and started toward the medical examiners office finding an old world primate parasite in a liver sample was very telling evidence but then there were the confusing results that ted lynch had gotten on the dna analysis to contend with and on top of that was the fact there was no inflammation in the liver with no immunosuppressant drugs the only thing that was certain was that it all didnt make sense arriving back at the morgue jack went directly up to the dna lab with the intention of grilling ted in the hope that he could come up with some hypothesis to explain what was going on the problem as jack saw it was that jack didnt know enough about current dna science to come up with an idea on his own the field was changing too rapidly jesus stapleton where the hell have you been ted snapped the moment he saw jack ive been calling all over creation and nobodys seen you ive been out jack said defensively he thought for a second about explaining what was going on then changed his mind too much had happened in the previous twelve hours sit down ted commanded jack sat ted searched around on his desktop until he located a particular sheet of developed film covered with hundreds of minute dark bands he handed it to jack ted why do you do this to me jack complained you know perfectly well i have no idea what im looking at with these things ted ignored jack while he searched for another similar piece of celluloid he found it under a laboratory budget he was working on he handed the second one to jack hold them up to the light ted said jack did as he was told he looked at the two sheets even he could tell they were different ted pointed to the first sheet of celluloid this is a study of the region of the dna that codes for ribosomal protein of a human being i just picked a case at random to show you what it looks like its gorgeous jack said lets not be sarcastic ted said ill try jack said now this other one is a study of franconis liver sample ted said its the same region using the same enzymes as the first study can you see how different it is thats the only thing i can see jack said ted snatched away the human study and tossed it aside then he pointed at the film jack was still holding as i told you yesterday this information is on cdrom so i was able to let the computer make a match of the pattern it came back that it was most consistent with a chimpanzee not definitely a chimpanzee jack asked nothing seemed to be definite about this case no but close ted said kind of like a cousin of a chimpanzee something like that do chimps have cousins jack asked you got me ted said with a shrug but ive been dying to give you this information you have to admit its rather impressive so from your perspective it was a xenograft jack said ted shrugged again if you made me guess id have to say yes but taking the dq alpha results into consideration i dont know what to say also ive taken it upon myself to run the dna for the abo blood groups so far thats coming up just like the dq alpha i think its going to be a perfect match for franconi which only confuses things farther its a weird case tell me about it jack said he then related to ted the discovery of an old world primate parasite ted made an expression of confusion im glad this is your case and not mine he said jack placed the sheet of celluloid on teds desk if im lucky i might have some answers in the next few days he said tonight im off to africa to visit the same country franconi did is the office sending you ted asked with surprise nope jack said im going on my own well thats not quite true i mean im paying for it but laurie is going too my god you are thorough ted said dogged is probably a better word jack said jack got up to go when he reached the door ted called out to him i did get the results of the mitochondrial dna back there was a match with mrs franconi so at least your identification was right finally something definitive jack said jack was again about to leave when ted called out again i just had a crazy idea ted said the only way i could explain the results ive been getting is if the liver was transgenic what the hell does that mean jack asked it means the liver contains dna from two separate organisms ted said hmmmm jack said ill have to think about that one cogo equatorial guinea bertram looked at his watch it was four oclock in the afternoon raising his eyes to look out the window he noticed that the sudden violent tropical rainstorm which had totally darkened the sky only fifteen minutes earlier had already vanished in its place was a steamy sunny african afternoon with sudden resolve bertram reached for his phone and called up to the fertility center the evening tech by the name of shirley cartwright answered have the two new breeding bonobo females got their hormone shots today bertram asked not yet shirley said i thought the protocol called for them to get the shots at two pm bertram said thats the usual schedule shirley said hesitantly why the delay bertram asked miss becket hasnt arrived yet shirley explained reluctantly the last thing she wanted to do was get her immediate boss in trouble but she knew she couldnt lie when was she due bertram asked no particular time shirley said shed told the day staff shed be busy all morning in her lab over at the hospital i imagine she got tied up she didnt leave instructions for the hormones to be given by someone else if she didnt arrive by two bertram asked apparently not shirley said so i expect her at any minute if she doesnt come in the next half hour go ahead and give the scheduled doses bertram said will that be a problem no problem whatsoever doctor shirley said bertram disconnected and then dialed melanies lab in the hospital complex he was less familiar with the staff and didnt know the person who answered but the person knew bertram and told him a disturbing story melanie hadnt been in that day because shed been tied up at the animal center bertram hung up and nervously tapped the top of the phone with the nail of his index finger despite siegfrieds assertions that hed taken care of the potential problem with kevin and his reputed girlfriends bertram was skeptical melanie was a conscientious worker it certainly wasnt like her to miss a scheduled injection snapping up the phone again bertram tried calling kevin but there was no answer with his suspicions rising bertram got up from his desk and informed martha his secretary that hed be back in an hour outside he climbed into his cherokee and headed for town as he drove bertram became increasingly certain that kevin and the women had managed to go to the island and it angered him he berated himself for allowing siegfried to lull him into a false sense of security bertram had a growing premonition that kevins curiosity was going to cause major trouble at the point of transition from asphalt to cobblestones at the edge of town bertram had to brake abruptly in his mounting vexation hed been unaware of his speed the wet cobblestones from the recent downpour were as slick as ice so bertrams car skidded several yards before coming to a complete stop bertram parked in the hospital parking lot he climbed to the third floor of the lab and pounded on kevins door there was no response bertram tried the door it was locked returning to his car bertram drove around the town square and parked behind the town hall he nodded to the lazy group of soldiers lounging in broken rattan chairs in the shade of the arcade taking the stairs by twos bertram presented himself to aurielo and said he had to speak to siegfried hes with the chief of security at the moment aurielo said let him know im here bertram said as he began to pace the outer office his irritation was mounting five minutes later cameron mcivers emerged from the inner office he said hello to bertram but bertram ignored him in his haste to get in to see siegfried weve got a problem bertram said melanie becket didnt show up for a scheduled injection this afternoon and kevin marshall is not in his lab im not surprised siegfried said calmly he sat back and stretched with his good arm they were both seen leaving early this morning with the nurse the mÃ©nageÃ trois seems to be blossoming they even had a dinner party late into the night at kevins house and then the women stayed over truly bertram questioned that the nerdy researcher could be involved in such a liaison seemed impossible i should know siegfried said i live across the green from kevin besides i met the women earlier at the chickee bar they were already tipsy and told me they were on their way to kevins where did they go this morning bertram asked i assume to acalayong siegfried said they were seen leaving in a pirogue before dawn by a member of the janitorial staff then they have gone to the island by water bertram snapped they were seen going west not east siegfried said it could have been a ruse bertram said it could have siegfried agreed and i thought of the possibility i even discussed it with cameron but both of us are of the opinion that the only way to visit the island by water is to land at the staging area the rest of the island is surrounded by a virtual wall of mangroves and marsh bertrams eyes rose up to stare at the huge rhino heads on the wall behind siegfried their brainless carcasses reminded him of the site manager yet bertram had to admit in this instance he had a point in fact when the island was initially considered for the bonobo project its inaccessibility by water had been one of its attractions and they couldnt have landed at the staging area siegfried continued because the soldiers are still out there itching to have an excuse to use their aks siegfried laughed it tickles me every time i think of their shooting out melanies car windows maybe youre right bertram said grudgingly of course im right siegfried said but im still concerned bertram said and suspicious i want to get into kevins office for what reason siegfried asked i was stupid enough to show him how to tap into the software wed developed for locating the bonobos bertram said unfortunately hes been taking advantage of it i know because hes accessed it on several occasions for long periods of time id like to see if i can find out what hed been up to id say that sounds quite reasonable siegfried said he called out to aurielo to see to it that bertram had an entrance card for the lab then he said to bertram let me know if you find anything interesting dont worry bertram said armed with the magnetic pass card bertram returned to the lab and entered kevins space locking the door behind him he first went through kevins desk finding nothing he made a quick tour of the room the first sign of trouble was a stack of computer paper next to the printer that bertram recognized as printouts of the island graphic bertram examined each page he could tell that they represented varying scales what he couldnt figure out was the meaning of all the surcharged geometric shapes putting the pages aside bertram went to kevins computer and began to search through his directories it wasnt long before he found what he was looking for the source of the information on the printouts for the next half hour bertram was transfixed by what he found kevin had devised a way to follow individual animals in real time after bertram played with this capability for a while he came across kevins stored information documenting the animals movement over a period of several hours from this information bertram was able to reproduce the geometric shapes you are too clever for your own good bertram said out loud as he allowed the computer to run sequentially through the movements of each animal by the time the program had run its course bertram had seen the problem with bonobo numbers sixty and sixtyseven with mounting anxiety bertram tried to get the indicators for the two animals to move when he couldnt he went back to real time and displayed the two animals current position theyd not changed one iota good lord bertram moaned all at once the worry about kevin vanished and was replaced with a more pressing problem turning off the computer bertram snapped up the printed island graphics and ran out of the lab outside he passed up his car to run directly across the square to the town hall he knew it would take less time on foot he raced up the stairs as he entered the outer office aurielo looked up bertram ignored him he burst into siegfrieds office unannounced ive got to talk with you immediately bertram sputtered to siegfried he was out of breath siegfried was meeting with his foodservice supervisor both appeared stunned by bertrams arrival its an emergency bertram added the foodservice supervisor stood up i can return later he said and left this better be important siegfried warned bertram waved the computer printouts its very bad news he said he took the chair vacated by the supervisor kevin marshall figured out a way to follow the bonobos over time so what siegfried said at least two of the bonobos dont move bertram said number sixty and number sixtyseven and they havent moved for more than twentyfour hours theres only one explanation theyre dead siegfried raised his eyebrows well theyre animals he said animals die we have to expect some attrition you dont understand bertram said with a tinge of disdain you made light of my concern that the animals had split into two groups i told you that it was significant this unfortunately is proof as sure as im standing here those animals are killing each other you think so siegfried asked with alarm theres no doubt in my mind bertram said ive been agonizing over why they split up into two groups i decided it had to have been because we forgot to maintain the balance between males and females theres no other explanation and it means the males are fighting over the females im sure of it oh my god siegfried exclaimed with a shake of his head thats terrible news its more than terrible bertram said its intolerable it will be the ruin of the whole program provided we dont act what can we do siegfried asked first we tell no one bertram said if there is ever an order to harvest either sixty or sixtyseven well deal with that particular problem then second and more important we must bring the animals in like ive been advocating the bonobos wont be killing each other if theyre in separate cages siegfried had to accept the whitehaired veterinarians advice although hed always favored the animals being off by themselves for logistical and security reasons its time was past the animals could not be allowed to kill each other in a very real way there was no choice when should we retrieve them siegfried asked as soon as possible bertram said i can have a team of securitycleared animal handlers ready by dawn tomorrow well begin by darting the splinter group once we have all the animals caged which should take no more than two or three days well move them at night to a section of the animal center that i will prepare i suppose id better recall that contingent of soldiers out by the bridge siegfried said the last thing we need is for them to shoot the animal handlers i didnt like having them out there in the first place bertram said i was afraid they might have shot one of the animals for sport or soup when should we inform our respective bosses at gensys siegfried asked not until it is done bertram said only then will we know how many animals have been killed maybe well also have a better idea of the best ultimate disposition my guess is well have to build a separate new facility for that wed need authorization siegfried said obviously bertram said he stood up all i can say is that it is a damn good thing i had the foresight to move all those cages out there new york city raymond felt better than he had in days things seemed to have gone well from the moment hed gotten up just after nine hed called dr waller anderson and not only was the doctor going to join he already had two clients ready to plunk down their deposits and head out to the bahamas for the bone marrow aspirations then around noon raymond had gotten a call from dr alice norwood whose office was on rodeo drive in beverly hills shed called to say that shed recruited three physicians with large private practices who were eager to come on board one was in century city another in brentwood and the last was in belair she was convinced that these doctors would soon provide a flood of clients because the market on the west coast for the service raymond was offering was nothing short of phenomenal but what had pleased raymond the most during the day was whom he didnt hear from there were no calls from either vinnie dominick or dr daniel levitz raymond took this silence to mean that the franconi business had finally been put to bed at threethirty the door buzzer went off darlene answered it and with a tearful voice told raymond that his car was waiting raymond took his girlfriend in his arms and patted her on the back next time maybe you can go raymond said consolingly really she asked i cant guarantee it raymond said but well try raymond had no control over the gensys flights darlene had been able to go on only one of the trips to cogo on all the other occasions the plane had been full on one of the segments as standard procedure the plane flew from the states to europe and then on to bata on the return trip the same general itinerary was followed although it was always a different european city after promising to call as soon as he arrived in cogo raymond carried his bag downstairs he climbed into the waiting sedan and luxuriously leaned back would you like the radio on sir the driver asked sure why not raymond said he was already beginning to enjoy himself the drive across town was the most difficult part of the trip once they were on the west side highway they were able to make good time there was a lot of traffic but since rush hour had not begun the traffic moved fluidly it was the same situation on the george washington bridge in less than an hour raymond was dropped off at teterboro airport the gensys plane had not yet arrived but raymond was not concerned he positioned himself in the lounge where he had a view of the runway and ordered himself a scotch just as he was being served the sleek gensys jet swooped in low out of the clouds and touched down it taxied over to a position directly in front of raymond it was a beautiful aircraft painted white with a red stripe along its side its only markings were its call sign nsu and a tiny american flag both were on the fin of the tail assembly as if in slow motion a forward door opened and selfcontained steps extended down toward the tarmac an impeccably dressed steward in darkblue livery appeared in the doorway descended the stairs and entered the general aviation building his name was roger perry raymond remembered him well along with another steward named jasper devereau hed been on the plane every trip raymond had made once inside the building roger scanned the lounge the moment he spotted raymond he walked over and greeted him with a salute is this the extent of your luggage sir roger asked as he picked up raymonds bag thats it raymond said are we leaving already isnt the plane going to refuel that had been the procedure on previous flights were all set roger said raymond got to his feet and followed the steward out into the gray raw march afternoon as he approached the luxurious private jet raymond hoped there were people watching him at times like this he felt as if he were living the life that was meant for him he even told himself that he was lucky hed lost his medical license tell me roger raymond called out just before they reached the stairs are we full on the flight to europe on every flight raymond had been on thered been other gensys executives only one other passenger roger said he stepped to the side at the base of the stairs and gestured for raymond to precede him raymond smiled as he climbed with only one other passenger and two stewards the flight was going to be even more enjoyable than hed anticipated the troubles that hed had over the previous few days seemed a small price to pay for such luxury just inside the plane he was met by jasper jasper took his overcoat and jacket and asked if raymond wanted a drink before takeoff ill wait raymond said gallantly jasper pulled aside the drape that separated the galley from the cabin swelling with pride raymond passed into the main part of the plane he was debating which of the deeply cushioned leather chairs to take when his eyes passed over the face of the other passenger raymond froze at the same time he felt a sinking feeling in his gut hello dr lyons welcome aboard taylor cabot raymond croaked i didnt expect to see you i suppose not taylor said im surprised to see myself he smiled and gestured toward the seat next to him raymond quickly sat down he berated himself for not taking the drink jasper had offered his throat had gone bonedry id been informed of the planes flight plan taylor explained and since there was a window of opportunity in my schedule i thought it wise for me to personally check on our cogo operation it was a lastminute decision of course well be making a stop in zurich for me to have a short meeting with some bankers i hope you wont find that inconvenient raymond shook his head no not at all he stammered and how are things going with the bonobo project taylor asked very well raymond managed were expecting a number of new clients in fact were having trouble keeping up with demand and what about that regrettable episode with carlo franconi taylor enquired i trust that has been successfully dealt with yes of course raymond sputtered he tried to smile part of the reason im making this trip is to be reassured that project is worth supporting taylor said my chief financial officer assures me that it is now turning a small profit but my operations officer has reservations about jeopardizing our primate research business so i have to make a decision i hope you will be willing to help me certainly raymond squeaked as he heard the characteristic whine of the jet engines starting it was like a party at the bar in the international departure lounge at jfk airport even lou was there having a beer and popping peanuts into his mouth he was in a great mood and acted as if he were going on the trip jack laurie warren natalie and esteban were sitting with lou at a round table in the corner of the bar over their heads was a television tuned to a hockey game the frantic voice of the announcer and the roar of the fans added to the general din its been a great day lou yelled to jack and laurie we picked up vido delbario and hes singing to save his ass i think well be making a major dent in the vaccarro organization what about angelo facciolo and franco ponti laurie asked thats another story lou said with a laugh for once the judge sided with us and set bail at two million each what did the trick was the police impersonation charge how about spoletto funeral home laurie asked thats going to be a gold mine lou said the owner is the brother of the wife of vinnie dominick you remember him dont you laurie laurie nodded how can i forget whos vinnie dominick jack asked he played a surprising role in the cerino affair laurie explained hes with the competing lucia organization lou said theyve been having a field day after cerinos fall but my gut feeling tells me were going to puncture their balloon what about the mole in the medical examiners office laurie asked hey first things first lou said well get to that dont worry when you do check out one of the techs by the name of vinnie amendola laurie said any particular reason lou asked as he wrote down the name in the small notebook he carried in the side pocket of his jacket just a suspicion laurie said consider it done lou said you know this episode shows how fast things can change yesterday i was in the dog house whereas today im the golden boy i even got a call from the captain about a possible commendation can you believe it you deserve it laurie said hey if i get one you guys should get one too lou said jack felt someone tap on his arm it was the waitress she asked if they wanted another round hey everybody jack called out above the babble of voices more beer jack looked first at natalie who put her hand over her glass to indicate she was fine she looked radiant in a dark purple jumpsuit she was a thirdgrade teacher at a public school in harlem but didnt look like any teacher jack could remember from jacks perspective her features were reminiscent of the egyptian sculptures in the metropolitan museum that laurie had dragged him in to see her eyes were almondshaped and her lips were full and generous her hair was done up in the most elaborate cornrow style that jack had ever seen natalie had said that it was her sisters forte when jack looked at warren to see whether he wanted more beer he shook his head warren was sitting next to natalie he was wearing a sport jacket over a black tshirt that somehow managed to hide his powerful physique he looked happier than jack had ever seen him his mouth harbored a half smile instead of his normal expression of hardlipped determination im fine esteban called out he too was smiling even more broadly than warren jack looked at laurie no more for me i want to save some room for wine with dinner on the plane laurie had her auburn hair braided and was wearing a loosefitting velour top with leggings with her relaxed ebullient demeanor and casual clothes jack thought she looked like she was in college yeah sure ill have another beer lou said one beer jack told the waitress then the check howd you guys make out today lou asked jack and laurie were here jack said that was the goal laurie and the others got the visas and i got the tickets he patted his stomach i also got a bunch of french francs and a money belt i was told that the french franc was the hard currency of choice for that part of africa whats going to happen when you arrive lou asked jack pointed over to esteban our expatriate traveling companion has taken care of the arrangements his cousins meeting us at the airport and his wifes brother has a hotel you should be fine lou said whats your plan estebans cousin has arranged for us to rent a van jack said so well drive to cogo and just drop in lou asked thats the idea jack said good luck lou said thanks jack said well probably need it a half hour later the groupminus loumerrily boarded the they found their seats and stowed their carryon baggage no sooner had they gotten themselves situated than the huge plane lurched and was pulled from the gate later when the engines began to scream and the plane began its dash down the runway to takeoff laurie felt jack take her hand he gripped it fiercely are you okay she asked jack nodded ive just learned not to like air travel he said laurie understood were on our way warren exclaimed gleefully africa here we come chapter march am cogo equatorial guinea are you asleep candace whispered are you kidding melanie whispered back how am i supposed to sleep on rock with just a few branches strewn over it i cant sleep either candace admitted especially with all this snoring going on what about kevin im awake kevin said they were in a small side cave jutting off the main chamber just behind the main entrance the darkness was almost absolute the only light came from meager moonlight reflected from outside kevin melanie and candace had been shuttled into this small cave immediately on their arrival it measured about ten feet wide with a downward sloping ceiling that started at a maximum height roughly equivalent to kevins five feet ten inches there was no back wall to this cave the chamber simply narrowed to a tunnel earlier in the evening kevin had explored the tunnel with the help of the flashlight in hopes of finding another way out but the tunnel abruptly ended after about thirty feet the bonobos had treated them well even after the initially cold reception by the females apparently the animals were mystified by the humans and intended to keep them alive and well theyd provided them with muddy water in gourds and a variety of food unfortunately the food was in the form of grubs maggots and other insects along with some kind of sedge from lago hippo later in the afternoon the animals had started a fire at the caves entrance kevin was particularly interested in how they started it but hed been too far back to observe their method a group of the bonobos had formed a tight circle and then a half an hour later a fire was going well that answers the question about the smoke kevin had said the animals had skewered the colobus monkeys and roasted them over the fire the monkeys were then torn apart and distributed with great fanfare given all the hooting and vocalizations it had been obvious to the humans that this monkey meat was considered a great treat bonobo number one had placed a few morsels of the feast on a large leaf and brought them back to the humans only kevin had been willing to try it hed said it was the toughest thing hed ever chewed as far as taste was concerned hed told the women that it was strangely similar to the elephant hed once sampled the previous year siegfried had bagged a forest elephant on one of his hunting forays and after taking the tusks hed had some of the meat cooked up by the central kitchen the bonobos had not tried to imprison the humans and had not tried to inhibit kevin and the women from untying the rope that bound them together at the same time the bonobos had made it clear that they were to stay in the small cave at all times at least two of the larger male bonobos remained in the immediate vicinity each time kevin or one of the women tried to venture forth these guards would screech and howl at the top of their lungs even more threatening they would ferociously charge with bared teeth only to pull up short at the last minute thus they effectively kept the humans in their place were going to have to do something melanie said we cant stay here forever and its pretty apparent well have to do it while they are all sleeping like now every bonobo in the cave including the supposed guards were fast asleep on primitive pallets constructed of branches and leaves most were snoring i dont think we should take the chance of angering them kevin said were lucky theyve treated us as well as they have being offered maggots to eat is not what id call being well treated melanie said seriously we have to do something besides they might turn on us theres no way to anticipate what theyll do i prefer to wait kevin said were a novelty now but theyll lose interest in us besides were undoubtedly missed back in town it wont take siegfried or bertram that long to figure out what weve done then theyll come for us im not convinced melanie said siegfried might take our disappearance as a godsend siegfried might but bertram wont kevin said hes basically a nice person what do you think candace melanie asked i dont know what to think candace said this situation is so far beyond anything id ever thought id be involved in that i dont know how to react im numb what are we going to do when we do get back kevin said we havent talked about that if we get back melanie said dont talk that way candace said we have to face facts melanie said thats why i think we should do something now while theyre all asleep we have no idea how soundly they sleep kevin said trying to walk out of here will be like walking through a mine field one thing is for sure candace said im not going to be involved in any more harvests i began to feel uncomfortable when i thought they were apes now that we know theyre protohumans i cant do it i know that much about myself thats a foregone conclusion kevin said i cant imagine any sensitive human being would feel differently but thats not the issue the issue is that this new race exists and if theyre not to be used for transplants whats to be done with them will they be able to reproduce candace asked most assuredly melanie said nothing was done to them to affect their fertility oh my candace said this is a horror maybe they should be rendered infertile melanie said then thered only be a single generation to consider i wish id thought of all this before i started this project kevin said the problem was that once i stumbled onto the ability to interchange chromosomal parts the intellectual stimulation was so strong i never considered other consequences there was a sudden bright flash of lightning momentarily illuminating the interior of the cave followed by a loud clap of thunder the concussion seemed to shake the entire mountain the violent display was natures way of announcing that one of the almost daily thunderstorms was about to inundate the island now thats an argument in favor of my position melanie said after the sound of the thunder died away what are you talking about kevin asked that thunder was loud enough to wake the dead melanie explained and not one of the bonobos so much as blinked its true candace said i think at least one of us should try to get out of here melanie said that way we could be sure that bertram will be alerted as to what is happening out here bertram can also make arrangements for someone to come here and rescue the others i guess i agree candace said of course you do melanie said there were a few moments of silence finally kevin broke it wait a second you guys are not suggesting that i go i couldnt get in the canoe much less paddle it melanie said i could get in it but i doubt i could paddle it in the dark candace said and you two think i could kevin asked certainly better than we could melanie said kevin shivered the idea of trying to get to the canoe in the dark knowing the hippos were out grazing was a scary thought even more scary was trying to paddle across the pond knowing it was filled with crocodiles maybe you could hide in the canoe until it gets light melanie suggested the important thing is to get out of this cave and away from these creatures while they are sleeping the idea of waiting in the canoe was better than trying to cross the lake in the darkness but it did not address the potential problem of running into the hippos in the marshy field remember it was your suggestion to come out here melanie reminded him kevin started to strongly protest but he stopped in a way it was true hed said that the only way to learn whether the bonobos were protohumans was to come to the island but from then on melanie had been the one to call the shots it was your suggestion candace said i remember it well we were in your office it was when you first raised the question about the smoke but i only said kevin began but he stopped from past experience he knew he was illequipped to argue with melanie and especially when candace supported her as she was now doing besides from where kevin was sitting he could see a clear path of moonlight along the cave floor all the way to the entrance except for a few rocks and branches there were no obstructions kevin began to think maybe he could do it maybe it was best not to think of the hippos maybe it was true that the creatures hospitality could not be counted upon not because of the bonobo part of their heritage but because of the human part all right kevin said with sudden resolve ill try hooray melanie said kevin pushed himself up onto his hands and knees he was already trembling with the knowledge that there were fifty powerful and wild animals in the immediate environment that wanted him to stay where he was if something goes wrong melanie said just get yourself back here in a hurry you make it sound so easy kevin said it will be melanie said bonobos and chimps fall asleep as soon as it gets dark and sleep until dawn youre not going to have any trouble but what about the hippos kevin said what about them melanie asked never mind kevin said ive got enough to worry about okay good luck melanie whispered yeah good luck candace echoed kevin tried to stand up and start out but he couldnt he kept telling himself that hed never been a hero and this was no time to start whats the matter melanie asked nothing kevin said then suddenly from some place deep within himself kevin found the courage he rose to a hunchedover position and began to pick his way along the path of moonlight toward the mouth of the cave as kevin moved he debated whether he would do better to move at a snails pace or make an outandout dash for the canoe it was an argument between caution and getting the ordeal over with caution won out he moved with painstaking baby steps every time his foot made the slightest noise he winced and froze in the darkness all around him he could hear the stertorous breathing of the sleeping creatures twenty feet from the caves entrance one of the bonobos moved so suddenly the branches in his bed snapped again kevin stopped in midstride his heart pounding but the bonobo had only stirred and was still breathing heavily a sign of sleep with additional light from the proximity of the cave entrance kevin could clearly see the bonobos sprawled about him the sight of so many sleeping beasts was enough to stop him dead in his tracks after a full minute of paralysis kevin recommenced his progress toward freedom he even began to feel the first wave of relief as the smell of the damp jungle replaced the feral scent of the bonobos but that relief was shortlived another clap of thunder followed by a sudden tropical downpour scared kevin to the point that he almost lost his balance it was only after frantic arm swinging that he managed to stay upright and in his planned path he shuddered to think how close hed come to stepping on one of the sleeping bonobos with another ten feet to go kevin could now see the black silhouette of the jungle below the nocturnal sounds of the jungle were now audible over the bonobos snores kevin was close enough to begin worrying about how to make the steep descent to the ground when calamity struck his heart leaped into his throat as he felt a hand on his leg something had grabbed him around the ankle with such force that instant tears formed in his eyes looking down in the half light the first thing he saw was his watch it was on the hairy wrist of the powerful bonobo number one tada shouted the bonobo as he leaped to his feet upending kevin in the process luckily the floor of that part of the cave was covered with refuse which broke kevins fall nevertheless he landed on his left hip in a jarring fashion bonobo number ones yell brought the other bonobos to their feet for a moment there was utter chaos until they all understood that there was no danger bonobo number one let go of kevins ankle only to reach down and grasp him by his upper arms in an amazing demonstration of strength he picked kevin up and held him off the ground at arms length the bonobo gave a loud long angry vocalization all kevin could do was wince in pain at the animals tight grip at the end of his tirade bonobo number one marched into the depths of the cave and literally tossed kevin into the smaller chamber after a final angry word he went back to his pallet kevin managed to push himself up to a sitting position hed again landed on his hip and it felt numb hed also sprained a wrist and scraped an elbow but considering the fact that hed been literally thrown through the air he was better off than hed anticipated more cries echoed inside of the cave presumably from bonobo number one but kevin couldnt tell for certain in the darkness he felt his right elbow he knew that the sticky warmth had to be blood kevin melanie whispered are you okay as good as can be expected kevin said thank god melanie said what happened i dont know kevin said id thought id made it i was right at the caves entrance are you hurt candace asked a little kevin admitted but no broken bones at least i dont think so we couldnt see what happened melanie said my double scolded me kevin said at least thats what i think he was doing then he threw me back in here im glad i didnt land on either of you im so sorry i encouraged you to go melanie said i guess you were right its good of you to say kevin said well it almost worked i was so close candace switched on the flashlight with her hand shielding the front lens she held it near kevins arm to check his elbow i guess were going to have to count on bertram edwards melanie said she shuddered and then sighed its hard to believe were prisoners of our own creations chapter march pm bata equatorial guinea jack realized hed been clenching his teeth he was also holding lauries hand much harder than was reasonable consciously he tried to relax the problem had been the flight from douala cameroon to bata the airline was a flybynight outfit that used small old commuter planes just the kind of aircraft that plagued jacks nightmares about his late family the flight had not been easy the plane constantly dodged thunderstorms whose towering clouds varied in color from whippedcream white to deep purple lightning had flashed constantly and the turbulence was fierce the previous part of the trip had been a dream the flight from new york to paris had been smooth and blissfully uneventful everyone had slept at least a few hours arrival in paris had been ten minutes early so theyd had ample time to make their connection with cameroon airlines everyone slept even more on the flight south to douala but that final leg to bata was a hairraiser were landing laurie said to jack i hope it is a controlled landing jack quipped he looked out the dirty window as hed expected the landscape was a carpet of uninterrupted green as the tops of the trees came closer and closer he hoped there was a runway ahead eventually they touched down onto tarmac and jack and warren breathed simultaneous sighs of relief as the weary travelers climbed out of the small aged plane jack looked across the illmaintained runway and saw a strange sight it was a resplendent white jet sitting all by itself against the dark green of the jungle at four points surrounding the plane were soldiers in camouflage fatigues and red berets although ostensibly standing upright theyd all assumed varying postures of repose automatic rifles were casually slung over their shoulders whose plane jack asked esteban with no markings it was apparent it was a private jet i cant imagine esteban said everyone except esteban was unprepared for the chaos in the airport arrival area all foreign arrivals had to go through customs the group was taken along with their luggage to a side room they were led to this unlikely spot by two men in dirty uniforms with automatic pistols bolstered in their belts at first esteban had been excluded from the room but after a loud argument on his part in a local dialect he was allowed in the men opened all the bags and spread the contents onto a picnicsized table esteban told jack the men expected bribes at first jack refused on principle when it became apparent that the standoff was going to last for hours jack relented ten french francs solved the problem as they exited into the main part of the airport esteban apologized its a problem here he said all government people take bribes they were met by estebans cousin whose name was arturo he was a heavyset enormously friendly individual with bright eyes and flashing teeth who shook hands enthusiastically with everyone he was attired in native african costume flowing robes in a colorful print and a pillbox hat they stepped out of the airport into the hot humid air of equatorial africa the vistas in all directions seemed immense since the land was relatively flat the lateafternoon sky was a faraway blue directly overhead but enormous thunderheads were nestled all along the horizon man i cant believe this warren said he was gazing around like a kid in a toy store ive been thinking about coming here for years but i never thought id make it he looked at jack thanks man give it here warren stuck out his hand he and jack exchanged palm slaps as if they were back on the neighborhood basketball court arturo had the rented van parked at curbside he slipped a couple of bills into the palm of a policeman and gestured for everyone to climb in esteban insisted that jack ride in the front passenger seat too tired to argue jack climbed in the vehicle was an old toyota with two rows of benches behind the front bucket seats laurie and natalie squeezed into the very back while warren and esteban took the middle as they exited the airport they had a view out over the ocean the beach was broad and sandy gentle waves lapped the shore after a short distance they passed a large unfinished cement structure that was weathered and crumbling rusted rebars stuck out of the top like the spines of sea urchins jack asked what it was it was supposed to be a tourist hotel arturo said but there was no money and no tourists thats a bad combination for business jack said while esteban played tour guide and pointed out various sights jack asked arturo if they had far to go no ten minutes arturo said i understand you worked for gensys jack said for three years arturo said but no more the manager is a bad person i prefer to stay in bata im lucky to have work we want to tour the gensys facility jack said do you think well have any trouble they dont expect you arturo asked with bewilderment nope jack said its a surprise visit then you may have trouble arturo said i dont think they like visitors when they repaired the only road to cogo they built a gate its manned twentyfour hours a day by soldiers uhoh jack said that doesnt sound good hed not expected restricted access to the town and had counted on being able to drive in directly where he expected to have trouble was getting into the hospital or the labs when esteban called to say you were going to cogo i thought youd been invited arturo said i didnt think to mention the gate i understand jack said its not your fault tell me do you think the soldiers would take money to let us in arturo flashed a glance in jacks direction he shrugged i dont know theyre better paid than regular soldiers how far is the gate from the town jack asked could someone walk through the forest and just pass the gate arturo glanced at jack again the conversation had taken a turn in a direction hed not expected it is quite far arturo said evincing some unease maybe five kilometers and it is not easy to walk in the jungle it can be dangerous and there is only one road jack asked only one road arturo agreed i saw on a map that cogo is on the water jack said what about arriving by boat i suppose arturo said where could someone find a boat jack asked in acalayong arturo said there are many boats there thats how to go to gabon and there would be boats to rent jack asked with enough money arturo said they were now passing through the center of bata it was composed of surprisingly broad treelined litterstrewn streets there were lots of people out and about but relatively few vehicles the buildings were all low concrete structures on the south side of town they turned off the main street and made their way along a rutted unpaved road there were large puddles from a recent rain the hotel was an unimposing twostory concrete building with rusted rebars sticking out the top for potential future upward expansion the facade had been painted blue but the color had faded to an indistinct pastel the moment they stopped an army of congenial children and adults emerged from the front door everyone was introduced down to the youngest shy child it turned out that several multigenerational families lived on the first floor the second floor was the hotel the rooms turned out to be tiny but clean they were all situated on the outside of the ushaped building access was by way of a veranda open to the courtyard there was a toilet and a shower on each end of the u after putting his bag in his room and appreciating the mosquito netting around the inordinately narrow bed jack went out onto the veranda laurie came out of her room together they leaned on the balustrade and peered down into the courtyard it was an interesting combination of banana trees discarded tires naked infants and chickens not quite the four seasons jack said laurie smiled its charming im happy theres not a bug in my room that had been my main worry the proprietors estebans brotherinlaw florenico and his wife celestina had prepared a huge feast the main course was a local fish served with a turniplike plant called malanga for dessert there was a type of pudding along with exotic fruit an ample supply of icecold cameroonean beer helped wash it all down the combination of plentiful food and beer took a toll on the exhausted travelers it wasnt long before all of them were fighting drooping eyelids with some effort they dragged themselves upstairs to their separate rooms full of plans to rise early and head south in the morning bertram climbed the stairs to siegfrieds office he was exhausted it was almost eightthirty at night and hed been up since fivethirty that morning to accompany the animal handlers out to isla francesca to help get the mass retrieval under way theyd worked all day and only returned to the animal center an hour earlier aurielo had long since gone home so bertram walked directly into the managers office siegfried was by the window facing the square with a glass in his hand he was staring over at the hospital the only light in the room was from the candle in the skull just as it had been three nights before its flame flickered from the action of the overhead fan sending shadows dancing across the stuffed animal trophies make yourself a drink siegfried said without turning around he knew it was bertram since theyd talked on the phone a half an hour earlier and made plans to meet bertram was more of a wine drinker than an imbiber of hard alcohol but under the circumstances he poured himself a double scotch he sipped the fiery fluid as he joined siegfried at the window the lights of the hospital lab complex glowed warmly in the moist tropical night did you know taylor cabot was coming bertram asked i hadnt the faintest idea siegfried said what did you do with him bertram asked siegfried gestured toward the hospital hes at the inn i had the chief surgeon move out of what we call the presidential suite of course he was none too happy you know how these egotistical doctors are but what was i supposed to do its not like im running a hotel here do you know why cabot came bertram asked raymond said that he came specifically to evaluate the bonobo program siegfried said i was afraid of that bertram said its just our luck siegfried complained the program has been running like a swiss clock for years on end and just when we have a problem he shows up what did you do with raymond bertram asked hes over there too siegfried said hes a pain in the ass he wanted to be away from cabot but where was i supposed to put him in my house no thank you has he asked about kevin marshall bertram asked of course siegfried said as soon as he got me aside it was his first question what did you say i told the truth siegfried said i told him kevin had gone off with the reproductive technologist and the intensive care nurse and that i had no idea where he was what was his reaction he got red in the face siegfried said he wanted to know if kevin had gone to the island i told him that we didnt think so then he ordered me to find him can you imagine i dont take orders from raymond lyons so kevin and the women have not reappeared bertram asked no and not a word siegfried said have you made any effort to find them bertram asked i sent cameron over to acalayong to check out those cheap hotels along the waterfront but he didnt have any luck im thinking they might have gone over to cocobeach in gabon thats what makes the most sense but why they didnt tell anyone is beyond me what a godawful mess bertram commented how did you do on the island siegfried asked we did well considering how fast we had to put the operation together bertram said we got an allterrain vehicle over there with a wagon it was all we could think of to get that many animals back to the staging area how many animals did you get twentyone bertram said which is a tribute to my crew it suggests well be able to finish up by tomorrow so soon siegfried commented thats the first encouraging news all day its easier than we anticipated bertram said the animals seem enthralled by us they are trusting enough to let us get close with the dart gun its like a turkey shoot im glad something is going right siegfried said the twentyone animals we got today were all part of the splinter group living north of the rio diviso it was interesting how they were living theyd made crude huts on stilts with roofs of layered lobelia leaves i dont give a damn how those animals were living siegfried snapped dont tell me youre going soft too no im not going soft bertram said but i still find it interesting there was also evidence of campfires so its good were putting them in the cages siegfried said they wont be killing each other and they wont be playing around with fire thats one way to look at it bertram agreed any sign of kevin and the women on the island siegfried asked not in the slightest bertram said and i made it a point to look but even in areas they would have left footprints there was nothing we spent part of today building a log bridge over the rio diviso so tomorrow well start retrievals near the limestone cliffs ill keep my eyes open for signs theyd been there i doubt youll find anything but until they are located we shouldnt rule out the possibility they went to the island but ill tell you if they did go and they come back here ill turn them over to the equatoguinean minister of justice with the charge that they have severely compromised the gensys operation of course that means theyll be lined up out in the soccer field in front of a firing squad before they knew what hit them nothing like that could happen until cabot and the others leave bertram said with alarm obviously siegfried said besides i mentioned the soccer field only figuratively id tell the minister theyd have to be taken out of the zone to be shot any idea when cabot and the others will be taking the patient back to the states no one has said anything siegfried said i guess its up to cabot i hope it will be tomorrow or at the very latest the following day chapter march am bata equatorial guinea jack awakened at fourthirty and was unable to get back to sleep ironically the racket made by tree frogs and crickets in the courtyard banana trees was too much even for someone fully adjusted to the noisy sirens and general din of new york city taking his towel and his soap jack stepped out on the veranda and started for the shower midway he bumped into laurie on her way back what are you doing up jack asked it was still pitch dark outside we went to bed around eight laurie said eight hours thats a reasonable nights sleep for me youre right jack said hed forgotten how early it was when theyd all collapsed ill go down into the kitchen area and see if i can find any coffee laurie said ill be right down jack said by the time jack got downstairs to the dining room he was surprised to find the rest of his group already having breakfast jack got a cup of coffee and some bread and sat down between warren and esteban arturo mentioned to me that he thought you were crazy to go to cogo without an invitation esteban said with his mouth full all jack could do was nod he told me you wont get in esteban said well see jack said after swallowing ive come this far so im not going to turn back without making an effort at least the road is good thanks to gensys esteban said worst case weve had an interesting drive jack said an hour later everyone met again in the dining room jack reminded the others that going to cogo wasnt a command performance and that those people who preferred to stay in bata should do so he said that hed been told it might take four hours each way you think you can make out on your own esteban asked absolutely jack said its not as if well be getting lost the map indicates only one main road heading south even i can handle that then i think ill stay esteban said i have more family id like to see by the time they were on the road with warren in the front passenger seat and the two women in the middle seat the eastern sky was just beginning to show a faint glow of dawn as they drove south they were shocked at how many people were walking along the road on their way into the city there were mostly women and children and most of the women were carrying large bundles on their heads they dont seem to have much but they appear happy warren commented many of the children stopped to wave at the passing van warren waved back the outskirts of bata dragged by the cement buildings eventually changed to simple whitewashed mud brick structures with thatched roofs reed mats formed corrals for goats once completely out of bata they began to see stretches of incredibly lush jungle traffic was almost nonexistent save for occasional large trucks going in the opposite direction as the trucks went by the wind jostled the van man those truckers move warren commented fifteen miles south of bata warren got out the map there was one fork and one turn in the road that they had to navigate appropriately or lose considerable time signs were almost nonexistent when the sun came up they all donned their sunglasses the scenery became monotonous uninterrupted jungle except for occasional tiny clusters of thatched huts almost two hours after theyd left bata they turned onto the road that led to cogo this is a much better road warren commented as jack accelerated up to cruising speed it looks new jack said the previous road had been reasonably smooth although its surface appeared like a patchwork quilt from all the separate repairs they were now heading southeast away from the coast and into considerably denser jungle they also began to climb in the distance they could see low junglecovered mountains seemingly out of nowhere came a violent thunderstorm just prior to its arrival the sky became a swirling mass of dark clouds day turned to night in the space of several minutes once the rain started it came down in sheets and the vans old ragged windshield wipers could not keep up with the downpour jack had to slow to less than twenty miles an hour fifteen minutes later the sun poked out between massive clouds turning the road into a ribbon of rising steam on a straight stretch a group of baboons crossing the road looked as if they were walking on a cloud after passing through the mountains the road turned back to the southeast warren consulted the map and told everyone they were within twenty miles of their destination rounding another turn they all saw what looked like a white building in the middle of the road what the hells this warren said were not there yet no way i think its a gate jack said i was told about this only last night keep your fingers crossed we might have to switch to plan b as they got closer they could see that on either side of the central structure were enormous white latticework fences they were on a roller mechanism so they could be drawn out of the way to permit vehicles to pass jack braked and brought the van to a stop about twenty feet from the fence out of the twostory gate house stepped three soldiers dressed similarly to those whod been guarding the private jet at the airport like the soldiers at the airport these men were carrying assault rifles only these men were holding their guns waist high aimed at the van i dont like this warren said these guys look like kids stay cool jack said he rolled his window down hi guys nice day huh the soldiers didnt move their blank expressions didnt change jack was about to ask them kindly to open the gate when a fourth man stepped out into the sunlight to jacks surprise this man was pulling on a black suit jacket over a white shirt and tie in the middle of the steaming jungle it was absurd the other surprising thing was that the man wasnt black he was arab can i help you the arab asked his tone was not friendly i hope so jack said were here to visit cogo the arab glanced at the windshield of the vehicle presumably looking for some identification not seeing it he asked jack if he had a pass no pass jack admitted were just a couple of doctors interested in the work thats going on here what is your name the arab asked dr jack stapleton ive come all the way from new york city just a minute the arab said before disappearing back into the gate house this doesnt look good jack said to warren out of the corner of his mouth he smiled at the soldiers how much should i offer him im not good at this bribing stuff money must mean a lot more here than it does in new york warren said why dont you overwhelm him with a hundred dollars i mean if its worth it to you jack mentally converted a hundred dollars into french francs then extracted the bills from his money belt a few minutes later the arab returned the manager says that he does not know you and that you are not welcome the arab said shucks jack said then he extended his left hand with the french francs casually stuck between his index finger and his ring finger we sure do appreciate your help the arab eyed the money for a moment before reaching out and taking it it disappeared into his pocket in the blink of an eye jack stared at him for a moment but the man didnt move jack found it difficult to read his expression because the mans mustache obscured his mouth jack turned to warren didnt i give him enough warren shook his head i dont think its going to happen you mean he just took my money and thats that jack asked be my guess warren said jack turned his attention back to the man in the black suit jack estimated he was about a hundred and fifty pounds definitely on the thin side for a moment jack entertained the idea of getting out of the car and asking for his money back but a glance at the soldiers made him think otherwise with a sigh of resignation jack did a threepoint turn and headed back the way theyd come phew laurie said from the backseat i did not like that one bit you didnt like it jack questioned now im pissed whats plan b warren asked jack explained about his idea of approaching cogo by boat from acalayong he had warren look at the map given how long it had taken them to get where they were he asked warren to estimate how long it would take to get to acalayong id say three hours warren said as long as the road stays good the problem is we have to backtrack quite a way before heading south jack glanced at his watch it was almost nine am that means wed get there about noon id judged we could get from acalayong to cogo in an hour even in the worlds slowest boat say we stay in cogo for a couple hours i think wed still get back at a reasonable hour what do you guys say im cool warren said jack looked in the rearview mirror i could take you ladies back to bata and come back tomorrow my only reservation about any of us going is those soldiers with the assault rifles laurie said i dont think thats a problem jack said if they have soldiers at the gate then they dont need them in the town of course theres always the chance they patrol the waterfront which would mean id be forced to use plan c whats plan c warren asked i dont know jack said i havent come up with it yet what about you natalie jack asked im finding it all interesting natalie said ill go along with the crowd it took almost an hour to get to the point where a decision had to be made jack pulled to the side of the road whats it going to be gang he asked he wanted to be absolutely sure back to bata or on to acalayong i think ill be more worried if you go by yourself laurie said count me in natalie jack said dont be influenced by these other crazies what do you want to do ill go natalie said okay jack said he put the car in gear and turned left toward acalayong siegfried got up from his desk with his coffee mug in hand and walked to the window overlooking the square he was mystified the cogo operation had been up and running for six years and never had they had someone come to the gate house and request entrance equatorial guinea was not a place people visited casually siegfried took a swig of his coffee and wondered if there could be any connection between this abnormal event and the arrival of taylor cabot the ceo of gensys both were unanticipated and both were particularly unwelcome since they came just when there was a major problem with the bonobo project until that unfortunate situation was taken care of siegfried didnt want any stray people around and he put the ceo in that category aurielo poked his head in the door and said that dr raymond lyons was there and wished to see him siegfried rolled his eyes he didnt want raymond around either send him in siegfried said reluctantly raymond came into the room looking as tanned and healthy as ever siegfried envied the mans aristocratic appearance and the fact that he had two good arms have you located kevin marshall yet raymond demanded no we havent siegfried said he took immediate offense at raymonds tone i understand its been fortyeight hours since hes been seen raymond said i want him found sit down doctor siegfried said sharply raymond hesitated he didnt know whether to get angry or be intimidated by the managers sudden aggressiveness i said sit siegfried said raymond sat the white hunter with his horrid scar and limp arm could be imposing particularly surrounded by evidence of his extensive kills let us clear up a point involving the chain of command siegfried said i do not take orders from you in fact when you are here as a guest you take orders from me is that understood raymond opened his mouth to protest but thought better of it he knew siegfried was technically correct and while we are talking so directly siegfried added where is my retrieval bonus in the past ive always gotten it when the patient left the zone on his way back to the states thats true raymond said tautly but there have been major expenses money is coming in shortly from new clients youll be paid as soon as it comes in i dont want you to think you can give me the runaround siegfried warned of course not raymond blurted out and one other thing siegfried said isnt there some way you can hasten the ceos departure his presence here in cogo is disrupting cant you use the patients needs in some way i dont see how raymond said hes been informed the patient is capable of traveling what more can i say think of something siegfried said ill try raymond said meanwhile please locate kevin marshall his disappearance concerns me im afraid he might do something rash we believe he went to cocobeach in gabon siegfried said he was gratified with the appropriate subservience in raymonds voice youre sure he didnt go to the island raymond asked we cant be totally sure siegfried admitted but we dont think so even if he did he wouldnt be apt to stay there he would have been back by now its been fortyeight hours raymond stood up and sighed i wish he would turn up worrying about him is driving me up the wall especially with taylor cabot here its just something else in a long string of problems going on in new york that have threatened the program and made my life miserable well continue to search siegfried assured him he tried to sound sympathetic but in actuality he was wondering how raymond was going to respond when he heard the bonobos were being rounded up to be brought into the animal center all other problems paled in the face of the animals killing each other ill try to think of something to say to taylor cabot raymond said as he started for the door if you could id appreciate being informed the moment you hear about kevin marshall certainly siegfried said obligingly he watched with satisfaction as the previously proud doctor beat a meek retreat just as raymond disappeared from view siegfried remembered that raymond was from new york siegfried dashed to his door catching raymond on his way down the stairs doctor siegfried called out with false deference raymond paused and looked back do you happen to know a doctor by the name of jack stapleton the blood drained from raymonds face this reaction was not lost on siegfried i think youd better come back into my office the manager said siegfried closed the door behind raymond who immediately wanted to know how in the world the name jack stapleton had come up siegfried walked around his desk and sat down he gestured toward a chair for raymond siegfried was not happy hed briefly thought of relating the unexpected request for a site visit by strange doctors to taylor cabot hed not thought of relating it to raymond just before you arrived i got an unusual call from our gate house siegfried said the moroccan guard told me that there was a van full of people who wanted to tour the facility weve never had uninvited visitors before the van was driven by dr jack stapleton of new york city raymond wiped the perspiration that had appeared on his forehead then he ran both hands simultaneously through his hair he kept telling himself that this couldnt be happening since vinnie dominick was supposed to have taken care of jack stapleton and laurie montgomery raymond hadnt called to find out what had happened to the two he didnt really want to know the details for twenty thousand dollars details werent something he should have to worry aboutor so he thought if pressed he would have guessed that stapleton and montgomery were somewhere floating in the atlantic ocean about now your reaction to this is starting to concern me siegfried said you didnt let stapleton and his friends in raymond asked no of course not siegfried said maybe you should have raymond said then we could have dealt with them jack stapleton is a very big danger to the program i mean is there a way here in the zone to take care of such people there is siegfried said we just turn them over to the equatoguinean minister of justice or the minister of defense along with a sizable bonus punishment is both discreet and very rapid the government is eager to ensure that nothing threatens the goose that lays the golden egg all we need to say is that they are seriously interfering with gensys operations then if they come back i think you should let them in raymond said perhaps you should tell me why siegfried said do you remember carlo franconi raymond asked carlo franconi the patient siegfried asked raymond nodded of course siegfried said well it started with him raymond said as he began the complicated story you think it is safe laurie asked she was looking at a huge hollowedout log canoe with a thatched canopy that was pulled halfway up the beach on the back was a sizable beatup outboard motor it was leaking fuel as evidenced by an opalescent scum that ringed the stern reportedly it goes all the way to gabon twice a day jack said thats farther than cogo how much rent did you have to pay natalie asked it had taken jack a half hour of negotiations to get it a bit more than i expected jack said apparently some people rented one a couple of days ago and it hasnt been seen since that episode has driven the rental price up im afraid more than a hundred or less warren asked he too wasnt impressed with the crafts apparent seaworthiness because if it was more than a c note you got took well lets not quibble jack said in fact lets get the show on the road unless you guys want to back out there was a moment of silence while the group eyed each other im not a great swimmer warren admitted i can assure you that we are not planning on going into the water jack said all right warren said lets go you ladies concur jack asked both laurie and natalie nodded without a lot of enthusiasm at the moment the noonday sun was enervating despite being on the shore of the estuary there was not a breath of air with the women positioned in the stern to help lift the bow jack and warren pushed the heavy pirogue off the shore and jumped in one after the other everyone helped paddle out about fifty feet jack attended to the motor compressing the small hand pump on top of the red fuel tank hed had a boat as a child on a lake in the midwest and had a lot of experience fussing with an outboard this canoe is a lot more stable than it looks laurie said even with jack moving around in the stern it was barely rocking and no leaks natalie said that was my concern warren stayed silent he had a white knuckle grip on the gunwale to jacks surprise the engine started after only two pulls a moment later they were off motoring almost due east after the oppressive heat the breeze felt good the drive to acalayong had been accomplished quicker than theyd anticipated even though the road deteriorated in comparison to the road north of the cogo turnoff there was no traffic save for an occasional northwardbound van inconceivably packed with passengers even the luggage racks on the tops had two or three people holding on for dear life acalayong had brought smiles to everyones face it was indicated as a city on the map but turned out to consist of no more than a handful of tawdry concrete shops bars and a few hotels there was a cementblock police post with several men in dirty uniforms sprawled in rattan chairs in the shade of the porch theyd eyed jack and the others with soporific disdain as the van had passed by although they had found the town comically honkytonk and litter strewn theyd been able to get something to eat and drink as well as procure the boat with some unease theyd parked the van in sight of the police station hoping it would be there on their return how long did you estimate it would take us laurie shouted over the noise of the outboard it was particularly loud because a portion of its cowling was missing an hour jack yelled back but the boat owner told me it would be more like twenty minutes its apparently just around the headland directly ahead at that moment they were crossing the twomilewide mouth of rio congue the junglecovered shorelines were hazy with mist thunderheads loomed above two thunderstorms had hit while theyd been in the van i hope we dont get caught out here in the rain natalie said but mother nature ignored her wish less than five minutes later it was pouring so hard that some of the huge drops splashed river water into the boat jack slowed the engine and allowed the boat to guide itself while he joined the others under the thatched canopy to everyones pleasant surprise they stayed completely dry as soon as they rounded the headland they saw cogos pier constructed of heavy pressuretreated timber it was a far cry from the rickety docks at acalayong as they got closer they could see there was a floating portion off the tip the first view of cogo impressed everyone in contrast with the dilapidated and haphazardly constructed buildings with flat corrugated metal roofs endemic to bata and all of acalayong cogo was comprised of attractive tiled whitewashed structures reflecting a rich colonial ambiance to the left and almost hidden by the jungle was a modern power station its presence was obvious only because of its improbably tall smokestack jack cut the engine way back as the town approached so they could hear each other speak tied along the dock were several pirogues similar to the one they were in though these others were piled high with fish netting im glad to see other boats jack said i was afraid our canoe would stand out like a sore thumb do you think that large modern building is the hospital laurie said while pointing jack followed her line of sight yup at least according to arturo and he should know he was part of the initial building crew out here i suppose thats our destination laurie said id guess jack said at least initially arturo said the animal complex is a few miles away in the jungle we might try to figure out a way to get out there the town is bigger than i expected warren said i was told it was an abandoned spanish colonial town jack explained not all of it has been renovated but from here it sure looks like it has what did the spanish do here natalie asked its nothing but jungle they grew coffee and cocoa jack said at least thats my understanding of course i dont have any idea where they grew it uhoh i see a soldier laurie said i see him too jack said his eyes had been searching along the waterfront as they came closer the soldier was dressed in the same jungle camouflage fatigues and red beret as the ones at the gate he was aimlessly pacing a cobblestone square immediately at the base of the pier with an assault rifle slung over his shoulder does that mean we switch to plan c warren questioned teasingly not yet jack said obviously hes where he is to interdict people coming off the pier but look at that chickee hut built on the beach if we got in there wed be home free we cant just run the canoe up onto the beach laurie said hell see that as well look how high that pier is jack said what if we were to slip underneath beach the canoe there and then walk to the chickee hut what do you think sounds cool warren said but this boat is not going to fit under that pier no way jack stood up and made his way over to one of the poles that supported the thatched roof it disappeared into a hole in the gunwale grasping it with both hands he pulled it up how convenient he said this canoe is a convertible a few minutes later they had all the poles out and the thatched roof had been converted to a pile of sticks and dried leaves they distributed it along both sides under the benches the owners not going to be happy about this natalie commented jack angled the boat so that the pier shielded them as much as possible from the line of sight from the square jack cut the engine just at the moment they glided into the shade under the pier grasping the timbers they guided the boat toward shore being careful to duck under crossbeams the boat scraped up the shady patch of shore and came to a stop so far so good jack said he encouraged the women and warren to get out then with warren pulling and jack paddling they got the boat high on the beach jack got out and pointed to a stone wall that ran perpendicular to the base of the pier before disappearing into the gently rising sand of the beach lets hug the wall when we clear it head for the chickee bar a few minutes later they were in the bar the soldier had not paid them any heed either he didnt see them or he didnt care the bar was deserted except for a black man carefully cutting up lemons and limes jack motioned toward the stools and suggested a celebratory drink everyone was happy to comply it had been hot in the canoe after the sun came out and especially after the canopy had come down the bartender came over immediately his name tag identified him as saturnino in contradiction to his name he was a jovial fellow he was wearing a wild print shirt and a pillbox hat similar to the one arturo had on when he picked them up at the airport the previous afternoon following natalies lead everyone had coke with a slice of lemon not much business today jack commented to saturnino not until after five the bartender said then we are very busy were new here jack said what money do we use you can sign saturnino jack looked at laurie for permission laurie shook her head wed rather pay he said are dollars okay what you like saturnino said dollars or cfa it makes no difference where is the hospital jack asked saturnino pointed over his shoulder up the street until you get to the main square it is the big building on the left what do they do there jack asked saturnino looked at jack as if he were crazy they take care of people do people come from america just to go to the hospital jack asked saturnino shrugged i dont know about that he said he took the bills jack had put on the bar and turned to the cash register nice try laurie whispered it would have been too easy jack agreed refreshed after their cold drinks the group headed out into the sunlight they passed within fifty feet of the soldier who continued to ignore them after a short walk up a hot cobblestone street they came to a small green surrounded by plantationstyle homes it reminds me of some of the caribbean islands laurie said five minutes later they entered the treelined town square the group of soldiers lolling in front of the town hall diagonally across from where they were standing spoiled the otherwise idyllic tableau whoa jack said theres a whole battalion i thought you said that if there were soldiers at the gate they wouldnt have to have any in the town laurie said ive been proved wrong jack acknowledged but theres no need to go over and announce ourselves this is the hospital lab complex in front of us from the corner of the square the building appeared to take up most of a cogo city block there was an entrance facing the square but there was also one down the side street to their left to avoid remaining in view of the lounging soldiers they went to the side entrance what are you going to say if were questioned laurie asked with some concern and walking into a hospital you know its bound to happen im going to improvise jack said he yanked the door open and ushered his friends in with an exaggerated bow laurie glanced at natalie and warren and rolled her eyes at least jack could still be charming even when he was most exasperating after entering the building everyone shivered with delight never had air conditioning felt quite so good the room they found themselves in appeared to be a lounge complete with walltowall carpeting club chairs and couches a large bookcase lined one wall some of the shelving was on an angle to display an impressive collection of periodicals from time to national geographic there were about a half dozen people sitting in the room all of them reading in the back wall at desk height was an opening fronted with sliding glass panels behind the glass a black woman in a blue uniform dress was sitting at a desk to the right of the opening was a hall with several elevators could all these people be patients laurie asked good question jack said somehow i dont think so they all look too healthy and too comfortable lets talk to the secretary or whoever she is warren and natalie were intimidated by the hospital environment they silently followed after jack and laurie jack rapped softly on the glass the woman looked up from her work and slid the glass open sorry she said i didnt see you arrive are you checking in no jack said all my bodily functions are working fine at the moment excuse me the woman questioned were here to see the hospital not use its services jack said were doctors this isnt the hospital the woman said this is the inn you can either go out and come in the front of the building or follow the hall to your right the hospital is beyond the double doors thank you jack said my pleasure the woman said she leaned forward and watched as jack and the others disappeared around the corner perplexed the woman sat back and picked up her phone jack led the others through the double doors immediately the surroundings looked more familiar the floors were vinyl and the walls were painted a soothing hospital green a faint antiseptic smell was detectable this is more like it jack said they entered a room whose windows fronted on the square between the windows were a large pair of doors leading to the outside there were a few couches and chairs on area rugs forming distinct conversational groupings but it was nothing like the lounge theyd initially entered but like the lounge this space had a glassfronted information cubbyhole jack again knocked on the glass another woman slid open the glass partition she was equally as cordial we have a question jack said were doctors and wed like to know if there are currently any transplant patients in the hospital yes of course theres one the woman said with a confused look on her face horace winchester hes in and ready to be discharged how convenient jack said what organ was transplanted his liver the woman said are you all from the pittsburgh group no were part of the new york group jack said i see the woman said although her expression suggested she didnt see at all thank you jack said to the woman as he herded the group toward the elevators that could be seen to the right luck is finally going our way jack said excitedly this is going to make it easy maybe all we have to do is get a look at the chart as if thats going to be easy laurie commented true jack said after a moments thought so maybe we should just drop in on horace and get the lowdown from the horses mouth hey man warren said pulling jack to a stop maybe natalie and i should wait down here were not used to being in a hospital you know what im saying i suppose jack said reluctantly but i kind of think its important for us to stick together in case we have to mosey down to the canoe sooner than wed like you know what im saying warren nodded and jack pressed the elevator call button cameron mcivers was accustomed to false alarms after all most of the time he or the office of security was called it was a false alarm accordingly as he entered the front door of the inn he was not concerned but it was his job or one of his deputies to check out all potential problems as he crossed to the information desk cameron noted that the lounge was as subdued as usual the calm scene bolstered his suspicions that this call would be like all the others cameron tapped on the glass and it was slid open miss williams cameron said while touching the brim of his hat in a form of salute cameron and the rest of the security force wore khaki uniforms with an aussie hat when on duty there was also a leather belt with shoulder strap a holstered beretta was attached to the belt on the right side and a handheld twoway radio on the left side they went that way corrina williams said excitedly she lifted herself out of her chair to point around the corner calm down cameron said gently who exactly are you talking about they didnt give any names corrina said there were four of them only one spoke he said he was a doctor hmmm cameron voiced and youve never seen them before never corrina said anxiously they took me by surprise i thought maybe they were to stay at the inn since we had new arrivals yesterday but they said they had come to see the hospital when i told them how to get there they left straightaway were they black or white cameron asked maybe this wouldnt be a typical false alarm after all half and half corrina said two blacks two whites but i could tell from the way they were dressed they were all american i see cameron said while he stroked his beard and pondered the unlikely possibility of any of the zones american workers coming into the inn to say they wanted to see the hospital the one who was talking also said something strange about his bodily functions working fine corrina said i didnt know how to respond hmmm cameron repeated could i use your phone of course corrina said she pulled the phone over from the side of her desk and faced it out toward cameron cameron punched the managers direct line siegfried answered immediately im here at the inn cameron explained i thought you should be apprised of a curious story four strange doctors presented themselves here to miss williams with the wish to see the hospital siegfrieds response was an angry tirade that forced cameron to hold the receiver away from his ear even corrina cringed cameron handed the phone back to the receptionist hed not heard every word of siegfrieds invective but the meaning was clear cameron was to get reinforcements over there immediately and detain the alien doctors cameron unsnapped the straps over both his beretta and the radio simultaneously he pulled the radio free and made an emergency call to base while he started for the hospital room turned out to be in the front of the building with a fine view out over the square looking east jack and the others had found the room without difficulty no one had challenged them in fact they hadnt seen a person as theyd made their way from the elevator to the rooms open door jack had knocked but it was obvious the room was momentarily empty although thered been plenty of evidence the room was occupied a television with a builtin vcr was on and it was showing an old paul newman movie the hospital bed was moderately disheveled an open halfpacked suitcase was poised on a luggage stand the mystery was solved when laurie noticed the sounds of a shower behind the closed bathroom door when the water stopped running jack had knocked but it wasnt until almost ten minutes later that horace winchester appeared the patient was in his midfifties and corpulent but he looked happy and healthy he cinched up the tie on his bathrobe and padded over to the club chair by the bed he sat down with a satisfied sigh whats the occasion he asked smiling at his guests this is more company than ive had the whole time ive been here how are you feeling jack asked he grabbed a straightback chair and sat down directly in front of horace warren and natalie lurked just outside the door they felt reluctant to enter the room laurie went to the window after seeing the group of soldiers shed become progressively anxious she was eager to make the visit short and get back to the boat im feeling just great horace said its a miracle i came here at deaths door and as yellow as a canary look at me now im ready for thirtysix holes of golf at one of my resorts hey any of you people are invited to any of my places for as long as you want to stay and it will all be on the house do you like to ski i do jack said but id rather talk about your case i understand you had a liver transplant here id like to ask where the liver came from a half smile puckered horaces face as he regarded jack out of the corner of his eye is this some kind of test he asked because if it is its not necessary im not going to be telling anyone i couldnt be more grateful in fact as soon as i can im going to have another double made exactly what do you mean by a double jack asked are you people part of the pittsburgh team horace asked he looked over at laurie no were part of the new york team jack said and were fascinated by your case were glad you are doing so well and were here to learn jack smiled and spread his hands palm up were all ears why dont you start from the beginning you mean how i got sick horace asked he was plainly confused no how you arranged to have your transplant here in africa jack said and id like to know what you mean by a double did you by any chance get a liver taken from some kind of ape horace gave a little nervous laugh and shook his head whats going on here he questioned he glanced again at laurie and then at natalie and warren who were still standing in the doorway uhoh laurie suddenly voiced she was staring out the window theres a bunch of soldiers running this way across the square warren quickly crossed the room and looked out shit man they mean business jack stood up reached out and grasped horace by the shoulders he leaned his face close to the patients you are really going to disappoint me if you dont answer my questions and i do the strangest things when im disappointed what kind of animal was it a chimpanzee theyre coming to the hospital warren yelled and they all have aks come on jack urged horace while giving the man a little shake talk to me was it a chimpanzee jack tightened his hold on the man it was a bonobo horace squeaked he was terrified is that a type of ape jack demanded yes horace managed come on man warren encouraged he was back at the door we got to get our asses out of here and what did you mean by a double jack asked laurie grabbed jacks arm theres no time those soldiers will be up here in a minute reluctantly jack let go of horace and allowed himself to be dragged to the door damn i was so close he complained warren was waving frantically for them to follow him and natalie down the central corridor toward the back of the building when the elevator door opened out stepped cameron with his beretta clutched in his hand everyone halt cameron shouted the moment he saw the strangers he grabbed his gun in both hands and trained it on warren and natalie then he swept it around to aim at jack and laurie for cameron the problem was that his adversaries were on either side of him when he was looking at one group he couldnt see the other hands on top of your heads cameron commanded he motioned with the barrel of his gun everyone complied although every time cameron swung the gun toward jack and laurie warren approached another step toward him no one is going to get hurt cameron said as he brought the gun back toward warren warren had gotten within range of a kick and with lightning speed his foot lashed out and connected with camerons hands the gun bounced off the ceiling before cameron could react to his guns sudden disappearance warren closed in on him and hit him twice once in the lower abdomen and then on the tip of the nose cameron collapsed backwards in a heap on the floor im glad youre on my team for this run jack said we got to get ourselves back to that boat warren blurted without humor im open to suggestions jack said cameron moaned and pushed himself over onto his stomach warren looked both ways down the hall a few minutes earlier hed thought of running down the main corridor toward the rear but that was no longer a reasonable alternative halfway down the corridor he could see some nurses gathering and pointing in his direction across from the elevators at eyelevel was a sign in the form of an arrow that pointed down the hall beyond horaces room it said or knowing they had little time to debate warren motioned in the direction of the arrow that way he barked the operating room jack questioned why because they wont expect it warren said he grabbed a stunned natalie by the hand and propelled her into a jog jack and laurie followed they passed horaces room but the chubby man had locked himself in his bathroom the operating suite was set off from the rest of the hospital by the usual swinging doors warren hit them and went through with a straight arm like a football running back jack and laurie were right behind there were no cases under way nor were there any patients in the recovery room there werent even any lights on except for those in a supply room halfway down the hall the supply rooms door was ajar emitting a faint glow hearing the repetitive thumps on the operating room doors a woman appeared from the supply room she was dressed in a scrub suit with a disposable cap she caught her breath as she saw the four figures hurtling in her direction hey you cant come in here in street clothes she yelled as soon as shed recovered from her initial shock but warren and the others had already passed perplexed she watched the intruders run all the way down the rest of the corridor to disappear through the doors leading to the lab turning back into the supply room she went for the wall phone warren skidded to a stop where the corridor formed a t he looked in either direction to the left at the far end was a red wall light indicating a fire alarm above it was an exit sign hold up jack said as warren was preparing to dash down to what he imagined would be a stairwell whats the matter man warren questioned anxiously this looks like a laboratory jack said he stepped over to a glazed door and looked inside he was immediately impressed although they were in the middle of africa it was the most modern lab hed ever seen every piece of equipment looked brand new come on laurie snapped theres no time for curiosity weve got to get out of here its true man warren said especially after hitting that security type back there weve got to make tracks you guys go jack said distractedly ill meet you at the boat warren laurie and natalie exchanged anxious glances jack tried the door it was unlocked he opened it and walked inside oh for crissake laurie complained jack could be so frustrating it was one thing for him to have little concern for his own safety but it was quite another thing for him to compromise others this place is going to be crawling with security dudes and soldiers in nothing flat warren said i know laurie said you guys go ill get him to come as soon as i can i cant leave you warren said think of natalie laurie said nonsense natalie said im no frail female were in this together you ladies go in there and talk some sense into that man warren said im going to run down the hall and pull the fire alarm what on earth for laurie asked its an old trick i learned as a teenager warren said whenever theres trouble cause as much chaos as you can it gives you a chance to slip away ill take your word for it laurie said she motioned for natalie to follow and entered the lab they found jack already engaged in pleasant conversation with a laboratory technician wearing a long white coat she was a frecklefaced redhead with an amiable smile jack already had her laughing excuse me laurie said struggling to keep her voice down jack we have to go laurie meet rolanda phieffer jack said shes originally from heidelberg germany jack laurie intoned through clenched teeth rolandas been telling me something very interesting jack said she and her colleagues here are working on the genes for minor histocompatibility antigens theyre moving them from a specific chromosome in one cell and sticking them into the same location on the same chromosome in another cell natalie whod walked over to a large picture window overlooking the square hastily turned back into the room its getting worse an entire car load of those arabs in black suits are arriving at that moment the fire alarm in the building went off it featured alternating sequences of three earsplitting shrieks of a horn followed by a disembodied voice fire in the laboratory please proceed immediately to stairwells for evacuation do not use the elevators oh my word rolanda said she looked around quickly to see what she should take with her laurie grabbed jack by both arms and shook him jack be reasonable we have to get out of here ive figured it out jack said with a wry smile i dont give a good goddamn laurie spat come on they rushed out into the hall other people were appearing as well everyone seemed confused as they looked up and down the hall some were sniffing there was animated conversation many people were carrying their laptop computers without rushing they moved en masse to the stairwell jack laurie and natalie met up with warren who was holding the door hed also managed to find white coats which he distributed to the others they all pulled them on over their clothes unfortunately they were the only ones wearing shorts they have created some kind of chimera with these apes called bonobos jack said excitedly thats the explanation no wonder the dna tests were so screwy whats he carrying on about now warren asked with irritation dont ask laurie said it will only encourage him whose idea was it to pull the fire alarm jack asked it was brilliant warrens laurie said at least one of us is thinking the stairwell opened up into a parking lot on the north side people were milling about looking back at the building and talking in small groups it was deathly hot since the sun was out and the parking lot was blacktop a wailing fire siren could be heard coming from the northeast what should we do laurie asked im relieved weve gotten as far as we have i didnt think it was going to be so easy to get out of the building lets walk over to the street and turn left jack said while pointing we can circle around the area to the west and get back to the waterfront where are all those soldiers laurie asked and the arabs natalie added id guess theyre looking for us in the hospital jack said lets go before all these lab people start going back into the building warren said they tried not to rush to avoid attracting any attention as they neared the street they all glanced behind them for fear they were being watched but no one was even looking in their direction everybody was captivated by the fire crew whod arrived so far so good jack said warren was the first to reach the street as he got a look to the west around the corner he stopped abruptly and put his arms out to block the others he backed up a step were not going that way he said theyve got a roadblock at the end of the street uhoh laurie said maybe theyve sealed off the area you remember that power station we saw jack said everyone nodded that power has to get over here to the hospital jack said id bet theres a tunnel maybe warren said but the trouble is we dont know how to find it besides im not thrilled about going back inside not with all those kids with aks then lets try walking across the square jack said toward where we saw the soldiers laurie questioned with dismay hey if theyre over here at the hospital there should be no problem jack said thats a point natalie agreed of course we could always give ourselves up and say were sorry jack said i mean what can they do to us besides kick us the hell out i think ive gotten what i came for so it wouldnt bother me in the slightest youre joking laurie said theyre not going to accept a mere apology warren struck that man weve done more than trespass im joking to an extent jack agreed but the man was sticking a gun in our face thats at least an explanation besides we can leave a bunch of our french francs behind supposedly that solves everything in this country it didnt get us past the gate laurie reminded him all right everything but get us in here jack said but ill be very surprised if it doesnt get us out weve got to do something warren said the fire crew are already waving for the people to come back in the building were going to be standing out here in this godawful heat by ourselves so they are jack said squinting against the sunlight he found his sunglasses and put them on lets try crossing the square before the soldiers return once again they tried to walk calmly as if they were strolling they got almost to the grass when they became aware of a commotion at the door into the building they all turned to see a number of the blacksuited arabs push their way pass the lab techs who were entering the arabs rushed out into the sundrenched parking lot with their neckties flapping and their eyes squinting each brandished an automatic pistol in his hand behind the arabs came several soldiers out of breath they stood in the hot sun panting while scanning the neighborhood warren froze and the rest of the group did the same i dont like this warren said the six of them have enough fire power to rob the chase manhattan bank they kind of remind me of the keystone cops jack said i dont find anything about this comical at all laurie said strangely enough i think were going to have to walk back inside warren said with these lab coats on theyre going to wonder why were standing out here before anyone could respond to warrens suggestion cameron came out the door accompanied by two other men one was dressed like cameron clearly a member of the security force the other was shorter with a limp right arm he too was dressed in khaki but without any of the martial embellishments the other two sported uhoh jack said i have a feeling well be forced to use the apology approach after all cameron was holding a bloodspotted handkerchief to his nose but it didnt obstruct his vision he spotted the group immediately and pointed thats them he yelled the moroccans and the soldiers responded immediately by surrounding the trespassers every gun was pointed at the group who raised their hands without being told i wonder if theyll be impressed with my medical examiner badge jack quipped dont do anything foolish laurie warned cameron and his companions walked over immediately silently the ring around the americans opened to allow them through siegfried stepped to the forefront wed like to apologize for any inconvenience jack began shut up siegfried snapped he walked around the group to eye them from all directions when he got back to where he started he asked cameron if these were the people hed encountered in the hospital no doubt in my mind cameron said while glaring directly into warrens face i hope you will indulge me sir of course siegfried said with a slight wave of dismissal without warning cameron punched warren in the side of the face with a roundhouse blow the sound was like a telephone directory falling to the floor a plaintive whine escaped from camerons lips as he grabbed his hand and gritted his teeth warren did not move a muscle he may not have blinked cameron swore under his breath and stepped away search them siegfried commanded we are sorry if we jack began but siegfried didnt let him finish he slapped him with an open fist hard enough to turn jacks head in the direction of the blow and raise a red welt on his cheek camerons deputy quickly relieved jack and the others of their passports wallets money and car keys he gave them to siegfried who slowly went through them after he looked at jacks passport he raised his eyes and glowered at him ive been told you are a troublemaker siegfried said with disdain id rather think of myself as a tenacious competitor jack said ah arrogant as well siegfried snarled i hope your tenacity comes in handy once you are turned over to the equatoguinean military perhaps we can call the american embassy and resolve this jack said we are after all government employees siegfried smiled which actually only increased his scarinduced sneer american embassy he questioned with uncamouflaged scorn in equatorial guinea what a joke unfortunately for you its out on the island of bioko he turned to cameron put them in the jail but separate the men and the women cameron snapped his fingers for his deputy he wanted the four handcuffed first while this was in progress he and siegfried drew off to the side are you really going to hand them over to the equatoguineans cameron asked absolutely siegfried said raymond told me all about stapleton they have to disappear when cameron asked as soon as taylor cabot leaves siegfried said i want this whole episode kept quiet i understand cameron said he touched the brim of his hat and then went back to supervise the transfer of the prisoners to the jail in the basement of the town hall chapter march pm isla francesca something very strange is going on kevin said but what melanie said should we get our hopes up where could all the other animals be candace questioned i dont know whether to be encouraged or concerned kevin said what if theyre having armageddon with the other group and the fighting spreads to here god almighty melanie commented i never thought of that kevin and the women had been virtual prisoners for over two days they had not been allowed to leave the small cave the entire time of their confinement and it now smelled as bad or worse than the outer cave to relieve themselves theyd been forced to go back into the tunnel which reeked like a minicesspool they themselves didnt smell much better they were filthy from wearing the same clothes and sleeping on the rock and dirt floor their hair was hopelessly matted kevins face was covered with a twoday stubble they were all weak from lack of exercise and food although each had eaten some of what was brought to them around ten oclock that morning thered been a sense that something abnormal was happening the animals had become agitated some had rushed out only to return moments later making loud cries early on bonobo number one had gone out but had yet to return that in itself was abnormal wait a second kevin said suddenly he put up his hands to keep the women from making any noise he strained to hear by turning his head slowly from side to side what is it melanie asked urgently i thought i heard a voice kevin said a human voice candace questioned kevin nodded wait i just heard it melanie said with excitement i did too candace said im sure it was a human voice it sounded like someone yelling okay arthur heard it too kevin said theyd named the bonobo who most often stood guard at the lip of the small cave arthur for no particular reason other than to have a way to refer to him over the long hours theyd had what could have been called a dialogue theyd even been able to guess at some of the meanings of the bonobo words and gestures the ones they were the most sure of included arak which meant away especially when accompanied by the spreading of fingers and a sweeping arm motion the same gesture candace had seen in the operating room there was also hana for quiet and zit for go they were very sure of food and water which were bumi and carak respectively a word they werent too sure of was sta accompanied by holding up ones hands with palms out they thought it might be the pronoun you arthur stood up and loudly vocalized to the few bonobos remaining in the cave they listened and then immediately disappeared out the front the next thing kevin and the others heard were several reports from a rifle not an ordinary gun but rather an air gun a few minutes later two figures in animalcenter coveralls appeared silhouetted against the hazy lateafternoon sky at the caves entrance one was carrying a gun the other a strong batterypowered lamp help melanie shouted she averted her eyes from the strong beam of light but waved her hands frantically lest the men not see her there was a loud thump that echoed around the inside of the cave simultaneously arthur let out a whimper with a confused expression on his flat face he looked down at a redtailed dart that protruded from his chest his hand came up to grasp it but before he could he began to wobble as if in slow motion he sagged to the floor and rolled over onto his side kevin melanie and candace emerged from their doorless cell and tried to stand upright it took a moment for them to stretch by the time they did the men were kneeling at the side of the bonobo to give the animal an additional dose of tranquilizer my god are we glad to see you melanie said she had to steady herself with a hand against the rock for a moment the cave had begun to spin the men stood up and shined the bright light on the women and then on kevin the former captives all had to shield their eyes you people are a mess the man with the light said im kevin marshall and this is melanie becket and candace brickmann i know who you are the man said flatly lets get out of this shithole kevin and the women were happy to comply on rubbery legs the two men followed once out of the cave the three friends had to squint in the bright hazy sunlight below the face of the cliff were a half dozen more animal handlers they were busy rolling up tranquilized bonobos in reed mats and lifting them onto a trailer where they were carefully positioned side by side theres one more up here in this cave the man with the flashlight yelled down to the others i know you two melanie said once she got a good view of the men whod come into the cave youre dave turner and daryl christian the men ignored melanie dave the taller of the two pulled a twoway radio out of a holder at his waist daryl started climbing down the giant steps turner to base dave said into the instrument i hear you loud and clear bertram said on the other end we got the last of the bonobos and were loading up dave said excellent work bertram said we found kevin marshall and the two women in a cave dave said in what state bertram asked filthy but otherwise apparently healthy dave said give me that thing melanie said reaching for daves radio suddenly she didnt like being talked about disparagingly by an underling dave fended her off what do you want me to do with them melanie put her hands on her hips she was incensed what do you mean what to do with them bring them to the animal center bertram said ill inform siegfried spallek im sure hell want to talk with them tenfour dave said he snapped off the radio whats the meaning of this kind of treatment melanie demanded weve been prisoners out here for more than two days dave shrugged we just follow orders maam it seems as if you two have riled up the front office big time what on earth is happening to the bonobos kevin asked when hed first seen what the men were doing hed assumed it had all been for the purpose of their rescue but the more he thought about it he couldnt understand why the animals were being loaded onto a trailer the bonobos good life on the island is a thing of the past dave said theyve been warring out here and killing each other weve found four corpses as evidence all bashed with stone wedges so were caging them at the staging area in preparation for taking them all to the animal center itll be sixfoot concrete cells from now on as far as i know kevins mouth slowly fell open in spite of his hunger exhaustion and aches and pains he felt a profound sadness for these unfortunate creatures whod not asked to be created or born their lives had suddenly and arbitrarily been doomed to monotonous incarceration their human potential was not to be realized and their striking accomplishments thus far would be lost daryl and three other men were now on their way up with a litter kevin turned to look back inside the cave in the far shadows he could see arthurs profile near the lip of the chamber where kevin and the women had been kept a tear formed in the corner of kevins eye as he imagined how arthur was going to feel when he awoke to find himself encased in steel all right you three dave said lets start back are you strong enough to walk or you want to ride on the trailer how do you move the trailer kevin asked weve got an allterrain vehicle on the island dave said ill walk thank you melanie said icily kevin and candace nodded in agreement were awfully hungry though kevin said the animals have only been offering us insects worms and marsh grass weve got some candy bars and soft drinks in a locker on the front of the trailer dave said that should be just fine kevin said the climb down the rock face was the hardest part of the trip once on the flat the walking was easy especially since the animal handlers had cleared the trail for the allterrain vehicle kevin was impressed with how much the workers had accomplished in so short a time as he emerged into the marshy field south of lago hippo he wondered if the canoe was still hidden in the reeds he guessed it probably was there was no reason it would have been found candace was elated when she saw the earthcovered timber bridge and said as much shed been worrying how they were going to get across the rio diviso you people have been busy kevin commented we had no choice dave said we had to round up these animals in the quickest time possible kevin melanie and candace began to get seriously fatigued on the last mile segment from the rio diviso bridge to the staging area it was especially apparent when they had to step off the trail for the allterrain vehicle to pass on its way back for the last trailerload of bonobos stopping and standing just for a moment made their legs feel like lead everybody breathed a sigh of relief when they emerged from the twilight of the jungle into the bustling staging area in the clearing another half dozen bluecoveralled workers were toiling under the hot sun they were quickly unloading the bonobos from a second trailer and getting them into individual steel cages before the animals revived the cages were fourfoot square steel boxes making it impossible for all but the youngest animals to stand up the only source of ventilation was through the bars in the doors the doors were secured by an angled hasp that latched around the side beyond the animals reach kevin was able to catch glimpses of terrified bonobos cowering within the cages shadows such small cages were supposed to be used only for transport but a forklift was laboriously moving them into the shade of the northfacing wall of the jungle suggesting they were staying on the island one of the workers was manning a hose from a gasolinepowered pump and spraying the cages and the animals with river water i thought you said the bonobos were going to the animal center kevin asked not today dave said for the moment there is no place to put them itll be tomorrow or the next day at the very latest there was no trouble getting over to the mainland because the telescoping bridge had been deployed it was constructed of steel and had a hollow drumlike sound as they trodded across parked alongside the bridge mechanism was daves pickup truck hop in dave said while pointing into the trucks bed just one minute melanie snapped they were her first words since leaving the cave were not riding in the back of a truck then youll walk dave said youre not riding in my cab come on melanie kevin urged it will be more pleasant back here in the open air kevin gave candace a hand dave went around and got in behind the wheel melanie resisted for another minute with her hands on her hips her legs spread apart and her lips pressed together she looked like a young girl on the verge of a temper tantrum melanie its not that far candace said she reached out her hand reluctantly melanie took it i didnt expect a heros welcome melanie complained but i didnt expect this kind of treatment after the damp oppressiveness of the cave and the moist hothouse of the jungle the breezy ride in the back of the truck was unexpectedly pleasant the bed was filled with reed mats that had been used to transport the animals and they provided adequate cushion the mats had a rather rank smell but the group guessed they did too they lay on their backs and watched patches of the lateafternoon sky appear between the branches of the overhead canopy of trees what do you think they are going to do to us candace said i dont want to go back in that jail lets hope they just fire us on the spot melanie said im ready to pack my bag and say goodbye to the zone the project and equatorial guinea ive had it i can only hope it will be that easy kevin said im also worried about the animals theyve been given life sentences theres not much we can do candace said i wonder kevin said i wonder what animalrights groups would say about this situation now dont say anything like that until we get the hell out of here melanie said that would drive everybody bananas they entered the eastern end of town passing the soccer field and tennis center on their right both were in use particularly the tennis center every court was taken an experience like this makes you feel less important than you thought you were melanie commented while glancing at the players youre hidden away for two agonizing days and everything goes on just as it did before they all pondered melanies comment as they unconsciously braced for the sharp righthand turn they knew was coming up to take them to the animal center but instead after the truck slowed it stopped kevin sat up and looked ahead he saw bertrams jeep cherokee siegfried wants you to drive directly to kevins house bertram called to dave okay dave called back the truck lurched forward as dave pulled out behind bertram kevin lay back down well thats a surprise maybe were not going to be treated that badly after all maybe we can get them to drop candace and me at our places melanie said theyre more or less on the way she looked down at herself the first thing im going to do is take a shower and change clothes only then am i going to eat kevin got his legs under him and kneeled behind the trucks cab he rapped on the rear window until he got daves attention he then relayed melanies request the response from dave was a wave of dismissal kevin repositioned himself on his back i guess you have to go to my house first he said as soon as they hit the cobblestones the ride was so jarring that they all sat up rounding the last turn kevin looked ahead expectantly he was as eager to take a shower as melanie unfortunately what he saw was not encouraging siegfried and cameron were standing out in front of his house along with four heavily armed equatoguinean soldiers one of the soldiers was an officer uhoh kevin said this doesnt look promising after all the truck came to a halt dave hopped out and came around to put down the tailgate kevin was the first to climb out on stiff legs melanie and candace followed preparing himself for the inevitable kevin walked over to where siegfried and cameron were standing he knew melanie and candace were right behind bertram whod parked in front of the pickup truck joined them no one looked particularly happy we had hoped youd taken an unannounced holiday siegfried said scornfully instead we find you have willfully disobeyed standing orders not to trespass on isla francesca youre all to be confined to quarters here in this house he pointed over his shoulder at kevins kevin was about to explain why theyd done what they had when melanie pushed past him she was exhausted and irate im not staying here and thats final she spat in fact i quit ill be leaving the zone just as soon as i can make arrangements siegfrieds upper lip hiked itself up to exaggerate his sneer after a quick step forward he backhanded melanie viciously knocking her down reflexively candace dropped to one knee to aid her friend dont touch her siegfried shouted as he drew his hand back as if to strike candace candace ignored him and helped melanie up into a sitting position melanies left eye was beginning to swell and a trickle of blood slowly ran down her cheek kevin winced and looked away expecting to hear another blow he admired candaces courage and wished that he shared some but he was terrified of siegfried and afraid to move when another blow did not materialize kevin looked back candace had melanie standing shakily on her feet youll be leaving the zone soon enough siegfried snarled at melanie but it will be in the company of the equatoguinean authorities you can try your insolence on them kevin swallowed with difficulty being given to the equatoguineans was what hed feared most im an american melanie sobbed but you are in equatorial guinea siegfried snapped and youve violated equatoguinean law siegfried stepped back ive confiscated all of your passports just so you know they will be given to the local authorities along with your persons in the meantime you are to stay here in this house and i warn you that these soldiers and this officer have been ordered to shoot if you so much as take one step outside have i made myself clear i need some clothes melanie cried ive had clothes for both of you women brought from your quarters and thrown into upstairs guest rooms siegfried said believe me we have thought of everything siegfried turned to cameron see that these people are taken care of of course sir cameron said he touched the tip of his hat before turning to kevin and the women okay youve heard the manager he barked upstairs you go and no trouble please kevin started forward but he detoured enough to go by bertram they were using more than fire they were making tools and even talking with each other kevin walked on hed not seen any reaction in bertrams face other than a slight movement of his perpetually elevated eyebrows but kevin was certain bertram had heard him as kevin wearily climbed to the second floor he saw cameron already organizing an area for the soldiers and the officer to occupy at the base of the stairs up in the front hall kevin melanie and candace eyed each other melanie was still sobbing intermittently kevin breathed out this is not good news he said they cant do this to us melanie whimpered the point is they are going to try kevin said and without our passports wed have trouble leaving the country even if we were to walk out of here melanie put her hands on either side of her face and squeezed ive got to get ahold of myself she said i feel numb again candace admitted weve gone from one form of captivity to another kevin sighed at least they didnt put us in the jail outside they heard multiple car engines start and vehicles pull away kevin went out onto the veranda and saw all the cars leaving except for camerons glancing up into the sky he noted that twilight was deepening into night a few stars were visible turning back into the house kevin went directly to the phone picking it up he heard what hed expected to hear nothing is there a dial tone melanie asked from behind him kevin replaced the receiver he shook his head im afraid not i didnt expect so melanie said lets take showers candace suggested good idea melanie said making an effort to sound positive after agreeing to meet in a half hour kevin walked back through the dining room and pushed open the kitchen door as dirty as he was he didnt want to enter the smell of roast chicken teased his nose esmeralda had leaped to her feet the moment the door opened hello esmeralda kevin said welcome mr marshall esmeralda said you didnt come out to greet us like you always do kevin said i was afraid the manager was still here esmeralda said he and the security man had come up earlier to say you were coming home and that you would not be able to leave the house thats what they told me too kevin said ive made food for you esmeralda said are you hungry very much kevin said but there are two guests i know esmeralda said the manager told me that as well can we eat in a half hour kevin asked certainly kevin nodded he was lucky to have esmeralda he turned to leave but esmeralda called out to him he hesitated holding the door ajar there are many bad things happening in the town she said not only for you and your friends but also for strangers i have a cousin who works at the hospital she told me that four americans came from new york and went into the hospital they talked with the patient who got the liver from the bonobo oh kevin questioned strangers coming from new york to talk to one of the transplant patients was a thoroughly unanticipated development they just walked in esmeralda continued they were not supposed to be there they said they were doctors security was called and the army and the guards came to take them away they are in the jail my word kevin commented while his mind veered off on a tangent new york reminded him of the surprising call hed gotten a week previously in the middle of the night from the gensys ceo taylor cabot it had been about the patient carlo franconi whod been killed in new york taylor cabot had asked if someone could figure out what had happened to carlo from an autopsy my cousin knows some of the soldiers who were there esmeralda continued they said that the americans will be given to the ministers if they are they will be killed i thought you should know kevin felt a chill descend his spine he knew such a fate was what siegfried had in mind for him melanie and candace but who were these americans had they been involved with the autopsy on carlo franconi it is all very serious esmeralda said and i am afraid for you i know you went to the forbidden island how do you know that kevin questioned with amazement in our town people talk esmeralda said when i said you were gone unexpectedly and that the manager was looking for you alphonse kimba told my husband that you had gone to the island he was sure i appreciate your concern kevin said evasively and preoccupied with his thoughts thank you for what you have told me kevin went back to his own room when he looked at himself in the mirror he was surprised how exhausted and filthy he appeared running a hand over his beginning beard he noticed something more disturbing he was beginning to look a lot like his double after a shave shower and clean clothes kevin felt revived the entire time he mused about the americans in the jail under the town hall he was very curious and would have liked nothing better than to go and talk with them kevin found the two women were equally refreshed the shower had transformed melanie into her irrepressible self and she complained bitterly about the selection of clothes shed been offered nothing goes with anything she complained they settled in the dining room and esmeralda began serving the meal melanie laughed after looking around at the surroundings you know i find it almost funny that a few hours ago we were living like neanderthals then presto were in the lap of luxury its like a time machine if only we didnt have to worry about what tomorrow will bring candace said lets at least enjoy our last supper melanie said with her typical wry humor besides the more i think about it the less likely i think it is that they can just foist us off on the equatoguineans i mean they wouldnt be able to get away with it this is almost the beginning of the third millennium the world is too small but im worried candace began excuse me kevin interrupted esmeralda told me something curious that id like to share with you kevin started by mentioning the phone call he got in the middle of the night from taylor cabot then he told the story about the arrival and subsequent incarceration of the new yorkers in the towns jail well thiss just what im talking about melanie said a couple of smart people do an autopsy in new york and they end up here in cogo and we thought we were so isolated i tell you the worlds getting smaller every day so you think these americans came here following a trail that started with franconi kevin asked his intuition was telling him the same thing but he wanted reinforcement what else could it be melanie questioned theres no question in my mind candace what do you think kevin asked i agree with melanie candace said otherwise its too much of a coincidence thank you candace melanie said while twirling her empty wineglass she looked menacingly at kevin i hate to interrupt this fascinating conversation but wheres some of that great wine of yours bucko gosh i totally forgot kevin said sorry he pushed back from the table and went into the butlers pantry that hed filled with his mostly untouched wine allocation as he was looking through the labels which held little meaning for him he was suddenly struck by how much wine he had counting the bottles in a small area and extrapolating it to allow for the entire room he realized he had more than three hundred bottles my word kevin said as a plan began to form in his head he grabbed an armload of bottles and pushed through the swinging door into the kitchen esmeralda got up from where she was sitting having her own dinner i have a favor to ask kevin said would you take these bottles of wine and a corkscrew down to the soldiers at the foot of the stairs so many she questioned yes and id like you to take even more to the soldiers in the town hall if they ask what the occasion is tell them that im going away and i wanted them to enjoy the wine not the manager a smile spread across esmeraldas face she looked at kevin i think i understand from a cupboard she got the canvas bag that she used for shopping and loaded it with wine bottles a moment later she disappeared through the butlers pantry heading for the front hall kevin made several trips back and forth from his wine collection to the kitchen table soon he had several dozen bottles lined up including a couple bottles of port whats going on melanie enquired after sticking her head into the kitchen were waiting and wheres the wine kevin handed her one of the bottles he said hed be a few minutes more and they should start eating without him melanie rolled the bottle over to look at the label oh my chÃ¢teau latour she said she flashed kevin an appreciative grin before ducking back into the dining room esmeralda returned to say that the soldiers were very pleased but i thought id take them some bread she added it will stimulate their thirst marvelous idea kevin said he filled the canvas bag with wine and tested its weight it was heavy but he thought esmeralda could handle it let me know how many soldiers are at the town hall kevin said as he handed her the bag we want to make sure there is plenty for everyone there are usually four at night esmeralda said then ten bottles should be fine kevin said at least for starters he smiled and esmeralda smiled back taking a deep breath kevin pushed through the door into the dining room he wanted to see what the women thought of his idea kevin rolled over and looked at the clock it was just before midnight so he sat up and put his feet over the side of the bed he turned off the alarm clock that had been set to go off at twelve pm sharp then he stretched during dinner kevins proposed plan had sparked a lively discussion in a cooperative effort the idea had been refined and expanded ultimately all three thought it was worth attempting after making what preparations they could they all decided to try to get a little rest but kevin had been unable to sleep despite his exhaustion he was too keyed up there was also the problem of the gradually increasing noise from the soldiers at first it had just been animated chatter but during the last half hour loud drunken singing had reverberated from below esmeralda had visited both groups of soldiers twice during the evening when she returned she reported that the expensive french wine was a big hit after her second visit she told kevin that the initial deliveries of bottles had been almost drained kevin dressed quickly in the dark then ventured out into the hall he did not want to turn on any lights luckily the moon was bright enough for him to see his way to the guest rooms he knocked first on melanies door he was startled when it was opened instantly ive been waiting melanie whispered i couldnt sleep together they went to candaces room she too was ready in the living room they picked up the small canvas bags each had prepared and walked out onto the veranda the vista was enticingly exotic it had rained several hours earlier but now the sky was filled with puffy silverblue clouds a gibbous moon was high in the sky and its light made the mistfilled town glow eerily the jungle sounds were shockingly loud in the hot moist air they had discussed this first stage in detail so there was no need for talk now at the far end of the veranda in the rear corner they secured the end of three sheets that had been tied together the other end was dropped over the side to the ground melanie had insisted on going first she climbed nimbly over the balustrade and lowered herself to the ground with inspiring ease candace was next and her cheerleading experience stood her in good stead she had no trouble making it down kevin was the one who had difficulty trying to imitate melanie he pushed off with his feet but then as he swung back toward the building he got twisted in the sheets so that he collided with the stucco scraping his knuckles damn he whispered when he finally was standing on the cobblestones he shook his hand and squeezed his fingers are you okay melanie whispered i think so kevin said the next stage of their escape was more worrisome in single file they inched along the back of the building within the shadow of the arcade each step took them closer to the central stairwell where they could hear the soldiers a cassette recorder playing african music at low volume had been added to the festivities they reached the stall where kevin kept his toyota landcruiser and slipped in along the passenger side until they reached the front according to previously made plans kevin eased around the car to the driversside door and quietly opened it at that point he was within fifteen to twenty feet from the inebriated soldiers who were on the opposite side of a reed mat suspended from the ceiling kevin released the emergency brake and put the car in neutral returning to the women he motioned to start pushing at first the heavy vehicle resisted their efforts kevin lifted his foot to push against the houses foundation that added amount of leverage made the difference the car eased out of its parking slot at the lip of the arcade the cobblestones of the street slanted downward in a gentle slope so rainwater would run away from the house as soon as the rear wheels of the vehicle passed this point the car gained momentum all at once kevin realized that no additional force was needed uhoh kevin cried as the car began to gain speed kevin ran around the side of the car and tried to get the driversside door open given the cars increasing momentum this wasnt easy the car was now halfway across the alley and beginning to curve to the right down the hill toward the waterfront finally kevin succeeded in opening the door in one swift move he dove in behind the wheel he got in position as quickly as possible then jammed on the brakes at the same time he turned the steering wheel hard to the left so as to better align the vehicle with the street fearful their efforts might have attracted the soldiers attention kevin looked their way to check the men were gathered around a small table supporting the cassette player and a half dozen empty wine bottles the soldiers were happily clapping and stomping their feet oblivious to kevins maneuverings with the car kevin breathed a sigh of relief the passengerside door opened and melanie climbed in candace got in the back dont close the door kevin whispered he was still holding his ajar kevin eased up on the brake the car did not move at first so he shifted his weight back and forth until he got the car rolling down the incline toward the waterfront kevin looked out the rear window steering the vehicle as it began gathering speed they rolled for two blocks at that point the hill began to flatten out and the car eventually came to a stop only then did kevin slip the key into the ignition and start the engine they all closed their doors they looked at each other in the half light of the cars interior they were all keyed up and their pulses were racing everyone smiled we did it melanie asserted so far so good kevin agreed kevin put the car in gear he turned right for several blocks to give his house a wide berth and headed for the motor pool youre pretty sure no one will give us trouble at the garage melanie said well theres no way to know for sure kevin said but i dont think so the motorpool people live a life of their own besides siegfried has probably kept the story of our disappearance and reappearance a secret hed have to if he were truly planning on handing us over to the equatoguinean authorities i hope you are right melanie said she sighed im half wondering if we shouldnt just try to drive out of the zone behind one of the trucks instead of bothering with four americans weve never met those people got in here somehow kevin said im counting on their having had a plan to get out running the main gate should be considered our lastditch option they pulled into the busy motorpool facility they had to squint under the glare of the mercuryvapor lights they continued until they came to the repair section kevin parked behind a bay with the cab of a semi up on the hydraulic lift several greasy mechanics were standing under it scratching their heads wait here kevin said as he alighted from the toyota he walked inside and greeted the men melanie and candace watched candace literally had her fingers crossed well at least they didnt bolt for the telephone the moment they saw him melanie said the women watched as one of the mechanics sauntered off and disappeared through a door in the rear of the facility he reappeared a moment later carrying a lengthy hunk of heavy chain he gave it to kevin who staggered under its weight as his face turned a progressively brighter shade of red kevin stumbled back toward the landcruiser sensing he was about to drop the chain melanie hopped out of the car to open the luggage area the vehicle lurched as kevin dropped the chain onto the tailgate i told them i wanted heavy chain kevin managed it didnt have to be this heavy what did you say to those men melanie asked i said that your car got stuck in some mud kevin said they didnt bat an eyelash of course they didnt offer to come and help either kevin and melanie returned inside the toyota and they started back toward town youre sure this is going to work candace asked from the rear seat no but i cant think of anything else kevin said for the rest of the trip no one spoke they all knew this was the most difficult part of the whole plan the tension mounted as they turned into the parking lot for the town hall and doused the headlights the room occupied by the army post was ablaze with light as they got closer kevin melanie and candace could hear the music this group of soldiers also had a cassette player only theirs was cranking out african music at full volume thats the kind of party i was counting on kevin said he made a wide turn and then backed toward the building he could just make out the window wells for the subterranean jail within the shadows of the groundfloor arcade he stopped the car within five feet of the building and put on the emergency brake all three gazed into the room occupied by the soldiers they couldnt see much of the room and none of the soldiers because the line of sight was on an angle through an unglazed window the windows shutter had been raised and hooked to the ceiling of the arcade a number of empty wine bottles were on the sill well its now or never kevin said can we help melanie asked no stay put kevin said kevin climbed from the car and walked in under the nearest arch to stand within the shelter of the arcade the sound of the music was deafening kevins major concern was that if someone looked out the window kevin would be seen immediately there was nothing to hide behind looking down at the window well kevin could see the barred opening beyond the bars was utter darkness there was not the faintest light within the cell getting down on his hands and knees first kevin lay on the stone floor with his head over the lip of the window well with his face close to the bars he called out over the noise of the music hello anybody in there just us tourists jack said are we invited to the party i understand you are americans kevin said like apple pie and baseball jack said kevin could suddenly hear other voices in the dark but they were unintelligible you people have to realize what a dangerous situation youve gotten yourselves into kevin said really jack said we thought this was how all visitors to cogo were treated kevin thought that whomever he was speaking with would certainly get along well with melanie im going to try to pull these bars out kevin said are you all in the same cell no we have two beautiful ladies in the cell to my left okay kevin said lets see what i can do with these bars first kevin got up and went back for the chain returning to the window well he threaded one end through the bars into the abyss hook this around one of the bars a number of times kevin said i like this jack said it reminds me of an old western movie back at the toyota kevin secured the chain to the trailer hitch when he got back to the window well he gently pulled on the chain he could see it was tied securely around the central bar looks good kevin said lets see what happens he climbed back into the vehicle and made sure it was in its lowest fourwheel drive gear looking out the back window kevin cautiously eased the car forward to take the slack out of the chain all right here we go kevin said to melanie and candace he began to press on the accelerator the heavyduty toyota engine strained but kevin couldnt hear it the hum of the motor was drowned out by the frenzied beat of a popular zairean rock group suddenly the vehicle lurched forward hastily kevin braked behind them they heard a terrible clanging over the sound of the music like someone hitting a fire escape with a curbstone kevin and the women winced they looked back at the opening into the army post to their relief no one appeared to check out the awful sound kevin jumped out of the toyota with the intention of going back to see what had happened when he almost ran into an impressively muscled black man heading right for him good job man my names warren and this is jack jack had come up alongside warren im kevin cool warren said you back these wheels up and well see what we can do with the other opening how did you get out so quickly kevin asked man you pulled out the whole friggin frame warren said kevin climbed into the car and slowly backed up he could see the two men had already detached the chain it worked melanie said congratulations i must admit it was better than i thought kevin said a moment later someone thumped on the back of the toyota when kevin looked he could see one of the men wave for him to go forward kevin used the same driving technique hed used the first episode with approximately the same amount of power there was the same sudden release and unfortunately the same clanging noise this time a soldier had appeared at the window kevin didnt move and he prayed the two men hed just met did the same the soldier proceeded to bring a wine bottle to his lips and in the process knocked several of the empties off the sill they shattered on the stone pavement then he turned and disappeared back into the room kevin got out of the vehicle in time to see two women being extracted from the second window well as soon as they were free all four rushed for the car kevin went around to detach the chain but found that warren was already in the process of doing so they all climbed into the toyota without discussion jack and warren squeezed into the jump seats in the back while laurie and natalie joined candace on the middle bench kevin put the car in gear after a final glance at the army post he drove from the parking lot he didnt switch on the lights until they were away from town hall the escape had been a heady experience for everyone triumph for kevin melanie and candace surprise and utter relief for the crew from new york the seven exchanged terse introductions then the questions started at first everyone spoke at the same time wait a second everybody jack shouted over the babble we need some order in this chaos only one person at a time well damn warren said im going first i just want to thank you guys for coming when you did ill second that laurie said having cleared the central part of town kevin pulled into the parking lot for the main supermarket there were several other cars he stopped and turned off the lights and the engine before we talk about anything else kevin said weve got to talk about getting out of this town we dont have a lot of time how did you people originally plan on leaving by the same boat we came in on jack said wheres the boat kevin asked we assume its where we left it jack said pulled up on the beach under the pier is it big enough for all of us kevin asked with room to spare jack said perfect kevin said with excitement i was hoping youd come by boat that way we can go directly to gabon he faced around quickly and restarted the engine lets just pray its not been found he drove out of the parking lot and began a circuitous route to the waterfront he wanted to stay as far from the town hall and his own house as possible we have a problem jack said we have no identification or money everything was taken from us were not much better off kevin said but we do have some money both cash and travelers checks our passports were confiscated when we were put under house arrest this afternoon we were destined for the same fats as you to be turned over to the equatoguinean authorities would that have been a problem jack asked kevin let out a little derisive laugh in the back of his mind he could see the skulls on siegfrieds desk it would have been more than a problem it would have meant a hushhush mock trial followed by a firing squad no shit warren said in this country it is a capital offense to interfere with gensys operations kevin said and the manager is the one who decides whether someone is interfering or not a firing squad jack repeated with horror im afraid so kevin said the army here is good at it theyve had a lot of practice over the years then were even more in debt to you people than we thought jack said id no idea laurie looked out the side window of the car and shuddered it was just sinking in how seriously her life was on the line and that the threat was not yet over how come you guys were in the soup warren asked its a long story melanie said so is ours laurie said i have a question kevin said did you people come here because of carlo franconi whoa jack said such clairvoyance im impressed and intrigued how did you guess what exactly is your role here in cogo me in particular kevin asked well all of you jack said kevin melanie and candace looked at each other to see who wanted to speak first we were all part of the same program candace said but i was just a minor player im an intensivecare nurse for a surgical transplant team im a reproductive technologist melanie said i provide the raw materials for kevin to work his magic and once he has i see to it that his creations are brought to fruition im a molecular biologist kevin explained with a sigh of regret someone who overstepped his bounds and committed a promethean blunder hold up jack said dont go too literary on me i know ive heard of prometheus but i cant remember who he was prometheus was a titan in greek mythology laurie said he stole fire from olympus and gave it to man i inadvertently gave fire to some animals kevin said i stumbled on the way to move chromosome parts particularly the short arm of chromosome six from one cell to another from one species to another so you took chromosome parts from humans and put them into an ape jack said into the fertilized egg of an ape kevin said a bonobo to be exact and what you were really doing jack continued was customdesigning the perfect organ transplant source for a specific individual exactly kevin said it wasnt what i had in mind in the beginning i was just a pure researcher what i ended up doing was something i was lured into because of its economic potential wow jack commented ingenious and impressive but also a little scary its more than scary kevin said its a tragedy of sorts the problem is i transferred too many human genes ive accidently created a race of protohumans you mean like neanderthals laurie asked more primitive by millions of years kevin said more like lucy but theyre intelligent enough to use fire make tools and even converse i think they are the way we were four or five million years ago where are these creatures laurie asked with alarm theyre on a nearby island kevin said where they have been living in comparative freedom unfortunately thats all about to change why is that laurie asked in her minds eye she could see these protohumans as a child shed been fascinated by cavemen kevin quickly told the story of the smoke eventually bringing him melanie and candace to the island he related how theyd been captured and then rescued he also told them about the creatures fate effacing lifelong internment in tiny concrete cells purely because they were too human thats awful laurie commented its a disaster jack said with a shake of his head what a story this world isnt ready for a new race warren said weve got enough trouble with what we have already were coming up on the waterfront kevin announced the square at the base of the pier is around the next bend then stop here jack said there was a soldier there when we arrived kevin pulled over to the side of the road and turned off the headlights he kept the engine running for the airconditioning jack and warren got out the back and ran down to the corner carefully they peeked around the bend if our boat is not there are there other boats around here laurie asked im afraid not kevin said is there another way out of town besides the main gate laurie asked thats it kevin said heaven help us laurie commented jack and warren came back quickly kevin lowered his window theres a soldier jack said hes none too attentive in fact he might even be asleep but well still have to deal with him i think it best you all stay here fine by me kevin said he was more than happy to leave such business up to others if left to him he wouldnt have had any idea what to do jack and warren returned to the corner and disappeared kevin raised his window laurie looked at natalie and shook her head im sorry about all this i suppose i should have known jack seems to have a penchant for finding trouble no need to apologize natalie said its certainly not your fault besides things are looking a lot better than they did only fifteen or twenty minutes ago jack and warren reappeared in a surprisingly short time jack was holding a handgun while warren was carrying an assault rifle they got into the back of the toyota any problem kevin asked nope jack said he was very accommodating of course warren can be very persuasive when he wants to be does the chickee hut bar have a parking area warren asked it does kevin said drive there warren said kevin backed up took a right and then the first left at the end of the block he pulled into an expansive asphalt parking lot the darkened chickee hut bar was silhouetted ahead beyond the bar was the sparkling expanse of the broad estuary its surface shimmered in the moonlight kevin drove directly up to the bar and stopped you all wait here warren said ill check on the boat he climbed out with the assault rifle and quickly disappeared around the bar he moves quickly melanie commented you have no idea jack said is that gabon on the other side of the water laurie asked it sure is melanie said how far is it jack asked about four miles straight across kevin said but we should try to get to cocobeach thats about ten miles away from there we can contact the american embassy in libreville who will certainly be able to help us how long will it take to get to cocobeach laurie asked id estimate a little more than an hour kevin said of course it depends on the speed of the boat warren reappeared and came to the car kevin lowered his window again were cool warren said the boats there no problem hooray everybody replied in unison they piled out of the car kevin melanie and candace brought their canvas bags is that your luggage laurie teased this is it candace said warren led the group into the darkened bar and around to where there were steps to the beach lets move quickly until we get behind the retaining wall warren said he motioned for the others to precede him it was dark beneath the pier and everyone had to move slowly along with the sound of the small waves lapping against the shore was the noise of large crabs scampering into their sand burrows weve got a couple of flashlights kevin said should we use them lets not take the chance jack said as he literally bumped into the boat he made sure it was reasonably stable before telling everyone to climb in and move to the stern as soon as everyone had done so jack could feel the bow become lighter leaning against the boat he began to push it out watch out for the crossbeams jack said as he jumped aboard everyone helped by reaching for the wood piles and pulling the boat silently along it took them only a few minutes to travel to the end of the pier which was blocked by the floating dock at that point they angled the boat out into moonlit open water there were only four paddles besides the men melanie insisted on paddling i want to get about a hundred yards away from the shore before i start the motor jack explained theres no sense taking any chances everyone looked back at peacefulappearing cogo whose whitewashed buildings shrouded in mist glimmered in the silver moonlight the surrounding jungle limned the town with midnight blue the walls of vegetation were like tidal waves about to break the night sounds of the jungle fell astern the only noise became the gurgle of the paddles passing through the water or their scraping along the side of the boat for a time no one spoke racing hearts slowed and breathing tended toward normal there was time to think and even look around the newcomers in particular were captivated by the arresting beauty of the nocturnal african landscape its sheer size was overwhelming everything seemed bigger in africa even the night sky for kevin it was different his relief of having escaped cogo and having helped others to do so as well only made his anguish about the fate of his chimeric bonobos that much more poignant it had been a mistake to have created them but abandoning them to a lifetime of captivity in a tiny cage compounded his guilt after a time jack picked up his oar and dropped it into the bottom of the boat time to start the engine he announced he grasped the outboard and tilted it down into the water wait a second kevin said suddenly i have a request something i have no right to ask of you people but it is important jack straightened up from bending over the gas tank whats on your mind sport he asked see that island the last one in the chain kevin said while pointing toward isla francesca thats where all the bonobos are theyre in cages at the foot of a bridge to the mainland id like nothing better than to go over there and release them what would that accomplish laurie asked a lot if i could get them to cross the bridge kevin said wouldnt your cogo friends just round them up again jack asked theyd never find them kevin said warming to his idea theyd vanish from this part of equatorial guinea and stretching for a thousand miles inland is mostly virginal rain forest it encompasses not only this country but vast regions of gabon cameroon congo and central african republic its got to be a million square miles parts of which are still literally unexplored just let them go by themselves candace asked thats exactly the point kevin said theyd have a chance and i think theyd make it theyre resourceful look at our ancestors they had to live through the pleistocene ice age that was more of a challenge than living in a rain forest laurie looked at jack i like the idea jack glanced at the island then asked which direction was cocobeach wed be going out of our way kevin admitted but its not far twenty minutes tops what if you let them out and they stay on the island warren said at least i could tell myself i tried kevin said i feel that i have to do something hey why not jack said i think i like the idea too what does everybody else say to tell you the truth id like to see one of these animals warren said lets go candace said enthusiastically okay by me natalie said i couldnt think of a better idea melanie said lets do it jack gave the engine cord a few pulls the outboard roared to life pushing over the helm jack steered toward isla francesca chapter march am coco equatorial guinea siegfried had dreamed the dream a hundred times and each time it had gotten a little worse in it he was approaching a female elephant with a young calf he didnt like doing it but a client couple demanded it it was the wife who wanted to see the baby up close siegfried had sent trackers out laterally to protect the flank while he and the couple neared the mother but the trackers to the north became terrified when a huge bull elephant appeared they ran and to compound their cowardice they failed to warn siegfried of the danger the sound of the enormous elephant charging through the underbrush was like the thunder of an oncoming train its shrieks built to a crescendo and just before impact siegfried woke up bathed in sweat panting siegfried rolled over and sat up reaching through the mosquito netting he found a glass of water and took a drink the problem with his dream was that it was too real this was the incident through which hed lost the use of his right arm and had the skin of his face flayed open siegfried sat on the edge of his bed for a few moments before he realized the shrieking hed thought was from his dream was coming from outside his window a moment later he realized the source loud west african rock music emanating from a cheap cassette player siegfried looked at the clock seeing that it was close to two am he became instantly incensed who could be so insolent to make such noise at that time in the morning sensing the noise was coming across the green in front of his house he got out of bed and stepped onto the veranda to his surprise and dismay the music was coming from kevin marshalls in fact siegfried could see who was responsible it was the soldiers guarding the house anger coursed through siegfrieds body like a bolt of electricity ducking back inside his bedroom he called cameron and ordered the security director to meet him over at kevins siegfried slammed the phone down he pulled on his clothes as he left the house he grabbed one of his old hunting carbines siegfried walked directly across the green the closer he got to kevins the louder the music became the soldiers were in a puddle of light beneath a bare light bulb sprinkled across the ground at their feet were numerous empty bottles of wine two of the soldiers were singing along with the music while playing imaginary instruments the other two appeared to have passed out by the time siegfried got to the scene camerons car had careened down the cobblestone street and screeched to a halt cameron jumped out he was still buttoning his shirt as he approached siegfried he glanced at the inebriated soldiers and was clearly appalled cameron started to apologize when siegfried cut him off forget about explanations and excuses he said get upstairs and make sure mr marshall and his two friends are tucked in for the night cameron touched the tip of hat in faint salute he disappeared up the stairs siegfried could hear him pounding on the door a moment later several lights went on in the living quarters siegfried fumed as he watched the soldiers they hadnt even noticed his presence or camerons cameron came back looking pale and shaking his head theyre not there siegfried tried to control his anger enough to think the level of incompetence with which he had to work was astounding what about his landcruiser siegfried snapped ill check cameron said he ran back literally pushing his way through the singing soldiers he returned almost instantly its gone what a surprise siegfried said sarcastically then he snapped his fingers and motioned toward camerons car siegfried got in the front seat while cameron climbed in behind the wheel call and alert your security force siegfried ordered i want kevins car found immediately and call the gate make sure it hasnt left the zone meanwhile take me to town hall cameron used his car phone as he maneuvered his vehicle around the block both numbers were stored in his phones autodialer so it was a handsfree operation stomping on the accelerator he headed north by the time they neared the town hall the official search for kevins car had been initiated it was readily determined that the vehicle had not tried to go through the gate as they turned into the parking lot both heard the music uhoh cameron said siegfried stayed silent he was trying to prepare himself for what he now suspected cameron pulled to a halt at the building his headlights picked up the debris that had resulted when the bar frames had been yanked out of the wall the pile of chain was visible this is a disaster siegfried said with a tremulous voice he stepped out of the car with the carbine although he had to hold the gun with one hand he was an accomplished marksman in quick succession he pulled off three rounds and three of the empty wine bottles on the windowsill of the army post burst into shards of glass but the music did not falter gripping the gun tightly in his good hand siegfried went over to the armypost window and looked in the cassette player was on the desk with its volume pegged at max the four soldiers were passed out either on the floor or slouched in the rickety furniture siegfried raised the gun he pulled the trigger and the cassette player flew off the desk in an instant the scene was thrust into a painful silence siegfried went back to cameron call the colonel of the garrison tell him what has happened tell him i want these men courtmartialed tell him to get a contingent of soldiers here immediately with a vehicle yes sir cameron intoned siegfried stepped beneath the arcade and looked at the bars that had been pulled from the jailcell windows they were hand forged looking at the openings he could tell why theyd come out so easily the mortar between the bricks under the stucco had turned to sand to get himself under control siegfried walked all the way around the town hall by the time he rounded the final corner headlights were coming along the road they turned into the parking lot with screeching tires the security patrol car came to a halt next to camerons car and the duty officer jumped out siegfried cursed under his breath as he approached with kevin and the women plus the americans missing the bonobo project was in serious jeopardy they had to be found mr spallek cameron said i have some information officer oleary thinks he saw kevin marshalls car ten minutes ago of course we can quickly confirm it if it is still there where siegfried asked in the lot by the chickee hut bar oleary said i noticed it on my last tour did you see any people no sir not a soul theres supposed to be a guard down there siegfried said did you see him not really sir oleary said what do you mean not really siegfried growled he was fed up with incompetence we dont make it a point to pay much attention to the soldiers oleary said siegfried looked off in the distance in a further attempt to control his anger he forced himself to notice how the moonlight reflected off the vegetation the beauty calmed him to a degree and he reluctantly admitted that he didnt pay much attention to the soldiers either rather than serving any truly utilitarian purpose they were just there one of the costs of doing business with the equatoguinean government but why would kevins car be at the chickee hut bar then it dawned on him cameron was it determined how the americans got into town siegfried asked im afraid not cameron said was a boat searched for siegfried asked cameron looked at oleary who reluctantly replied i didnt know anything about looking for a boat what about when you relieved hansen at eleven cameron asked when he briefed you did he mention hed looked for a boat not a word sir oleary said cameron swallowed he turned to siegfried ill just have to follow up on this and get back to you later in other words no one looked for a goddamn boat siegfried snapped this is a comedy around here but im not laughing i gave specific orders for a search for a boat cameron said obviously orders are not enough you lunkhead siegfried spat you are supposed to be in charge you are responsible siegfried closed his eyes and gritted his teeth hed lost both groups all he could do at this point was have the colonel call the army post in acalayong in the unlikely event the escapees might land there but siegfried was far from optimistic he knew that if the tables were turned and hed been the one fleeing hed go to gabon all of a sudden siegfrieds eyes popped open another thought occurred to him a more worrisome thought is there a guard out at isla francesca he asked no sir none was requested what about at the bridge on the mainland siegfried persisted there was until you ordered it removed cameron said then were going right now siegfried said he started for camerons car as he did so three vehicles sped down the street and turned into the parking lot they were army jeeps they swooped over to the two parked vehicles and stopped all of them were filled with soldiers bristling with guns from the front jeep stepped colonel mongomo in contrast to the slovenly soldiers he was impeccably attired in his martial finery complete with medals despite the fact that it was night he wore aviator sunglasses he saluted siegfried stiffly and said he was at his service id be very appreciative if you took care of those drunk soldiers siegfried said in a controlled fashion while pointing toward the post theres another group where officer oleary can take you and tell one of these jeeps full of soldiers to follow us we may need their firepower kevin motioned for jack to slow down jack cut back on the throttle and the heavy pirogue quickly lost momentum they had entered the narrow channel between isla francesca and the mainland it was significantly darker than out in the open water because the trees on either side formed a canopy kevin was worried about the rope for the feeding float and hed positioned himself in the bow hed explained it to jack so jack was prepared its eerie in here laurie said listen to how loud the animals are natalie said what you are hearing are mostly frogs melanie said romantically inclined frogs its coming up just ahead kevin said jack cut the engine then stood in order to tip the outboard out of the water there was a soft thud and a scraping noise as the boat passed over the rope lets paddle kevin said its only a little way farther and i wouldnt want to hit a log in the dark the dense jungle on the right fell away as they reached the staging area clearing once again they were in moonlight oh no kevin cried from the bow the bridge is not deployed damn that shouldnt be a problem melanie said i still have the key she held it up and it glinted in the low light i had a feeling it would come in handy someday oh melanie kevin gushed youre wonderful for a moment there i thought all was lost a deployable bridge that needs a key jack questioned thats mighty sophisticated for out here in the jungle theres a dock coming up on our right kevin said thats where well tie the boat up jack was in the stern he used his oar to back paddle so the bow turned toward the island a few minutes later they quietly bumped against wood planking okay everybody kevin said he took a breath he was nervous he knew he was out of character since he was about to do something hed never done before be a hero of sorts heres what i suggest you all stay in the boat at least for now i really dont know how these animals are going to react to me theyre unbelievably strong so there is a risk im willing to take it for the reasons ive already talked about but i dont want to put any of you in jeopardy is that reasonable its reasonable but i dont know if i agree jack said seems to me you are going to need some help besides with this ak its not as if we cant defend ourselves warren said no shooting kevin said please particularly not for my benefit thats why i want you all to stay here if things go badly just leave melanie stood up im almost as responsible as you for these creatures existence im helping whether you like it or not bucko kevin made an expression of exasperation no pouting melanie said she climbed out of the boat onto the dock sounds like a party jack said he stood up to follow melanies lead you sit down melanie said sternly at the moment its a private party jack sat kevin got out his flashlight and joined melanie on the dock well work very quickly he promised the first line of business was the bridge without it the plan would fail no matter what the response was from the animals kevin put in the key as he turned it on and pressed the green button he held his breath almost immediately he heard the whine of a batterydriven electric motor from the mainland side then in slow motion the telescoping bridge extended across the dark river to make contact with the cement stanchion on the island kevin climbed up on it to make sure it was solidly seated he tried to shake it but it was rigidly in place satisfied he got down and he and melanie hiked in the direction of the forest they couldnt see the cages because of the darkness of the shadows but they knew where they were do you have any plan or are we just going to let them all out en masse melanie asked as they walked across the field kevin had the flashlight on so they could see where they were stepping the only idea that came to my mind was to find my double bonobo number one kevin said unlike me hes a leader if i can make him understand maybe hell take the others kevin shrugged can you think of a better idea not at the moment melanie said the cages were all lined up in a long row the smell was rank since some of the animals had been in their tiny prisons for more than twentyfour hours as kevin and melanie walked along kevin shined the light in each enclosure the animals awoke immediately some backed against the rear wall trying to shield themselves from the glare others stood their ground obstinately their eyes flashing red how are you going to recognize him melanie asked i wish i could count on seeing my watch kevin said but the chances of that are slim i suppose its up to recognizing that awful scar he has its rather ironic that he and siegfried have almost the same scar melanie said dont even mention that mans name kevin said my gosh look the light illuminated bonobo number ones frightfully scarred face he stared back defiantly its him melanie cried bada kevin said he patted his chest as the bonobo females had done when he melanie and candace had first been brought to the cave bonobo number one tilted his head and the skin between his eye furrowed bada kevin repeated slowly the bonobo raised his hand and patted his chest then he said bada as clearly as kevin had kevin looked at melanie they were both shocked although they had tentatively conversed with arthur it had been in such a different context theyd never been entirely sure they were actually communicating this was different atah kevin said it was a word theyd heard frequently starting from the moment bonobo number one had yelled it when theyd first encountered him they thought it meant come bonobo number one didnt respond kevin repeated the word then looked at melanie i dont know what else to say neither do i melanie said lets go for it and open the door maybe hell respond then i mean it is hard for him to come when hes locked up good point jack said he stepped around melanie to reach back along the right side of the cage with trepidation kevin released the latch and opened the door kevin and melanie stepped back kevin directed the flashlight toward the ground rather than shine it in the animals face bonobo number one emerged slowly and stood up to his full height he looked to his left and then to his right before redirecting his attention at the two humans atah kevin said again while backing up melanie stayed in step bonobo number one started forward stretching as he walked like an athlete warming up kevin turned his body around so he could walk easier he repeated atah several more times the animals facial expression didnt change as he followed kevin led to the bridge and climbed up on it he again repeated atah bonobo number one hesitantly climbed onto the concrete stanchion kevin backed up until he was standing in the middle of the span the bonobo came out onto the bridge warily he glanced frequently from side to side kevin then tried something theyd not tested on arthur kevin strung bonobo words together he used sta from the episode when bonobo number one tried to give the dead monkey to candace he used zit which bonobo number one had used to get them to go to the cave and finally he used arak which they were quite sure meant away sta zit arak kevin said he opened his fingers and swept his hand away from his chest the gesture that candace had described in the operating room kevin hoped his amalgamated sentence said you go away after repeating the phrase once again kevin pointed to the northeast in the direction of the limitless rain forest bonobo number one rose up on the balls of his feet and looked over kevins shoulder at the dark wall of mainland jungle he then looked back in the direction of the cages spreading his arms he vocalized a series of sounds kevin and melanie had not heard or at least not associated with any specific activity whats he doing kevin asked at that point the animal was facing away from him i could be wrong melanie said but i think hes making reference to his people my god kevin said i think he might have understood my meaning lets let more of the animals out kevin walked forward the bonobo sensed his movement and turned to face him kevin hesitated the bridge was about ten feet wide and kevin was concerned about coming too close he remembered all too well how easy it had been for the bonobo to pick him up and throw him like a rag doll kevin stared into the animals face to try to see any emotion but he couldnt all he got was a repeat of the uncanny sensation that he was looking into an evolutionary mirror whats the matter melanie asked hes scary kevin admitted i dont know whether to pass him or not please not another mexican standoff melanie said we dont have much time okay kevin said he took a breath and inched around the animal while teetering on the edge the bonobo watched him but didnt move this is so nerve wracking kevin complained when he climbed down from the bridge do we want him to stay here melanie asked kevin scratched his head i dont know he might be a lure to get the others over here but then again maybe he should come back with us why dont we just start walking melanie said well let him decide melanie and kevin set out for the animal cages they were pleased when bonobo number one immediately climbed from the bridge and followed they walked quickly conscious that candace and the other people were waiting when they got to the cages they didnt hesitate kevin opened the door on the first cage while melanie did the second the animals emerged quickly and immediately exchanged words with bonobo number one kevin and melanie went to the next two cages within only a few minutes there was a dozen animals milling about vocalizing and stretching its working kevin said im sure of it if they were just going to run off in the forest here on the island they would have already done so i think they all know they have to leave maybe i should get candace and our new friends melanie said they should witness this and they can help speed things up good idea kevin said he looked at the long row of cages he knew there were over seventy melanie ran off into the night while kevin went to the next cage he noticed that bonobo number one stayed nearby to greet each newly freed animal by the time kevin had released a half dozen more animals the humans arrived at first they were intimidated by the creatures and didnt know how to act the animals ignored them except for warren whom they gave a wide berth warren had brought the assault rifle which kevin guessed reminded the animals of the dart gun they are so quiet laurie said its spooky theyre depressed kevin said it could be from the tranquilizer or from having been imprisoned but dont go too close they might be quiet but they are very strong what can we do to help candace asked just open the cage doors kevin said with seven people working it took only a few minutes to get all the cages open as soon as the last animal had emerged into the night kevin motioned for everyone to start toward the bridge bonobo number one whod been shadowing kevin clapped his hands loudly just as hed done when kevin and the women had first come upon him in the culdesac of the marshy field then he vocalized raucously before starting after the humans immediately the rest of the bonobos quietly followed the seven humans led the seventyone transgenic bonobos in a procession across the clearing to the bridge of their freedom arriving at the span the humans stepped aside bonobo number one stopped at the cement stanchion sta zit arak kevin repeated as he spread his fingers and swept his hand away from his chest for the final time then he pointed toward the unexplored african interior bonobo number one bowed his head momentarily before leaping up on top of the stanchion looking out over his people he vocalized for a final time before turning his back on isla francesca and crossing the bridge to the mainland the mass of the bonobos silently followed its like watching the exodus jack quipped dont be blasphemous laurie teased but as with all teasing there was an element of truth she was truly awed by the spectacle as if by magic the animals melted into the dark jungle without a sound one minute they were a restive crowd milling about the base of the bridge the next minute they were gone like water soaking into a sponge the humans didnt move or talk for a moment finally kevin broke the silence they did it and im pleased he said thank you all for helping maybe now i can come to terms with what i did in creating them he stepped up to the bridge and pressed the red button with a whine the bridge retracted the group turned away from the stanchion and began to trudge back to the pirogue that was one of the strangest pageants ive ever seen jack said halfway to the canoe melanie suddenly stopped and cried oh no look everyones eyes darted across the river in the direction she was pointing headlight beams from several vehicles could be intermittently seen through the foliage the vehicles were descending the track leading to the bridge mechanism we cant get to the boat warren blurted theyll see us we cant stay here either jack said back to the cages kevin cried they all turned and ran toward the bulwark of the jungle the moment they ducked behind the cages the headlight beams swept across the clearing as the vehicles turned to the west the vehicles stopped but the headlights stayed on and the engines kept running its a group of equatoguinean soldiers kevin said and siegfried melanie said i can recognize him anywhere and thats cameron mciverss patrol car a searchlight snapped on its highintensity light played along the row of cages then swept the bank of the river it quickly found the canoe even fifty yards away they could hear excited voices responding to the discovery of the boat this is not good jack said they know were here a sudden and sustained burst of heavy gunfire shattered the tranquility of the night what on earth are they shooting at laurie asked im afraid theyre destroying our boat jack said i suppose thats bad news for my deposit this is no time for humor laurie complained an explosion rocked the night air and a fireball briefly illuminated the soldiers that must have been the gas tank kevin said so much for our transportation a few minutes later the searchlight went out then the first vehicle made a uturn and disappeared back up the track leading to cogo does anybody have an idea whats happening jack asked my guess is siegfried and cameron are going back to town melanie said knowing were on the island they probably feel pretty confident the headlights on the second vehicle suddenly went out thrusting the entire area into darkness even the moonlight was meager since the moon had sunk low in the western sky i preferred it when we had some idea where they were and what they were doing warren said how big is this island jack asked about six miles long and two wide kevin said but theyre making a fire warren said interrupting kevin a dot of golden light illuminated part of the bridge mechanism then flared up into a campfire the ghostly figures of the soldiers could be seen moving in the periphery of the light isnt that nice jack said looks like theyre making themselves at home what are we going to do laurie questioned despairingly we dont have a lot of choice with them sitting at the base of the bridge warren said i count six of them lets hope theyre not planning on coming over here jack said they wont come until dawn kevin said theres no way theyd come over here in the dark besides theres no need they dont expect us to be going anywhere what about swimming across that channel jack said its only about thirty or forty feet wide and theres no current to speak of im not a good swimmer warren said nervously i told you that this whole area is also infested with crocodiles kevin said oh god laurie said now he tells us but listen we dont have to swim kevin said at least i dont think so the boat that melanie candace and i used to get here is most likely where we left it and its big enough for all of us fantastic jack said where is it im afraid its going to require a little hike kevin said its a little more than a mile but at least theres a freshly cleared trail sounds like a walk in the park jack said what time is it kevin asked threetwenty warren said then we only have approximately an hour and a half before daylight kevin said wed better start now what jack had facetiously labeled a walk in the park turned out to be one of the most harrowing experiences that any of them had ever had unwilling to use the flashlights for the first two to three hundred yards they had proceeded by a process that could only be termed the blind leading the blind the interior of the jungle had been entirely devoid of light it was so utterly dark it had been difficult for anyone to even know whether their eyes were open or not kevin had gone first to feel his way along the ground making frequent wrong choices that required backtracking to find the trail knowing what kind of creatures inhabited the forest kevin held his breath each time he extended his hand or his foot into the blackness behind kevin the others had aligned themselves in snakelike single file each holding on to the unseen figure ahead jack had tried to make light of the situation but after a time even his usually resourceful flippancy failed him from then on they were all victims of their own fears as the nocturnal creatures chattered chirped bellowed twittered and occasionally screamed around them when they finally deemed it safe to use the flashlights they made better progress at the same time they shuddered when they saw the number of snakes and insects that they encountered knowing that prior to the use of the flashlights they had been passing these same creatures unawares by the time they reached the marshy fields around lago hippo the eastern horizon was faintly beginning to lighten leaving the darkness of the forest they mistakenly believed the worst was behind them but it wasnt the case the hippopotami were all out of the water grazing the animals looked enormous in the predawn twilight they may not look it but they are very dangerous kevin warned more humans are killed by them than youd think the group took a circuitous route to give the hippopotami wide berth but as they neared the reeds where they hoped the small canoe was still hidden they had to pass close by two particularly large hippos the animals seemed to regard them sleepily until without warning they charged luckily they charged for the lake with a huge amount of commotion and crashing noise each multiton animal created a new wide trail through the reeds to the water for a moment everyones heart fluttered in his chest it took a few minutes for everyone to recover before pushing on the sky was now progressively brightening and they knew they had no time to lose the short hike had taken much more time than they had anticipated thank god its still here kevin said when he separated the reeds and found the small canoe even the styrofoam food chest was still in place but reaching the canoe posed another problem it was quickly decided the boat was too small and too dangerous to carry seven people after a difficult discussion it was decided that jack and warren would stay in the reeds to wait for kevin to bring the small canoe back waiting was hell not only did the sky continue to get lighter and lighter presaging imminent dawn and the possible appearance of the soldiers but there was always the worry that the motorized canoe had disappeared jack and warren nervously alternated between looking at each other and their watches while fighting off clouds of insatiable insects and on top of everything else their exhaustion was total just when they were thinking that something terrible had happened to the others kevin appeared at the edge of the reeds like a mirage and silently paddled in warren scrambled into the canoe followed by jack the power boats okay jack asked anxiously at least it was there kevin said i didnt try to start the engine they backed out of the reeds and started for the rio diviso unfortunately there were lots of hippos and even a few crocodiles forcing them to paddle twice the usual distance just to keep clear before they slipped into the foliage hiding the mouth of the junglelined river they caught a glimpse of some soldiers entering the clearing in the distance do you think they saw us jack asked from his position in the bow theres no way to know kevin said were getting out of here by the skin of our teeth jack said the waiting was as hard on the women as it had been on jack and warren when the small canoe pulled alongside there were literal tears of relief the final worry was the outboard motor jack agreed to attend to it because of his experience with similar engines as a teenager while he checked it over the others paddled the heavy canoe out of the reeds into the open water jack pumped the gas then with a little prayer pulled the cord the engine sputtered and caught it was loud in the morning stillness jack looked at laurie she smiled and gave him the thumbsup sign jack put the motor in gear gave it a full throttle and steered directly south where they could see gabon as a line of green along the horizon epilogue march pm new york city lou soldano glanced at his watch as he flashed his police badge to get him into the customs area of the international arrivals building at kennedy airport hed hit more traffic than hed expected in the midtown tunnel and hoped he was not too late to greet the returning world travelers going up to one of the skycaps he asked which carousel was air france way down the end brother the skycap said with a wave of his hand just my luck thought lou as he broke into a slow jog after a short distance he slowed and for the one millionth time vowed to stop smoking as he got closer it was easy to see which carousel he was looking for air france in block letters showed on a monitor around it the people were four deep lou made a half circuit before seeing the group even though they were facing away he could recognize lauries hair he insinuated himself between other passengers and gave lauries arm a squeeze she turned around indignantly but quickly recognized him then she gave him a hug so fierce his face turned red okay okay i give up lou managed he laughed laurie let him go so that he could give jack and warren a handshake lou gave natalie a peck on the cheek so you guys have a good trip or what lou questioned it was apparent he was all keyed up jack shrugged and looked at laurie it was okay he said noncommittally yeah it was okay laurie agreed the trouble was nothing happened really lou said im surprised you know being africa and all i havent been there but ive heard what have you heard man warren asked well theres lots of animals lou said is that it natalie asked lou shrugged embarrassingly i guess animals and the ebola virus but like i said ive never been there jack laughed and when he did so did all the others whats going on here lou said are you guys pulling my leg im afraid so laurie said we had a fabulous trip the first part was a little harrowing but we managed to survive that and once we got to gabon we had a ball did you see any animals lou asked more than you could imagine laurie said there see thats what everybody says lou remarked maybe someday ill go over there myself the luggage came and they hoisted it onto their shoulders they breezed through customs and passed through the terminal lous unmarked car was at the curb one of the few perks he explained they put the luggage in the trunk and climbed in laurie sat next to lou lou drove out of the airport and they were immediately bogged down in traffic how about you laurie asked have you been making any headway back here i was afraid you werent going to ask lou said things have been going down like you wouldnt believe it was that spoletto funeral home that was the gold mine right now everybody is lining up to pleabargain i even got an indictment on vinnie dominick thats fantastic laurie said what about that awful pig angelo facciolo hes still in the slammer lou said we have him nailed on stealing franconis body i know its not much but remember al capone was reeled in on tax evasion what about the mole in the medical examiners office laurie said solved lou said in fact thats how we have angelo nailed vinnie amendola has agreed to testify so it was vinnie laurie said with a mixture of vindication and regret no wonder hes been acting so weird jack said from the backseat there was one unexpected twist lou said there was someone else mixed up in all this who has taken us by surprise hes apparently out of the country at the moment when he comes back into the country hes going to be arrested for murder of a teenager by the name of cindy carlson over in jersey we believe franco ponti and angelo facciolo did the actual killing but it was at this guys behest his name is dr raymond lyons do either of you guys know him never heard of him jack said nor i laurie said well he had something to do with that organ transplant stuff you people were so interested in lou said but later for that right now id like to hear about the first part of your trip the harrowing part for that youll have to buy us dinner laurie said its kind of a long story glossary bonobo an anthropoid ape
