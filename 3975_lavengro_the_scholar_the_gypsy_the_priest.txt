notes upon george borrow i borrow as a splendid literary amateur there are some writers who cannot be adequately criticisedwho cannot indeed be adequately written about at all save by those to whom they are personally known i allude to those writers of genius who having only partially mastered the art of importing their own individual characteristics into literary forms end their lifework as they began it remaining to the last amateurs in literary art of this class of writers george borrow is generally taken to be the very type was he really so there are passages in lavengro which are unsurpassed in the prose literature of englandunsurpassed i mean for mere perfection of stylefor blending of strength and graphic power with limpidity and music of flow is lavengro the work of a literary amateur who yielding at will to every kind of authorial selfindulgence fails to find artistic expression for the life moving within himfails to project an individuality that his friends knew to have been unique of other writers of genius admirable criticism may be made by those who have never known them in the flesh is this because each of those others having passed from the stage of the literary amateur to that of the literary artist is able to pour the stream of his personality into the literary mould and give to the world a true image of himself it has been my chance of life to be brought into personal relations with many men of genius but i feel that there are others who could write about them more adequately than i does borrow stand alone the admirers of his writings seem generally to think he does for ever since i wrote my brief and hasty obituary notice of him in i have been urged to enlarge my reminiscences of himurged not only by philologers and gypsologists but by many others in england america and germany but i on my part have been for years urging upon the friend who introduced me to him and who knew him years agoknew him when he wasthe comparatively young literary lion of east angliadr gordon hake to do what others are urging me to do not only has the author of parables and tales more knowledge of the subject than any one else but having a greater reputation than i he can speak with more authority and having a more brilliant pen than i he can give a more vital picture than i can hope to give of our common friend if he is as he seems to be fully determined not to depict borrow in prose let me urge him to continue in verse that admirable description of him contained in one of the wellknown sonnets addressed to myself in the new day and he the walking lord of gipsy lore how often mid the deer that grazed the park or in the fields and heath and windy moor made musical with many a soaring lark have we not held brisk commune with him there while lavengro then towering by your side with rose complexion and bright silvery hair would stop amid his swift and lounging stride to tell the legends of the fading race as at the summons of his piercing glance its story peopling his brown eyes and face while you called up that pendant of romance to petulengro with his boxing glory your amazonian sinfis noble story ii is there a key to lavengro dr hake however and those others among borrows friends who are apt to smile at the way in which critics of the highest intelligence will stand baffled and bewildered before the eccentricities of lavengro and the romany rye some critics treating the work as autobiography spoilt and some as spoilt fictionforget that while it is easy to open a locked door with a key to open a locked door without a key is a very different undertaking on the subject of autobiographies and the autobiographic method i had several interesting talks with borrow i remember an especial one that took place on wimbledon common on a certain autumn morning when i was pointing out to him the spot called gypsy ring he was in a very communicative mood that day and more amenable to criticism than he generally was i had been speaking of certain bold coincidences in lavengro and the romany ryeespecially that of lavengros meeting by accident in the neighbourhood of salisbury plain the son of the very applewoman of london bridge with whom he had made friends and also of such apparently manufactured situations as that of lavengros coming upon the man whom wordsworths poetry had sent into a deep slumber in a meadow what is an autobiography he asked is it a mere record of the incidents of a mans life or is it a picture of the man himselfhis character his soul now this i think a very suggestive question of borrows with regard to himself and his own work that he sat down to write his own life in lavengro i know he had no idea then of departing from the strict line of fact indeed his letters to his friend mr john murray would alone be sufficient to establish this in spite of his calling lavengro a dream in the first volume he did almost confine himself to matters of fact but as he went on he clearly found that the ordinary tapestry into which destiny had woven the incidents of his life were not tinged with sufficient depth of colour to satisfy his sense of wonder for let it be remembered that of love as a strong passion he had almost none surely no one but lavengro could have lived in a dingle with a girl like belle berners and passed the time in trying to teach her armenian without strong passion no very deeply coloured lifetapestry can in these unadventurous days be woven the manufactured incidents of which there are so many in lavengro and the romany rye are introduced to give colour to a web of life that strong passion had left untinged but why in order to flash upon the personality of lavengro and upon lavengros attitude towards the universe unseen as well as seen a light more searching as borrow considered than any picture of actual experience could have done in other words to build up the truth of the character of lavengro borrow does not shrink from manipulating certain incidents and inventing others and when he wishes to dive very boldly into the abysmal deeps of personality he speaks and moves partly behind the mask of some fictitious character such as the man who touched for the evil chance and such as the hypochondriac who taught himself chinese to ward off despair but could not tell the time of day by looking at the clock this is not the place for me to enter more fully into this matter but i am looking forward to a fitting occasion of showing whether or not lavengro and the romany rye form a spiritual autobiography and if they do whether that autobiography does or does not surpass every other for absolute truth of spiritual representation meantime let it be remembered by those who object to borrows method that as i have just hinted at the basis of his character was a deep sense of wonder let it be remembered that he was led to study the first of the many languages he taught himselfirishbecause there was as he said something mysterious and uncommon in its use let it be remembered that it was this instinct of wonder not the impulse of the mere poseur that impelled him to make certain exaggerated statements about the characters themselves who are introduced into hisbooks iii isopel berners for instance the tall girl isopel bernersthe most vigorous sketch he has given usis perfect as she is adorable among heroines she stands quite alone there is none other that is in the least like her yet she is in many of her qualities typical of a class among the very bravest of all human beings in the british islands are or were the nomadic girls of the high road and the dingle their bravery is not only an inherited quality it is in every way fostered by their mode of life no tenderness from the men with whom they travel either as wives or as mistresses do they getnone of the chivalry which girls in most other grades of life experienceand none do they expect in all disputes between themselves and the men their associates they know that the final argument is the knockdown blow with the romany girl too this is the case to be sure but then while the romany girl as a rule owing to tribal customs receives the blow in patience the english girl is apt to return it and with vigour this condition of things gives the english roadgirl a frank independence of bearing which distinguishes her from girls of all other classes there is something of the charm of the savage about her even to her odd passion for tattoo no doubt isopel is an idealisation of the class but the class with all its drawbacks has a certain winsomeness for men of borrows temperament but unfortunately his love of the wonderful his instinct for exaggeration asserts itself even here i need give only one instance of what i mean he makes isopel berners speak of herself as being taller than lavengro now as borrow gives lavengro his own character and physique in every detail even to the silvery hair and even to the somewhat peculiar method of sparring and as he himself stood six feet two inches isopel must have been better adapted to shine as a giantess in a show than as a fighting woman capable of cowing the flaming tinman himself it is a very exceptional woman that can really stand up against a trained boxer and it is i believe or used to be an axiom among the nomads that no fighting woman ought to stand more than about five feet ten inches at the outside a handsome young woman never looks so superb as when boxing but it is under peculiar disadvantages that she spars with a man inasmuch as she has even when properly padded as assuredly every woman ought to be to guard her chest with even more care than she guards her face the truth is as borrow must have known that women in order to stand a chance against men must rely upon some special and surprising method of attacksuch for instance as that of the sudden lefthand body blow of the magnificent gypsy girl of whose exploits i told him that day at gypsy ring who when travelling in england was attached to boswells boxingbooth and was always accompanied by a favourite bantam cock ornamented with a gold ring in each wattle and trained to clap his wings and crow whenever he saw his mistress putting on the glovesthe most beautiful girl gypsy or other that ever went into east anglia this lefthand body blow of hers she delivered so unexpectedly and with such an enginelike velocity that but few boxers could stop it but with regard to isopel berners neither lavengro nor the man she thrashed when he stole one of her flaxen hairs to conjure with gives the reader the faintest idea of isopels method of attack or defence and we have to take her prowess on trust in a word borrow was content to give us the wonderful without taking that trouble to find for it a logical basis which a literary master would have taken and instances might easily be multiplied of this exaggeration of borrows which is apt to lend a sense of unreality to some of the most picturesque pages of lavengro iv borrows use of patois nor does borrow take much trouble to give organic life to a dramatic picture by the aid of patois in dialogue in every conversation between borrows gypsies and between them and lavengro the illusion is constantly being disturbed by the vocabulary of the speakers it is hard for the reader to believe that characters such as jasper petulengro his wife and sister ursula between whom so much of the dialogue is distributed should make use of the complex sentences and bookwords which borrow on occasion puts into their mouths i remember once remarking to him upon the value of patois within certain limitsnot only in imaginative but in biographic art his answer came in substance to this that if the matter of the dialogue be true to nature the entire verisimilitude of the form is a secondary consideration walter scott said he has run to death the method of patois dialogue he urged moreover that the gypsies really are extremely fond of uncommon and fine words and this no doubt is true especially in regard to the women there is nothing in which the native superiority of the illiterate romany woman over the illiterate english woman of the road is more clearly seen than in the love of long bookwords often mispronounceddisplayed by the former strong however as is the romany chis passion for fine words her sentences are rarely complex like some of the sentences borrow puts into her mouth with regard however to the charge of idealising gypsy lifea charge which has often been brought against borrowit must be remembered that the gypsies to whom he introduces us are the better kind of gryengroes horsedealers by far the most prosperous of all gypsies borrows gryengroes are not in any way more prosperous than those he knew these nomads have an instinctive knowledge of horsefleshwill tell the amount of blood in any horse by a lightning glance at his quartersand will sometimes make large sums before the fair is over yet on the whole i will not deny that borrow was as successful in giving us vital portraits of english and irish characters as of romany characters perhaps more so that hypochondriacal strain in borrows nature which dr hake alludes to perhaps prevented him from sympathising fully with the joyous romany temper but over and above this and charming as the petulengro family are they do not live as do the characters of mr groome in his delightful book in gypsy tentsa writer whose treatises on the gypsies in the encyclopædia britannica and in chambers encyclopedia are as full of the fruits of actual personal contact with the gypsies as of the learning to be derived from books v the saving grace of pugilism borrows flaming tinman is of course a brilliant success but then he though named bosville is not a pure gypsy he is what is called on the roads i believe a half and half and in nothing is more clearly seen that prepotency of transmission which i have elsewhere attributed to the anglosaxon in the racial struggle than in hybrids of this kind a thoroughbred romany chal can be brutal enough but the flaming tinmans peculiar shade of brutality is anglosaxon not romany the tinmans ironical muttering while unharnessing his horse afraid hm afraid that was the word i think is worthy of dickens at his very bestworthy of dickens when he created rogue riderhoodbut it is hardly romany i think the battle in the dingle is superb borrow is always at his strongest when describing a pugilistic encounter for in the saving grace of pugilism as an english accomplishment he believed as devoutly almost as he believed in east anglia and the bible it was this more than anything else that aroused the ire of the critics of lavengro when it first appeared one critical journal characterised the book as the work of a barbarian this was in when clio seemed set upon substituting harlequins wand for britannias trident seemed set upon crowning her with the cap and bells of folly in her maudlin moodthe marvellous and memorable year when england while every forge in europe was glowing with expectance ready to beat every ploughshare into a sworduttered her famous prophecy that from the day of the opening of the prince consorts glass show in hyde park bullets bayonets and fists were to be institutions of a benighted past very different was the prophecy of this eccentric barbarian borrow especially as regards the abolition of the british fist his prophecy was that the decay of pugilism would be followed by a flourishing time in england for the revolver and the assassins knifea prophecy which i can now recommend to those two converts to the virtues of pugilism mr justice grantham and the present editor of the daily news the former of whom in passing sentence of death at the central criminal court on wednesday january th upon a labourer named hosler for stabbing one dennis finnessey to death in a quarrel about a pot of beer borrowed in the most impudent manner from the eccentric barbarian when he said if men would only use their fists instead of knives when tempted to violence so many people would not be hanged while the latter remarked that the same thing has been said from the bench before and cannot be said too often when the eccentric barbarian argued that pugnacity is one of the primary instincts of manwhen he argued that no civilisation can ever eradicate this instinct without emasculating itselfwhen he argued that to clench ones fist and strike out is the irresistible impulse of every one who has been assaulted and that to make it illegal to strike out to make it illegal to learn the art to strike out with the best effect is not to quell the instinct but simply to force it to express itself in other and more dangerous and dastardly wayswhen he argued thus more than forty years ago he saw more clearly than did his critics into the futurea future which held within its womb not only the american civil war and the gigantic continental struggles whose bloody reek still smells to heaven but also the present carnival of dynamite the revolver and the assassins knife vi borrows gypsies to those who knew borrow the striking thing about lavengro and the romany rye is not that there is so much about the gypsies but that there is comparatively so little and that he only introduces one family group judged fromthese two books the reader would conclude that he knew nothing whatever of the lees the stanleys and the most noticeable of all the lovells and yet those who knew him are aware that he was thrown into contact with most of these but here as in everything else borrows eccentric methods can never be foreseen the most interesting of all the gypsies are the welsh gypsies the welsh variety of the romany tongue is quite peculiar and the romanies of the principality are superior to all others in these islands in intelligence and in their passion for gorgio respectability borrow in lavengro takes the reader to the welsh border itself and then turns back leaving the welsh romany undescribed and in the only part of wild wales where gypsy life is afterwards glanced at the gypsies introduced are not welsh but english the two great successes amongst borrows romany characters are undoubtedly mrs petulengros mother old mrs herne and her grandchild leonora but these are the two wicked characters of the group it is impossible to imagine anything better told than the attempt of these two to poison lavengro it is drama of the rarest kind the terrible ironical dialogue over the prostrate and semiconscious lavengro between the childmurderess and the hagmurderess who have poisoned him is like nothing else in literature this scene alone should make lavengro immortal in no other race than the romany would a child of the elflike intelligence and unconscious wickedness of leonora be possible but also it must be said that in no other race than the romany would be possible a child like her who is made the subject of my sonnet a gypsy childs christmas printed in the journal of the gypsy lore societya sonnet which renders in verse a real incident recorded by my friend before alluded to dear sinfi rose and danced along the dells drawn by the christmas chimes and soon she sate where neath the snow around the churchyard gate the ploughmen slept in bramblebanded cells the gorgios passed half fearing gipsy spells while sinfi gazing seemed to meditate she laughed for joy then wept disconsolate de poor dead gorgios cannot hear de bells within the church the clouds of gorgiobreath arose a steam of lazy praise and prayer to him who weaves the loving christmasstair oer sorrow and sin and wintry deeps of death but where stood he beside our sinfi there remembering childish tears in nazareth perhaps borrows pictures of the gypsies by omitting to depict the romany woman on her loftier her tragic side fail to demonstrate what he well knew to be the romanys great racial mark of distinction all over europe the enormous superiority of the gypsy women over the gypsy men not in intelligence merely but in all the higher human qualities while it is next to impossible to imagine a gypsy hero gypsy heroineswomen capable of the noblest thingsare far from uncommon the amazonian sinfi alluded to in dr hakes sonnet was a heroine of this noble strain and yet perhaps she was but a type of a certain kind of romany chi it was she of the bantam cock and the lefthand body blow alluded to above this same gypsy girl also illustrated another side of the variously endowed character of the romany women ignored or almost ignored by borrowtheir passion for music the daughter of an extremely welltodo gryengro or dealer in horses this gypsy girl had travelled over nearly all england and was familiar with london where in the studio of a certain romantic artist she was in great request as a facemodel but having been brought into close contact with a travelling band of hungarian gypsy musicians who visited england some years ago she developed a passion for music that showed her to be a musical genius the gypsy musicians of hungary who are darker than the tented gypsies are the most intelligent and most widelytravelled of even hungarian gypsiesindeed of all the romany race and with them sinfi soon developed into the fiddling sinfi who was famous in wales and also in east anglia and the east midlands after a while she widened her reputation in a curious way as the only performer on the old welsh stringed instrument called the crwth or cruth i told borrow her story at gypsy ring having become through the good nature of an eminent welsh antiquary the possessor of a crwth and having discovered the unique capabilities of that rarelyseen instrument she soon taught herself to play upon it with extraordinary effect fascinating her welsh patrons by the ravishing strains she could draw from it this obsolete instrument is sixstringed with two of the strings reaching beyond the keyboard and a bridge placed not at right angles to the sides of the instrument but in an oblique direction though in some respects inferior to the violin it is in other respects superior to it sinfis performances on this remarkable instrument showed her to be a musical genius of a high ordervii my first meeting with borrow but i am not leaving myself much room for personal reminiscences of borrow after allthough these are what i sat down to write dr hake in his memoirs of eighty years records thus the first meeting between borrow and myself at roehampton at the doctors own delightful house whose windows at the back looked over richmond park and in front over the wildest part of wimbledon common later on george borrow turned up while watts was there and we went through a pleasant trio in which borrow as was his wont took the first fiddle the reader must not here take metaphor for music borrow made himself very agreeable to watts recited a fairy tale in the best style to him and liked him there is however no doubt that borrow would have run away from me had i been associated in his mind with the literary calling but at that time i had written nothing at all save poems and a prose story or two of a romantic kind and even these though some of the poems have since appeared were then known only through private circulation about me there was nothing of the literary flavour no need to flee away from me as he fled from the writing fraternity he had not long before this refused to allow dr hake to introduce the late w r s ralston to him simply because the russian scholar moved in the literary world with regard to newspaper critiques of books his axiom was that whatever is praised by the press is of necessity bad and he refused to read anything that was so praised after the fairy tale mentioned by dr hake was over we went at borrows suggestion for a ramble through richmond park calling on the way at the baldfaced stag in kingston vale in order that borrow should introduce me to jerry abershaws sword which was one of the special glories of that once famous hostelry a divine summer day it was i remembera day whose heat would have been oppressive had it not been tempered every now and then by a playful silvery shower falling from an occasional wandering cloud whose slatecoloured body thinned at the edges to a fringe of lace brighter than any silver these showers however seemed as borrow remarked merely to give a rich colour to the sunshine and to make the wild flowers in the meadows on the left breathe more freely in a word it was one of those uncertain summer days whose peculiarly english charm was borrows special delight he liked rain but he liked it falling on the green umbrella enormous shaggy like a gypsytent after a summer storm he generally carried as we entered the robin hood gate we were confronted by a sudden weird yellow radiance magical and mysterious which showed clearly enough that in the sky behind us there was gleaming over the fields and over wimbledon common a rainbow of exceptional brilliance while the raindrops sparkling on the ferns seemed answering every hue in the magic arch far away borrow told us some interesting stories of romany superstitions in connection with the rainbowhow by making a trushul cross of two sticks the romany chi who pens the dukkerin can wipe the rainbow out of the sky etc whereupon hake quite as original a man as borrow and a humourist of a still rarer temper launched out into a strain of wit and whim which it is not my business here to record upon the subject of the spirit of the rainbow which a certain child went out to find borrow loved richmond park and he seemed to know every tree i found also that he was extremely learned in deer and seemed familiar with every dappled coat which washed and burnished by the showers seemed to shine in the sun like metal of course i observed him closely and i began to wonder whether i had encountered in the silveryhaired giant striding by my side with a vast umbrella under his arm a true child of the open air did a true child of the open air ever carry a gigantic green umbrella that would have satisfied sarah gamp herself i murmured to hake while borrow lingered under a tree and looking round the park said in a dreamy way old england old england viii a child of the open air under a green umbrella perhaps however i had better define what hake and i meant by this phrase and to do this i cannot do better than quote the definition of natureworship by h a the swimming rye which we had both been just discussing and which i quoted not long after this memorable walk in a literary journal with all the recent cultivation of the picturesque by means of watercolour landscape descriptive novels cooks excursions etc the real passion for nature is as rare as ever it wasperhaps rarer it is quite an affair of individual temperament it cannot be learned it cannot be lost that no writer has ever tried to explain it shows how little it is known often it has but little to do with poetry little with science the poet indeed rarely has it at its very highest the man of science as rarely i wish i could define itin human soulsin one perhaps as much as inanotherthere is always that instinct for contact which is a great factor of progress there is always an irresistible yearning to escape from isolation to get as close as may be to some other conscious thing in most individuals this yearning is simply for contact with other human souls in some few it is not there are some in every country of whom it is the blessing not the bane that owing to some exceptional power or to some exceptional infirmity they can get closer to natura benigna herself closer to her whom we now call inanimate nature than to the human mother who bore themfar closer than to father brother sister wife or friend darwin among english savants and emily brontë among english poets and sinfi lovell among english gypsies showed a good deal of the characteristics of the children of the open air but in the case of the first of these besides the strength of his family ties the pedantic inquisitiveness the methodising pedantry of the man of science in the second the sensitivity to human contact and in the third subjection to the love passiondisturbed and indeed partially stifled the native instinct with which they were undoubtedly endowed between the true children of the open air and their fellows there are barriers of idiosyncrasy barriers of convention or other barriers quite indefinable which they find most difficult to overpass and even when they succeed in overpassing them the attempt is not found to be worth the making for what the natureworshipper finds in intercourse with his fellowmen is not the unegoistic frankness of nature his first love inviting him to touch her close soul to soulbut another ego enisled like his ownsensitive shrinking like his owna soul which love him as it may is nevertheless and for all its love the central ego of the universe to itself the very alcyone round whom all other natureworshippers revolve like the rest of the human constellations but between these and nature there is no such barrier and upon nature they lavish their lovea most equal love that varies no more with her change of mood than does the love of a man for a beautiful woman whether she smiles or weeps or frowns to them a highland glen is most beautiful so is a green meadow so is a mountain gorge or a barren peak so is a south american savannah a balmy summer is beautiful but not more beautiful than a winters sleet beating about the face and stinging every nerve into delicious life to the child of the open air life has but few ills poverty cannot touch him let the stock exchange rob him of his turkish bonds and he will go and tend sheep in sacramento valley perfectly content to see a dozen faces in a year so far from being lonely he has got the sky the wind the brown grass and the sheep and as life goes on love of nature grows both as a cultus and a passion and in time nature seems to know him and love him in her turn it was the umbrella green manifold and bulging under borrows arm that made me ask dr hake as borrow walked along beneath the trees is he a genuine child of the open air and then calling to mind lavengro and the romany rye i said he went into the dingle and lived alonewent there not as an experiment in selfeducation as thoreau went and lived by walden pond he could enjoy living alone for the horrors to which he was occasionally subject did not spring from solitary living he was never disturbed by passion as was the natureworshipper who once played such selfish tricks with sinfi lovell and as emily brontë would certainly have been had she been placed in such circumstances as charlotte brontë placed shirley but the most damning thing of all said hake is that umbrella gigantic and green a painful thought that has often occurred to me passion has certainly never disturbed his natureworship said i so devoid of passion is he that to depict a tragic situation is quite beyond his powers picturesque he always is powerful never no one reading an account of the privations of lavengro during the joseph sell period finds himself able to realise from borrows description the misery of a young man tenderly reared and with all the pride of an east anglian gentleman living on bread and water in a garret with starvation staring him in the face it is not passion i said to hake that prevents borrow from enjoying the peace of the natureworshipper it is ambition his books show that he could never cleanse his stuffed bosom of the perilous stuff of ambition to become renowned judging from many a peroration in lavengro was as great an incentive to borrow to learn languages as to alexander smiths poethero it was an incentive to write poetry ambition and the green gamp said hake but look the rainbow is fading from the sky without the intervention of gypsy sorceries and see how the ferns are changing colour with the change in the light but i soon found that if borrow was not a perfect child of the open air he was something better a man of that deep sympathy with human kind which the child of the open air must needs lack ix the gypsies of norman cross knowing borrows extraordinary shyness and his great dislike of meeting strangers dr hake while borrow was trying to get as close to the deer as they would allow expressed to me his surprise at the terms of cordial friendship that sprang up between us during that walk but i was not surprised there were several reasons why borrow should at once take to mereasons that had nothing whatever to do with any inherent attractiveness of my ownby recalling what occurred i can throw a more brilliant light upon borrows character than by any kind of analytical disquisition two herons rose from the ponds and flew away to where they probably had their nests by the expression on borrows face as he stood and gazed at them i knew that like myself he had a passion for herons were there many herons around whittlesea mere before it was drained i said i should think so said he dreamily and every kind of water bird then suddenly turning round upon me with a start he said but how do you know that i knew whittlesea mere you say in lavengro that you played among the reeds of whittlesea mere when you were a child i dont mention whittlesea mere in lavengro he said no said i but you speak of a lake near the old state prison at norman cross and that was whittlesea mere then you know whittlesea mere said borrow much interested i know the place that was whittlesea mere before it was drained i said and i know the vipers around norman cross and i think i know the lane where you first met jasper petulengro he was a generation before my time indeed i never was thrown much across the petulengroes in the eastern counties but i knew some of the hernes and the lees and the lovells i then told him what i knew about romanies and vipers and also gave him marcianuss story about the moors being invulnerable to the vipers bite and about their putting the true breed of a suspected child to the test by setting it to grasp a viperas he borrow when a child grasped one of the vipers of norman cross the gypsies said borrow always believed me to be a romany but surely you are not a romany rye no i said but i am a student of folklore and besides as it has been my fortune to see every kind of life in england high and low i could not entirely neglect the romanies could i i should think not said borrow indignantly but i hope you dont know the literary class among the rest hake is my only link to that dark world i said and even you dont object to hake i am purer than he purer than you from the taint of printers ink he laughed who are you the very question i have been asking myself ever since i was a child in short frocks i said and have never yet found an answer but hake agrees with me that no wellbred soul should embarrass itself with any such troublesome query this gave a chance to hake who in such local reminiscences as these had been able to take no part the humorous mystery of mans personality had often been a subject of joke between him and me in many a ramble in the park and elsewhere at once he threw himself into a strain of whimsical philosophy which partly amused and partly vexed borrow who stood waiting to return to the subject of the gypsies and east anglia you are an englishman said borrow not only an englishman but an east englishman i said using a phrase of his own in lavengroif not a thorough east anglian an east midlander who you will admit is nearly as good nearly said borrow and when i went on to tell him that i once used to drive a genuine shales mare a descendant of that same famous norfolk trotter who could trot fabulous miles an hour to whom he with the norfolk farmers raised his hat in reverence at the norwich horse fair and when i promised to show him a portrait of this same east anglian mare with myself behind her in a dogcartan east anglian dogcartwhen i praised the stinging saltness of the sea water off yarmouth lowestoft and cromer the quality which makes it the best the most buoyant the most delightful of all sea water to swim inwhen i told him that the only english river in which you could see reflected the rainbow he loved was the glassy ouse of east anglia and the only place in england where you could see it reflected in the wet sand was the norfolk coast and when i told him a good many things showing that i was in very truth not only an englishman but an east englishman my conquest of the walking lord of gypsy lore was complete and from that moment we became friendshake meanwhile stood listening to the rooks in the distance he turned and asked borrow whether he had never noticed a similarity between the kind of muffled rattling roar made by the seawaves upon a distant pebbly beach and the sound of a large rookery in the distance it is on sand alone said borrow that the sea strikes its true musicnorfolk sand a rattle is not music the best of the seas lutes i said is made by the sands of cromer i have read over to my beloved old friend dr hake the above meagre account of that my first delightful ramble with borrow he whose memory lets nothing escape has reminded me of a score of interesting things said and done on that memorable occasion but in putting into print any record of ones intercourse with a famous man there is always an unpleasant sense of lapsing into egotism and besides the reader has very likely had enough now of talk between borrow and me x the future of borrows works he whom london once tried hard but in vain to lionise lived during some of the last years of his life in hereford square unknown to any save about a dozen friends at the head of them stood mr john murray whose virtues both as publisher and as english gentleman he was never tired of extolling afterwards he went down to east angliathat east anglia he loved so wellwent there as he told me to die but it was not till one day in that borrow achieved in the cottage by the oulton broads which his genius once made famous and where so much of his best work had been written the souls great conquest over its fleshly trammels the conquest we call death but which he believed to be life his body was laid by the side of that of his wife at brompton when i wrote his obituary notice in the athenæum no little wonder was expressed in various quarters that the walking lord of gypsy lore had been walking so lately the earth and yet his bible in spain had still a regular sale his lavengro and romany rye were still allowed by all competent critics to be among the most delightful books in the language indeed at his death borrow was what he now is and what he will continue to be long after time has played havoc with ninetenths of the writers whose names are week by week and day by day paragraphed in the papers as literary celebritiesan english classic apart from borrows undoubted genius as a writer the subjectmatter of his writings has an interest that will not wane but will go on growing the more the features of our beautiful england to use his own phrase are changed by the multitudinous effects of the railway system the more attraction will readers find in books which depict her before her beauty was marredbooks which depict her in those antediluvian days when there was such a thing as space in the islandwhen in england there was a sense of distance that sense without which there can be no romancewhen the stagecoach was in its glorywhen the only magician who could convey man and his belongings at any rate of speed beyond mans own walking rate was the horsethe beloved horse whose praises borrow loved to sing and whose ideal was reached in the mighty shaleswhen the great high roads were alive not merely with the bustle of business but with real adventure for the travellerdays and scenes which borrow better than any one else could paint a time will come i say when not only books full of descriptive genius like lavengro but even such comparatively tame descriptions of england as the gleanings in england and wales of the now forgotten east midlander samuel jackson pratt will be read with a new interest but why was borrow so entirely forgotten at the moment of his death simply because like many another man of genius and many a scholar he refused to figure in the literary arenawent on his way quietly influencing the world but mixing only with his private friends theodore watts authors preface to the first edition in the following pages i have endeavoured to describe a dream partly of study partly of adventure in which will be found copious notices of books and many descriptions of life and manners some in a very unusual form the scenes of action lie in the british islandspray be not displeased gentle reader if perchance thou hast imagined that i was about to conduct thee to distant lands and didst promise thyself much instruction and entertainment from what i might tell thee of them i do assure thee that thou hast no reason to be displeased inasmuch as there are no countries in the world less known by the british than these selfsame british islands or where more strange things are every day occurring whether in road or street house or dingle the time embraces nearly the first quarter of the present century this information again may perhaps be anything butagreeable to thee it is a long time to revert to but fret not thyself many matters which at present much occupy the public mind originated in some degree towards the latter end of that period and some of them will be treated of the principal actors in this dream or drama are as you will have gathered from the titlepage a scholar a gypsy and a priest should you imagine that these three form one permit me to assure you that you are very much mistaken should there be something of the gypsy manifest in the scholar there is certainly nothing of the priest with respect to the gypsydecidedly the most entertaining character of the threethere is certainly nothing of the scholar or the priest in him and as for the priest though there may be something in him both of scholarship and gypsyism neither the scholar nor the gypsy would feel at all flattered by being confounded with him many characters which may be called subordinate will be found and it is probable that some of these characters will afford much more interest to the reader than those styled the principal the favourites with the writer are a brave old soldier and his helpmate an ancient gentlewoman who sold apples and a strange kind of wandering man and his wife amongst the many things attempted in this book is the encouragement of charity and free and genial manners and the exposure of humbug of which there are various kinds but of which the most perfidious the most debasing and the most cruel is the humbug of the priest yet let no one think that irreligion is advocated in this book with respect to religious tenets i wish to observe that i am a member of the church of england into whose communion i was baptized and to which my forefathers belonged its being the religion in which i was baptized and of my forefathers would be a strong inducement to me to cling to it for i do not happen to be one of those choice spirits who turn from their banner when the battle bears strongly against it and go over to the enemy and who receive at first a hug and a viva and in the sequel contempt and spittle in the face but my chief reason for belonging to it is because of all churches calling themselves christian ones i believe there is none so good so well founded upon scripture or whose ministers are upon the whole so exemplary in their lives and conversation so well read in the book from which they preach or so versed in general learning so useful in their immediate neighbourhoods or so unwilling to persecute people of other denominations for matters of doctrine in the communion of this church and with the religious consolation of its ministers i wish and hope to live and die and in its and their defence will at all times be ready if required to speak though humbly and to fight though feebly against enemies whether carnal or spiritual and is there no priestcraft in the church of england there is certainly or rather there was a modicum of priestcraft in the church of england but i have generally found that those who are most vehement against the church of england are chiefly dissatisfied with her because there is only a modicum of that article in herwere she stuffed to the very cupola with it like a certain other church they would have much less to say against the church of england by the other church i mean rome its system was once prevalent in england and during the period that it prevailed there was more prolific of debasement and crime than all other causes united the people and the government at last becoming enlightened by means of the scripture spurned it from the island with disgust and horror the land instantly after its disappearance becoming a fair field in which arts sciences and all the amiable virtues flourished instead of being a pestilent marsh where swinelike ignorance wallowed and artful hypocrites like so many willsothewisp played antic gambols about around and above debased humanity but popery still wished to play her old part to regain her lost dominion to reconvert the smiling land into the pestilential morass where she could play again her old antics from the period of the reformation in england up to the present time she has kept her emissaries here individuals contemptible in intellect it is true but catlike and gliding who at her bidding have endeavoured as much as in their power has lain to damp and stifle every genial honest loyal and independent thought and to reduce minds to such a state of dotage as would enable their old popish mother to do what she pleased with them and in every country however enlightened there are always minds inclined to grovelling superstitionminds fond of eating dust and swallowing clayminds never at rest save when prostrate before some fellow in a surplice and these popish emissaries found always some weak enough to bow down before them astounded by their dreadful denunciations of eternal woe and damnation to any who should refuse to believe their romania but they played a poor gamethe law protected the servants of scripture and the priest with his beads seldom ventured to approach any but the remnant of those of the eikonolatryrepresentatives of wormeaten houses their debased dependants and a few poor crazy creatures amongst the middle classeshe played a poor game and the labour was about to prove almost entirely in vain when the english legislature in compassion or contempt or yet more probably influenced by that spirit of toleration and kindness which is so mixed up with protestantism removed almost entirely the disabilities under which popery laboured and enabled it to raise its head and to speak out almost without fear and it did raise its head and though it spoke with some little fear at first soon discarded every relic of it went about the land uttering its damnation cry gathering around itand for doing so many thanks to itthe favourers of priestcraft wholurked within the walls of the church of england frightening with the loudness of its voice the weak the timid and the ailing perpetrating whenever it had an opportunity that species of crime to which it has ever been most partial deathbed robbery for as it is cruel so is it dastardly yes it went on enlisting plundering and uttering its terrible threats tilltill it became as it always does when left to itself a fool a very fool its plunderings might have been overlooked and so might its insolence had it been common insolence but it and then the roar of indignation which arose from outraged england against the viper the frozen viper which it had permitted to warm itself upon its bosom but thanks popery you have done all that the friends of enlightenment and religious liberty could wish but if ever there were a set of foolish ones to be found under heaven surely it is the priestly rabble who came over from rome to direct the grand movementso long in its getting up but now again the damnation cry is withdrawn there is a subdued meekness in your demeanour you are now once more harmless as a

gravemirrorsalpine country emblemsslow of speechthe jewstrange gestures on an evening of july in the year at east d a beautiful little town in a certain district of east anglia i first saw the light my father was a cornish man the youngest as i have heard him say of seven brothers he sprang from a family of gentlemen or as some people would call them gentillâtres for they were not very wealthy they had a coat of arms however and lived on their own property at a place called tredinnock which being interpreted means the house on the hill which house and the neighbouring acres had been from time immemorial in their possession i mention these particulars that the reader may see at once that i am not altogether of low and plebeian origin the present age is highly aristocratic and i am convinced that the public will read my pages with more zest from being told that i am a gentillâtre by birth with cornish blood in my veins of a family who lived on their own property at a place bearing a celtic name signifying the house on the hill or more strictly the house on the hillock my father was what is generally termed a posthumous childin other words the gentillâtre who begot him never had the satisfaction of invoking the blessing of the father of all upon his head having departed this life some months before the birth of his youngest son the boy therefore never knew a fathers care he was however well tended by his mother whose favourite he was so much so indeed that his brethren the youngest of whom was considerably older than himself were rather jealous of him i never heard however that they treated him with any marked unkindness and it will be as well to observe here that i am by no means well acquainted with his early history of which indeed as i am not writing his life it is not necessary to say much shortly after his mothers death which occurred when he was eighteen he adopted the profession of arms which he followed during the remainder of his life and in which had circumstances permitted he would probably have shone amongst the best by nature he was cool and collected slow to anger though perfectly fearless patient of control of great strength and to crown all a proper man with his hands with far inferior qualifications many a man has become a fieldmarshal or general similar ones made tamerlane who was not a gentillâtre but the son of a blacksmith emperor of onethird of the world but the race is not always for the swift nor the battle for the strong indeed i ought rather to say very seldom certain it is that my father with all his high military qualifications never became emperor fieldmarshal or even general indeed he had never an opportunity of distinguishing himself save in one battle and that took place neither in flanders egypt nor on the banks of the indus or oxus but in hyde park smile not gentle reader many a battle has been fought in hyde park in which as much skill science and bravery have been displayed as ever achieved a victory in flanders or by the indus in such a combat as that to which i allude i opine that even wellington or napoleon would have been heartily glad to cry for quarter ere the lapse of five minutes and even the blacksmith tartar would perhaps have shrunk from the opponent with whom after having had a dispute with him my father engaged in single combat for one hour at the end of which time the champions shook hands and retired each having experienced quite enough of the others prowess the name of my fathers antagonist was brain what still a smile did you never hear that name before i cannot help it honour to brain who four months after the event which i have now narrated was champion of england having conquered the heroic johnson honour to brain who at the end of other four months worn out by the dreadful blows which he had received in his manly combats expired in the arms of my father who read the bible to him in his latter momentsbig ben brain you no longer smile even you have heard of big ben i have already hinted that my father never rose to any very exalted rank in his profession notwithstanding his prowess and other qualifications after serving for many years in the line he at last entered as captain in the militia regiment of the earl of at that period just raised and to which he was sent by the duke of york to instruct the young levies in military manœuvres and discipline and in this mission i believe he perfectly succeeded competent judges having assured me that the regiment in question soon came by his means to be considered as one of the most brilliant in the service and inferior to no regiment of the line in appearance or discipline as the headquarters of this corps were at d the duties of my father not unfrequently carried him to that place and it was on one of these occasions that he became acquainted with a young person of the neighbourhood for whom he formed an attachment which was returned and this young person was my mother she was descended from a family of french protestants natives of caen who were obliged to leave their native country when old louis at the instigation of the pope thought fit to revoke the edict of nantes their name was petrement and i have reason for believing that they were people of some consideration that they were noble hearts and good christiansthey gave sufficient proof in scorning to bow the knee to the tyranny of rome so they left beautiful normandy for their faiths sake and with a few louis dors in their purse a bible in the vulgar tongue and a couple of old swords which if report be true had done service in the huguenot wars they crossed the sea to the isle of civil peace and religious liberty and established themselves in east anglia and many other huguenot families bent their steps thither and devoted themselves to agriculture or the mechanical arts and in the venerable old city the capital of the province in the northern shadow of the castle of de burgh the exiles built for themselves a church where they praised god in the french tongue and to which at particular seasons of the year they were in the habit of flocking from country and from town to sing thou hast provided for us a goodly earth thou waterest her furrows thou sendest rain into the little valleys thereof thou makest it soft with the drops of rain and blessest the increase of it i have been told that in her younger days my mother was strikingly handsome this i can easily believe i never knew her in her youth for though she was very young when she married my father who was her senior by many years she had attained the middle age before i was born no children having been vouchsafed to my parents in the early stages of their union yet even at the present day now that years threescore and ten have passed over her head attended with sorrow and troubles manifold poorly chequered with scanty joys can i look on that countenance and doubt that at one time beauty decked it as with a glorious garment hail to thee my parent as thou sittest there in thy widows weeds in the dusky parlour in the house overgrown with the lustrous ivy of the sister isle the solitary house at the end of the retired court shaded by lofty poplars hail to thee dame of the oval face olive complexion and grecian forehead by thy table seated with the mighty volume of the good bishop hopkins spread out before thee there is peace in thy countenance my mother it is not worldly peace however not the deceitful peace which lulls to bewitching slumbers and from which let us pray humbly pray that every sinner may be roused in time to implore mercy not in vain thine is the peace of the righteous my mother of those to whom no sin can be imputed the score of whose misdeeds has been long since washed away by the blood of atonement which imputeth righteousness to those who trust in it it was not always thus my mother a time was when the cares pomps and vanities of this world agitated thee too much but that time is gone by another and a better has succeeded there is peace now on thy countenance the true peace peace around thee too in thy solitary dwelling sounds of peace the cheerful hum of the kettle and the purring of the immense angola which stares up at thee from its settle with its almost human eyes no more earthly cares and affections now my mother yes one why dost thou suddenly raise thy dark and still brilliant eye from the volume with a somewhat startled glance what noise is that in the distant street merely the noise of a hoof a sound common enough it draws nearer nearer and now it stops before thy gate singular and now there is a pause a long pause ha thou hearest somethinga footstep a swift but heavy footstep thou risest thou tremblest there is a hand on the pin of the outer door there is some one in the vestibule and now the door of thy apartment opens there is a reflection on the mirror behind thee a travelling hat a gray head and sunburnt face my dearest son my darling mother yes mother thou didst recognize in the distant street the hooftramp of the wanderers horse i was not the only child of my parents i had a brother some three years older than myself he was a beautiful child one of those occasionally seen in england and in england alone a rosy angelic face blue eyes and light chestnut hair it was not exactly an anglosaxon countenance in which by the by there is generally a cast of loutishness and stupidity it partook to a certain extent of the celtic character particularly in the fire and vivacity which illumined it his face was the mirror of his mind perhaps no disposition more amiable was ever found amongst the children of adam united however with no inconsiderable portion of high and dauntless spirit so great was his beauty in infancy that people especially those of the poorer classes would follow the nurse who carried him about in order to look at and bless his lovely face at the age of three months an attempt was made to snatch him from his mothers arms in the streets of london at the moment she was about to enter a coach indeed his appearance seemed to operate so powerfully upon every person who beheld him that my parents were under continual apprehension of losing him his beauty however was perhaps surpassed by the quickness of his parts he mastered his letters in a few hours and in a day or two could decipher the names of people on the doors of houses and over the shopwindows as he grew up his personal appearance became less prepossessing his quickness and cleverness however rather increased and i may say of him that with respect to everything which he took in hand he did it better and more speedily than any other person perhaps it will be asked here what became of him alas alas his was an early and a foreign grave as i have said before the race is not always for the swift nor the battle for the strong and now doubtless after the above portrait of my brother painted in the very best style of rubens the reader will conceive himself justified in expecting a fulllength one of myself as a child for as to my present appearance i suppose he will be tolerably content with that flitting glimpse in the mirror but he must excuse me i have no intention of drawing a portrait of myself in childhood indeed it would be difficult for at that time i never looked into mirrors no attempts however were ever made to steal me in my infancy and i never heard that my parents entertained the slightestapprehension of losing me by the hands of kidnappers though i remember perfectly well that people were in the habit of standing still to look at me ay more than at my brother from which premises the reader may form any conclusion with respect to my appearance which seemeth good unto him and reasonable should he being a goodnatured person and always inclined to adopt the charitable side in any doubtful point be willing to suppose that i too was eminently endowed by nature with personal graces i tell him frankly that i have no objection whatever to his entertaining that idea moreover that i heartily thank him and shall at all times be disposed under similar circumstances to exercise the same species of charity towards himself with respect to my mind and its qualities i shall be more explicit for were i to maintain much reserve on this point many things which appear in these memoirs would be highly mysterious to the reader indeed incomprehensible perhaps no two individuals were ever more unlike in mind and disposition than my brother and myself as light is opposed to darkness so was that happy brilliant cheerful child to the sad and melancholy being who sprang from the same stock as himself and was nurtured by the same milk once when travelling in an alpine country i arrived at a considerable elevation i saw in the distance far below a beautiful stream hastening to the ocean its rapid waters here sparkling in the sunshine and there tumbling merrily in cascades on its banks were vineyards and cheerful villages close to where i stood in a granite basin with steep and precipitous sides slumbered a deep dark lagoon shaded by black pines cypresses and yews it was a wild savage spot strange and singular ravens hovered above the pines filling the air with their uncouth notes pies chattered and i heard the cry of an eagle from a neighbouring peak there lay the lake the dark solitary and almost inaccessible lake gloomy shadows were upon it which strangely modified as gusts of wind agitated the surface occasionally assumed the shape of monsters so i stood on the alpine elevation and looked now on the gay distant river and now at the dark graniteencircled lake close beside me in the lone solitude and i thought of my brother and myself i am no moralizer but the gay and rapid river and the dark and silent lake were of a verity no bad emblems of us two so far from being quick and clever like my brother and able to rival the literary feat which i have recorded of him many years elapsed before i was able to understand the nature of letters or to connect them a lover of nooks and retired corners i was as a child in the habit of fleeing from society and of sitting for hours together with my head on my breast what i was thinking about it would be difficult to say at this distance of time i remember perfectly well however being ever conscious of a peculiar heaviness within me and at times of a strange sensation of fear which occasionally amounted to horror and for which i could assign no real cause whatever by nature slow of speech i took no pleasure in conversation nor in hearing the voices of my fellowcreatures when people addressed me i not unfrequently especially if they were strangers turned away my head from them and if they persisted in their notice burst into tears which singularity of behaviour by no means tended to dispose people in my favour i was as much disliked as my brother was deservedly beloved and admired my parents it is true were always kind to me and my brother who was good nature itself was continually lavishing upon me every mark of affection there was however one individual who in the days of my childhood was disposed to form a favourable opinion of me one day a jewi have quite forgotten the circumstance but i was long subsequently informed of itone day a travelling jew knocked at the door of a farmhouse in which we had taken apartments i was near at hand sitting in the bright sunshine drawing strange lines on the dust with my fingers an ape and dog were my companions the jew looked at me and asked me some questions to which though i was quite able to speak i returned no answer on the door being opened the jew after a few words probably relating to pedlary demanded who the child was sitting in the sun the maid replied that i was her mistresss youngest son a child weak here pointing to her forehead the jew looked at me again and then said pon my conscience my dear i believe that you must be troubled there yourself to tell me any such thing it is not my habit to speak to children inasmuch as i hate them because they often follow me and fling stones after me but i no sooner looked at that child than i was forced to speak to ithis not answering me shows his sense for it has never been the custom of the wise to fling away their words in indifferent talk and conversation the child is a sweet child and has all the look of one of our peoples children fool indeed did i not see his eyes sparkle just now when the monkey seized the dog by the ear they shone like my own diamondsdoes your good lady want any real and fine were it not for what you tell me i should say it was a prophets child fool indeed he can write already or ill forfeit the box which i carry on my back and for which i should be loth to take two hundred pounds he then leaned forward to inspect the lines which i had traced all of a sudden he started back and grew white as a sheet then taking off his hat he made some strange gestures to me cringing chattering and showing his teeth and shortly departed muttering something about holy letters and talking to himself in a strange tongue the words of the jew were in due course of time reported to my mother who treasured them in her heart and from that moment began to entertain brighter hopes of her youngestborn than she had ever before ventured to fosterchapter ii barracks and lodgingsa campthe vipera delicate childblackberry timemeum and tuumhythethe golgothadanemans skullsuperhuman staturestirring timesthe seaboard i have been a wanderer the greater part of my life indeed i remember only two periods and these by no means lengthy when i was strictly speaking stationary i was a soldiers son and as the means of my father were by no means sufficient to support two establishments his family invariably attended him wherever he went so that from my infancy i was accustomed to travelling and wandering and looked upon a monthly change of scene and residence as a matter of course sometimes we lived in barracks sometimes in lodgings but generally in the former always eschewing the latter from motives of economy save when the barracks were inconvenient and uncomfortable and they must have been highly so indeed to have discouraged us from entering them for though we were gentry pray bear that in mind gentle reader gentry by birth and incontestably so by my fathers bearing the commission of good old george the third we were not fine gentry but people who could put up with as much as any genteel scotch family who find it convenient to live on a third floor in london or on a sixth at edinburgh or glasgow it was not a little that could discourage us we once lived within the canvas walls of a camp at a place called pett in sussex and i believe it was at this place that occurred the first circumstance or adventure call it which you will that i can remember in connection with myself it was a strange one and i will relate it it happened that my brother and myself were playing one evening in a sandy lane in the neighbourhood of this pett camp our mother was at a slight distance all of a sudden a bright yellow and to my infantine eye beautiful and glorious object made its appearance at the top of the bank from between the thick quickset and gliding down began to move across the lane to the other side like a line of golden light uttering a cry of pleasure i sprang forward and seized it nearly by the middle a strange sensation of numbing coldness seemed to pervade my whole arm which surprised me the more as the object to the eye appeared so warm and sunlike i did not drop it however but holding it up looked at it intently as its head dangled about a foot from my hand it made no resistance i felt not even the slightest struggle but now my brother began to scream and shriek like one possessed o mother mother said he the viper my brother has a viper in his hand he then like one frantic made an effort to snatch the creature away from me the viper now hissed amain and raised its head in which were eyes like hot coals menacing not myself but my brother i dropped my captive for i saw my mother running towards me and the reptile after standing for a moment nearly erect and still hissing furiously made off and disappeared the whole scene is now before me as vividly as if it occurred yesterday the gorgeous viper my poor dear frantic brother my agitated parent and a frightened hen clucking under the bushes and yet i was not three years old it is my firm belief that certain individuals possess an inherent power or fascination over certain creatures otherwise i should be unable to account for many feats which i have witnessed and indeed borne a share in connected with the taming of brutes and reptiles i have known a savage and vicious mare whose stall it was dangerous to approach even when bearing provender welcome nevertheless with every appearance of pleasure an uncouth wiryheaded man with a frightfully seamed face and an iron hook supplying the place of his right arm one whom the animal had never seen before playfully bite his hair and cover his face with gentle and endearing kisses and i have already stated how a viper would permit without resentment one child to take it up in his hand whilst it showed its dislike to the approach of another by the fiercest hissings philosophy can explain many strange things but there are some which are a far pitch above her and this is one i should scarcely relate another circumstance which occurred about this time but for a singular effect which it produced upon my constitution up to this period i had been rather a delicate child whereas almost immediately after the occurrence to which i allude i became both hale and vigorous to the great astonishment of my parents who naturally enough expected that it would produce quite a contrary effect it happened that my brother and myself were disporting ourselves in certain fields near the good town of canterbury a female servant had attended us in order to take care that we came to no mischief she however it seems had matters of her own to attend to and allowing us to go where we listed remained in one corner of a field in earnest conversation with a redcoated dragoon now it chanced to be blackberry time and the two children wandered under the hedges peering anxiously among them in quest of that trash so grateful to urchins of their degree we did not find much of it however and were soon separated in the pursuit all at once i stood still and could scarcely believe my eyes i had come to a spot where almost covering the hedge hung clusters of what seemed fruit deliciouslytempting fruitsomething resembling grapes of various colours green red and purple dear me thought i how fortunate yet have i a right to gather it is it mine for the observance of the law of meum and tuum had early been impressed upon my mind and i entertained even at that tender age the utmost horror for theft so i stood staring at the variegated clusters in doubt as to what i should do i know not how i argued the matter in my mind the temptation however was at last too strong for me so i stretched forth my hand and ate i remember perfectly well that the taste of this strange fruit was by no means so pleasant as the appearance but the idea of eating fruit was sufficient for a child and after all the flavour was muchsuperior to that of sour apples so i ate voraciously how long i continued eating i scarcely know one thing is certain that i never left the field as i entered it being carried home in the arms of the dragoon in strong convulsions in which i continued for several hours about midnight i awoke as if from a troubled sleep and beheld my parents bending over my couch whilst the regimental surgeon with a candle in his hand stood nigh the light feebly reflected on the whitewashed walls of the barrackroom another circumstance connected with my infancy and i have done i need offer no apology for relating it as it subsequently exercised considerable influence over my pursuits we were if i remember right in the vicinity of a place called hythe in kent one sweet evening in the latter part of summer our mother took her two little boys by the hand for a wander about the fields in the course of our stroll we came to the village church an old grayheaded sexton stood in the porch who perceiving that we were strangers invited us to enter we were presently in the interior wandering about the aisles looking on the walls and inspecting the monuments of the notable dead i can scarcely state what we saw how should i i was a child not yet four years old and yet i think i remember the evening sun streaming in through a stained window upon the dingy mahogany pulpit and flinging a rich lustre upon the faded tints of an ancient banner and now once more we were outside the building where against the wall stood a loweaved penthouse into which we looked it was half filled with substances of some kind which at first looked like large gray stones the greater part were lying in layers some however were seen in confused and mouldering heaps and two or three which had perhaps rolled down from the rest lay separately on the floor skulls madam said the sexton skulls of the old danes long ago they came pirating into these parts and then there chanced a mighty shipwreck for god was angry with them and he sunk them and their skulls as they came ashore were placed here as a memorial there were many more when i was young but now they are fast disappearing some of them must have belonged to strange fellows madam only see that one why the two young gentry can scarcely lift it and indeed my brother and myself had entered the golgotha and commenced handling these grim relics of mortality one enormous skull lying in a corner had fixed our attention and we had drawn it forth spirit of eld what a skull was yon i still seem to see it the huge grim thing many of the others were large strikingly so and appeared fully to justify the old mans conclusion that their owners must have been strange fellows but compared with this mighty mass of bone they looked small and diminutive like those of pigmies it must have belonged to a giant one of those redhaired warriors of whose strength and stature such wondrous tales are told in the ancient chronicles of the north and whose gravehills when ransacked occasionally reveal secrets which fill the minds of puny moderns with astonishment and awe reader have you ever pored days and nights over the pages of snorro probably not for he wrote in a language which few of the present day understand and few would be tempted to read him tamed down by latin dragomans a brave old book is that of snorro containing the histories and adventures of old northern kings and champions who seemed to have been quite different men if we may judge from the feats which they performed from those of these days one of the best of his histories is that which describes the life of harald haardraade who after manifold adventures by land and sea now a pirate now a mercenary of the greek emperor became king of norway and eventually perished at the battle of stanford bridge whilst engaged in a gallant onslaught upon england now i have often thought that the old kemp whose mouldering skull in the golgotha at hythe my brother and myself could scarcely lift must have resembled in one respect at least this harald whom snorro describes as a great and wise ruler and a determined leader dangerous in battle of fair presence and measuring in height just five ells neither more nor less i never forgot the danemans skull like the apparition of the viper in the sandy lane it dwelt in the mind of the boy affording copious food for the exercise of imagination from that moment with the name of dane were associated strange ideas of strength daring and superhuman stature and an undefinable curiosity for all that is connected with the danish race began to pervade me and if long after when i became a student i devoted myself with peculiar zest to danish lore and the acquirement of the old norse tongue and its dialects i can only explain the matter by the early impression received at hythe from the tale of the old sexton beneath the penthouse and the sight of the danish skull and thus we went on straying from place to place at hythe today and perhaps within a week looking out from our hostelwindow upon the streets of old winchester our motions ever in accordance with the route of the regiment so habituated to change of scene that it had become almost necessary to our existence pleasant were these days of my early boyhood and a melancholy pleasure steals over me as i recall them those were stirring times of which i am speaking and there was much passing around me calculated to captivate the imagination the dreadful struggle which so long convulsed europe and in which england bore so prominent a part was then at its hottest we were at war and determination and enthusiasm shone in every face man woman and child were eager to fight the frank the hereditary but thank god never dreaded enemy of the anglosaxon race love your country and beat the french and then never mind what happens was the cry of entire england oh those were days of power gallant days bustling days worth the bravest days of chivalry at least tall battalions of native warriors were marching through the land there was the glitter of the bayonet and the gleam of the sabre the shrill squeak of the fife and loud rattling of the drum were heard in the streets of country towns and the loyal shouts of the inhabitants greeted the soldiery on their arrival or cheered them at their departure and now let us leave the upland and descend to the seaboard there is a sight for you upon the billows a dozen menofwar are gliding majestically out of port their long buntings streaming from the topgallant masts calling on the skulking frenchman to come forth from his bights and bays and what looms upon us yonder from the fogbank inthe east a gallant frigate towing behind her the long low hull of a crippled privateer which but three short days ago had left dieppe to skim the sea and whose crew of ferocious hearts are now cursing their imprudence in an english hold

when i was between six and seven years of age we were once more at d the place of my birth whither my father had been despatched on the recruiting service i have already said that it was a beautiful little townat least it was at the time of which i am speaking what it is at present i know not for thirty years and more have elapsed since i last trod its streets it will scarcely have improved for how could it be better than it then was i love to think on thee pretty quiet d thou pattern of an english country town with thy clean but narrow streets branching out from thy modest marketplace with thine oldfashioned houses with here and there a roof of venerable thatch with thy one halfaristocratic mansion where resided thy lady bountifulshe the generous and kind who loved to visit the sick leaning on her goldheaded cane whilst the sleek old footman walked at a respectful distance behind pretty quiet d with thy venerable church in which moulder the mortal remains of englands sweetest and most pious bard yes pretty d i could always love thee were it but for the sake of him who sleeps beneath the marble slab in yonder quiet chancel it was within thee that the longoppressed bosom heaved its last sigh and the crushed and gentle spirit escaped from a world in which it had known nought but sorrow sorrow do i say how faint a word to express the misery of that bruised reed misery so dark that a blind worm like myself is occasionally tempted to exclaim better had the world never been created than that one so kind so harmless and so mild should have undergone such intolerable woe but it is over now for as there is an end of joy so has affliction its termination doubtless the allwise did not afflict him without a cause who knows but within that unhappy frame lurked vicious seeds which the sunbeams of joy and prosperity might have called into life and vigour perhaps the withering blasts of misery nipped that which otherwise might have terminated in fruit noxious and lamentable but peace to the unhappy one he is gone to his rest the deathlike face is no longer occasionally seen timidly and mournfully looking for a moment through the windowpane upon thy marketplace quiet and pretty d the hind in thy neighbourhood no longer at eveningfall views and starts as he views the dark lathy figure moving beneath the hazels and alders of shadowy lanes or by the side of murmuring trout streams and no longer at early dawn does the sexton of the old church reverently doff his hat as supported by some kind friend the deathstricken creature totters along the church path to that mouldering edifice with the low roof inclosing a spring of sanatory waters built and devoted to some saintif the legend over the door be true by the daughter of an east anglian king but to return to my own history i had now attained the age of six shall i state what intellectual progress i had been making up to this period alas upon this point i have little to say calculated to afford either pleasure or edification i had increased rapidly in size and in strength the growth of the mind however had by no means corresponded with that of the body it is true i had acquired my letters and was by this time able to read imperfectly but this was all and even this poor triumph over absolute ignorance would never have been effected but for the unremitting attention of my parents who sometimes by threats sometimes by entreaties endeavoured to rouse the dormant energies of my nature and to bend my wishes to the acquisition of the rudiments of knowledge but in influencing the wish lay the difficulty let but the will of a human being be turned to any particular object and it is ten to one that sooner or later he achieves it at this time i may safely say that i harboured neither wishes nor hopes i had as yet seen no object calculated to call them forth and yet i took pleasure in many things which perhaps unfortunately were all within my sphere of enjoyment i loved to look upon the heavens and to bask in the rays of the sun or to sit beneath hedgerows and listen to the chirping of the birds indulging the while in musing and meditation as far as my very limited circle of ideas would permit but unlike my brother who was at this time at school and whose rapid progress in every branch of instruction astonished and delighted his preceptors i took no pleasure in books whose use indeed i could scarcely comprehend and bade fair to be as arrant a dunce as ever brought the blush of shame into the cheeks of anxious and affectionate parents but the time was now at hand when the ice which had hitherto bound the mind of the child with its benumbing power was to be thawed and a world of sensations and ideas awakened to which it had hitherto been an entire stranger one day a young lady an intimate acquaintance of our family and godmother to my brother drove up to the house in which we dwelt she staid some time conversing with my mother and on rising to depart she put down on the table a small packet exclaiming i have brought a little present for each of the boys the one is a history of england which i intend for my godson when he returns from school the other is and here she said something which escaped my ear as i sat at some distance moping in a corneri intend it for the youngest yonder pointing to myself she then departed and my mother going out shortly after i was left alone i remember for some time sitting motionless in my corner with my eyes bent upon the ground at last i lifted my head and looked upon the packet as it lay on the table all at once a strange sensation came over me such as i had never experienced beforea singular blending of curiosity awe and pleasure the remembrance of which even at this distance of time produces a remarkable effect upon my nervous system what strange things are the nervesi mean those more secret and mysterious ones in which i have some notion that the mind or soul call it which you will has itshabitation how they occasionally tingle and vibrate before any coming event closely connected with the future weal or woe of the human being such a feeling was now within me certainly independent of what the eye had seen or the ear had heard a book of some description had been brought for me a present by no means calculated to interest me what cared i for books i had already many into which i never looked but from compulsion friends moreover had presented me with similar things before which i had entirely disregarded and what was there in this particular book whose very title i did not know calculated to attract me more than the rest yet something within told me that my fate was connected with the book which had been last brought so after looking on the packet from my corner for a considerable time i got up and went to the table the packet was lying where it had been lefti took it up had the envelope which consisted of whitish brown paper been secured by a string or a seal i should not have opened it as i should have considered such an act almost in the light of a crime the books however had been merely folded up and i therefore considered that there could be no possible harm in inspecting them more especially as i had received no injunction to the contrary perhaps there was something unsound in this reasoning something sophistical but a child is sometimes as ready as a grownup person in finding excuses for doing that which he is inclined to do but whether the action was right or wrong and i am afraid it was not altogether right i undid the packet it contained three books two from their similarity seemed to be separate parts of one and the same work they were handsomely bound and to them i first turned my attention i opened them successively and endeavoured to make out their meaning their contents however as far as i was able to understand them were by no means interesting whoever pleases may read these books for me and keep them too into the bargain said i to myself i now took up the third book it did not resemble the others being longer and considerably thicker the binding was of dingy calfskin i opened it and as i did so another strange thrill of pleasure shot through my frame the first object on which my eyes rested was a picture it was exceedingly well executed at least the scene which it represented made a vivid impression upon me which would hardly have been the case had the artist not been faithful to nature a wild scene it wasa heavy sea and rocky shore with mountains in the background above which the moon was peering not far from the shore upon the water was a boat with two figures in it one of which stood at the bow pointing with what i knew to be a gun at a dreadful shape in the water fire was flashing from the muzzle of the gun and the monster appeared to be transfixed i almost thought i heard its cry i remained motionless gazing upon the picture scarcely daring to draw my breath lest the new and wondrous world should vanish of which i had now obtained a glimpse who are those people and what could have brought them into that strange situation i asked of myself and now the seed of curiosity which had so long lain dormant began to expand and i vowed to myself to become speedily acquainted with the whole history of the people in the boat after looking on the picture till every mark and line in it were familiar to me i turned over various leaves till i came to another engraving a new source of wondera low sandy beach on which the furious sea was breaking in mountainlike billows cloud and rack deformed the firmament which wore a dull and leadenlike hue gulls and other aquatic fowls were toppling upon the blast or skimming over the tops of the maddening wavesmercy upon him he must be drowned i exclaimed as my eyes fell upon a poor wretch who appeared to be striving to reach the shore he was upon his legs but was evidently half smothered with the brine high above his head curled a horrible billow as if to engulf him for ever he must be drowned he must be drowned i almost shrieked and dropped the book i soon snatched it up again and now my eye lighted on a third picture again a shore but what a sweet and lovely one and how i wished to be treading it there were beautiful shells lying on the smooth white sand some were empty like those i had occasionally seen on marble mantelpieces but out of others peered the heads and bodies of wondrous crayfish a wood of thick green trees skirted the beach and partly shaded it from the rays of the sun which shone hot above while blue waves slightly crested with foam were gently curling against it there was a human figure upon the beach wild and uncouth clad in the skins of animals with a huge cap on his head a hatchet at his girdle and in his hand a gun his feet and legs were bare he stood in an attitude of horror and surprise his body was bent far back and his eyes which seemed starting out of his head were fixed upon a mark on the sanda large distinct marka human footprint reader is it necessary to name the book which now stood open in my hand and whose very prints feeble expounders of its wondrous lines had produced within me emotions strange and novel scarcely for it was a book which has exerted over the minds of englishmen an influence certainly greater than any other of modern times which has been in most peoples hands and with the contents of which even those who cannot read are to a certain extent acquainted a book from which the most luxuriant and fertile of our modern prose writers have drunk inspiration a book moreover to which from the hardy deeds which it narrates and the spirit of strange and romantic enterprise which it tends to awaken england owes many of her astonishing discoveries both by sea and land and no inconsiderable part of her naval glory hail to thee spirit of de foe what does not my own poor self owe to thee england has better bards than either greece or rome yet i could spare them easier far than de foe unabashed de foe as the hunchbacked rhymer styled him the true chord had now been touched a raging curiosity with respect to the contents of the volume whose engravings had fascinated my eye burned within me and i never rested until i had fully satisfied it weeks succeeded weeks months followed months and the wondrous volume was my only study and principal source of amusement for hours together iwould sit poring over a page till i had become acquainted with the import of every line my progress slow enough at first became by degrees more rapid till at last under a shoulder of mutton sail i found myself cantering before a steady breeze over an ocean of enchantment so well pleased with my voyage that i cared not how long it might be ere it reached its termination and it was in this manner that i first took to the paths of knowledge about this time i began to be somewhat impressed with religious feelings my parents were to a certain extent religious people but though they had done their best to afford me instruction on religious points i had either paid no attention to what they endeavoured to communicate or had listened with an ear far too obtuse to derive any benefit but my mind had now become awakened from the drowsy torpor in which it had lain so long and the reasoning powers which i possessed were no longer inactive hitherto i had entertained no conception whatever of the nature and properties of god and with the most perfect indifference had heard the divine name proceeding from the mouths of people frequently alas on occasions when it ought not to be employed but i now never heard it without a tremor for i now knew that god was an awful and inscrutable being the maker of all things that we were his children and that we by our sins had justly offended him that we were in very great peril from his anger not so much in this life as in another and far stranger state of being yet to come that we had a saviour withal to whom it was necessary to look for help upon this point however i was yet very much in the dark as indeed were most of those with whom i was connected the power and terrors of god were uppermost in my thoughts they fascinated though they astounded me twice every sunday i was regularly taken to the church where from a corner of the large spacious pew lined with black leather i would fix my eyes on the dignified highchurch rector and the dignified highchurch clerk and watch the movement of their lips from which as they read their respective portions of the venerable liturgy would roll many a portentous word descriptive of the wondrous works of the most high rector thou didst divide the sea through thy power thou brakest the heads of the dragons in the waters philoh thou smotest the heads of leviathan in pieces and gavest him to be meat for the people in the wilderness rector thou broughtest out fountains and waters out of the hard rocks thou driedst up mighty waters philoh the day is thine and the night is thine thou hast prepared the light and the sun peace to your memories dignified rector and yet more dignified clerk by this time ye are probably gone to your long homes and your voices are no longer heard sounding down the aisles of the venerable church nay doubtless this has already long since been the fate of him of the sonorous amenthe one of the two who with all due respect to the rector principally engrossed my boyish admirationhe at least is scarcely now among the living living why i have heard say that he blew a fifefor he was a musical as well as a christian professora bold fife to cheer the guards and the brave marines as they marched with measured step obeying an insane command up bunkers height whilst the rifles of the sturdy yankees were sending the leaden hail sharp and thick amidst the redcoated ranks for philoh had not always been a man of peace nor an exhorter to turn the other cheek to the smiter but had even arrived at the dignity of a halberd in his countrys service before his sixfoot form required rest and the grayhaired veteran retired after a long peregrination to his native town to enjoy ease and respectability on a pension of eighteenpence a day and well did his fellowtownsmen act when to increase that ease and respectability and with a thoughtful regard for the dignity of the good church service they made him clerk and precentorthe man of the tall form and of the audible voice which sounded loud and clear as his own bunker fife well peace to thee thou fine old chap despiser of dissenters and hater of papists as became a dignified and highchurch clerk if thou art in thy grave the better for thee thou wert fitted to adorn a bygone time when loyalty was in vogue and smiling content lay like a sunbeam upon the land but thou wouldst be sadly out of place in these days of cold philosophical latitudinarian doctrine universal tolerism and halfconcealed rebellionrare times no doubt for papists and dissenters but which would assuredly have broken the heart of the loyal soldier of george the third and the dignified highchurch clerk of pretty d we passed many months at this place nothing however occurred requiring any particular notice relating to myself beyond what i have already stated and i am not writing the history of others at length my father was recalled to his regiment which at that time was stationed at a place called norman cross in lincolnshire or rather huntingdonshire at some distance from the old town of peterborough for this place he departed leaving my mother and myself to follow in a few days our journey was a singular one on the second day we reached a marshy and fenny country which owing to immense quantities of rain which had lately fallen was completely submerged at a large town we got on board a kind of passageboat crowded with people it had neither sails nor oars and those were not the days of steamvessels it was in a treckschuyt and was drawn by horses young as i was there was much connected with this journey which highly surprised me and which brought to my remembrance particular scenes described in the book which i now generally carried in my bosom the country was as i have already said submergedentirely drownedno land was visible the trees were growing bolt upright in the flood whilst farmhouses and cottages were standing insulated the horses which drew us were up to the knees in water andon coming to blind pools and greedy depths were not unfrequently swimming in which case the boys or urchins who mounted them sometimes stood sometimes knelt upon the saddle and pillions no accident however either to the quadrupeds or bipeds who appeared respectively to be quite au fait in their business and extricated themselves with the greatest ease from places in which pharaoh and all his hosts would have gone to the bottom nightfall brought us to peterborough and from thence we were not slow in reaching the place of our destinationchapter iv norman crosswide

and a strange place it was this norman cross and at the time of which i am speaking a sad cross to many a norman being what was then styled a french prison that is a receptacle for captives made in the french war it consisted if i remember right of some five or six casernes very long and immensely high each standing isolated from the rest upon a spot of ground which might average ten acres and which was fenced round with lofty palisades the whole being compassed about by a towering wall beneath which at intervals on both sides sentinels were stationed whilst outside upon the field stood commodious wooden barracks capable of containing two regiments of infantry intended to serve as guards upon the captives such was the station or prison at norman cross where some six thousand french and other foreigners followers of the grand corsican were now immured what a strange appearance had those mighty casernes with their blank blind walls without windows or grating and their slanting roofs out of which through orifices where the tiles had been removed would be protruded dozens of grim heads feasting their prisonsick eyes on the wide expanse of country unfolded from that airy height ah there was much misery in those casernes and from those roofs doubtless many a wistful look was turned in the direction of lovely france much had the poor inmates to endure and much to complain of to the disgrace of england be it saidof england in general so kind and bountiful rations of carrion meat and bread from which i have seen the very hounds occasionally turn away were unworthy entertainment even for the most ruffian enemy when helpless and a captive and such alas was the fare in those casernes and then those visits or rather ruthless inroads called in the slang of the place strawplait hunts when in pursuit of a contraband article which the prisoners in order to procure themselves a few of the necessaries and comforts of existence were in the habit of making redcoated battalions were marched into the prisons who with the bayonets point carried havoc and ruin into every poor convenience which ingenious wretchedness had been endeavouring to raise around it and then the triumphant exit with the miserable booty and worst of all the accursed bonfire on the barrack parade of the plait contraband beneath the view of the glaring eyeballs from those lofty roofs amidst the hurrahs of the troops frequently drowned in the curses poured down from above like a tempestshower or in the terrific warwhoop of vive lempereur it was midsummer when we arrived at this place and the weather which had for a long time been wet and gloomy now became bright and glorious i was subjected to but little control and passed my time pleasantly enough principally in wandering about the neighbouring country it was flat and somewhat fenny a district more of pasture than agriculture and not very thickly inhabited i soon became well acquainted with it at the distance of two miles from the station was a large lake styled in the dialect of the country a mere about whose borders tall reeds were growing in abundance this was a frequent haunt of mine but my favourite place of resort was a wild sequestered spot at a somewhat greater distance here surrounded with woods and thick groves was the seat of some ancient family deserted by the proprietor and only inhabited by a rustic servant or two a place more solitary and wild could scarcely be imagined the garden and walks were overgrown with weeds and briars and the unpruned woods were so tangled as to be almost impervious about this domain i would wander till overtaken by fatigue and then i would sit down with my back against some beech elm or stately alder tree and taking out my book would pass hours in a state of unmixed enjoyment my eyes now fixed on the wondrous pages now glancing at the sylvan scene around and sometimes i would drop the book and listen to the voice of the rooks and wild pigeons and not unfrequently to the croaking of multitudes of frogs from the neighbouring swamps and fens in going to and from this place i frequently passed a tall elderly individual dressed in rather a quaint fashion with a skin cap on his head and stout gaiters on his legs on his shoulders hung a moderate sized leathern sack he seemed fond of loitering near sunny banks and of groping amidst furze and low scrubby bramble bushes of which there were plenty in the neighbourhood of norman cross once i saw him standing in the middle of a dusty road looking intently at a large mark which seemed to have been drawn across it as if by a walkingstick he must have been a large one the old man muttered half to himself or he would not have left such a trail i wonder if he is near he seems to have moved this way he then went behind some bushes which grew on the right side of the road and appeared to be in quest of something moving behind the bushes with his head downwards and occasionally striking their roots with his foot at length he exclaimed here he is and forthwith i saw him dart amongst the bushes there was a kind of scuffling noise the rustling of branches and the crackling of dry sticks i have him said the man at last i have got him and presently he made his appearance about twenty yards down the road holding a large viper in his hand what do you think of that my boy said he as i went up to him what do you think of catching such a thing as that with the naked hand what do i think said i why that i could do as much myself you do said the man do you lord how the young people in these days are given to conceit it did not use to be so in my time when i was a child childer knew how to behave themselves but the childer of these days are full of conceit full of froth like the mouth of this viper and with his forefinger and thumb he squeezed a considerable quantity of foam from the jaws of the viper down upon the road thechilder of these days are a generation ofgod forgive me what was i about to say said the old man and opening his bag he thrust the reptile into it which appeared far from empty i passed on as i was returning towards the evening i overtook the old man who was wending in the same direction good evening to you sir said i taking off a cap which i wore on my head good evening said the old man and then looking at me hows this said he you arnt sure the child i met in the morning yes said i i am what makes you doubt it why you were then all froth and conceit said the old man and now you take off your cap to me i beg your pardon said i if i was frothy and conceited it ill becomes a child like me to be so thats true dear said the old man well as you have begged my pardon i truly forgive you thank you said i have you caught any more of those things only four or five said the old man they are getting scarce though this used to be a great neighbourhood for them and what do you do with them said i do you carry them home and play with them i sometimes play with one or two that i tame said the old man but i hunt them mostly for the fat which they contain out of which i make unguents which are good for various sore troubles especially for the rheumatism and do you get your living by hunting these creatures i demanded not altogether said the old man besides being a viperhunter i am what they call a herbalist one who knows the virtue of particular herbs i gather them at the proper season to make medicines with for the sick and do you live in the neighbourhood i demanded you seem very fond of asking questions child no i do not live in this neighbourhood in particular i travel about i have not been in this neighbourhood till lately for some years from this time the old man and myself formed an acquaintance i often accompanied him in his wanderings about the neighbourhood and on two or three occasions assisted him in catching the reptiles which he hunted he generally carried a viper with him which he had made quite tame and from which he had extracted the poisonous fangs it would dance and perform various kinds of tricks he was fond of telling me anecdotes connected with his adventures with the reptile species but said he one day sighing i must shortly give up this business i am no longer the man i was i am become timid and when a person is timid in viperhunting he had better leave off as it is quite clear his virtue is leaving him i got a fright some years ago which i am quite sure i shall never get the better of my hand has been shaky more or less ever since what frightened you said i i had better not tell you said the old man or you may be frightened too lose your virtue and be no longer good for the business i dont care said i i dont intend to follow the business i dare say i shall be an officer like my father well said the old man i once saw the king of the vipers and since then the king of the vipers said i interrupting him have the vipers a king as sure as we have said the old man as sure as we have king george to rule over us have these reptiles a king to rule over them and where did you see him said i i will tell you said the old man though i dont like talking about the matter it may be about seven years ago that i happened to be far down yonder to the west on the other side of england nearly two hundred miles from here following my business it was a very sultry day i remember and i had been out several hours catching creatures it might be about three oclock in the afternoon when i found myself on some heathy land near the sea on the ridge of a hill the side of which nearly as far down as the sea was heath but on the top there was arable ground which had been planted and from which the harvest had been gatheredoats or barley i know not whichbut i remember that the ground was covered with stubble well about three oclock as i told you before what with the heat of the day and from having walked about for hours in a lazy way i felt very tired so i determined to have a sleep and i laid myself down my head just on the ridge of the hill towards the field and my body over the side down amongst the heath my bag which was nearly filled with creatures lay at a little distance from my face the creatures were struggling in it i remember and i thought to myself how much more comfortably off i was than they i was taking my ease on the nice open hill cooled with the breezes whilst they were in the nasty close bag coiling about one another and breaking their very hearts all to no purpose and i felt quite comfortable and happy in the thought and little by little closed my eyes and fell into the sweetest snooze that ever i was in in all my life and there i lay over the hills side with my head half in the field i dont know how long all dead asleep at last it seemed to me that i heard a noise in my sleep something like a thing moving very faint however far away then it died and then it came again upon my ear as i slept and now it appeared almost as if i heard crackle crackle then it died again or i became yet more dead asleep than before i know not which but i certainly lay some time without hearing it all of a sudden i became awake and there was i on the ridge of the hill with my cheek on the ground towards the stubble with a noise in my ear like that of something moving towards me among the stubble of the field well i lay a moment or two listening to the noise and then i became frightened for i did not like the noise at all it sounded so odd so i rolled myself on my belly and looked towards the stubble mercy upon us there was a huge snake or rather a dreadful viper for it was all yellow and gold moving towards me bearing its head about a foot and a half above the ground the dry stubble crackling beneath its outrageous belly it might be about five yards off when i first saw it making straight towards me child as if it would devour me i lay quite still for i was stupified with horror whilst the creature came still nearer and now it was nearly upon me when it suddenly drew back a little and then what do you thinkit lifted its head and chest high in the air and high over my face as i looked up flickering at me with its tongue as if it would fly at my face child what i felt at that moment i can scarcely say but it was a sufficient punishment for all the sins i ever committed and there we two were i looking up at the viper and the viper looking down upon me flickering at me with its tongue it was only the kindness of god that saved me all at once there was a loud noise the report of a gun for a fowler was shooting at a covey of birds a little way off in the stubble whereupon the viper sunk its head and immediately made off over the ridge of the hill down in the direction of the sea as it passed by me howeverand it passed close by meit hesitated a moment as if it was doubtful whether it should not seize me it did not however but made off down the hill it has often struck me that he was angry with me and came upon me unawares for presuming to meddle with his people as i have always been in the habit of doingbut said i how do you know that it was the king of the vipers how do i know said the old man who else should it be there was as much difference between it and other reptiles as between king george and other people is king george then different from other people i demanded of course said the old man i have never seen him myself but i have heard people say that he is a ten times greater man than other folks indeed it stands to reason that he must be different from the rest else people would not be so eager to see him do you think child that people would be fools enough to run a matter of twenty or thirty miles to see the king provided king george havent the french a king i demanded yes said the old man or something much the same and a queer one he is not quite so big as king george they say but quite as terrible a fellow what of him suppose he should come to norman cross what should he do at norman cross child why you were talking about the vipers in your bag breaking their hearts and so on and their king coming to help them now suppose the french king should hear of his people being in trouble at norman cross and he cant come child said the old man rubbing his hands the water lies between the french dont like the water neither vipers nor frenchmen take kindly to the water child when the old man left the country which he did a few days after the conversation which i have just related he left me the reptile which he had tamed and rendered quite harmless by removing the fangs i was in the habit of feeding it with milk and frequently carried it abroad with me in my walkschapter v the tentman and womandark and swarthymanner of speakingbad moneytransfixedfaltering tone little baskethigh opinionplenty of goodkeeping guardtilted cartrubricalsjasperthe right sortthe horseman of the lanejohn newtonthe alarmgentle brothers one day it happened that being on my rambles i entered a green lane which i had never seen before at first it was rather narrow but as i advanced it became considerably wider in the middle was a driftway with deep ruts but right and left was a space carpeted with a sward of trefoil and clover there was no lack of trees chiefly ancient oaks which flinging out their arms from either side nearly formed a canopy and afforded a pleasing shelter from the rays of the sun which was burning fiercely above suddenly a group of objects attracted my attention beneath one of the largest of the trees upon the grass was a kind of low tent or booth from the top of which a thin smoke was curling beside it stood a couple of light carts whilst two or three lean horses or ponies were cropping the herbage which was growing nigh wondering to whom this odd tent could belong i advanced till i was close before it when i found that it consisted of two tilts like those of waggons placed upon the ground and fronting each other connected behind by a sail or large piece of canvas which was but partially drawn across the top upon the ground in the intervening space was a fire over which supported by a kind of iron crowbar hung a caldron my advance had been so noiseless as not to alarm the inmates who consisted of a man and woman who sat apart one on each side of the fire they were both busily employedthe man was carding plaited straw whilst the woman seemed to be rubbing something with a white powder some of which lay on a plate beside her suddenly the man looked up and perceiving me uttered a strange kind of cry and the next moment both the woman and himself were on their feet and rushing out upon me i retreated a few steps yet without turning to flee i was not however without apprehension which indeed the appearance of these two people was well calculated to inspire the woman was a stout figure seemingly between thirty and forty she wore no cap and her long hair fell on either side of her head like horsetails half way down her waist her skin was dark and swarthy like that of a toad and the expression of her countenance was particularly evil her arms were bare and her bosom was but half concealed by a slight boddice below which she wore a coarse petticoat her only other article of dress the man was somewhat younger but of a figure equally wild his frame was long and lathy but his arms were remarkably short his neck was rather bent he squinted slightly and his mouth was much awry his complexion was dark but unlike that of the woman it was more ruddy than livid there was a deep scar on his cheek something like the impression of a halfpenny the dress was quite in keeping with the figure in his hat which was slightly peaked was stuck a peacocks feather over a waistcoat of hide untanned and with the hair upon it he wore a rough jerkin of russet hue smallclothes of leather which had probably once belonged to a soldier but with which pipeclay did not seem to have come in contact for many a year protected his lower man as far as the knee his legs were cased in long stockings of blue worsted and on his shoes he wore immense oldfashioned buckles such were the two beings who now came rushing upon me the man was rather in advance brandishing a ladle in his hand so i have caught you at last said he ill teach ye you young highwayman to come skulking about my properties young as i was i remarked that his manner of speaking was different from that of any people with whom i had been in the habit of associating it was quite as strange as his appearance and yet it nothing resembled the foreign english which i had been in the habit of hearing through the palisades of the prison he could scarcely be a foreigner your properties said i i am in the kings lane why did you put them there if you did not wish them to be seen on the spy said the woman hey ill drown him in the sludge in the toadpond over the hedge so we will said the man drown him anon in the mud drown me will you said i i should like to see you whats all this about was it because i saw you with your hands full of straw plait and my mother there yes said the woman what was i about myself how should i know making bad money perhaps and it will be as well here to observe that at this time there was much bad money in circulation in the neighbourhood generally supposed to be fabricated by the prisoners so that this false coin and straw plait formed the standard subjects of conversation at norman cross ill strangle thee said the beldame dashing at me bad money is itleave him to me wifelkin said the man interposing you shall now see how ill baste him down the lane myself i tell you what my chap you had better put down that thing of yours my father lies concealed within my tepid breast and if to me you offer any harm or wrong ill call him forth to

villain that if he comes near my fire ill serve him out as i will you take thattiny jesus what have we got here oh delicate jesus what is the matter with the child i had made a motion which the viper understood and now partly disengaging itself from my bosom where it had lain perdu it raised its head to a level with my face and stared upon my enemy with its glittering eyes the man stood like one transfixed and the ladle with which he had aimed a blow at me now hung in the air like the hand which held it his mouth was extended and his cheeks became of a pale yellow save alone that place which bore the mark which i have already described and this shone now portentously like fire he stood in this manner for some time at last the ladle fell from his hand and its falling appeared to rouse him from his stupor i say wifelkin said he in a faltering tone did you ever see the like of this here but the woman had retreated to the tent from the entrance of which her loathly face was now thrust with an expression partly of terror and partly of curiosity after gazing some time longer at the viper and myself the man stooped down and took up the ladle then as if somewhat more assured he moved to the tent where he entered into conversation with the beldame in a low voice of their discourse though i could hear the greater part of it i understood not a single word and i wondered what it could be for i knew by the sound that it was not french at last the man in a somewhat louder tone appeared to put a question to the woman who nodded her head affirmatively and in a moment or two produced a small stool which she delivered to him he placed it on the ground close by the door of the tent first rubbing it with his sleeve as if for the purpose of polishing its surface man now my precious little gentleman do sit down here by the poor peoples tent we wish to be civil in our slight way dont be angry and say no but look kindly upon us and satisfied my precious little god almighty woman yes my georgeous angel sit down by the poor bodies fire and eat a sweatmeat we want to ask you a question or two only first put that serpent away myself i can sit down and bid the serpent go to sleep thats easy enough but as for eating a sweetmeat how can i do that i have not got one and where am i to get it woman never fear my tiny tawny we can give you one such as you never ate i dare say however far you may have come from the serpent sunk into his usual restingplace and i sat down on the stool the woman opened a box and took out a strange little basket or hamper not much larger than a mans fist and formed of a delicate kind of matting it was sewed at the top but ripping it open with a knife she held it to me and i saw to my surprise that it contained candied fruits of a dark green hue tempting enough to one of my age there my tiny said she taste and tell me how you like them very much said i where did you get them the beldame leered upon me for a moment then nodding her head thrice with a knowing look said who knows better than yourself my tawny now i knew nothing about the matter but i saw that these strange people had conceived a very high opinion of the abilities of their visitor which i was nothing loath to encourage i therefore answered boldly ah who indeed certainly said the man who should know better than yourself or so well and now my tiny one let me ask you one thingyou didnt come to do us any harm no said i i had no dislike to you though if you were to meddle with me man of course my gorgeous of course you would and quite right too meddle with youwhat

of these things i should have no objection but what would my father say i think he would hardly let me man why not he would be with you and kindly would we treat him indeed without your father you

what the snake why no did you think he was man to be sure we did didnt you tell me so myself why yes but who would have thought you would have believed it it is a tame one i hunt vipers and tame them man oh oh grunted the woman thats it is it the man and woman who during this conversation had resumed their former positions within the tent looked at each other with a queer look of surprise as if somewhat disconcerted at what they now heard they then entered into discourse with each other in the same strange tongue which had already puzzled me at length the man looked me in the face and said somewhat hesitatingly so you are not one of them there after all myself one of them there i dont know what you mean man why we have been thinking you were a goblina devilkin however i see how it is you are a sapengro a chap who catches snakes and plays tricks with them well it comes very nearly to the same thing and if you please to list with us and bear us pleasant company we shall be glad of

and morningto wifelkin here and all our family theres plenty of us when we are all together as i said before you seem fly i shouldnt wonder if you could read oh yes said i i can read and eager to display my accomplishments i took my book out of my pocket and opening it at random proceeded to read how a certain man whilst wandering about a certain solitary island entered a cave the mouth of which was overgrown with brushwood and how he was nearly frightened to death in that cave by something which he saw that will do said the man thats the kind of prayers for me and my family arnt they wifelkin i never heard more delicate prayers in all my life why they beat the rubricals hollowand here comes my son jasper i say jasper heres a young sapengro that can read and is more fly than yourself shake hands with him i wish ye to be two brotherswith a swift but stealthy pace jasper came towards us from the farther part of the lane on reaching the tent he stood still and looked fixedly upon me as i sat upon the stool i looked fixedly upon him a queer look had jasper he was a lad of some twelve or thirteen years with long arms unlike the singular being who called himself his father his complexion was ruddy but his face was seamed though it did not bear the peculiar scar which disfigured the countenance of the other nor though roguish enough a certain evil expression which that of the other bore and which the face of the woman possessed in a yet more remarkable degree for the rest he wore drab breeches with certain strings at the knee a rather gay waistcoat and tolerably white shirt under his arm he bore a mighty whip of whalebone with a brass knob and upon his head was a hat without either top or brim there jasper shake hands with the sapengro can he box father said jasper surveying me rather contemptuously i should think not he looks so puny and small hold your peace fool said the man he can do more than thati tell you hes fly he carries a sap about which would sting a ninny like you to dead what a sapengro said the boy with a singular whine and stooping down he leered curiously in my face kindly however and then patted me on the head a sapengro he ejaculated lor yes and one of the right sort said the man i am glad we have met with him he is going to list with us and be our clergyman and god almighty ant you my tawny i dont know said i i must see what my father will say your father bahbut here he stopped for a sound was heard like the rapid galloping of a horse not loud and distinct as on a road but dull and heavy as if upon a grass sward nearer and nearer it came and the man starting up rushed out of the tent and looked around anxiously i arose from the stool upon which i had been seated and just at that moment amidst a crashing of boughs and sticks a man on horseback bounded over the hedge into the lane at a few yards distance from where we were from the impetus of the leap the horse was nearly down on his knees the rider however by dint of vigorous handling of the reins prevented him from falling and then rode up to the tent tis nat said the man what brings him here the new comer was a stout burly fellow about the middle age he had a savage determined look and his face was nearly covered over with carbuncles he wore a broad slouching hat and was dressed in a grey coat cut in a fashion which i afterwards learnt to be the genuine newmarket cut the skirts being exceedingly short his waistcoat was of red plush and he wore broad corduroy breeches and white topboots the steed which carried him was of iron grey spirited and powerful but covered with sweat and foam the fellow glanced fiercely and suspiciously around and said something to the man of the tent in a harsh and rapid voice a short and hurried conversation ensued in the strange tongue i could not take my eyes off this new comer oh that half jockey half bruiser countenance i never forgot it more than fifteen years afterwards i found myself amidst a crowd before newgate a gallows was erected and beneath it stood a criminal a notorious malefactor i recognised him at once the horseman of the lane is now beneath the fatal tree but nothing altered still the same man jerking his head to the right and left with the same fierce and under glance just as if the affairs of this world had the same kind of interest to the last grey coat of newmarket cut plush waistcoat corduroys and boots nothing altered but the head alas is bare and so is the neck oh crime and virtue virtue and crimeit was old john newton i think who when he saw a man going to be hanged said there goes john newton but for the grace of god but the lane the lane all was now in confusion in the lane the man and woman were employed in striking the tents and in making hurried preparations for departure the boy jasper was putting the harness upon the ponies and attaching them to the carts and to increase the singularity of the scene two or three wildlooking women and girls in red cloaks and immense black beaver bonnets came from i know not what direction and after exchanging a few words with the others commenced with fierce and agitated gestures to assist them in their occupation the rider meanwhile sat upon his horse but evidently in a state of great impatience he muttered curses between his teeth spurred the animal furiously and then reined it in causing it to rear itself up nearly perpendicular at last he said curse ye for romans how slow ye are well it is no business of mine stay here all day if you like i have given ye warning i am off to the big north road however before i go you had better give me all you have of that truly spoken nat my pal said the man give it him mother there it is now be off as soon as you please and rid us of evil company the woman had handed him two bags formed of stocking half full of something heavy which looked through them for all the world like money of some kind the fellow on receiving them thrust them without ceremony into the pockets of his coat and then without a word of farewell salutation departed at a tremendous rate the hoofs of his horse thundering for a long time on the hard soil of the neighbouring road till the sound finally died away in the distance the strange people were not slow in completing their preparations and then flogging their animals terrifically hurried away seemingly in the same directionthe boy jasper was last of the band as he was following the rest he stopped suddenly and looked on the ground appearing to muse then turning round he came up to me where i was standing leered in my face and then thrusting out his hand he said goodbye sap i dare say we shall meet again remember we are brothers two gentle brothers then whining forth what a sapengro lor he gave me a parting leer and hastened away i remained standing in the lane gazing after the retreating company a strange set of people said i at last i wonder who they can bechapter vi three yearslillys grammarproficiencyignorant of figuresthe school bellorder of successionpersecution what are we to donorthwarda goodly scenehaunted groundfeats of chivalryriversover the brig years passed on even three years during this period i had increased considerably in stature and in strength and let us hope improved in mind for i had entered on the study of the latin language the very first person to whose care i was intrusted for the acquisition of latin was an old friend of my fathers a clergyman who kept a seminary at a town the very next we visited after our departure from the cross under his instruction however i continued only a few weeks as we speedily left the place captain said this divine when my father came to take leave of him on the eve of our departure i have a friendship for you and therefore wish to give you a piece of advice concerning this son of yours you are now removing him from my care you do wrong but we will let that pass listen to me there is but one good school book in the worldthe one i use in my seminarylillys latin grammar in which your son has already made some progress if you are anxious for the success of your son in life for the correctness of his conduct and the soundness of his principles keep him to lillys grammar if you can by any means either fair or foul induce him to get by heart lillys latin grammar you may set your heart at rest with respect to him i myself will be his warrant i never yet knew a boy that was induced either by fair means or foul to learn lillys latin grammar by heart who did not turn out a man provided he lived long enough my father who did not understand the classical languages received with respect the advice of his old friend and from that moment conceived the highest opinion of lillys latin grammar during three years i studied lillys latin grammar under the tuition of various schoolmasters for i travelled with the regiment and in every town in which we were stationed i was invariably god bless my father sent to the classical academy of the place it chanced by good fortune that in the generality of these schools the grammar of lilly was in use when however that was not the case it made no difference in my educational course my father always stipulating with the masters that i should be daily examined in lilly at the end of the three years i had the whole by heart you had only to repeat the first two or three words of any sentence in any part of the book and forthwith i would open cry commencing without blundering and hesitation and continue till you were glad to beg me to leave off with many expressions of admiration at my proficiency in the latin language sometimes however to convince you how well i merited these encomiums i would follow you to the bottom of the stair and even into the street repeating in a kind of singsong measure the sonorous lines of the golden schoolmaster if i am here asked whether i understood anything of what i had got by heart i replynever mind i understand it all now and believe that no one ever yet got lillys latin grammar by heart when young who repented of the feat at a mature age and when my father saw that i had accomplished my task he opened his mouth and said truly this is more than i expected i did not think that there had been so much in you either of application or capacity you have now learnt all that is necessary if my friend dr bs opinion was sterling as i have no doubt it was you are still a child however and must yet go to school in order that you may be kept out of evil company perhaps you may still contrive now you have exhausted the barn to pick up a grain or two in the barnyard you are still ignorant of figures i believe not that i would mention figures in the same day with lillys grammar these words were uttered in a place called in the north or in the road to the north to which for some time past our corps had been slowly advancing i was sent to the school of the place which chanced to be a day school it was a somewhat extraordinary one and a somewhat extraordinary event occurred to me within its walls it occupied part of the farther end of a small plain or square at the outskirts of the town close to some extensive bleaching fields it was a long low building of one room with no upper story on the top was a kind of wooden box or sconce which i at first mistook for a pigeonhouse but which in reality contained a bell to which was attached a rope which passing through the ceiling hung dangling in the middle of the schoolroom i am the more particular in mentioning this appurtenance as i had soon occasion to scrape acquaintance with it in a manner not very agreeable to my feelings the master was very proud of his bell if i might judge from the fact of his eyes being frequently turned to that part of the ceiling from which the rope depended twice every day namely after the morning and evening tasks had been gone through were the boys rung out of school by the monotonous jingle of this bell this ringing out was rather a lengthy affair for as the master was a man of order and method the boys were only permitted to go out of the room one by one and as they were rather numerous amounting at least to one hundred and were taught to move at a pace of suitable decorum at least a quarter of an hour elapsed from the commencement of the march before the last boy could make his exit the office of bellringer was performed by every boy successively and it so happened that the very first day of my attendance at the school the turn to ring the bell had by order of succession arrived at the place which had been allotted to me for the master as i have already observed was a man of method and order and every boy had a particular seat to which he became a fixture as long as he continued at the school so upon this day when the tasks were done and completed and the boys sat with their hats and caps in their hands anxiously expecting the moment of dismissal it was suddenly notified to me by the urchins who sat nearest to me that i must get up and ring the bell now as this was the first time that i had been at the school i was totally unacquainted withthe process which i had never seen and indeed had never heard of till that moment i therefore sat still not imagining it possible that any such duty could be required of me but now with not a little confusion i perceived that the eyes of all the boys in the school were fixed upon me presently there were nods and winks in the direction of the bellrope and as these produced no effect uncouth visages were made like those of monkeys when enraged teeth were gnashed tongues thrust out and even fists were bent at me the master who stood at the end of the room with a huge ferule under his arm bent full upon me a look of stern appeal and the ushers of whom there were four glared upon me each from his own particular corner as i vainly turned in one direction and another in search of one reassuring look but now probably in obedience to a sign from the master the boys in my immediate neighbourhood began to maltreat me some pinched me with their fingers some buffeted me whilst others pricked me with pins or the points of compasses these arguments were not without effect i sprang from my seat and endeavoured to escape along a double line of benches thronged with boys of all ages from the urchin of six or seven to the nondescript of sixteen or seventeen it was like running the gauntlet every one great or small pinching kicking or otherwise maltreating me as i passed by goaded on in this manner i at length reached the middle of the room where dangled the bellrope the cause of all my sufferings i should have passed itfor my confusion was so great that i was quite at a loss to comprehend what all this could mean and almost believed myself under the influence of an ugly dreambut now the boys who were seated in advance in the row arose with one accord and barred my farther progress and one doubtless more sensible than the rest seizing the rope thrust it into my hand i now began to perceive that the dismissal of the school and my own release from torment depended upon this self same rope i therefore in a fit of desperation pulled it once or twice and then left off naturally supposing that i had done quite enough the boys who sat next the door no sooner heard the bell than rising from their seats they moved out at the door the bell however had no sooner ceased to jingle than they stopped short and turning round stared at the master as much as to say what are we to do now this was too much for the patience of the man of method which my previous stupidity had already nearly exhausted dashing forward into the middle of the room he struck me violently on the shoulders with his ferule and snatching the rope out of my hand exclaimed with a stentorian voice and genuine yorkshire accent prodigy of ignorance dost not even know how to ring a bell must i myself instruct thee he then commenced pulling at the bell with such violence that long before half the school was dismissed the rope broke and the rest of the boys had to depart without their accustomed music but i must not linger here though i could say much about the school and the pedagogue highly amusing and diverting which however i suppress in order to make way for matters of yet greater interest on we went northward northward and as we advanced i saw that the country was becoming widely different from those parts of merry england in which we had previously travelled it was wilder and less cultivated and more broken with hills and hillocks the people too of those regions appeared to partake of something of the character of their country they were coarsely dressed tall and sturdy of frame their voices were deep and guttural and the half of the dialect which they spoke was unintelligible to my ears i often wondered where we could be going for i was at this time about as ignorant of geography as i was of most other things however i held my peace asked no questions and patiently awaited the issue northward northward still and it came to pass that one morning i found myself extended on the bank of a river it was a beautiful morning of early spring small white clouds were floating in the heaven occasionally veiling the countenance of the sun whose light as they retired would again burst forth coursing like a racehorse over the sceneand a goodly scene it was before me across the water on an eminence stood a white old city surrounded with lofty walls above which rose the tops of tall houses with here and there a church or steeple to my right hand was a long and massive bridge with many arches and of antique architecture which traversed the river the river was a noble one the broadest that i had hitherto seen its waters of a greenish tinge poured with impetuosity beneath the narrow arches to meet the sea close at hand as the boom of the billows breaking distinctly upon a beach declared there were songs upon the river from the fisherbarks and occasionally a chorus plaintive and wild such as i had never heard before the words of which i did not understand but which at the present time down the long avenue of years seem in memorys ear to sound like horam coram dago several robust fellows were near me some kneedeep in water employed in hauling the seine upon the strand huge fish were struggling amidst the meshesprincely salmontheir brilliant mail of blue and silver flashing in the morning beam so goodly and gay a scene in truth had never greeted my boyish eye and as i gazed upon the prospect my bosom began to heave and my tears to trickle was it the beauty of the scene which gave rise to these emotions possibly for though a poor ignorant childa halfwild creaturei was not insensible to the loveliness of nature and took pleasure in the happiness and handiworks of my fellowcreatures yet perhaps in something more deep and mysterious the feelings which then pervaded me might originate who can lie down on elvir hill without experiencing something of the sorcery of the place flee from elvir hill young swain or the maids of elle will have power over you and you will go elfwildso say the danes i had unconsciously laid myself down on haunted ground and i am willing to imagine that what i then experienced was rather connected with the world of spirits and dreams than with what i actually saw and heard around me surely the elves and genii of the place were conversing bysome inscrutable means with the principle of intelligence lurking within the poor uncultivated clod perhaps to that ethereal principle the wonders of the past as connected with that stream the glories of the present and even the history of the future were at that moment being revealed of how many feats of chivalry had those old walls been witness when hostile kings contended for their possessionhow many an army from the south and from the north had trod that old bridgewhat red and noble blood had crimsoned those rushing waterswhat strains had been sung ay were yet being sung on its bankssome soft as doric reed some fierce and sharp as those of norwegian skaldaglam some as replete with wild and wizard force as finlands runes singing of kalevales moors and the deeds of woinomoinen honour to thee thou island stream onward may thou ever roll fresh and green rejoicing in thy bright past thy glorious present and in vivid hope of a triumphant future flow on beautiful onewhich of the worlds streams canst thou envy with thy beauty and renown stately is the danube rolling

thou envy the turbid tiber of bygone fame creeping sadly to the sea surcharged with the abominations of modern romehow unlike to thee thou pure island stream and as i lay on the bank and wept there drew nigh to me a man in the habiliments of a fisher he was barelegged of a weatherbeaten countenance and of stature approaching to the gigantic what is the callant greeting for said he as he stopped and surveyed me has ony body wrought ye ony harm not that i know of i replied rather guessing at than understanding his question i was crying because i could not help it i say old one what is the name

you speir a civil question yon river is called the tweed and yonder over the brig is scotland did ye never hear of the tweed my bonny man no said i as i rose from the grass and proceeded to cross the

before we found ourselves at edinburgh or rather in the castle into which the regiment marched with drums beating colours flying and a long train of baggagewaggons behind the castle was as i suppose it is now a garrison for soldiers two other regiments were already there the one an irish if i remember right the other a small highland corps it is hardly necessary to say much about this castle which everybody has seen on which account doubtless nobody has ever yet thought fit to describe itat least that i am aware be this as it may i have no intention of describing it and shall content myself with observing that we took up our abode in that immense building or caserne of modern erection which occupies the entire eastern side of the bold rock on which the castle stands a gallant caserne it wasthe best and roomiest that i had hitherto seenrather cold and windy it is true especially in the winter but commanding a noble prospect of a range of distant hills which i was told were the hieland hills and of a broad arm of the sea which i heard somebody say was the firth of forth my brother who for some years past had been receiving his education in a certain celebrated school in england was now with us and it came to pass that one day my father as he sat at table looked steadfastly on my brother and myself and then addressed my motherduring my journey down hither i have lost no opportunity of making inquiries about these people the scotch amongst whom we now are and since i have been here i have observed them attentively from what i have heard and seen i should say that upon the whole they are a very decent set of people they seem acute and intelligent and i am told that their system of education is so excellent that every person is learnedmore or less acquainted with greek and latin there is one thing however connected with them which is a great drawback the horrid jargon which they speak however learned they may be in greek and latin their english is execrable and yet im told it is not so bad as it was i was in company the other day with an englishman who has resided here many years we were talking about the country and the people i should like both very well said i were it not for the language i wish sincerely our parliament which is passing so many foolish acts every year would pass one to force these scotch to speak english i wish so too said he the language is a disgrace to the british government but if you had heard it twenty years ago captainif you had heard it as it was spoken when i first came to edinburgh only custom said my mother i dare say the language is now what it was then i dont know said my father though i dare say you are right it could never have been worse than it is at present but now to the point were it not for the language which if the boys were to pick it up might ruin their prospects in life were it not for that i should very much like to send them to a school there is in this place which everybody talks about the high school i think they call it tis said to be the best school in the whole island but the idea of ones children speaking scotchbroad scotch i must think the matter over and he did think the matter over and the result of his deliberation was a determination to send us to the school let me call thee up before my minds eye high school to which every morning the two english brothers took their way from the proud old castle through the lofty streets of the old town high schoolcalled so i scarcely know why neither lofty in thyself nor by position being situated in a flat bottom oblong structure of tawny stone with many windows fenced with iron nettingwith thy long hall below and thy five chambers above for the reception of the five classes into which the eight hundred urchins who styled thee instructress were divided thy learned rector and his four subordinate dominies thy strange old porter of the tall form and grizzled hair hight boee and doubtless of norse ancestry as his name declares perhaps of the blood of bui hin digri the hero of northern songthe jomsborg viking who clove thorsteinn midlaagr asunder in the dread sea battle of horunga vog and who when the fight was lost and his own two hands smitten off seized two chests of gold with his bloody stumps and springing with them into the sea cried to the scanty relics of his crew overboard now all buis lads yes i remember all about thee and how at eight of every morn we were all gathered together with one accord in the long hall from which after the litanies had been read for so i will call them being an episcopalian the five classes from the five sets of benches trotted off in long files one boy after the other up the five spiral staircases of stone each class to its destination and well do i remember how we of the third sat hushed and still watched by the eye of the dux until the door opened and in walked that model of a good scotchman the shrewd intelligent but warmhearted and kind dominie the respectable carson and in this school i began to construe the latin language which i had never done before notwithstanding my long and diligent study of lilly which illustrious grammar was not used at edinburgh nor indeed known greek was only taught in the fifth or highest class in which my brother was as for myself i never got beyond the third during the two years that i remained at this seminary i certainly acquired here a considerable insight in the latin tongue and to the scandal of my father and horror of my mother a thorough proficiency in the scotch which in less than two months usurped the placeof the english and so obstinately maintained its ground that i still can occasionally detect its lingering remains i did not spend my time unpleasantly at this school though first of all i had to pass through an ordeal scotland is a better country than england said an ugly bleareyed lad about a head and shoulders taller than myself the leader of a gang of varlets who surrounded me in the playground on the first day as soon as the morning lesson was over scotland is a far better country than england in every respect is it said i then you ought to be very thankful for not having been born in england thats just what i am ye loon and every morning when i say my prayers i thank god for not being an englishman the scotch are a much better and braver people than the english it may be so said i for what i knowindeed till i came here i never heard a word either about the scotch or their country are ye making fun of us ye english puppy said the bleareyed lad take that and i was presently beaten black and blue and thus did i first become aware of the difference of races and their antipathy to each other bow to the storm and it shall pass over you i held my peace and silently submitted to the superiority of the scotchin numbers this was enough from an object of persecution i soon became one of patronage especially amongst the champions of the class the english said the bleareyed lad though a wee bit behind the scotch in strength and fortitude are nae to be sneezed at being far ahead of the irish to say nothing of the french a pack of cowardly scoundrels and with regard to the english country it is na scotland it is true but it has its gude properties and though there is neer a haggis in a the land theres an unco deal o gowd and siller i respect england for i have an auntie married there the scotch are certainly a most pugnacious people their whole history proves it witness their incessant wars with the english in the olden time and their internal feuds highland with lowland clan with clan family with family saxon with gael in my time the schoolboys for want perhaps of english urchins to contend with were continually fighting with each other every noon there was at least one pugilistic encounter and sometimes three in one month i witnessed more of these encounters than i had ever previously seen under similar circumstances in england after all there was not much harm done harm what harm could result from short chopping blows a hug and a tumble i was witness to many a sounding whack some blood shed a blue ee now and then but nothing more in england on the contrary where the lads were comparatively mild gentle and pacific i had been present at more than one death caused by blows in boyish combats in which the oldest of the victors had scarcely reached thirteen years but these blows were in the jugular given with the full force of the arm shot out horizontally from the shoulder but the scotchthough by no means proficients in boxing and how should they box seeing that they have never had a teacherare i repeat a most pugnacious people at least they were in my time anything served them that is the urchins as a pretence for a fray or dorically speaking a bicker every street and close was at feud with its neighbour the lads of the school were at feud with the young men of the college whom they pelted in winter with snow and in summer with stones and then the feud between the old and new town one day i was standing on the ramparts of the castle on the southwestern side which overhangs the green brae where it slopes down into what was in those days the green swamp or morass called by the natives of auld reekie the nor loch it was a dark gloomy day and a thin veil of mist was beginning to settle down upon the brae and the morass i could perceive however that there was a skirmish taking place in the latter spot i had an indistinct view of two parties apparently of urchinsand i heard whoops and shrill cries eager to know the cause of this disturbance i left the castle and descending the brae reached the borders of the morass where was a runnel of water and the remains of an old wall on the other side of which a narrow path led across the swamp upon this path at a little distance before me there was a bicker i pushed forward but had scarcely crossed the ruined wall and runnel when the party nearest to me gave way and in great confusion came running in my direction as they drew nigh one of them shouted to me wha are ye mon are ye o the auld toon i made no answer ha ye are of the new toon deil tak ye well murder ye and the next moment a huge stone sung past my head let me be ye fule bodies said i im no of either of ye i live yonder aboon in the castle ah ye live in the castle then yere an auld tooner come gie us your help man and dinna stand there staring like a dunnot we want help sair eneugh here are stanes for my own part i wished for nothing better and rushing forward i placed myself at the head of my new associates and commenced flinging stones fast and desperately the other party now gave way in their turn closely followed by ourselves i was in the van and about to stretch out my hand to seize the hindermost boy of the enemy when not being acquainted with the miry and difficult paths of the nor loch and in my eagerness taking no heed of my footing i plunged into a quagmire into which i sank as far as my shoulders our adversaries no sooner perceived this disaster than setting up a shout they wheeled round and attacked us most vehemently had my comrades now deserted me my life had not been worth a straws purchase i should either have been smothered in the quag or what is more probable hadmy brains beaten out with stones but they behaved like true scots and fought stoutly around their comrade until i was extricated whereupon both parties retired the night being near at hand ye are na a bad hand at flinging stanes said the lad who first addressed me as we now returned up the brae your aim is right dangerous mon i saw how ye skelpit them ye maun help us agin thae new toon blackguards at our next bicker so to the next bicker i went and to many more which speedily followed as the summer advanced the party to which i had given my help on the first occasion consisted merely of outlyers posted about half way up the hill for the purpose of overlooking the movements of the enemy did the latter draw nigh in any considerable force messengers were forthwith despatched to the auld toon especially to the filthy alleys and closes of the high street which forthwith would disgorge swarms of bareheaded and barefooted callants who with gestures wild and eldrich screech and hollo might frequently be seen pouring down the sides of the hill i have seen upwards of a thousand engaged on either side in these frays which i have no doubt were full as desperate as the fights described in the iliad and which were certainly much more bloody than the combats of modern greece in the war of independence the callants not only employed their hands in hurling stones but not unfrequently slings at the use of which they were very expert and which occasionally dislodged teeth shattered jaws or knocked out an eye our opponents certainly laboured under considerable disadvantage being compelled not only to wade across a deceitful bog but likewise to clamber up part of a steep hill before they could attack us nevertheless their determination was such and such their impetuosity that we had sometimes difficulty enough to maintain our own i shall never forget one bicker the last indeed which occurred at that time as the authorities of the town alarmed by the desperation of its character stationed forthwith a body of police on the hill side to prevent in future any such breaches of the peace it was a beautiful sunday evening the rays of the descending sun were reflected redly from the grey walls of the castle and from the black rocks on which it was founded the bicker had long since commenced stones from sling and hand were flying but the callants of the new town were now carrying everything before them a fullgrown bakers apprentice was at their head he was foaming with rage and had taken the field as i was told in order to avenge his brother whose eye had been knocked out in one of the late bickers he was no slinger or flinger but brandished in his right hand the spoke of a cartwheel like my countryman tom hickathrift of old in his encounter with the giant of the lincolnshire fen protected by a piece of wickerwork attached to his left arm he rushed on to the fray disregarding the stones which were showered against him and was ably seconded by his followers our own party was chased half way up the hill where i was struck to the ground by the baker after having been foiled in an attempt which i had made to fling a handful of earth into his eyes all now appeared lost the auld toon was in full retreat i myself lay at the bakers feet who had just raised his spoke probably to give me the coup de grâceit was an awful moment just then i heard a shout and a rushing sound a wildlooking figure is descending the hill with terrible bounds it is a lad of some fifteen years he is bareheaded and his red uncombed hair stands on end like hedgehogs bristles his frame is lithy like that of an antelope but he has prodigious breadth of chest he wears a military undress that of the regiment even of a drummer for it is wild davy whom a month before i had seen enlisted on leith links to serve king george with drum and drumstick as long as his services might be required and who ere a week had elapsed had smitten with his fist drummajor elzigood who incensed at his inaptitude had threatened him with his cane he has been in confinement for weeks this is the first day of his liberation and he is now descending the hill with horrid bounds and shoutings he is now about five yards distant and the baker who apprehends that something dangerous is at hand prepares himself for the encounter but what avails the strength of a baker even full grownwhat avails the defence of a wicker shield what avails the wheelspoke should there be an opportunity of using it against the impetus of an avalanche or a cannon ballfor to either of these might that wild figure be compared which at the distance of five yards sprang at once with head hands feet and body all together upon the champion of the new town tumbling him to the earth amain and now it was the turn of the old town to triumph our late discomfited host returning on its steps overwhelmed the fallen champion with blows of every kind and then led on by his vanquisher who had assumed his arms namely the wheelspoke and wicker shield fairly cleared the brae of their adversaries whom they drove down headlong into the morasschapter viii expert climbersthe cragssomething redthe horrible edgedavid haggartfine materialsthe greatest victoryextraordinary robberthe ruling passion meanwhile i had become a daring cragsman a character to which an english lad has seldom opportunities of aspiring for in england there are neither crags nor mountains of these however as is well known there is no lack in scotland and the habits of individuals are invariably in harmony with the country in which they dwell the scotch are expert climbers and i was now a scot in most things particularly in language the castle on which i dwelt stood upon a rock a bold and craggy one which at first sight would seem to bid defiance to any feet save those of goats and chamois but patience and perseverance generally enable mankind to overcome things which at first sight appear impossible indeed what is there above mans exertions unwearied determination will enable him to run with the horse to swim with the fish and assuredly to compete with the chamois and the goat in agility and sureness of foot to scale the rock was merely childs play for the edinbro callants it was my own favourite diversion i soon found that the rock contained all manner of strange crypts crannies and recesses where owls nestled and the weasel brought forth her young here and there were small natural platforms overgrown with long grass and various kinds of plants where the climber if so disposed could stretch himself and either give his eyes to sleep or his mind to thought for capital places were these same platforms either for repose or meditation the boldest features of the rock are descried on the southern side where after shelving down gently from the wall for some distance it terminates abruptly in a precipice black and horrible of some three hundred feet at least as if the axe of nature had been here employed cutting sheer down and leaving behind neither excrescence nor spura dizzy precipice it is assimilating much to those so frequent in the flinty hills of northern africa and exhibiting some distant resemblance to that of gibraltar towering in its horridness above the neutral ground it was now holiday time and having nothing particular wherewith to occupy myself i not unfrequently passed the greater part of the day upon the rocks once after scaling the western crags and creeping round a sharp angle of the wall overhung by a kind of watch tower i found myself on the southern side still keeping close to the wall i was proceeding onward for i was bent upon a long excursion which should embrace half the circuit of the castle when suddenly my eye was attracted by the appearance of something red far below me i stopped short and looking fixedly upon it perceived that it was a human being in a kind of red jacket seated on the extreme verge of the precipice which i have already made a faint attempt to describe wondering who it could be i shouted but it took not the slightest notice remaining as immovable as the rock on which it sat i should never have thought of going near that edge said i to myself however as you have done it why should not i and i should like to know who you are so i commenced the descent of the rock but with great care for i had as yet never been in a situation so dangerous a slight moisture exuded from the palms of my hands my nerves were tingling and my brain was somewhat dizzyand now i had arrived within a few yards of the figure and had recognised it it was the wild drummer who had turned the tide of battle in the bicker on the castle brae a small stone which i dislodged now rolled down the rock and tumbled into the abyss close beside him he turned his head and after looking at me for a moment somewhat vacantly he resumed his former attitude i drew yet nearer to the horrible edge not close however for fear was on me what are you thinking of david said i as i sat behind him and trembled for i repeat that i was afraid david haggart i was thinking of willie wallace myself you had better be thinking of yourself man a strange place this to come to and think of william wallace david haggart why so is not his tower just beneath our feet myself you mean the auld ruin by the side of nor lochthe ugly stane bulk from the foot of which flows the spring into the dyke where the watercresses grow david haggart just sae geordie myself and why were ye thinking of him the english hanged him long since as i have heard say david haggart i was thinking that i should wish to be like him myself do ye mean that ye would wish to be hanged david haggart i wad na flinch from that geordie if i might be a great man first myself and wha kens davie how great you may be even without hanging are ye not in the high road of preferment are ye not a bauld drummer already wha kens how high ye may rise perhaps to be general or drummajordavid haggart i hae na wish to be drummajor it were na great things to be like the doited carle elsethangude as they call him and troth he has nae his name for naething but i should have nae objection to be a general and to fight the french and americans and win myself a name and a fame like willie wallace and do brave deeds such as i have been reading about in his story book myself ye are a fule davie the story book is full of lies wallace indeed the wuddie rebel i have heard my father say that the duke of cumberland was worth twenty of willie wallace david haggart ye had better sae naething agin willie wallace geordie for if ye do deil hae me if i dinna tumble ye doon the craig fine materials in that lad for a hero you will say yes indeed for a hero or for what he afterwards became in other times and under other circumstances he might have made what is generally termed a great man a patriot or a conqueror as it was the very qualities which might then have pushed him on to fortune and renown were the cause of his ruin the war over he fell into evil courses for his wild heart and ambitious spirit could not brook the sober and quiet pursuits of honest industry can an arabian steed submit to be a vile drudge cries the fatalist nonsense a man is not an irrational creature but a reasoning being and has something within him beyond mere brutal instinct the greatest victory which a man can achieve is over himself by which is meant those unruly passions which are not convenient to the time and place david did not do this he gave the reins to his wild heart instead of curbing it and became a robber and alas alas he shed bloodunder peculiar circumstances it is true and without malice prépenseand for that blood he eventually died and justly for it was that of the warden of a prison from which he was escaping and whom he slew with one blow of his stalwart arm tamerlane and haggart haggart and tamerlane both these men were robbers and of low birth yet one perished on an ignoble scaffold and the other died emperor of the world is this justice the ends of the two men were widely dissimilaryet what is the intrinsic difference between them very great indeed the one acted according to his lights and his country not so the other tamerlane was a heathen and acted according to his lights he was a robber where all around were robbers but he became the avenger of godgods scourge on unjust kings on the cruel bajazet who had plucked out his own brothers eyes he became to a certain extent the purifier of the east its regenerator his equal never was before nor has it since been seen here the wild heart was profitably employed the wild strength the teeming brain onward lame one onward tamurlank haggart but peace to thee poor david why should a mortal worm be sitting in judgment over thee the mighty and just one has already judged thee and perhaps above thou hast received pardon for thy crimes which could not be pardoned here below and now that thy feverish existence has closed and thy once active form become inanimate dust thy very memory all but forgotten i will say a few words about thee a few words soon also to be forgotten thou wast the most extraordinary robber that ever lived within the belt of britain scotland rang with thy exploits and england too north of the humber strange deeds also didst thou achieve when fleeing from justice thou didst find thyself in the sister isle busy wast thou there in town and on curragh at fair and racecourse and also in the solitary place ireland thought thee her child for who spoke her brogue better than thyselfshe felt proud of thee and said sure ohanlon is come again what might not have been thy fate in the far west in america whither thou hadst turned thine eye saying i will go there and become an honest man but thou wast not to go there davidthe blood which thou hadst shed in scotland was to be required of thee the avenger was at hand the avenger of blood seized manacled brought back to thy native land condemned to die thou wast left in thy narrow cell and told to make the most of thy time for it was short and there in thy narrow cell and thy time so short thou didst put the crowning stone to thy strange deeds by that strange history of thyself penned by thine own hand in the robber tongue thou mightest have been better employed davidbut the ruling passion was strong with thee even in the jaws of death thou mightest have been better employedbut peace be with thee i repeat and the almightys grace and pardon chapter ix napoleonthe stormthe coveup the countrythe trembling handirishtough battletipperary hills elegant lodgingsa speechfair specimenorangemen onward onward and after we had sojourned in scotland nearly two years the long continental war had been brought to an end napoleon was humbled for a time and the bourbons restored to a land which could well have dispensed with them we returned to england where the corps was disbanded and my parents with their family retired to private life i shall pass over in silence the events of a year which offer little of interest as far as connected with me and mine suddenly however the sound of war was heard again napoleon had broken forth from elba and everything was in confusion vast military preparations were again made our own corps was levied anew and my brother became an officer in it but the danger was soon over napoleon was once more quelled and chained for ever like prometheus to his rock as the corps however though so recently levied had already become a very fine one thanks to my fathers energetic drilling the government very properly determined to turn it to some account and as disturbances were apprehended in ireland about this period it occurred to them that they could do no better than despatch it to that country in the autumn of the year we set sail from a port in essex we were some eight hundred strong and were embarked in two ships very large but old and crazy a storm overtook us when off beachy head in which we had nearly foundered i was awakened early in the morning by the howling of the wind and the uproar on deck i kept myself close however as is still my constant practice on similar occasions and waited the result with that apathy and indifference which violent seasickness is sure to produce we shipped several seas and once the vessel missing stayswhich to do it justice it generally did at every third or fourth tackwe escaped almost by a miracle from being dashed upon the foreland on the eighth day of our voyage we were in sight of ireland the weather was now calm and serene the sun shone brightly on the sea and on certain green hills in the distance on which i descried what at first sight i believed to be two ladies gathering flowers which however on our nearer approach proved to be two tall white towers doubtless built for some purpose or other though i did not learn for what we entered a kind of bay or cove by a narrow inlet it was a beautiful and romantic place this cove very spacious and being nearly landlocked was sheltered from every wind a small island every inch of which was covered with fortifications appeared to swim upon the waters whose dark blue denoted their immense depth tall green hills which ascended gradually from the shore formed the background to the west they were carpeted to the top with turf of the most vivid green and studded here and there with woods seemingly of oak there was a strange old castle half way up the ascent a village on a cragbut the mists of the morning were half veiling the scene when i surveyed it and the mists of time are now hanging densely between it and my no longer youthful eye i may not describe itnor will i try leaving the ship in the cove we passed up a wide river in boats till we came to a city where we disembarked it was a large city as large as edinburgh to my eyes there were plenty of fine houses but little neatness the streets were full of impurities handsome equipages rolled along but the greater part of the population were in rags beggars abounded there was no lack of merriment however boisterous shouts of laughter were heard on every side it appeared a city of contradictions after a few days rest we marched from this place in two divisions my father commanded the second i walked by his side our route lay up the country the country at first offered no very remarkable feature it was pretty but tame on the second day however its appearance had altered it had become more wild a range of distant mountains bound the horizon we passed through several villages as i suppose i may term them of low huts the walls formed of rough stones without mortar the roof of flags laid over wattles and wickerwork they seemed to be inhabited solely by women and children the latter were naked the former in general bleareyed beldames who sat beside the doors on low stools spinning we saw however both men and women working at a distance in the fields i was thirsty and going up to an ancient crone employed in the manner which i have described i asked her for water she looked me in the face appeared to consider a moment then tottering into her hut presently reappeared with a small pipkin of milk which she offered to me with a trembling hand i drank the milk it was sour but i found it highly refreshing i then took out a penny and offered it to her whereupon she shook her head smiled and patting my face with her skinny hand murmured some words in a tongue which i had never heard before i walked on by my fathers side holding the stirrupleather of his horse presently several low uncouth cars passed by drawn by starved cattle the drivers were tall fellows with dark features and athletic framesthey wore long loose blue cloaks with sleeves which last however dangled unoccupied these cloaks appeared in tolerably good condition not so their under garments on their heads were broad slouching hats the generality of them were barefooted as they passed the soldiers jested with them in the patois of east anglia whereupon the fellows laughed and appeared to jest with the soldiers but what they said who knows it being in a rough guttural language strange and wild the soldiers stared at each other and were silenta strange language that said a young officer to my father i dont understand a word of it what can it be irish said my father with a loud voice and a bad language it is i have known it of old that is i have often heard it spoken when i was a guardsman in london theres one part of london where all the irish liveat least all the worst of themand there they hatch their villanies to speak this tongue it is that which keeps them together and makes them dangerous i was once sent there to seize a couple of desertersirishwho had taken refuge amongst their companions we found them in what was in my time called a ken that is a house where only thieves and desperadoes are to be found knowing on what kind of business i was bound i had taken with me a sergeants party it was well i did so we found the deserters in a large room with at least thirty ruffians horridlooking fellows seated about a long table drinking swearing and talking irish ah we had a tough battle i remember the two fellows did nothing but sat still thinking it best to be quiet but the rest with an ubbubboo like the blowing up of a powdermagazine sprang up brandishing their sticks for these fellows always carry sticks with them even to bed and not unfrequently spring up in their sleep striking left and right did you take the deserters said the officer yes said my father for we formed at the end of the room and charged with fixed bayonets which compelled the others to yield notwithstanding their numbers but the worst was when we got out into the street the whole district had become alarmed and hundreds came pouring down upon usmen women and children women did i saythey looked fiends halfnaked with their hair hanging down over their bosoms they tore up the very pavement to hurl at us sticks rang about our ears stones and irishi liked the irish worst of all it sounded so horrid especially as i did not understand it its a bad language a queer tongue said i i wonder if i could learn it learn it said my father what should you learn it forhowever i am not afraid of that it is not like scotch no person can learn it save those who are born to it and even in ireland the respectable people do not speak it only the wilder sort like those we have passed within a day or two we had reached a tall range of mountains running north and south which i was told were those of tipperary along the skirts of these we proceeded till we came to a town the principal one of these regions it was on the bank of a beautiful river which separated it from the mountains it was rather an ancient place and might contain some ten thousand inhabitantsi found that it was our destination there were extensive barracks at the farther end in which the corps took up its quarters with respect to ourselves we took lodgings in a house which stood in the principal street you never saw more elegant lodgings than these captain said the master of the house a tall handsome and athletic man who came up whilst our little family were seated at dinner late in the afternoon of the day of our arrival they beat anything in this town of clonmel i do not let them for the sake of interest and to none but gentlemen in the army in order that myself and my wife who is from londonderry may have the advantage of pleasant company a genteel company ay and protestant company captain it did my heart good when i saw your honour ride in at the head of all those fine fellows real protestants ill engage not a papist among them they are too goodlooking and honestlooking for that so i no sooner saw your honour at the head of your army with that handsome young gentleman holding by your stirrup than i said to my wife mistress hyne who is from londonderry god bless me said i what a truly protestant countenance what a noble bearing and what a sweet young gentleman by the silver hairs of his honourand sure enough i never saw hairs more regally silver than those of your honourby his honours gray silver hairs and by my own soul which is not worthy to be mentioned in the same day with one of themit would be no more than decent and civil to run out and welcome such a father and son coming in at the head of such a protestant military and then my wife who is from londonderry mistress hyne looking me in the face like a fairy as she is you may say that says she it would be but decent and civil honey and your honour knows how i ran out of my own door and welcomed your honour riding in company with your son who was walking how i welcomed ye both at the head of your royal regiment and how i shook your honour by the hand saying i am glad to see your honour and your honours son and your honours royal military protestant regiment and now i have you in the house and right proud i am to have ye one and all one two three four true protestants every one no papists here and i have made bold to bring up a bottle of claret which is now waiting behind the door and when your honour and your family have dined i will make bold too to bring up mistress hyne from londonderry to introduce to your honours lady and then well drink to the health of king george god bless him to the glorious and immortalto boyne waterto your honours speedy promotion to be lord lieutenant and to the speedy downfall of the pope and saint anthony of padua such was the speech of the irish protestant addressed to my father in the long lofty diningroom with three windows looking upon the high street of the good town of clonmel as he sat at meat with his family after saying grace like a truehearted respectable soldier as he was a bigot and an orangeman oh yes it is easier to apply epithets of opprobrium to people than to make yourself acquainted with their history and position he was a specimen and a fair specimen of a most remarkable body of menwho during two centuries have fought a good fight in ireland in the cause of civilization and religious truth they were sent as colonists few in number into a barbarous and unhappy country where ever since though surrounded with difficulties of every kind they have maintained their ground theirs has been no easy life nor have their lines fallen upon very pleasant places amidst darkness they have held up a lamp and it would be well for ireland were all her children like these her adopted ones but they are fierce and sanguinary it is said ay ay they have not unfrequently opposed the keen sword to the savage pike but they are bigoted and narrowminded ay ay they do not like idolatry and will not bow the knee before a stone but their language is frequently indecorous go to my dainty one did ye ever listen to the voice of papist cursing the irish protestants have faults numerous ones but the greater number of these may be traced to the peculiar circumstances of their position but they have virtues numerous ones and their virtues are their own their industry their energy and their undaunted resolution are their own they have been vilified and traducedbut what would ireland be without them i repeat that it would be well for her were all her sons no worse than these much calumniated children of her adoptionchapter x protestant young gentlementhe greek lettersopen chimneymurtaghparis and salamancanothing to do to whit to whoothe pack of cardsbefore christmas we continued at this place for some months during which time the soldiers performed their duties whatever they were and i having no duties to perform was sent to school i had been to english schools and to the celebrated one of edinburgh but my education at the present day would not be what it isperfect had i never had the honour of being alumnus in an irish seminary captain said our kind host you would no doubt wish that the young gentleman should enjoy every advantage which the town may afford towards helping him on in the path of genteel learning its a great pity that he should waste his time in idlenessdoing nothing else than what he says he has been doing for the last fortnightfishing in the river for trouts which he never catches and wandering up the glen in the mountain in search of the hips that grow there now we have a school here where he can learn the most elegant latin and get an insight into the greek letters which is desirable and where moreover he will have an opportunity of making acquaintance with all the protestant young gentlemen of the place the handsome welldressed young persons whom your honour sees in the church on the sundays when your honour goes there in the morning with the rest of the protestant military for it is no papist school though there may be a papist or two therea few poor farmers sons from the country with whom there is no necessity for your honours child to form any acquaintance at all at all and to the school i went where i read the latin tongue and the greek letters with a nice old clergyman who sat behind a black oaken desk with a huge elzevir flaccus before him in a long gloomy kind of hall with a broken stone floor the roof festooned with cobwebs the walls considerably dilapidated and covered over with strange figures and hieroglyphics evidently produced by the application of burnt stick and there i made acquaintance with the protestant young gentlemen of the place who with whatever éclat they might appear at church on a sunday did assuredly not exhibit to much advantage in the schoolroom on the week days either with respect to clothes or looks and there i was in the habit of sitting on a large stone before the roaring fire in the huge open chimney and entertaining certain of the protestant young gentlemen of my own age seated on similar stones with extraordinary accounts of my own adventures and those of the corps with an occasional anecdote extracted from the storybooks of hickathrift and wight wallace pretending to be conning the lesson all the while and there i made acquaintance notwithstanding the hint of the land lord with the papist gasoons as they were called the farmers sons from the country and of these gasoons of which there were three two might be reckoned as nothing at all in the third however i soon discovered that there was something extraordinary he was about sixteen years old and above six feet high dressed in a gray suit the coat from its size appeared to have been made for him some ten years before he was remarkably narrowchested and roundshouldered owing perhaps as much to the tightness of his garment as to the hand of nature his face was long and his complexion swarthy relieved however by certain freckles with which the skin was plentifully studded he had strange wandering eyes gray and somewhat unequal in size they seldom rested on the book but were generally wandering about the room from one object to another sometimes he would fix them intently on the wall and then suddenly starting as if from a reverie he would commence making certain mysterious movements with his thumbs and forefingers as if he were shuffling something from him one morning as he sat by himself on a bench engaged in this manner i went up to him and said good day murtagh you do not seem to have much to do faith you may say that shorsha dearit is seldom much to do that i have and what are you doing with your hands faith then if i must tell you i was een dealing with the cards do you play much at cards sorra a game shorsha have i played with the cards since my uncle phelim the thief stole away the ould pack when he went to settle in the

but my fathers own and thats where i live when at home and your father is a farmer i suppose you may say that and it is a farmer i should have been like my brother denis had not my uncle phelim the thief tould my father to send me to school to learn greek letters that i might be made a saggart of and sent to paris and salamanca and you would rather be a farmer than a priest you may say thatfor were i a farmer like the rest i should have something to do like the restsomething that i cared forand i should come home tired at night and fall asleep as the rest do before the fire but when i comes home at night i am not tired for i have been doing nothing all day that i care for and then i sits down and stares about me and at the fire till i become frighted and then i shouts to my brother denis or to the gasoons get up i say and lets be doing something tell us a tale of finnmacoul and how he lay down in the shannons bed and let the river flow down his jaws arrah shorsha i wish you would come

two bad luck to them and do they get up and tell you stories sometimes they does but oftenmost they curses me and bids me be quiet but i cant be quiet either before the fire or abed so i runs out of the house and stares at the rocks at the trees and sometimes at the clouds as they run a race across the bright moon and the more i stares the more frighted i grows till i screeches and holloas and last night i went into the barn and hid my face in the straw and there as i lay and shivered in the straw i heard a voice above my head singing out to whit to whoo and then up i starts and runs into the house and falls over my brother denis as he lies at the fire whats that for says he get up you thief says i and be helping me i have been out in the barn and an owl has crowd at me and what has

and desolatethe donjonold womanmy own house when christmas was over and the new year commenced we broke up our quarters and marched away to templemore this was a large military station situated in a wild and thinly inhabited country extensive bogs were in the neighbourhood connected with the huge bog of allan the palus mæotis of ireland here and there was seen a ruined castle looming through the mists of winter whilst at the distance of seven miles rose a singular mountain exhibiting in its brow a chasm or vacuum just for all the world as if a piece had been bitten out a feat which according to the tradition of the country had actually been performed by his satanic majesty who after flying for some leagues with the morsel in his mouth becoming weary dropped it in the vicinity of cashel where it may now be seen in the shape of a bold bluff hill crowned with the ruins of a stately edifice probably built by some ancient irish king we had been here only a few days when my brother who as i have before observed had become one of his majestys officers was sent on a detachment to a village at about ten miles distance he was not sixteen and though three years older than myself scarcely my equal in stature for i had become tall and largelimbed for my age but there was a spirit in him that would not have disgraced a general and nothing daunted at the considerable responsibility which he was about to incur he marched sturdily out of the barrackyard at the head of his party consisting of twenty lightinfantry men and a tall grenadier sergeant selected expressly by my father for the soldierlike qualities which he possessed to accompany his son on this his first expedition so out of the barrackyard with something of an air marched my dear brother his single drum and fife playing the inspiring old melody marlbrouk is gone to the wars hell never return no more i soon missed my brother for i was now alone with no being at all assimilating in age with whom i could exchange a word of late years from being almost constantly at school i had cast aside in a great degree my unsocial habits and natural reserve but in the desolate region in which we now were there was no school and i felt doubly the loss of my brother whom moreover i tenderly loved for his own sake books i had none at least such as i cared about and with respect to the old volume the wonders of which had first beguiled me into common reading i had so frequently pored over its pages that i had almost got its contents by heart i was therefore in danger of falling into the same predicament as murtagh becoming frighted from having nothing to do nay i had not even his resources i cared not for cards even if i possessed them and could find people disposed to play with them however i made the most of circumstances and roamed about the desolate fields and bogs in the neighbourhood sometimes entering the cabins of the peasantry with a gods blessing upon you good people where i would take my seat on the strangers stone at the corner of the hearth and looking them full in the face would listen to the carles and carlines talking irish ah that irish how frequently do circumstances at first sight the most trivial and unimportant exercise a mighty and permanent influence on our habits and pursuitshow frequently is a stream turned aside from its natural course by some little rock or knoll causing it to make an abrupt turn on a wild road in ireland i had heard irish spoken for the first time and i was seized with a desire to learn irish the acquisition of which in my case became the steppingstone to other languages i had previously learnt latin or rather lilly but neither latin nor lilly made me a philologist i had frequently heard french and other languages but had felt little desire to become acquainted with them and what it may be asked was there connected with the irish calculated to recommend it to my attention first of all and principally i believe the strangeness and singularity of its tones then there was something mysterious and uncommon associated with its use it was not a school language to acquire which was considered an imperative duty no no nor was it a drawingroom language drawled out occasionally in shreds and patches by the ladies of generals and other great dignitaries to the ineffable dismay of poor officers wives nothing of the kind but a speech spoken in outoftheway desolate places and in cutthroat kens where thirty ruffians at the sight of the kings minions would spring up with brandished sticks and an ubbubboo like the blowing up of a powdermagazine such were the points connected with the irish which first awakened in my mind the desire of acquiring it and by acquiring it i became as i have already said enamoured of languages having learnt one by chance i speedily as the reader will perceive learnt others some of which were widely different from irish ah that irish i am much indebted to it in more ways than one but i am afraid i have followed the way of the world which is very much wont to neglect original friends and benefactors i frequently find myself at present turning up my nose at irish when i hear it in the street yet i have still a kind of regard for it the fine old language a labhair padruic ninsefail nan riogh one of the most peculiar features of this part of ireland is the ruined castles which are so thick and numerous that theface of the country appears studded with them it being difficult to choose any situation from which one at least may not be descried they are of various ages and styles of architecture some of great antiquity like the stately remains which crown the crag of cashel others built by the early english conquerors others and probably the greater part erections of the times of elizabeth and cromwell the whole speaking monuments of the troubled and insecure state of the country from the most remote periods to a comparatively modern time from the windows of the room where i slept i had a view of one of these old placesan indistinct one it is true the distance being too great to permit me to distinguish more than the general outline i had an anxious desire to explore it it stood to the southeast in which direction however a black bog intervened which had more than once baffled all my attempts to cross it one morning however when the sun shone brightly upon the old building it appeared so near that i felt ashamed at not being able to accomplish a feat seemingly so easy i determined therefore upon another trial i reached the bog and was about to venture upon its black surface and to pick my way amongst its innumerable holes yawning horribly and half filled with water black as soot when it suddenly occurred to me that there was a road to the south by following which i might find a more convenient route to the object of my wishes the event justified my expectations for after following the road for some three miles seemingly in the direction of the devils mountain i suddenly beheld the castle on my left i diverged from the road and crossing two or three fields came to a small grassy plain in the midst of which stood the castle about a gunshot to the south was a small village which had probably in ancient days sprung up beneath its protection a kind of awe came over me as i approached the old building the sun no longer shone upon it and it looked so grim so desolate and solitary and here was i in that wild country alone with that grim building before me the village was within sight it is true but it might be a village of the dead for what i knew no sound issued from it no smoke was rising from its roofs neither man nor beast was visible no life no motionit looked as desolate as the castle itself yet i was bent on the adventure and moved on towards the castle across the green plain occasionally casting a startled glance around me and now i was close to it it was surrounded by a quadrangular wall about ten feet in height with a square tower at each corner at first i could discover no entrance walking round however to the northern side i found a wide and lofty gateway with a tower above it similar to those at the angles of the wall on this side the ground sloped gently down towards the bog which was here skirted by an abundant growth of copsewood and a few evergreen oaks i passed through the gateway and found myself within a square enclosure of about two acres on one side rose a round and lofty keep or donjon with a conical roof part of which had fallen down strewing the square with its ruins close to the keep on the other side stood the remains of an oblong house built something in the modern style with various windowholes nothing remained but the bare walls and a few projecting stumps of beams which seemed to have been half burnt the interior of the walls was blackened as if by fire fire also appeared at one time to have raged out of the windowholes for the outside about them was black portentously so i wonder what has been going on here i exclaimed there were echoes along the walls as i walked about the court i entered the keep by a low and frowning doorway the lower floor consisted of a large dungeonlike room with a vaulted roof on the left hand was a winding staircase in the thickness of the wall it looked anything but inviting yet i stole softly up my heart beating on the top of the first flight of stairs was an arched doorway to the left was a dark passage to the right stairs leading still higher i stepped under the arch and found myself in an apartment somewhat similar to the one below but higher there was an object at the farther end an old woman at least eighty was seated on a stone cowering over a few sticks burning feebly on what had once been a right noble and cheerful hearth her sideglance was towards the doorway as i entered for she had heard my footsteps i stood suddenly still and her haggard glance rested on my face is this your house mother i at length demanded in the language which i thought she would best understand yes my house my own house the house of the brokenhearted any other persons house i demanded my own house the beggars housethe

sunsetbagglefthanded hitterirish and supernaturalat swanton morley one morning i set out designing to pay a visit to my brother at the place where he was detached the distance was rather considerable yet i hoped to be back by evening fall for i was now a shrewd walker thanks to constant practice i set out early and directing my course towards the north i had in less than two hours accomplished considerably more than half of the journey the weather had been propitious a slight frost had rendered the ground firm to the tread and the skies were clear but now a change came over the scene the skies darkened and a heavy snowstorm came on the road then lay straight through a bog and was bounded by a deep trench on both sides i was making the best of my way keeping as nearly as i could in the middle of the road lest blinded by the snow which was frequently borne into my eyes by the wind i might fall into the dyke when all at once i heard a shout to windward and turning my eyes i saw the figure of a man and what appeared to be an animal of some kind coming across the bog with great speed in the direction of myself the nature of the ground seemed to offer but little impediment to these beings both clearing the holes and abysses which lay in their way with surprising agility the animal was however some slight way in advance and bounding over the dyke appeared on the road just before me it was a dog of what species i cannot tell never having seen the like before or since the head was large and round the ears so tiny as scarcely to be discernible the eyes of a fiery red in size it was rather small than large and the coat which was remarkably smooth as white as the falling flakes it placed itself directly in my path and showing its teeth and bristling its coat appeared determined to prevent my progress i had an ashen stick in my hand with which i threatened it this however only served to increase its fury it rushed upon me and i had the utmost difficulty to preserve myself from its fangs what are you doing with the dog the fairy dog said a man who at this time likewise cleared the dyke at a bound he was a very tall man rather well dressed as it should seem his garments however were like my own so covered with snow that i could scarcely discern their quality what are ye doing with the dog of peace i wish he would show himself one said i i said nothing to him but he placed himself in my road and would not let me pass of course he would not be letting you till he knew where ye were going hes not much of a fairy said i or he would know that without asking tell him that i am going to see my brother and who is your brother little sas what my father is a royal soldier oh ye are going then to the detachment at by my shoul i have a good mind to be spoiling your journey you are doing that already said i keeping me here talking about dogs and fairies you had better go home and get some salve to cure that place over your eye its catching cold youll be in so much snow on one side of the mans forehead there was a raw and staring wound as if from a recent and terrible blow faith then ill be going but its taking you wid me i will be and where will you take me why then to ryans castle little sas you do not speak the language very correctly said i it is not sas you should call metis sassanach and forthwith i accompanied the word with a speech full of flowers of irish rhetoric the man looked upon me for a moment fixedly then bending his head towards his breast he appeared to be undergoing a kind of convulsion which was accompanied by a sound something resembling laughter presently he looked at me and there was a broad grin on his features by my shoul its a thing of peace im thinking yebut now with a whisking sound came running down the road a hare it was nearly upon us before it perceived us suddenly stopping short however it sprang into the bog on the righthand side after it amain bounded the dog of peace followed by the man but not until he had nodded to me a farewell salutation in a few moments i lost sight of him amidst the snowflakes the weather was again clear and fine before i reached the place of detachment it was a little wooden barrack surrounded by a wall of the same material a sentinel stood at the gate i passed by him and entering the building found myself in a rude kind of guardroom several soldiers were lying asleep on a wooden couch at one end others lounged on benches by the side of a turf fire the tall sergeant stood before the fire holding a cooking utensil in his left hand on seeing me he made the military salutation is my brother here said i rather timidly dreading to hear that he was out perhaps for the day the ensign is in his room sir said bagg i am now preparing his meal which will presently be ready you will find the ensign above stairs and he pointed to a broken ladder which led to some place above and there i found himthe boy soldierin a kind of upper loft so low that i could touch with my hands the sooty rafters the floor was of rough boards through the joints of which you could see the gleam of the soldiers fire and occasionally discern their figures as they moved about in one corner was a camp bedstead by the side of which hung the childs sword gorget and sash a deal table stood in the proximity of the rusty grate where smoked and smouldered a pile of black turf from the boga deal table without a piece of baize to cover it yet fraught with things not devoid of interest a bible given by a mother the odyssey the greek odyssey a flute with broad silver keys crayons moreover and water colours and a sketch of a wild prospect near which though but half finished afforded ample proof of the excellence and skill of the boyish hand now occupied upon it ah he was a sweet being that boy soldier a plant of early promise bidding fair to become in after time all that is great good and admirable i have read of a remarkable welshman of whom it was said when the grave closed over him that he could frame a harp and play it build a ship and sail it compose an ode and set it to music a brave fellow that son of walesbut i had once a brother who could do more and better than this but the grave has closed over him as over the gallant welshman of yore there are now but two that remember himthe one who bore him and the being who was nurtured at the same breast he was taken and i was lefttruly the ways of providence are inscrutable you seem to be very comfortable john said i looking around the room and at the various objects which i have described above you have a good roof over your head and have all your things about you yes i am very comfortable george in many respects i am moreover independent and feel myself a man for the first time in my lifeindependent did i saythats not the word i am something much higher than that here am i not sixteen yet a person in authority like the centurion in the book there with twenty englishmen under me worth a whole legion of his men and that fine fellow bagg to wait upon me and take my orders oh these last six weeks have passed like hours of heaven but your time must frequently hang heavy on your hands this is a strange wild place and you must be very solitary i am never solitary i have as you see all my things about me and there is plenty of company below stairs not that i mix with the soldiers if i did goodbye to my authority but when i am alone i can hear all their discourse through the planks and i often laugh to myself at the funny things they say and have you any acquaintance here the very best much better than the colonel and the rest at their grand templemore i had never so many in my whole life before one has just left me a gentleman who lives at a distance across the bog he comes to talk with me about greek and the odyssey for he is a very learned man and understands the old irish and various other strange languages he has had a dispute with bagg on hearing his name he called him to him and after looking at him for some time with great curiosity said that he was sure he was a dane bagg however took the compliment in dudgeon and said that he was no more a dane than himself but a trueborn englishman and a sergeant of six years standing and what other acquaintance have you all kinds the whole neighbourhood cant make enough of me amongst others theres the clergyman of the parish and his family such a venerable old man such fine sons and daughters i am treated by them like a son and brotheri might be always with them if i pleased theres one drawback however in going to see them theres a horrible creature in the house a kind of tutor whom they keep more from charity than anything else he is a papist and they say a priest you should see him scowl sometimes at my red coat for he hates the king and not unfrequently when the kings health is drunk curses him between his teeth i once got up to strike him but the youngest of the sisters who is the handsomestcaught my arm and pointed to her forehead and what does your duty consist of have you nothing else to do than pay visits and receive them we do what is required of us we guard this edifice perform our evolutions and help the excise i am frequently called up in the dead of night to go to some wild place or other in quest of an illicit still this last part of our duty is poor mean work i dont like it nor more does bagg though without it we should not see much active service for the neighbourhood is quiet save the poor creatures with their stills not a soul is stirring tis true theres jerry grant and who is jerry grant did you never hear of him thats strange the whole country is talking about him he is a kind of outlaw rebel or robber all three i daresay theres a hundred pounds offered for his head and where does he live his proper home they say is in the queens county where he has a band but he is a strange fellow fond of wandering about by himself amidst the bogs and mountains and living in the old castles occasionally he quarters himself in the peasants houses who let him do just what he pleases he is free of his money and often does them good turns and can be goodhumoured enough so they dont dislike him then he is what they call a fairy man a person in league with fairies and spirits and able to work much harm by supernatural means on which account they hold him in great awe he is moreover a mighty strong and tall fellow bagg has seen him has he yes and felt him he too is a strange one a few days ago he was told that grant had been seen hovering about an old castle some two miles off in the bog so one afternoon what does he do but without saying a word to mefor which by the bye i ought to put him under arrest though what i should do without bagg i have no idea whateverwhat does he do but walk off to the castle intending as i suppose to pay a visit to jerry he had some difficulty in getting there on account of the turfholes in the bog which he was not accustomed to however thither at last he got and went in it was a strange lonesome place he says and he did not much like the look of it however in he went and searched about from the bottom to the top and down again but could find no one he shouted and hallooed but nobody answered save the rooks and choughs which started up in great numbers i have lost my trouble said bagg and left the castle it was now late in the afternoon near sunset when about half way over the bog he met a man and that man was jerry grant theres no doubt of it bagg says it was the most sudden thing in the world he was moving along making the best of his way thinking of nothing at all save a publichouse at swanton morley which he intends to take when he gets home and the regiment is disbandedthough i hope that will not be for some time yet he had just leaped a turfhole and was moving on when at the distance of about six yards before him he saw a fellow coming straight towards him bagg says that he stopped short as suddenly as if he had heard the word halt when marching at double quick time it was quite a surprise he says and he cant imagine how the fellow was so close upon him before he was aware he was an immense tall fellowbagg thinks at least two inches taller than himselfvery well dressed in a blue coat and buff breeches for all the world like a squire when going out hunting bagg however saw at once that he had a roguish air and he was on his guard in a moment good evening to ye sodger says the fellow stepping close up to bagg and staring him in the face good evening to you sir i hope you are well says bagg you are looking after some one says the fellow just so sir says bagg and forthwith seized him by the collar the man laughed bagg says it was such a strange awkward laugh do you know whom you have got hold of sodger says he i believe i do sir said bagg and in that belief will hold you fast in the name of king george and the quarter sessions the next moment he was sprawling with his heels in the air bagg says there was nothing remarkable in that he was only flung by a kind of wrestling trick which he could easily have baffled had he been aware of it you will not do that again sir said he as he got up and put himself on his guard the fellow laughed again more strangely and awkwardly than before then bending his body and moving his head from one side to the other as a cat does before she springs and crying out heres for ye sodger he made a dart at bagg rushing in with his head foremost that will do sir says bagg and drawing himself back he put in a lefthanded blow with all the force of his body and arm just over the fellows right eyebagg is a lefthanded hitter you must knowand it was a blow of that kind which won him his famous battle at edinburgh with the big highland sergeant bagg says that he was quite satisfied with the blow more especially when he saw the fellow reel fling out his arms and fall to the ground and now sir said he ill make bold to hand you over to the quarter sessions and if there is a hundred pounds for taking you who has more right to it than myself so he went forward but ere he could lay hold of his man the other was again on his legs and was prepared to renew the combat they grappled each otherbagg says he had not much fear of the result as he now felt himself the best man the other seeming half stunned with the blowbut just then there came on a blast a horrible roaring wind bearing night upon its wings snow and sleet and hail bagg says he had the fellow by the throat quite fast as he thought but suddenly he becamebewildered and knew not where he was and the man seemed to melt away from his grasp and the wind howled more and more and the night poured down darker and darker the snow and the sleet thicker and more blinding lord have mercy upon us said bagg myself a strange adventure that it is well that bagg got home alive john he says that the fight was a fair fight and that the fling he got was a fair fling the result of a common enough wrestling trick but with respect to the storm which rose up just in time to save the fellow he is of opinion that it was not fair but something irish and supernatural myself i dare say hes right i have read of witchcraft in the bible john he wishes much to have one more encounter with the fellow he says that on fair ground and in fine weather he has no doubt that he could master him and hand him over to the quarter sessions he says that a hundred pounds would be no bad thing to be disbanded upon for he wishes to take an inn at swanton morley keep a cockpit and live respectably myself he is quite right and now kiss me my darling brother for i must go back through the bog to templemorechapter xiii groom and cobstrength and symmetrywheres the saddlethe first rideno more fatiguelove for horses pursuit of wordsphilologist and pegasusthe smithwhat more agrahsassanach ten pence and it came to pass that as i was standing by the door of the barrack stable one of the grooms came out to me saying i say young gentleman i wish you would give the cob a breathing this fine morning why do you wish me to mount him said i you know he is dangerous i saw him fling you off his back only a few days ago why thats the very thing master id rather see anybody on his back than myself he does not like me but to them he does he can be as gentle as a lamb but suppose said i that he should not like me we shall soon see that master said the groom and if so be he shows temper i will be the first to tell you to get down but theres no fear of that you have never angered or insulted him and to such as you i say again hell be as gentle as a lamb and how came you to insult him said i knowing his temper as you do merely through forgetfulness master i was riding him about a month ago and having a stick in my hand i struck him thinking i was on another horse or rather thinking of nothing at all he has never forgiven me though before that time he was the only friend i had in the world i should like to see you on him master i should soon be off him i cant ride then you are all right master theres no fear trust him for not hurting a young gentleman an officers son who cant ride if you were a blackguard dragoon indeed with long spurs twere another thing as it is hell treat you as if he were the elder brother that loves you ride hell soon teach you to ride if you leave the matter with him hes the best riding master in all ireland and the gentlest the cob was led forth what a tremendous creature i had frequently seen him before and wondered at him he was barely fifteen hands but he had the girth of a metropolitan drayhorse his head was small in comparison with his immense neck which curved down nobly to his wide back his chest was broad and fine and his shoulders models of symmetry and strength he stood well and powerfully upon his legs which were somewhat short in a word he was a gallant specimen of the genuine irish cob a species at one time not uncommon but at the present day nearly extinct there said the groom as he looked at him halfadmiringly half sorrowfully with sixteen stone on his back hell trot fourteen miles in one hour with your nine stone some two and a half more ay and clear a sixfoot wall at the end of it im half afraid said i i had rather you would ride him id rather so too if he would let me but he remembers the blow now dont be afraid young master hes longing to go out himself hes been trampling with his feet these three days and i know what that means hell let anybody ride him but myself and thank them but to me he says no you struck me but said i wheres the saddle never mind the saddle if you are ever to be a frank rider you must begin without a saddle besides if he felt a saddle he would think you dont trust him and leave you to yourself now before you mount make his acquaintancesee there how he kisses you and licks your face and see how he lifts his foot thats to shake hands you may trust him now you are on his back at last mind how you hold the bridlegently gently its not four pair of hands like yours can hold him if he wishes to be off mind what i tell youleave it all to him off went the cob at a slow and gentle trot too fast however for so inexperienced a rider i soon felt myself sliding off the animal perceived it too and instantly stood stone still till i had righted myself and now the groom came up when you feel yourself going said he dont lay hold of the mane thats no use mane never yet saved man from falling no more than straw from drowning its his sides you must cling to with your calves and feet till you learn to balance yourself thats it now abroad with you ill bet my comrade a pot of beer that youll be a regular rough rider by the time you come back and so it proved i followed the directions of the groom and the cob gave me every assistance how easy is riding afterthe first timidity is got over to supple and youthful limbs and there is no second fear the creature soon found that the nerves of his rider were in proper tone turning his head half round he made a kind of whining noise flung out a little foam and set off in less than two hours i had made the circuit of the devils mountain and was returning along the road bathed with perspiration but screaming with delight the cob laughing in his equine way scattering foam and pebbles to the left and right and trotting at the rate of sixteen miles an hour oh that ride that first ridemost truly it was an epoch in my existence and i still look back to it with feelings of longing and regret people may talk of first loveit is a very agreeable event i dare saybut give me the flush and triumph and glorious sweat of a first ride like mine on the mighty cob my whole frame was shaken it is true and during one long week i could hardly move foot or hand but what of that by that one trial i had become free as i may say of the whole equine species no more fatigue no more stiffness of joints after that first ride round the devils hill on the cob oh that cob that irish cobmay the sod lie lightly over the bones of the strongest speediest and most gallant of its kind oh the days when issuing from the barrackgate of templemore we commenced our hurryskurry just as inclination lednow across the fieldsdirect over stone walls and running brooksmere pastime for the cob sometimes along the road to thurles and holy cross even to distant cahirwhat was distance to the cob it was thus that the passion for the equine race was first awakened within mea passion which up to the present time has been rather on the increase than diminishing it is no blind passion the horse being a noble and generous creature intended by the allwise to be the helper and friend of man to whom he stands next in the order of creation on many occasions of my life i have been much indebted to the horse and have found in him a friend and coadjutor when human help and sympathy were not to be obtained it is therefore natural enough that i should love the horse but the love which i entertain for him has always been blended with respect for i soon perceived that though disposed to be the friend and helper of man he is by no means inclined to be his slave in which respect he differs from the dog who will crouch when beaten whereas the horse spurns for he is aware of his own worth and that he carries death within the horn of his heel if therefore i found it easy to love the horse i found it equally natural to respect him i much question whether philology or the passion for languages requires so little of an apology as the love for horses it has been said i believe that the more languages a man speaks the more a man is he which is very true provided he acquires languages as a medium for becoming acquainted with the thoughts and feelings of the various sections into which the human race is divided but in that case he should rather be termed a philosopher than a philologistbetween which two the difference is wide indeed an individual may speak and read a dozen languages and yet be an exceedingly poor creature scarcely half a man and the pursuit of tongues for their own sake and the mere satisfaction of acquiring them surely argues an intellect of a very low order a mind disposed to be satisfied with mean and grovelling things taking more pleasure in the trumpery casket than in the precious treasure which it contains in the pursuit of words than in the acquisition of ideas i cannot help thinking that it was fortunate for myself who am to a certain extent a philologist that with me the pursuit of languages has been always modified by the love of horses for scarcely had i turned my mind to the former when i also mounted the wild cob and hurried forth in the direction of the devils hill scattering dust and flintstones on every side that ride amongst other things taught me that a lad with thews and sinews was intended by nature for something better than mere wordculling and if i have accomplished anything in after life worthy of mentioning i believe it may partly be attributed to the ideas which that ride by setting my blood in a glow infused into my brain i might otherwise have become a mere philologist one of those beings who toil night and day in culling useless words for some opus magnum which murray will never publish and nobody ever read beings without enthusiasm who having never mounted a generous steed cannot detect a good point in pegasus himself like a certain philologist who though acquainted with the exact value of every word in the greek and latin languages could observe no particular beauty in one of the most glorious of homers rhapsodies what knew he of pegasus he had never mounted a generous steed the merest jockey had the strain been interpreted to him would have called it a brave songi return to the brave cob on a certain day i had been out on an excursion in a crossroad at some distance from the satanic hill the animal which i rode cast a shoe by good luck a small village was at hand at the entrance of which was a large shed from which proceeded a most furious noise of hammering leading the cob by the bridle i entered boldly shoe this horse and do it quickly a gough said i to a wild grimy figure of a man whom i found alone fashioning a piece of iron arrigod yuit said the fellow desisting from his work and staring at me o yes i have money said i and of the best and i pulled out an english shilling tabhair chugam said the smith stretching out his grimy hand no i shant said i some people are glad to get their money when their work is donethe fellow hammered a little longer and then proceeded to shoe the cob after having first surveyed it with attention he performed his job rather roughly and more than once appeared to give the animal unnecessary pain frequently making use of loud and boisterous words by the time the work was done the creature was in a state of high excitement and plunged and tore the smith stood at a short distance seeming to enjoy the irritation of the animal and showing in a remarkable manner a huge fang which projected from the under jaw of a very wry mouth you deserve better handling said i as i went up to the cob and fondled it whereupon it whinnied and attempted to touch my face with its nose are ye not afraid of that beast said the smith showing his fang arrah its vicious that he looks its at you theni dont fear him and thereupon i passed under the horse between his hind legs and is that all you can do agrah said the smith no said i i can ride him ye can ride him and what else agrah i can leap him over a sixfoot wall said i over a wall and what more agrah nothing more said i what more would you have can you do this agrah said the smith and he uttered a word which i had never heard before in a sharp pungent tone the effect upon myself was somewhat extraordinary a strange thrill ran through me but with regard to the cob it was terrible the animal forthwith became like one mad and reared and kicked with the utmost desperation can you do that agrah said the smith what is it said i retreating i never saw the horse so before go between his legs

openthe bookstalla portraita banished priest from the wild scenes which i have attempted to describe in the latter pages i must now transport the reader to others of a widely different character he must suppose himself no longer in ireland but in the eastern corner of merry england bogs ruins and mountains have disappeared amidst the vapours of the west i have nothing more to say of them the region in which we are now is not famous for objects of that kind perhaps it flatters itself that it can produce fairer and better things of some of which let me speak there is a fine old city before us and first of that let me speak a fine old city truly is that view it from whatever side you will but it shows best from the east where the ground bold and elevated overlooks the fair and fertile valley in which it stands gazing from those heights the eye beholds a scene which cannot fail to awaken even in the least sensitive bosom feelings of pleasure and admiration at the foot of the heights flows a narrow and deep river with an antique bridge communicating with a long and narrow suburb flanked on either side by rich meadows of the brightest green beyond which spreads the city the fine old city perhaps the most curious specimen at present extant of the genuine old english town yes there it spreads from north to south with its venerable houses its numerous gardens its thrice twelve churches its mighty mound which if tradition speaks true was raised by human hands to serve as the grave heap of an old heathen king who sits deep within it with his sword in his hand and his gold and silver treasures about him there is a grey old castle upon the top of that mighty mound and yonder rising three hundred feet above the soil from among those noble forest trees behold that old norman masterwork that cloudencircled cathedral spire around which a garrulous army of rooks and choughs continually wheel their flight now who can wonder that the children of that fine old city are proud of her and offer up prayers for her prosperity i myself who was not born within her walls offer up prayers for her prosperity that want may never visit her cottages vice her palaces and that the abomination of idolatry may never pollute her temples ha idolatry the reign of idolatry has been over there for many a long year never more let us hope to return brave hearts in that old town have borne witness against it and sealed their testimony with their hearts bloodmost precious to the lord is the blood of his saints we are not far from hallowed ground observe ye not yon chalky precipice to the right of the norman bridge on this side of the stream upon its brow is a piece of ruined wall the last relic of what was of old a stately pile whilst at its foot is a place called the lollards hole and with good reason for many a saint of god has breathed his last beneath that white precipice bearing witness against popish idolatry midst flame and pitch many a grisly procession has advanced along that suburb across the old bridge towards the lollards hole furious priests in front a calm pale martyr in the midst a pitying multitude behind it has had its martyrs the venerable old town ah there is good blood in that old city and in the whole circumjacent region of which it is the capital the angles possessed the land at an early period which however they were eventually compelled to share with hordes of danes and northmen who flocked thither across the sea to found hearthsteads on its fertile soil the present race a mixture of angles and danes still preserve much which speaks strongly of their northern ancestry amongst them ye will find the lightbrown hair of the north the strong and burly forms of the north many a wild superstition ay and many a wild name connected with the ancient history of the north and its sublime mythology the warm heart and the strong heart of the old danes and saxons still beat in those regions and there ye will find if anywhere old northern hospitality and kindness of manner united with energy perseverance and dauntless intrepidity better soldiers or mariners never bled in their countrys battles than those nurtured in those regions and within those old walls it was yonder to the west that the great naval hero of britain first saw the light he who annihilated the sea pride of spain and dragged the humbled banner of france in triumph at his stern he was born yonder towards the west and of him there is a glorious relic in that old town in its dark flint guildhouse the roof of which you can just descry rising above that maze of buildings in the upper hall of justice is a species of glass shrine in which the relic is to be seen a sword of curious workmanship the blade is of keen toledan steel the heft of ivory and motherofpearl tis the sword of cordova won in bloodiest fray off saint vincents promontory and presented by nelson to the old capital of the muchloved land of his birth yes the proud spaniards sword is to be seen in yonder guildhouse in the glass case affixed to the wall many other relics has the good old town but none prouder than the spaniards sword such was the place to which when the war was over my father retired it was here that the old tired soldier set himself down with his little family he had passed the greater part of his life in meritorious exertion in the service of his country and his chief wish now was to spend the remainder of his days in quiet and respectability his means it is true were not very ample fortunate it was that his desires corresponded with them with a small fortune of his own and with his halfpay as a royal soldier he had no fears for himself or for his faithful partner and helpmate but then his children how was he to provide for them how launch them upon the wide ocean of the world this was perhaps the only thought which gave him uneasiness and i believe that many an old retired officer at that time and under similar circumstances experienced similar anxiety had the war continued their children would have been of course provided for in the army but peace now reigned and the military career was closed to all save the scions of the aristocracy or those who were insome degree connected with that privileged order an advantage which few of these old officers could boast of they had slight influence with the great who gave themselves very little trouble either about them or their families i have been writing to the duke said my father one day to my excellent mother after we had been at home somewhat better than a year i have been writing to the duke of york about a commission for that eldest boy of ours he however affords me no hopes he says that his list is crammed with names and that the greater number of the candidates have better claims than my son i do not see how that can be said my mother nor do i replied my father i see the sons of bankers and merchants gazetted every month and i do not see what claims they have to urge unless they be golden ones however i have not served my king fifty years to turn grumbler at this time of life i suppose that the people at the head of affairs know what is most proper and convenient perhaps when the lad sees how difficult nay how impossible it is that he should enter the army he will turn his mind to some other profession i wish he may i think he has already said my mother you see how fond he is of the arts of drawing and painting and as far as i can judge what he has already done is very respectable his mind seems quite turned that way and i heard him say the other day that he would sooner be a michael angelo than a general officer but you are always talking of him what do you think of doing with the other child what indeed said my father that is a consideration which gives me no little uneasiness i am afraid it will be much more difficult to settle him in life than his brother what is he fitted for even were it in my power to provide for him god help the child i bear him no illwill on the contrary all love and affection but i cannot shut my eyes there is something so strange about him how he behaved in ireland i sent him to school to learn greek and he picked up irish and greek as well said my mother i heard him say the other day that he could read st john in the original tongue you will find excuses for him i know said my father you tell me i am always thinking of my firstborn i might retort by saying you are always thinking of the other but it is the way of women always to side with the secondborn theres whats her name in the bible by whose wiles the old blind man was induced to give to his second son the blessing which was the birthright of the other i wish i had been in his place i should not have been so easily deceived no disguise would ever have caused me to mistake an impostor for my firstborn though i must say for this boy that he is nothing like jacob he is neither smooth nor sleek and though my secondborn he is already taller and larger than his brother just so said my mother his brother would make a far better jacob than he i will hear nothing against my firstborn said my father even in the way of insinuation he is my joy and pride the very image of myself in my youthful days long before i fought big ben though perhaps not quite so tall or strong built as for the other god bless the child i love him im sure but i must be blind not to see the difference between him and his brother why he has neither my hair nor my eyes and then his countenance why tis absolutely swarthy god forgive me i had almost said like that of a gypsy but i have nothing to say against that the boy is not to be blamed for the colour of his face nor for his hair and eyes but then his ways and mannersi confess i do not like them and that they give me no little uneasinessi know that he kept very strange company when he was in ireland people of evil report of whom terrible things were saidhorsewitches and the like i questioned him once or twice upon the matter and even threatened him but it was of no use he put on a look as if he did not understand me a regular irish look just such a one as those rascals assume when they wish to appear all innocence and simplicity and they full of malice and deceit all the time i dont like them they are no friends to old england or its old king god bless him they are not good subjects and never were always in league with foreign enemies when i was in the coldstream long before the revolution i used to hear enough about the irish brigades kept by the french kings to be a thorn in the side of the english whenever opportunity served old sergeant meredith once told me that in the time of the pretender there were always in london alone a dozen of fellows connected with these brigades with the view of seducing the kings soldiers from their allegiance and persuading them to desert to france to join the honest irish as they were called one of these traitors once accosted him and proposed the matter to him offering handfuls of gold if he could induce any of his comrades to go over meredith appeared to consent but secretly gave information to his colonel the fellow was seized and certain traitorous papers found upon him he was hanged before newgate and died exulting in his treason his name was michael nowlan that ever son of mine should have been intimate with the papist irish and have learnt their language but he thinks of other things now said my mother other languages you mean said my father it is strange that he has conceived such a zest for the study of languages no sooner did he come home than he persuaded me to send him to that old priest to learn french and italian and if i remember right you abetted him but as i said before it is in the nature of women invariably to take the part of the secondborn well there is no harm in learning french and italian perhaps much good in his case as they may drive theother tongue out of his head irish why he might go to the university but for that but how would he look when on being examined with respect to his attainments it was discovered that he understood irish how did you learn it they would ask him how did you become acquainted with the language of papists and rebels the boy would be sent away in disgrace be under no apprehension i have no doubt that he has long since forgotten it i am glad to hear it said my father for between ourselves i love the poor child ay quite as well as my firstborn i trust they will do well and that god will be their shield and guide i have no doubt he will for i have read something in the bible to that effect what is that text about the young ravens being fed i know a better than that said my mother one of davids own words i have been young and now am grown old yet never have i seen the righteous man forsaken or his seed begging their bread i have heard talk of the pleasures of idleness yet it is my own firm belief that no one ever yet took pleasure in it mere idleness is the most disagreeable state of existence and both mind and body are continually making efforts to escape from it it has been said that idleness is the parent of mischief which is very true but mischief itself is merely an attempt to escape from the dreary vacuum of idleness there are many tasks and occupations which a man is unwilling to perform but let no one think that he is therefore in love with idleness he turns to something which is more agreeable to his inclination and doubtless more suited to his nature but he is not in love with idleness a boy may play the truant from school because he dislikes books and study but depend upon it he intends doing something the whileto go fishing or perhaps to take a walk and who knows but that from such excursions both his mind and body may derive more benefit than from books and school many people go to sleep to escape from idleness the spaniards do and according to the french account john bull the squire hangs himself in the month of november but the french who are a very sensible people attribute the action à une grande envie de se désennuyer he wishes to be doing something say they and having nothing better to do he has recourse to the cord it was for want of something better to do that shortly after my return home i applied myself to the study of languages by the acquisition of irish with the first elements of which i had become acquainted under the tuition of murtagh i had contracted a certain zest and inclination for the pursuit yet it is probable that had i been launched about this time into some agreeable career that of arms for example for which being the son of a soldier i had as was natural a sort of penchant i might have thought nothing more of the acquisition of tongues of any kind but having nothing to do i followed the only course suited to my genius which appeared open to me so it came to pass that one day whilst wandering listlessly about the streets of the old town i came to a small bookstall and stopping commenced turning over the books i took up at least a dozen and almost instantly flung them down what were they to me at last coming to a thick volume i opened it and after inspecting its contents for a few minutes i paid for it what was demanded and forthwith carried it home it was a tessaraglot grammar a strange old book printed somewhere in holland which pretended to be an easy guide to the acquirement of the french italian low dutch and english tongues by means of which any one conversant in any one of these languages could make himself master of the other three i turned my attention to the french and italian the old book was not of much value i derived some benefit from it however and conning it intensely at the end of a few weeks obtained some insight into the structure of these two languages at length i had learnt all that the book was capable of informing me yet was still far from the goal to which it had promised to conduct me i wish i had a master i exclaimed and the master was at hand in an old court of the old town lived a certain elderly personage perhaps sixty or thereabouts he was rather tall and something of a robust make with a countenance in which bluffness was singularly blended with vivacity and grimace and with a complexion which would have been ruddy but for a yellow hue which rather predominated his dress consisted of a snuffcoloured coat and drab pantaloons the former evidently seldom subjected to the annoyance of a brush and the latter exhibiting here and there spots of something which if not grease bore a strong resemblance to it add to these articles an immense frill seldom of the purest white but invariably of the finest french cambric and you have some idea of his dress he had rather a remarkable stoop but his step was rapid and vigorous and as he hurried along the streets he would glance to the right and left with a pair of big eyes like plums and on recognizing any one would exalt a pair of grizzled eyebrows and slightly kiss a tawny and ungloved hand at certain hours of the day he might be seen entering the doors of female boardingschools generally with a book in his hand and perhaps another just peering from the orifice of a capacious back pocket and at a certain season of the year he might be seen dressed in white before the altar of a certain small popish chapel chanting from the breviary in very intelligible latin or perhaps reading from the desk in utterly unintelligible english such was my preceptor in the french and italian tongues exul sacerdos vone banished priest i came into england twentyfive years ago my dearchapter xv monsieur dantecondemned musketsportingsweet rivuletthe earls homethe poolthe sonorous voice what dost thou readman of peacezohar and mishnamoney changers so i studied french and italian under the tuition of the banished priest to whose house i went regularly every evening to receive instruction i made considerable progress in the acquisition of the two languages i found the french by far the most difficult chiefly on account of the accent which my master himself possessed in no great purity being a norman by birth the italian was my favourite vous serez un jour un grand philologue mon cher said the old man on our arriving at the conclusion of dantes hell i hope i shall be something better said i before i die or i shall have lived to little purpose thats true my dear philologistone small poor dog what would you wish to be many things sooner than that for example i would rather be like him who wrote this book quoi monsieur dante he was a vagabond my dear forced to fly from his country no my dear if you would be like one poet be like monsieur boileau he is the poet i dont think so how not think so he wrote very respectable verses lived and died much respected by everybody tother one bad dog forced to fly from his countrydied with not enough to pay his undertaker were you not forced to flee from your country that very true but there is much difference between me and this dante he fled from country because he had one bad tongue which he shook at his betters i fly because benefice gone and head going not on account of the badness of my tongue well said i you can return now the bourbons are restored i find myself very well here not bad country il est vrai que la france sera toujours la france but all are dead there who knew me i find myself very well here preach in popish chapel teach schismatic that is protestant child tongues and literature i find myself very well and why because i know how to govern my tongue never call people hard names ma foi il y a beaucoup de différence entre moi et ce sacre de dante under this old man who was well versed in the southern languages besides studying french and italian i acquired some knowledge of spanish but i did not devote my time entirely to philology i had other pursuits i had not forgotten the roving life i had led in former days nor its delights neither was i formed by nature to be a pallid indoor student no no i was fond of other and i say it boldly better things than study i had an attachment to the angle ay and to the gun likewise in our house was a condemned musket bearing somewhere on its lock in rather antique characters tower with this weapon i had already in ireland performed some execution among the rooks and choughs and it was now again destined to be a source of solace and amusement to me in the winter season especially on occasions of severe frost when birds abounded sallying forth with it at these times far into the country i seldom returned at night without a string of bullfinches blackbirds and linnets hanging in triumph round my neck when i reflect on the immense quantity of powder and shot which i crammed down the muzzle of my uncouth fowlingpiece i am less surprised at the number of birds which i slaughtered than that i never blew my hands face and old honeycombed gun at one and the same time to pieces but the winter alas i speak as a fowler seldom lasts in england more than three or four months so during the rest of the year when not occupied with my philological studies i had to seek for other diversions i have already given a hint that i was also addicted to the angle of course there is no comparison between the two pursuits the rod and line seeming but very poor trumpery to one who has had the honour of carrying a noble firelock there is a time however for all things and we return to any favourite amusement with the greater zest from being compelled to relinquish it for a season so if i shot birds in winter with my firelock i caught fish in summer or attempted so to do with my angle i was not quite so successful it is true with the latter as with the former possibly because it afforded me less pleasure it was indeed too much of a listless pastime to inspire me with any great interest i not unfrequently fell into a doze whilst sitting on the bank and more than once let my rod drop from my hands into the water at some distance from the city behind a range of hilly ground which rises towards the southwest is a small river the waters of which after many meanderings eventually enter the principal river of the district and assist to swell the tidewhich it rolls down to the ocean it is a sweet rivulet and pleasant it is to trace its course from its springhead high up in the remote regions of eastern anglia till it arrives in the valley behind yon rising ground and pleasant is that valley truly a goodly spot but most lovely where yonder bridge crosses the little stream beneath its arch the waters rush garrulously into a blue pool and are there stilled for a time for the pool is deep and they appear to have sunk to sleep farther on however you hear their voice again where they ripple gaily over yon gravelly shallow on the left the hill slopes gently down to the margin of the stream on the right is a green level a smiling meadow grass of the richest decks the side of the slope mighty trees also adorn it giant elms the nearest of which when the sun is nigh its meridian fling a broad shadow upon the face of the pool through yon vista you catch a glimpse of the ancient brick of an old english hall it has a stately look that old building indistinctly seen as it is among those umbrageous trees you might almost suppose it an earls home and such it was or rather upon its site stood an earls home in days of old for there some old kemp some sigurd or thorkild roaming in quest of a hearthstead settled down in the gray old time when thor and freya were yet gods and odin was a portentous name yon old hall is still called the earls home though the hearth of sigurd is now no more and the bones of the old kemp and of sigrith his dame have been mouldering for a thousand years in some neighbouring knoll perhaps yonder where those tall norwegian pines shoot up so boldly into the air it is said that the old earls galley was once moored where is now that blue pool for the waters of that valley were not always sweet yon valley was once an arm of the sea a salt lagoon to which the warbarks of sigurd in search of a home found their way i was in the habit of spending many an hour on the banks of that rivulet with my rod in my hand and when tired with angling would stretch myself on the grass and gaze upon the waters as they glided past and not unfrequently divesting myself of my dress i would plunge into the deep pool which i have already mentioned for i had long since learned to swim and it came to pass that on one hot summers day after bathing in the pool i passed along the meadow till i came to a shallow part and wading over to the opposite side i adjusted my dress and commenced fishing in another pool beside which was a small clump of hazels and there i sat upon the bank at the bottom of the hill which slopes down from the earls home my float was on the waters and my back was towards the old hall i drew up many fish small and great which i took from off the hook mechanically and flung upon the bank for i was almost unconscious of what i was about for my mind was not with my fish i was thinking of my earlier yearsof the scottish crags and the heaths of irelandand sometimes my mind would dwell on my studieson the sonorous stanzas of dante rising and falling like the waves of the seaor would strive to remember a couplet or two of poor monsieur boileau canst thou answer to thy conscience for pulling all those fish out of the water and leaving them to gasp in the sun said a voice clear and sonorous as a bell i started and looked round close behind me stood the tall figure of a man dressed in raiment of quaint and singular fashion but of goodly materials he was in the prime and vigour of manhood his features handsome and noble but full of calmness and benevolence at least i thought so though they were somewhat shaded by a hat of finest beaver with broad drooping eaves surely that is a very cruel diversion in which thou indulgest my young friend he continued i am sorry for it if it be sir said i rising but i do not think it cruel to fish what are thy reasons for not thinking so fishing is mentioned frequently in scripture simon peter was a fisherman true and andrew and his brother but thou forgettest they did not follow fishing as a diversion as i fear thou doest thou readest the scriptures sometimes sometimesnot dailythat is to be regretted what profession dost thou makei mean to what religious denomination dost thou belong my young friend church it is a very good professionthere is much of scripture contained in its liturgy dost thou read aught beside the scriptures sometimes what dost thou read besidesgreek and dante indeed then thou hast the advantage over myself i can only read the former well i am rejoiced to find that thou hast other pursuits beside thy fishing dost thou know hebrew no thou shouldest study it why dost thou not undertake the study i have no books i will lend thee books if thou wish to undertake the study i live yonder at the hall as perhaps thou knowest i have a library there in which are many curious books both in greek and hebrew which i will show to thee whenever thou mayest find it convenient to come and see me farewell i am glad to find that thou hast pursuits more satisfactory than thy cruel fishing and the man of peace departed and left me on the bank of the stream whether from the effect of his words or from want of inclination to the sport i know not but from that day i became less and less a practitioner of that cruel fishing i rarely flung line and angle into the water but i not unfrequently wandered by the banks of the pleasant rivulet it seems singular to me on reflection that i never availed myself of his kind invitation i say singular for the extraordinary under whatever form had long had no slight interest for me and i had discernment enough to perceive that yon was no common man yet i went not near him certainly not from bashfulness or timidity feelings to which i had long been an entire stranger am i to regret this perhaps for i might have learned both wisdom and righteousness from those calm quiet lips and my aftercourse might have been widely different as it was i fell in with other guess companions from whom i received widely different impressions than those i might have derived from him when many years had rolled on long after i had attained manhood and had seen and suffered much and when our first interview had long since been effaced from the mind of the man of peace i visited him in his venerable hall and partook of the hospitality of his hearth and there i saw his gentle partner and his fair children and on the morrow he showed me the books of which he had spoken years before by the side of the stream in the low quiet chamber whose one window shaded by a gigantic elm looks down the slope towards the pleasant stream he took from the shelf his learned books zohar and mishna toldoth jesu and abarbenel i am fond of these studies said he which perhaps is not to be wondered at seeing that our people have been compared to the jews in one respect i confess we are similar to them we are fond of getting money i do not like this last author this abarbenel the worse for having been a moneychanger i am a banker myself as thou knowest and would there were many like him amidst the moneychangers of princes the hall of many an earl lacks the bounty the palace of many a prelate the piety and learning which adorn the quiet quakers homechapter xvi fair of horseslooks of respectthe fast trotterpair of eyesstrange menjasper your palforce of blood young lady with diamondsnot quite so beautiful i was standing on the castle hill in the midst of a fair of horses i have already had occasion to mention this castle it is the remains of what was once a norman stronghold and is perched upon a round mound or monticle in the midst of the old city steep is this mound and scarped evidently by the hand of man a deep gorge over which is flung a bridge separates it on the south from a broad swell of open ground called the hill of old the scene of many a tournament and feat of norman chivalry but now much used as a showplace for cattle where those who buy and sell beeves and other beasts resort at stated periods so it came to pass that i stood upon this hill observing a fair of horses the reader is already aware that i had long since conceived a passion for the equine race a passion in which circumstances had of late not permitted me to indulge i had no horses to ride but i took pleasure in looking at them and i had already attended more than one of these fairs the present was lively enough indeed horse fairs are seldom dull there was shouting and whooping neighing and braying there was galloping and trotting fellows with highlows and white stockings and with many a string dangling from the knees of their tight breeches were running desperately holding horses by the halter and in some cases dragging them along there were longtailed steeds and docktailed steeds of every degree and breed there were droves of wild ponies and long rows of sober cart horses there were donkeys and even mules the last rare things to be seen in damp misty england for the mule pines in mud and rain and thrives best with a hot sun above and a burning sand below there wereoh the gallant creatures i hear their neigh upon the wind there weregoodliest sight of allcertain enormous quadrupeds only seen to perfection in our native isle led about by dapper grooms their manes ribanded and their tails curiously clubbed and balled ha hahow distinctly do they say ha ha an old man draws nigh he is mounted on a lean pony and he leads by the bridle one of these animals nothing very remarkable about that creature unless in being smaller than the rest and gentle which they are not he is not of the sightliest look he is almost dun and over one eye a thick film has gathered but stay there is something remarkable about that horse there is something in his action in which he differs from all the rest as he advances the clamour is hushed all eyes are turned upon himwhat looks of interestof respectand what is this people are taking off their hatssurely not to that steed yes verily men especially old men are taking off their hats to that oneeyed steed and i hear more than one deepdrawn ah what horse is that said i to a very old fellow the counterpart of the old man on the pony save that the last wore a faded suit of velveteen and this one was dressed in a white frock the best in mother england said the very old man taking a knobbed stick from his mouth and looking me in the face at first carelessly but presently with something like interest he is old like myself but can still trot his twenty miles an hour you wont live long my swain tall and overgrown ones like thee never does yet if you should chance to reach my years you may boast to thy great grand boys thou hast seen marshland shales amain i did for the horse what i would neither do for earl or baron doffed my hat yes i doffed my hat to the wondrous horse the fast trotter the best in mother england and i too drew a deep ah and repeated the words of the old fellows around such a horse as this we shall never see again a pity that he is so old now during all this time i had a kind of consciousness that i had been the object of some persons observation that eyes were fastened upon me from somewhere in the crowd sometimes i thought myself watched from before sometimes from behind and occasionally methought that if i just turned my head to the right or left i should meet a peering and inquiring glance and indeed once or twice i did turn expecting to see somebody whom i knew yet always without success though it appeared to me that i was but a moment too late and that some one had just slipped away from the direction to which i turned like the figure in a magic lanthorn once i was quite sure that there were a pair of eyes glaring over my right shoulder my attention however was so fully occupied with the objects which i have attempted to describe that i thought very little of this coming and going this flitting and dodging of i knew not whom or what it was after all a matter of sheer indifference to me who was looking at me i could only wish whomsoever it might be to be more profitably employed so i continued enjoying what i saw and now there was a change in the scene the wondrous old horse departed with his aged guardian other objects of interest are at hand two or three men on horseback are hurrying through the crowd they are widely different in their appearance from the other people of the fair not so much in dress for they are clad something after the fashion of rustic jockeys but in their lookno light brown hair have they no ruddy cheeks no blue quiet glances belong to them their features are dark their locks long black and shining and their eyes are wild they are admirable horsemen but they do not sit the saddle in the manner of common jockeys they seem tofloat or hover upon it like gulls upon the waves two of them are mere striplings but the third is a very tall man with a countenance heroically beautiful but wild wild wild as they rush along the crowd give way on all sides and now a kind of ring or circus is formed within which the strange men exhibit their horsemanship rushing past each other in and out after the manner of a reel the tall man occasionally balancing himself upon the saddle and standing erect on one foot he had just regained his seat after the latter feat and was about to push his horse to a gallop when a figure started forward close from beside me and laying his hand on his neck and pulling him gently downward appeared to whisper something into his ear presently the tall man raised his head and scanning the crowd for a moment in the direction in which i was standing fixed his eyes full upon me and anon the countenance of the whisperer was turned but only in part and the sideglance of another pair of wild eyes was directed towards my face but the entire visage of the big black man half stooping as he was was turned full upon mine but now with a nod to the figure who had stopped him and with another inquiring glance at myself the big man once more put his steed into motion and after riding round the ring a few more times darted through a lane in the crowd and followed by his two companions disappeared whereupon the figure who had whispered to him and had subsequently remained in the middle of the space came towards me and cracking a whip which he held in his hand so loudly that the report was nearly equal to that of a pocket pistol he cried in a strange tone what the sapengro lor the sapengro upon the hill i remember that word said i and i almost think i remember you you cant be jasper your pal truth and no lie brother it is strange that you should have known me said i i am certain but for the word you used i should never have recognized you not so strange as you may think brother there is something in your face which would prevent people from forgetting you even though they might wish it and your face is not much altered since the time you wot of though you are so much grown i thought it was you but to make sure i dodged about inspecting you i believe you felt me though i never touched you a sign brother that we are akin that we are dui palortwo relations your blood beat when mine was near as mine always does at the coming of a brother and we became brothers in that lane and where are you staying said i in this town not in the town the like of us dont find it exactly wholesome to stay in towns we keep abroad but i have little to do herecome with me and ill show you where we stay we descended the hill in the direction of the north and passing along the suburb reached the old norman bridge which we crossed the chalk precipice with the ruin on its top was now before us but turning to the left we walked swiftly along and presently came to some rising ground which ascending we found ourselves upon a wild moor or heath you are one of them said i whom people call just so said jasper but never mind what people call us and that tall handsome man on the hill whom you whispered i suppose hes one of ye what is his name tawno chikno said jasper which means the small one we call him such because he is the biggest man of all our nation you say he is handsome that is not the word brother hes the beauty of the world women run wild at the sight of tawno an earls daughter near londona fine young lady with diamonds round her neckfell in love with tawno i have seen that lass on a heath as this may be kneel down to tawno clasp his feet begging to be his wifeor anything elseif she might go with him but tawno would have nothing to do with her i have a wife of my own said he a lawful rommany wife whom i love better than the whole world jealous though she sometimes be and is she very beautiful said i why you know brother beauty is frequently a matter of taste however as you ask my opinion i should say not quite so beautiful as himself we had now arrived at a small valley between two hills or downs the sides of which were covered with furze in the midst of this valley were various carts and low tents forming a rude kind of encampment several dark children were playing about who took no manner of notice of us as we passed one of the tents however a canvas screen was lifted up and a woman supported on a crutch hobbled out she was about the middle age and besides being lame was bitterly ugly she was very slovenly dressed and on her swarthy features ill nature was most visibly stamped she did not deign me a look but addressing jasper in a tongue which i did not understand appeared to put some eager questionsto him hes coming said jasper and passed on poor fellow said he to me he has scarcely been gone an hour and shes jealous already well he continued what do you think of her you have seen her now and can judge for yourselfthat ere woman is tawno chiknos wifechapter xvii the tentspleasant

romanly we went to the farthest of the tents which stood at a slight distance from the rest and which exactly resembled the one which i have described on a former occasion we went in and sat down one on each side of a small fire which was smouldering on the ground there was no one else in the tent but a tall tawny woman of middle age who was busily knitting brother said jasper i wish to hold some pleasant discourse with you as much as you please said i provided you can find anything pleasant to talk about never fear said jasper and first of all we will talk of yourself where have you been all this long time here and there said i and far and near going about with the soldiers but there is no soldiering now so we have sat down father and family in the town there and do you still hunt snakes said jasper no said i i have given up that long ago i do better now read books and learn languages well i am sorry you have given up your snakehunting manys the strange talk i have had with our people about your snake and yourself and how you frightened my father and mother in the lane and where are your father and mother where i shall never see them brother at least i hope so not dead no not dead

the chong were mine and has he none of his own sometimes he has but he is not so well off as myself when my father and mother were bitchadey pawdel which to tell you the truth they were for chiving wafodo dloovu they left me all they had which was not a little and i became the head of our family which was not a small one i was not older than you when that happened yet our people said they had never a better krallis to contrive and plan for them and to keep them in order and this is so well known that many rommany chals not of our family come and join themselves to us living with us for a time in order to better themselves more especially those of the poorer sort who have little of their own tawno is one of these is that fine fellow poor one of the poorest brother handsome as he is he has not a horse of his own to ride on perhaps we may put it down to his wife who cannot move about being a cripple as you saw and you are what is called a gypsy king ay ay a rommany kral are there other kings those who call themselves so but the true pharaoh is petulengro did pharaoh make horseshoes the first who ever did brother pharaoh lived in egypt so did we once brother and you left itmy fathers did brother and why did they come here they had their reasons brother and you are not english we are not gorgios and you have a language of your own avali this is wonderful ha ha cried the woman who had hitherto sat knitting at the farther end of the tent without saying a word though not inattentive to our conversation as i could perceive by certain glances which she occasionally cast upon us both ha ha she screamed fixing upon me two eyes which shone like burning coals and which were filled with an expression both of scorn and malignity it is wonderful is it that we should have a language of our own what you grudge the poor people the speech they talk among themselves thats just like you gorgios you would have everybody stupid singletongued idiots like yourselves we are taken before the poknees of the gav myself and sister to give an account of ourselves so i says to my sisters little boy speaking rommany i says to the little boy who is with us run to my son jasper and the rest and tell them to be off there are hawks abroad so the poknees questions us and lets us go not being able to make anything of us but as we are going he calls us back good woman says the poknees what was that i heard you say just now to the little boy i was telling him your worship to go and see the time of day and to save trouble i said it in our own language where did you get that language says the poknees tis our own language sir i tells him we did not steal it shall i tell you what it is my good woman says the poknees i would thank you sir says i for tis often we are asked about it well then says the poknees it is no language at all merely a madeup gibberish oh bless your wisdom says i with a curtsey you can tell us what our language is without understanding it another time we met a parson good woman he says whats that you are talking is it broken language of course your reverence says i we are broken people give a shilling your reverence to the poor broken woman oh these gorgios they grudge us our very language she called you her son jasper i am her son brother i thought you said your parents were bitchadey pawdel you thought right brother this is my wifes mother then you are married jasper ay truly i am husband and father you will see wife and chabo anon where are they now in the gav penning dukkerin we were talking of language jasper true brother yours must be a rum one tis called rommany i would gladly know it you need it sorely would you teach it me none soonersuppose we begin now suppose we do brother not whilst i am here said the woman flinging her knitting down and starting upon her feet not whilst i am here shall this gorgio learn rommany a pretty manœuvre truly and what would be the end of it i goes to the farming ker with my sister to tell a fortune and earn a few sixpences for the chabes i sees a jolly pig in the yard and i says to my sister speaking rommany do so and so says i which the farming man hearing asks what we are talking about nothing at all master says i something about the weather when who should start up from behind a pale where he has been listening but this ugly gorgio crying out they are after poisoning your pigs neighbour so that we are glad to run i and my sister with perhaps the farmengro shouting after us says my sister to me when we have got fairly off how came that ugly one to know what you said to me whereupon i answers it all comes of my son jasper who brings the gorgio to our fire and must needs be teaching him who was fool there says my sister who indeed but my son jasper i answers and here should i be a greater fool to sit still and suffer it which i will not do i do not like the look of him he looks overgorgeous an ill day to the romans when he masters rommany and when i says that i pens a true dukkerin what do you call god jasper you had better be jawing said the woman raising her voice to a terrible scream you had better be moving off my gorgio hang you for a keen one sitting there by the fire and stealing my language before my face do you know whom you have to deal with do you know that i am dangerous my name is herne and i comes of the hairy ones and a hairy one she looked she wore her hair clubbed upon her head fastened with many strings and ligatures but now tearing these off her locks originally jet black but now partially grizzled with age fell down on every side of her covering her face and back as far down as her knees no shebear from lapland ever looked more fierce and hairy than did that woman as standing in the open part of the tent with her head bent down and her shoulders drawn up seemingly about to precipitate herself upon me she repeated again and again my name is herne and i comes of the hairy ones i call god duvel brother it sounds very like devil it doth brother it doth and what do you call divine i mean godly oh i call that duvelskoe i am thinking of something jasper what are you thinking of brother would it not be a rum thing if divine and devilish were originally one and the same word it would brother it would from this time i had frequent interviews with jasper sometimes in his tent sometimes on the heath about which we would roam for hours discoursing on various matters sometimes mounted on one of his horses of which he had several i would accompany him to various fairs and markets in the neighbourhood to which he went on his own affairs or those of his tribe i soon found that i had become acquainted with a most singular people whose habits and pursuits awakened within me the highest interest of all connected with them however their language was doubtless that which exercised the greatest influence over my imagination i had at first some suspicion that it would prove a mere madeup gibberish but i was soon undeceived broken corrupted and half in ruins as it was it was not long before i found that it was an original speech far more so indeed than one or two others of high name and celebrity which up to that time i had been in the habit of regarding with respect and veneration indeed many obscure points connected with the vocabulary of these languages and to which neither classic nor modern lore afforded any clue i thought i could now clear up by means of this strange broken tongue spoken by people who dwelt among thickets and furze bushes in tents as tawny as their faces and whom the generality of mankind designated and with much semblance of justice as thieves and vagabonds but where did this speech come from and who were they who spoke it these were questions which i could not solve and which jasper himself when pressed confessed his inability to answer but whoever we be brother said he we are an old people and not what folks in general imagine broken gorgios and if we are not egyptians we are at any rate rommany chalsrommany chals i should not wonder after all said i that these people had something to do with the founding of rome rome it is said was built by vagabonds who knows but that some tribe of the kind settled down thereabouts and called the town which they built after their name but whence did they come originally ah there is the difficulty but abandoning these questions which at that time were far too profound for me i went on studying the language and at the same time the characters and manners of these strange people my rapid progress in the former astonished while it delighted jasper well no longer call you sapengro brother said he but rather lavengro which in the language of the gorgios meaneth word master nay brother said tawno chikno with whom i had become very intimate you had better call him cooromengro i have put on the gloves with him and find him a pure fist master i like him for that for i am a cooromengro myself and was born at brummagem i likes him for his modesty said mrs chikno i never hears any ill words come from his mouth but on the contrary much sweet language his talk is golden and he has taught my eldest to say his prayers in rommany which my rover had never the grace to do he is the pal of my rom said mrs petulengro who was a very handsome woman and therefore i likes him and not less for his being a rye folks calls me highminded and perhaps i have reason to be so before i married pharaoh i had an offer from a lordi likes the young rye and if he chooses to follow us he shall have my sister what say you mother should not the young rye have my sister ursula i am going to my people said mrs herne placing a bundle upon a donkey which was her own peculiar property i am going to yorkshire for i can stand this no longer you say you like him in that we differs i hates the gorgio and would like speaking romanly to mix a little poison with his waters and now go to lundra my children i goes to yorkshire take my blessing with ye and a little bit of a gillie to cheer your hearts with when ye are weary in all kinds of weather have we lived together but now we are parted i goes brokenheartedi cant keep you company ye are no longer rommany to gain a bad brother ye have lost a good motherchapter xviii what professionnot fitted for a churchmanerratic coursethe bitter draughtprinciple of woethou wouldst be joyouswhat ails youpoor child of clay so the gypsies departed mrs herne to yorkshire and the rest to london as for myself i continued in the house of my parents passing my time in much the same manner as i have already described principally in philological pursuits but i was now sixteen and it was highly necessary that i should adopt some profession unless i intended to fritter away my existence and to be a useless burden to those who had given me birth but what profession was i to choose there being none in the wide world perhaps for which i was suited nor was there any one for which i felt any decided inclination though perhaps there existed within me a lurking penchant for the profession of arms which was natural enough as from my earliest infancy i had been accustomed to military sights and sounds but this profession was then closed as i have already hinted and as i believe it has since continued to those who like myself had no better claims to urge than the services of a father my father who for certain reasons of his own had no very high opinion of the advantages resulting from this career would have gladly seen me enter the church his desire was however considerably abated by one or two passages of my life which occurred to his recollection he particularly dwelt on the unheardof manner in which i had picked up the irish language and drew from thence the conclusion that i was not fitted by nature to cut a respectable figure at an english university he will fly off in a tangent said he and when called upon to exhibit his skill in greek will be found proficient in irish i have observed the poor lad attentively and really do not know what to make of him but i am afraid he will never make a churchman and i have no doubt that my excellent father was right both in his premises and the conclusion at which he arrived i had undoubtedly at one period of my life forsaken greek for irish and the instructions of a learned protestant divine for those of a papist gassoon the cardfancying murtagh and of late though i kept it a strict secret i had abandoned in a great measure the study of the beautiful italian and the recitation of the sonorous terzets of the divine comedy in which at one time i took the greatest delight in order to become acquainted with the broken speech and yet more broken songs of certain houseless wanderers whom i had met at a horse fair such an erratic course was certainly by no means in consonance with the sober and unvarying routine of college study and my father who was a man of excellent common sense displayed it in not pressing me to adopt a profession which required qualities of mind which he saw i did not possess other professions were talked of amongst which the law but now an event occurred which had nearly stopped my career and merged all minor points of solicitude in anxiety of my life my strength and appetite suddenly deserted me and i began to pine and droop some said that i had overgrown myself and that these were the symptoms of a rapid decline i grew worse and worse and was soon stretched upon my bed from which it seemed scarcely probable that i should ever more rise the physicians themselves giving but slight hopes of my recovery as for myself i made up my mind to die and felt quite resigned i was sadly ignorant at that time and when i thought of death it appeared to me little else than a pleasant sleep and i wished for sleep of which i got but little it was well that i did not die that time for i repeat that i was sadly ignorant of many important things i did not die for somebody coming gave me a strange bitter draught a decoction i believe of a bitter root which grows on commons and desolate places and the person who gave it me was an ancient female a kind of doctress who had been my nurse in my infancy and who hearing of my state had come to see me so i drank the draught and became a little better and i continued taking draughts made from the bitter root till i manifested symptoms of convalescence but how much more quickly does strength desert the human frame than return to it i had become convalescent it is true but my state of feebleness was truly pitiable i believe it is in that state that the most remarkable feature of human physiology frequently exhibits itself oh how dare i mention the dark feeling of mysterious dread which comes over the mind and which the lamp of reason though burning bright the while is unable to dispel art thou as leeches say the concomitant of diseasethe result of shattered nerves nay rather the principle of woe itself the fountain head of all sorrow coexistent with man whose influence he feels when yet unborn and whose workings he testifies with his earliest cries when drowned in tears he first beholds the light for as the sparks fly upward so is man born to trouble and woe doth he bring with him into the world even thyself dark one terrible one causeless unbegotten without a father oh how unfrequently dost thou break down the barriers which divide thee from the poor soul of man and overcast its sunshine with thy gloomy shadow in the brightest days of prosperityin the midst of health and wealthhow sentient is the poor human creature of thy neighbourhood how instinctively aware that the floodgates of horror may be cast open and the dark stream engulf him for ever and ever then is it not lawful for man to exclaim better that i had never been born fool for thyself thou wast not born but to fulfil the inscrutable decrees of thy creator and how dost thou know that this dark principle is not after all thy best friend that it is not that which tempers the whole mass of thy corruption it may be for what thou knowest the mother of wisdom and of great works it is the dread of the horror of the night that makes the pilgrim hasten on his way when thou feelest it nigh let thy safety word be onward if thou tarry thou art overwhelmed courage build great workstis urging theeit is ever nearest the favourites of godthe fool knows little of it thou wouldst be joyous wouldst thou then be a fool what great work was ever the result of joy the puny onewho have been the wise ones the mighty ones the conquering ones of this earth the joyous i believe not the fool is happy or comparatively socertainly the least sorrowful but he is still a fool and whose notes are sweetest those of the nightingale or of the silly lark what ails you my child said a mother to her son as he lay on a couch under the influence of the dreadful one what ails you you seem afraid boy and so i am a dreadful fear is upon me mother but of what there is no one can harm you of what are you apprehensive boy of nothing that i can express i know not what i am afraid of but afraid i am mother perhaps you see sights and visions i knew a lady once who was continually thinking that she saw an armed man threaten her but it was only an imagination a phantom of the brain boy no armed man threatens me and tis not a thing that would cause me any fear did an armed man threaten me i would get up and fight him weak as i am i would wish for nothing better for then perhaps i should lose this fear mine is a dread of i know not what and there the horror lies mother your forehead is cool and your speech collected do you know where you are boy i know where i am and i see things just as they are you are beside me and upon the table there is a book which was written by a florentine all this i see and that there is no ground for being afraid i am moreover quite cool and feel no painbut but and then there was a burst of gemiti sospiri ed alti guai alas alas poor child of clay as the sparks fly upward so wast thou born to sorrowonwardchapter xix agreeable delusionsyoutha professionab gwilymglorious english lawthere they passmy dear old masterthe deal desklanguage of the tentswhere is morfyddgo toonly once it has been said by this or that writer i scarcely know by whom that in proportion as we grow old and our time becomes short the swifter does it pass until at last as we approach the borders of the grave it assumes all the speed and impetuosity of a river about to precipitate itself into an abyss this is doubtless the case provided we can carry to the grave those pleasant thoughts and delusions which alone render life agreeable and to which even to the very last we would gladly cling but what becomes of the swiftness of time when the mind sees the vanity of human pursuits which is sure to be the case when its fondest dearest hopes have been blighted at the very moment when the harvest was deemed secure what becomes from that moment i repeat of the shortness of time i put not the question to those who have never known that trial they are satisfied with themselves and all around them with what they have done and yet hope to do some carry their delusions with them to the borders of the grave ay to the very moment when they fall into it a beautiful golden cloud surrounds them to the last and such talk of the shortness of time through the medium of that cloud the world has ever been a pleasant world to them their only regret is that they are so soon to quit it but oh ye dear deluded hearts it is not every one who is so fortunate to the generality of mankind there is no period like youth the generality are far from fortunate but the period of youth even to the least so offers moments of considerable happiness for they are not only disposed but able to enjoy most things within their reach with what trifles at that period are we content the things from which in afterlife we should turn away in disdain please us then for we are in the midst of a golden cloud and everything seems decked with a golden hue never during any portion of my life did time flow on more speedily than during the two or three years immediately succeeding the period to which we arrived in the preceding chapter since then it has flagged often enough sometimes it has seemed to stand entirely still and the reader may easily judge how it fares at the present from the circumstance of my taking pen in hand and endeavouring to write down the passages of my lifea last resource with most people but at the period to which i allude i was just as i may say entering upon life i had adopted a profession andto keep up my character simultaneously with that professionthe study of a new languagei speedily became a proficient in the one but ever remained a novice in the other a novice in the law but a perfect master in the welsh tongue yes very pleasant times were those when within the womb of a lofty deal desk behind which i sat for some eight hours every day transcribing when i imagined eyes were upon me documents of every description in every possible hand blackstone kept company with ab gwilymthe polished english lawyer of the last century who wrote long and prosy chapters on the rights of thingswith a certain wild welshman who some four hundred years before that time indited immortal cowydds and odes to the wives of cambrian chieftainsmore particularly to one morfydd the wife of a certain hunchbacked dignitary called by the poet facetiously bwa bachgenerally terminating with the modest request of a little private parlance beneath the green wood bough with no other witness than the eos or nightingale a request which if the poet himself may be believed rather a doubtful point was seldom very seldom denied and by what strange chance had ab gwilym and blackstone two personages so exceedingly different been thus brought together from what the reader already knows of me he may be quite prepared to find me reading the former but what could have induced me to take up blackstone or rather the law i have ever loved to be as explicit as possible on which account perhaps i never attained to any proficiency in the law the essence of which is said to be ambiguity most questions may be answered in a few words and this among the rest though connected with the law my parents deemed it necessary that i should adopt some profession they named the law the law was as agreeable to me as any other profession within my reach so i adopted the law and the consequence was that blackstone probably for the first time found himself in company with ab gwilym by adopting the law i had not ceased to be lavengro so i sat behind a desk many hours in a day ostensibly engaged in transcribing documents of various kinds the scene of my labours was a strange old house occupying one side of a long and narrow court into which however the greater number of the windows looked not but into an extensive garden filled with fruit trees in the rear of a large handsome house belonging to a highly respectable gentleman who moyennant une douceur considerable had consented to instruct my fathers youngest son in the mysteries of glorious english law ah would that i could describe the good gentleman in the manner which he deserves he has long since sunk to his place in a respectable vault in the aisle of a very respectable church whilst an exceedingly respectable marble slab against the neighbouring wall tells on a sunday some eye wandering from its prayerbook that his dust lies below to secure such respectabilities in death he passed a most respectable life let no one sneer he accomplished much his life was peaceful so was his death are these trifles i wish i could describe him for i loved the man and with reason for he was ever kind to me to whom kindness has not always been shown and he was moreover a choice specimen of a class which no longer existsa gentleman lawyer of the old school i would fain describe him but figures with which he has nought to do press forward and keep him from my minds eye there they pass spaniard and moor gypsy turk and livid jew but who is that what that thick pursy manin the loose snuffcoloured greatcoat with the white stockings drab breeches and silver buckles on his shoes that man with the bull neck and singular head immense in the lower part especially about the jaws but tapering upward like a pear the man with the bushy brows small grey eyes replete with catlike expression whose grizzled hair is cut close and whose earlobes are pierced with small golden rings oh that is not my dear old master but a widely different personage bon jour monsieur vidocq expressions de ma part à monsieur le baron taylor but here comes at last my veritable old master a more respectablelooking individual was never seen he really looked what he was a gentleman of the lawthere was nothing of the pettifogger about him somewhat under the middle size and somewhat rotund in person he was always dressed in a full suit of black never worn long enough to become threadbare his face was rubicund and not without keenness but the most remarkable thing about him was the crown of his head which was bald and shone like polished ivory nothing more white smooth and lustrous some people have said that he wore false calves probably because his black silk stockings never exhibited a wrinkle they might just as well have said that he waddled because his shoes creaked for these last which were always without a speck and polished as his crown though of a different hue did creak as he walked rather slowly i cannot say that i ever saw him walk fast he had a handsome practice and might have died a very rich man much richer than he did had he not been in the habit of giving rather expensive dinners to certain great people who gave him nothing in return except their company i could never discover his reasons for doing so as he always appeared to me a remarkably quiet man by nature averse to noise and bustle but in all dispositions there are anomalies i have already said that he lived in a handsome house and i may as well here add that he had a very handsome wife who both dressed and talked exceedingly well so i sat behind the deal desk engaged in copying documents of various kinds and in the apartment in which i sat and in the adjoining ones there were others some of them likewise copied documents while some were engaged in the yet more difficult task of drawing them up and some of these sons of nobody were paid for the work they did whilst others like myself sons of somebody paid for being permitted to work which as our principal observed was but reasonable forasmuch as we not unfrequently utterly spoiled the greater part of the work intrusted to our hands there was one part of the day when i generally found myself quite alone i mean at the hour when the rest went home to their principal meal i being the youngest was left to take care of the premises to answer the bell and so forth till relieved which was seldom before the expiration of an hour and a half when i myself went home this period however was anything but disagreeable to me for it was then that i did what best pleased me and leaving off copying the documents i sometimes indulged in a fit of musing my chin resting on both my hands and my elbows planted on the desk or opening the desk aforesaid i would take out one of the books contained within it and the book which i took out was almost invariably not blackstone but ab gwilym ah that ab gwilym i am much indebted to him and it were ungrateful on my part not to devote a few lines to him and his songs in this my history start not reader i am not going to trouble you with a poetical dissertation no no i know my duty too well to introduce anything of the kind but i who imagine i know several things and amongst others the workings of your mind at this moment have an idea that you are anxious to learn a little a very little more about ab gwilym than i have hitherto told you the two or three words that i have dropped having awakened within you a languid kind of curiosity i have no hesitation in saying that he makes one of the some halfdozen really great poets whose verses in whatever language they wrote exist at the present day and are more or less known it matters little how i first became acquainted with the writings of this man and how the short thick volume stuffed full with his immortal imaginings first came into my hands i was studying welsh and i fell in with ab gwilym by no very strange chance but before i say more about ab gwilym i must be permittedi really mustto say a word or two about the language in which he wrote that same sweet welsh if i remember right i found the language a difficult one in mastering it however i derived unexpected assistance from what of irish remained in my head and i soon found that they were cognate dialects springing from some old tongue which itself perhaps had sprung from one much older and here i cannot help observing cursorily that i every now and then whilst studying this welsh generally supposed to be the original tongue of britain encountered words which according to the lexicographers were venerable words highly expressive showing the wonderful power and originality of the welsh in which however they were no longer used in common discourse but were relics precious relics of the first speech of britain perhaps of the world with which words however i was already well acquainted and which i had picked up not in learned books classic books and in tongues of old renown but whilst listening to mr petulengro and tawno chikno talking over their everyday affairs in the language of the tents which circumstance did not fail to give rise to deep reflection in those moments when planting my elbows on the deal desk i rested my chin upon my hands but it is probable that i should have abandoned the pursuit of the welsh language after obtaining a very superficial acquaintance with it had it not been for ab gwilym a strange songster was that who pretending to be captivated by every woman he saw was in reality in love with nature alonewild beautiful solitary natureher mountains and cascades her forests and streams her birds fishes and wild animals go to ab gwilym with thy pseudoamatory odes to morfydd or this or that other lady fair or ugly little didst thou care for any of them dame nature was thy love however thou mayest seek to disguise the truth yes yes sendthy lovemessage to morfydd the fair wanton by whom dost thou send it i would know by the salmon forsooth which haunts the rushing stream the glorious salmon which bounds and gambols in the flashing water and whose ways and circumstances thou so well describestsee there he hurries upwards through the flashing water halloo what a glimpse of glorybut where is morfydd the while what another message to the wife of bwa bach ay truly and by whom the wind the swift wind the rider of the world whose course is not to be stayed who gallops oer the mountain and when he comes to broadest river asks neither for boat nor ferry who has described the wind so wellhis speed and power but where is morfydd and now thou art awaiting morfydd the wanton the wife of the bwa bach thou art awaiting her beneath the tall trees amidst the underwood but she comes not no morfydd is there quite right ab gwilym what wantest thou with morfydd but another form is nigh at hand that of red reynard who seated upon his chine at the mouth of his cave looks very composedly at thee thou startest bendest thy bow thy crossbow intending to hit reynard with the bolt just above the jaw but the bow breaks reynard barks and disappears into his cave which by thine own account reaches helland then thou ravest at the misfortune of thy bow and the nonappearance of morfydd and abusest reynard go to thou carest neither for thy bow nor for morfydd thou merely seekest an opportunity to speak of reynard and who has described him like thee the brute with the sharp shrill cry the black reverse of melody whose face sometimes wears a smile like the devils in the evangile but now thou art actually with morfydd yes she has stolen from the dwelling of the bwa bach and has met thee beneath those rocksshe is actually with thee ab gwilym but she is not long with thee for a storm comes on and thunder shatters the rocksmorfydd flees quite right ab gwilym thou hadst no need of her a better theme for song is the voice of the lordthe rock shattererthan the frail wife of the bwa bach go to ab gwilym thou wast a wiser and a better man than thou wouldst fain have had people believe but enough of thee and thy songs those times passed rapidly with ab gwilym in my hand i was in the midst of enchanted ground in which i experienced sensations akin to those i had felt of yore whilst spelling my way through the wonderful bookthe delight of my childhood i say akin for perhaps only once in our lives do we experience unmixed wonder and delight and these i had already knownchapter xx silver graygood word for

they sat together one summer evening in their little garden beneath the shade of some tall poplars yes there sat my father in the garden chair which leaned against the wall of his quiet home the haven in which he had sought rest and praise be to god found it after many a year of poorly requited toil there he sat with locks of silver gray which set off so nobly his fine bold but benevolent face his faithful consort at his side and his trusty dog at his feet an eccentric animal of the genuine regimental breed who born amongst redcoats had not yet become reconciled to those of any other hue barking and tearing at them when they drew near the door but testifying his fond reminiscence of the former by hospitable waggings of the tail whenever a uniform made its appearanceat present a very unfrequent occurrence i am afraid i have not done right in putting him to the law said my father resting his chin upon his goldheaded bamboo cane why what makes you think so said my mother i have been taking my usual evening walk up the road with the animal here said my father and as i walked along i overtook the boys master mr s we shook hands and after walking a little way farther we turned back together talking about this and that the state of the country the weather and the dog which he greatly admired for he is a goodnatured man and has a good word for everybody though the dog all but bit him when he attempted to coax his head after the dog we began talking about the boy it was myself who introduced that subject i thought it was a good opportunity to learn how he was getting on so i asked what he thought of my son he hesitated at first seeming scarcely to know what to say at length he came out with oh a very extraordinary youth a most remarkable youth indeed captain indeed said i i am glad to hear it but i hope you find him steady steady steady said he why yes hes steady i cannot say that he is not steady come come said i beginning to be rather uneasy i see plainly that you are not altogether satisfied with him i was afraid you would not be for though he is my own son i am anything but blind to his imperfections but do tell me what particular fault you have to find with him and i will do my best to make him alter his conduct no fault to find with him captain i assure you no fault whatever the youth is a remarkable youth an extraordinary youth onlyas i told you before mr s is the bestnatured man in the world and it was only with the greatest difficulty that i could get him to say a single word to the disadvantage of the boy for whom he seems to entertain a very great regard at last i forced the truth from him and grieved i was to hear it though i must confess that i was somewhat prepared for it it appears that the lad has a total want of discrimination i dont understand you said my mother you can understand nothing that would seem for a moment to impugn the conduct of that child i am not however so blind want of discrimination was the word and it both sounds well and is expressive it appears that since he has been placed where he is he has been guilty of the grossest blunders only the other day mr s told me as he was engaged in close conversation with one of his principal clients the boy came to tell him that a person wanted particularly to speak with him and on going out he found a lamentable figure with one eye who came to ask for charity whom nevertheless the lad had ushered into a private room and installed in an arm chair like a justice of the peace instead of telling him to go about his businessnow what did that show but a total want of discrimination i wish we may never have anything worse to reproach him with said my mother i dont know what worse we could reproach him with said my father i mean of course as far as his profession is concerned discrimination is the very keystone if he treated all people alike he would soon become a beggar himself there are grades in society as well as in the army and according to those grades we should fashion our behaviour else there would instantly be an end of all order and discipline i am afraid that the child is too condescending to his inferiors whilst to his superiors he is apt to be unbending enough i dont believe that would do in the world i am sure it would not in the army he told me another anecdote with respect to his behaviour which shocked me more than the other had done it appears that his wife who by the by is a very fine woman and highly fashionable gave him permission to ask the boy to tea one evening for she is herself rather partial to the lad there had been a great dinner party there that day and there were a great many fashionable people so the boy went and behaved very well and modestly for some time and was rather noticed till unluckily a very great gentleman an archdeacon i think put some questions to him and finding that he understood the languages began talking to him about the classics what do you think the boy had the impertinence to say that the classics were much overvalued and amongst other things that some horrid fellow or other some welshman i think thank god it was not an irishman was a better poet than ovid the company were of coursehorrified the archdeacon who is seventy years of age and has seven thousand a year took snuff and turned away mrs s turned up her eyes mr s however told me with his usual goodnature i suppose to spare my feelings that he rather enjoyed the thing and thought it a capital joke i think so too said my mother i do not said my father that a boy of his years should entertain an opinion of his owni mean one which militates against all established authorityis astounding as well might a raw recruit pretend to offer an unfavourable opinion on the manual and platoon exercise the idea is preposterous the lad is too independent by half i never yet knew one of an independent spirit get on in the army the secret of success in the army is the spirit of subordination which is a poor spirit after all said my mother but the child is not in the army and it is well for him that he is not said my father but you do not talk wisely the world is a field of battle and he who leaves the ranks what can he expect but to be cut down i call his present behaviour leaving the ranks and going vapouring about without orders his only chance lies in falling in again as quick as possible does he think he can carry the day by himself an opinion of his own at these yearsi confess i am exceedingly uneasy about the lad you make me uneasy too said my mother but i really think you are too hard upon the child after all though not perhaps all you could wish him he is always ready to read the bible let us go in he is in the room above us at least he was two hours ago i left him there bending over his books i wonder what he has been doing all this time it is now getting late let us go in and he shall read to us i am getting old said my father and i love to hear the bible read to me for my own sight is something dim yet i do not wish the child to read to me this night i cannot so soon forget what i have heard but i hear my eldest sons voice he is now entering the gate he shall read the bible to us this night what say youchapter xxi the eldest sonsaying of wild finlandthe critical timevaunting pollsone thing wanteda fathers blessing miracle of artthe popes houseyoung enthusiastpictures of englandpersist and wrestlethe little dark man the eldest son the regard and affection which my father entertained for his firstborn were natural enough and appeared to none more so than myself who cherished the same feelings towards him what he was as a boy the reader already knows for the reader has seen him as a boy fain would i describe him at the time of which i am now speaking when he had attained the verge of manhood but the pen fails me and i attempt not the task and yet it ought to be an easy one for how frequently does his form visit my minds eye in slumber and in wakefulness in the light of day and in the night watches but last night i saw him in his beauty and his strength he was about to speak and my ear was on the stretch when at once i awoke and there was i alone and the night storm was howling amidst the branches of the pines which surround my lonely dwelling listen to the moaning of the pine at whose root thy hut is fasteneda saying that of wild finland in which there is wisdom i listened and thought of life and death of all human beings that i had ever known that elder brother was the most frank and generous ay and the quickest and readiest and the best adapted to do a great thing needful at the critical time when the delay of a moment would be fatal i have known him dash from a steep bank into a stream in his full dress and pull out a man who was drowning yet there were twenty others bathing in the water who might have saved him by putting out a hand without inconvenience to themselves which however they did not do but stared with stupid surprise at the drowning ones struggles yes whilst some shouted from the bank to those in the water to save the drowning one and those in the water did nothing my brother neither shouted nor stood still but dashed from the bank and did the one thing needful which under such circumstances not one man in a million would have done now who can wonder that a brave old man should love a son like this and prefer him to any other my boy my own boy you are the very image of myself the day i took off my coat in the park to fight big ben said my father on meeting his son wet and dripping immediately after his bold feat and who cannot excuse the honest pride of the old manthe stout old man ay old man that son was worthy of thee and thou wast worthy of such a son a noble specimen wast thou of those strong singleminded englishmen who without making a parade either of religion or loyalty feared god and honoured their king and were not particularly friendly to the french whose vaunting polls they occasionally broke as at minden and malplaquet to the confusion vast of the eternal foes of the english land i who was so little like thee that thou understoodest me not and in whom with justice thou didst feel so little pride had yet perception enough to see all thy worth and to feel it an honour to be able to call myself thy son and if at some no distant time when the foreign enemy ventures to insult our shore i be permitted to break some vaunting poll it will be a triumph to me to think that if thou hadst lived thou wouldst have hailed the deed and mightest yet discover some distant resemblance to thyself the day when thou didst all but vanquish the mighty brain i have already spoken of my brothers taste for painting and the progress he had made in that beautiful art it is probable that if circumstances had not eventually diverted his mind from the pursuit he would have attained excellence and left behind him some enduring monument of his powers for he had an imagination to conceive and that yet rarer endowment a hand capable of giving life body and reality to the conceptions of his mind perhaps he wanted one thing the want of which is but too often fatal to the sons of genius and without which genius is little more than a splendid toy in the hands of the possessorperseverance dogged perseverance in his proper calling otherwise though the grave had closed over him he might still be living in the admiration of his fellowcreatures o ye gifted ones follow your calling for however various your talents may be ye can have but one calling capable of leading ye to eminence and renown follow resolutely the one straight path before you it is that of your good angel let neither obstacles nor temptations induce ye to leave it bound along if you can if not on hands and knees follow it perish in it if needful but ye need not fear that no one ever yet died in the true path of his calling before he had attained the pinnacle turn into other paths and for a momentary advantage or gratification ye have sold your inheritance your immortality ye will never be heard of after death my father has given me a hundred and fifty pounds said my brother to me one morning and something which is better his blessing i am going to leave you and where are you going where to the great city to london to be sure i should like to go with you pooh said my brother what should you do there but dont be discouraged i dare say a time will come when you too will go to londonand sure enough so it did and all but too soon and what do you purpose doing there i demanded oh i go to improve myself in art to place myself under some master of high name at least i hope to do so eventually i have however a plan in my head which i should wish first to execute indeed i do not think i can rest till i have done so every one talks so much about italy and the wondrous artists which it has produced and the wondrous pictures which are to be found there now i wish to see italy or rather rome the great city for i am told that in a certain room there is contained the grand miracle of art and what do you call it the transfiguration painted by one rafael and it is said to be the greatest work of the greatest painter which the world has ever known i suppose it is because everybody says so that i have such a strange desire to see it i have already made myself well acquainted with its locality and think that i could almost find my way to it blindfold when i have crossed the tiber which as you are aware runs through rome i must presently turn to the right up a rather shabby street which communicates with a large square the farther end of which is entirely occupied by the front of an immense church with a dome which ascends almost to the clouds and this church they call st peters ay ay said i i have read about that in keyslers travels before the church in the square are two fountains one on either side casting up water in showers between them in the midst is an obelisk brought from egypt and covered with mysterious writing on your right rises an edifice not beautiful nor grand but huge and bulky where lives a strange kind of priest whom men call the pope a very horrible old individual who would fain keep christ in leadingstrings calls the virgin mary the queen of heaven and himself gods lieutenantgeneral upon earth ay ay said i i have read of him in foxs book of martyrs well i do not go straight forward up the flight of steps conducting into the church but i turn to the right and passing under the piazza find myself in a court of the huge bulky house and then ascend various staircases and pass along various corridors and galleries all of which i could describe to you though i have never seen them at last a door is unlocked and we enter a room rather high but not particularly large communicating with another room into which however i do not go though there are noble things in that second roomimmortal things by immortal artists amongst others a grand piece of corregio i do not enter it for the grand picture of the world is not there but i stand still immediately on entering the first room and i look straight before me neither to the right nor left though there are noble things both on the right and left for immediately before me at the farther end hanging against the wall is a picture which arrests me and i can see nothing else for that picture at the farther end hanging against the wall is the picture of the world yes go thy way young enthusiast and whether to london town or to old rome may success attend thee yet strange fears assail me and misgivings on thy account thou canst not rest thou sayst till thou hast seen the picture in the chamber at old rome hanging over against the wall ay and thus thou dost exemplify thy weaknessthy strength too it may befor the one idea fantastic yet lovely which now possesses thee could only have originated in a genial and fervent brain well go if thou must go yet it perhaps were better for thee to bide in thy native land and there with fear and trembling with groanings with straining eyeballs toil drudge slave till thou hast made excellence thine own thou wilt scarcely acquire it by staring at the picture over against the door in the high chamber of old rome seekest thou inspiration thou needest it not thou hast it already and it was never yet found by crossing the sea what hast thou to do with old rome and thou an englishman did thy blood never glow at the mention of thy native land as an artist merely yes i trow and with reason for thy native land need not grudge old rome her pictures of the world she has pictures of her own pictures of england and is it a new thing to toss up caps and shoutengland against the world yes against the world in all in all in science and in arms in minstrel strain and not less in the art which enables the hand to deceive the intoxicated soul by means of pictures seekst models to gainsborough and hogarth turn not names of the world may be but english namesand england against the world a living master why there he comes thou hast had him long he has long guided thy young hand towards the excellence which is yet far from thee but which thou canst attain if thou shouldst persist and wrestle even as he has done midst gloom and despondencyay and even contempt he who now comes up the creaking stair to thy little studio in the second floor to inspect thy last effort before thou departest the little stout man whose face is very dark and whose eye is vivacious that man has attained excellence destined some day to be acknowledged though not till he is cold and his mortal part returned to its kindred clay he has painted not pictures of the world but english pictures such as gainsborough himself might have done beautiful rural pieces with trees which might well tempt the little birds to perch upon them thou needest not run to rome brother where lives the old mariolater after pictures of the world whilst at home there are pictures of england nor needest thou even go to london the big city in search of a master for thou hast one at home in the old east angliantown who can instruct thee whilst thou needest instruction better stay at home brother at least for a season and toil and strive midst groanings and despondency till thou hast attained excellence even as he has donethe little dark man with the brown coat and the topboots whose name will one day be considered the chief ornament of the old town and whose works will at no distant period rank amongst the proudest pictures of englandand england against the world thy master my brother thy at present all too little considered mastercromechapter xxii desire for noveltylives of the lawlesscountenancesold yeoman and damewe live near the seauncouthlooking volumethe other conditiondraoitheaca dilemmathe antinomianlodowick muggletonalmost blind anders vedel but to proceed with my own story i now ceased all at once to take much pleasure in the pursuits which formerly interested me i yawned over ab gwilym even as i now in my minds eye perceive the reader yawning over the present pages what was the cause of this constitutional lassitude or a desire for novelty both it is probable had some influence in the matter but i rather think that the latter feeling was predominant the parting words of my brother had sunk into my mind he had talked of travelling in strange regions and seeing strange and wonderful objects and my imagination fell to work and drew pictures of adventures wild and fantastic and i thought what a fine thing it must be to travel and i wished that my father would give me his blessing and the same sum that he had given my brother and bid me go forth into the world always forgetting that i had neither talents nor energies at this period which would enable me to make any successful figure on its stage and then i again sought up the book which had so captivated me in my infancy and i read it through and i sought up others of a similar character and in seeking for them i met books also of adventure but by no means of a harmless description lives of wicked and lawless men murray and latroonbooks of singular power but of coarse and prurient imaginationbooks at one time highly in vogue now deservedly forgotten and most difficult to be found and when i had gone through these books what was my state of mind i had derived entertainment from their perusal but they left me more listless and unsettled than before and i really knew not what to do to pass my time my philological studies had become distasteful and i had never taken any pleasure in the duties of my profession i sat behind my desk in a state of torpor my mind almost as blank as the paper before me on which i rarely traced a line it was always a relief to hear the bell ring as it afforded me an opportunity of doing something which i was yet capable of doing to rise and open the door and stare in the countenances of the visitors all of a sudden i fell to studying countenances and soon flattered myself that i had made considerable progress in the science there is no faith in countenances said some roman of old trust anything but a persons countenance not trust a mans countenance say some moderns why it is the only thing in many people that we can trust on which account they keep it most assiduously out of the way trust not a mans words if you please or you may come to very erroneous conclusions but at all times place implicit confidence in a mans countenance in which there is no deceit and of necessity there can be none if people would but look each other more in the face we should have less cause to complain of the deception of the world nothing so easy as physiognomy nor so useful somewhat in this latter strain i thought at the time of which i am speaking i am now older and let us hope less presumptuous it is true that in the course of my life i have scarcely ever had occasion to repent placing confidence in individuals whose countenances have prepossessed me in their favour though to how many i may have been unjust from whose countenances i may have drawn unfavourable conclusions is another matter but it had been decreed by that fate which governs our every action that i was soon to return to my old pursuits it was written that i should not yet cease to be lavengro though i had become in my own opinion a kind of lavater it is singular enough that my renewed ardour for philology seems to have been brought about indirectly by my physiognomical researches in which had i not indulged the event which i am about to relate as far as connected with myself might never have occurred amongst the various countenances which i admitted during the period of my answering the bell there were two which particularly pleased me and which belonged to an elderly yeoman and his wife whom some little business had brought to our law sanctuary i believe they experienced from me some kindness and attention which won the old peoples hearts so one day when their little business had been brought to a conclusion and they chanced to be alone with me who was seated as usual behind the deal desk in the outer room the old man with some confusion began to tell me how grateful himself and dame felt for the many attentions i had shown them and how desirous they were to make me some remuneration of course said the old man we must be cautious what we offer to so fine a young gentleman as yourself we have however something we think will just suit the occasion a strange kind of thing which people say is a book though no one that my dame or myself have shown it to can make anything out of it so as we are told that you are a fine young gentleman who can read all the tongues of the earth and stars as the bible says we thought i and my dame that it would be just the thing you would like and my dame has it now at the bottom of her basket a book said i how did you come by it we live near the sea said the old man so near that sometimes our thatch is wet with the spray and it may now be a year ago that there was a fearful storm and a ship was driven ashore during the night and ere the morn was a complete wreck when we got up at daylight there were the poor shivering crew at our door they were foreigners redhaired men whose speech we did not understand but we took them in and warmed them and they remained with us threedays and when they went away they left behind them this thing here it is part of the contents of a box which was washed ashore and did you learn who they were why yes they made us understand that they were danes danes thought i danes and instantaneously huge and grizzly appeared to rise up before my vision the skull of the old pirate dane even as i had seen it of yore in the penthouse of the ancient church to which with my mother and my brother i had wandered on the memorable summer eve and now the old man handed me the book a strange and uncouthlooking volume enough it was not very large but instead of the usual covering was bound in wood and was compressed with strong iron clasps it was a printed book but the pages were not of paper but vellum and the characters were black and resembled those generally termed gothic it is certainly a curious book said i and i should like to have it but i cant think of taking it as a gift i must give you an equivalent i never take presents from anybody the old man whispered with his dame and chuckled and then turned his face to me and said with another chuckle well we have agreed about the price but may be you will not consent i dont know said i what do you demand why that you shake me by the hand and hold out your cheek to my old dame she has taken an affection to you i shall be very glad to shake you by the hand said i but as for the other condition it requires consideration no consideration at all said the old man with something like a sigh she thinks you like her son our only child that was lost twenty years ago in the waves of the north sea oh that alters the case altogether said i and of course i can have no objection and now at once i shook off my listlessness to enable me to do which nothing could have happened more opportune than the above event the danes the danes and i was at last to become acquainted and in so singular a manner with the speech of a people which had as far back as i could remember exercised the strongest influence over my imagination as how should they notin infancy there was the summereve adventure to which i often looked back and always with a kind of strange interest with respect to those to whom such gigantic and wondrous bones could belong as i had seen on that occasion and more than this i had been in ireland and there under peculiar circumstances this same interest was increased tenfold i had mingled much whilst there with the genuine irisha wild but kindhearted race whose conversation was deeply imbued with traditionary lore connected with the early history of their own romantic land and from them i heard enough of the danes but nothing commonplace for they never mentioned them but in terms which tallied well with my own preconceived ideas for at an early period the danes had invaded ireland and had subdued it and though eventually driven out had left behind them an enduring remembrance in the minds of the people who loved to speak of their strength and their stature in evidence of which they would point to the ancient raths or mounds where the old danes were buried and where bones of extraordinary size were occasionally exhumed and as the danes surpassed other people in strength so according to my narrators they also excelled all others in wisdom or rather in draoitheac or magic for they were powerful sorcerers they said compared with whom the fairy men of the present day knew nothing at all at all and amongst other wonderful things they knew how to make strong beer from the heather that grows upon the bogs little wonder if the interest the mysterious interest which i had early felt about the danes was increased tenfold by my sojourn in ireland and now i had in my possession a danish book which from its appearance might be supposed to have belonged to the very old danes indeed but how was i to turn it to any account i had the book it is true but i did not understand the language and how was i to overcome that difficulty hardly by poring over the book yet i did pore over the book daily and nightly till my eyes were dim and it appeared to me every now and then i encountered words which i understood english words though strangely disguised and i said to myself courage english and danish are cognate dialects a time will come when i shall understand this danish and then i pored over the book again but with all my poring i could not understand it and then i became angry and i bit my lips till the blood came and i occasionally tore a handful from my hair and flung it upon the floor but that did not mend the matter for still i did not understand the book which however i began to see was written in rhymea circumstance rather difficult to discover at first the arrangement of the lines not differing from that which is employed in prose and its being written in rhyme made me only the more eager to understand it but i toiled in vain for i had neither grammar nor dictionary of the language and when i sought for them could procureneither and i was much dispirited till suddenly a bright thought came into my head and i said although i cannot obtain a dictionary or grammar i can perhaps obtain a bible in this language and if i can procure a bible i can learn the language for the bible in every tongue contains the same thing and i have only to compare the words of the danish bible with those of the english and if i persevere i shall in time acquire the language of the danes and i was pleased with the thought which i considered to be a bright one and i no longer bit my lips or tore my hair but took my hat and going forth i flung my hat into the air and when my hat came down i put it on my head and commenced running directing my course to the house of the antinomian preacher who sold books and whom i knew to have bibles in various tongues amongst the number and i arrived out of breath and i found the antinomian in his little library dusting his books and the antinomian clergyman was a tall man of about seventy who wore a hat with a broad brim and a shallow crown and whose manner of speaking was exceedingly nasal and when i saw him i cried out of breath have you a danish bible and he replied what do you want it for friend and i answered to learn danish by and may be to learn thy duty replied the antinomian preacher truly i have it not but as you are a customer of mine i will endeavour to procure you one and i will write to that laudable society which men call the bible society an unworthy member of which i am and i hope by next week to procure what you desire and when i heard these words of the old man i was very glad and my heart yearned towards him and i would fain enter into conversation with him and i said why are you an antinomian for my part i would rather be a dog than belong to such a religion nay friend said the antinomian thou forejudgest us know that those who call us antinomians call us so despitefully we do not acknowledge the designation then you do not set all law at nought said i far be it from us said the old man we only hope that being sanctified by the spirit from above we have no need of the law to keep us in order did you ever hear tell of lodowick muggleton not i that is strange know then that he was the founder of our poor society and after him we are frequently though opprobriously termed muggletonians for we are christians here is his book which perhaps you can do no better than purchase you are fond of rare books and this is both curious and rare i will sell it cheap thank you and now be gone i will do all i can to procure the bible and in this manner i procured the danish bible and i commenced my task first of all however i locked up in a closet the volume which had excited my curiosity saying out of this closet thou comest not till i deem myself competent to read thee and then i sat down in right earnest comparing every line in the one version with the corresponding one in the other and i passed entire nights in this manner till i was almost blind and the task was tedious enough at first but i quailed not and soon began to make progress and at first i had a misgiving that the old book might not prove a danish book but was soon reassured by reading many words in the bible which i remembered to have seen in the book and then i went on right merrily and i found that the language which i was studying was by no means a difficult one and in less than a month i deemed myself able to read the book anon i took the book from the closet and proceeded to make myself master of its contents i had some difficulty for the language of the book though in the main the same as the language of the bible differed from it in some points being apparently a more ancient dialect by degrees however i overcame this difficulty and i understood the contents of the book and well did they correspond with all those ideas in which i had indulged connected with the danes for the book was a book of ballads about the deeds of knights and champions and men of huge stature ballads which from time immemorial had been sung in the north and which some two centuries before the time of which i am speaking had been collected by one anders vedel who lived with a certain tycho brahe and assisted him in making observations upon the heavenly bodies at a place called uranias castle on the little island of hveen in the cattegat chapter xxiii the two individualsthe long pipethe germanswertherthe female quakersuicidegibbonjesus of bethlehemfill your glassshakespeareenglish at mindenmelancholy swayne vonvedthe fifth dinner strange doctrinesare you happyimprove yourself in german it might be some six months after the events last recorded that two individuals were seated together in a certain room in a certain street of the old town which i have so frequently had occasion to mention in the preceding pages one of them was an elderly and the other a very young man and they sat on either side of the fireplace beside a table on which were fruit and wine the room was a small one and in its furniture exhibited nothing remarkable over the mantelpiece however hung a small picture with naked figures in the foreground and with much foliage behind it might not have struck every beholder for it looked old and smokedried but a connoisseur on inspecting it closely would have pronounced it to be a judgment of paris and a masterpiece of the flemish school the forehead of the elder individual was high and perhaps appeared more so than it really was from the hair being carefully brushed back as if for the purpose of displaying to the best advantage that part of the cranium his eyes were large and full and of a light brown and might have been called heavy and dull had they not been occasionally lighted up by a sudden gleamnot so brilliant however as that which at every inhalation shone from the bowl of the long clay pipe which he was smoking but which from a certain sucking sound which about this time began to be heard from the bottom appeared to be giving notice that it would soon require replenishment from a certain canister which together with a lighted taper stood upon the table beside him you do not smoke said he at length laying down his pipe and directing his glance to his companion now there was at least one thing singular connected with this last the colour of his hair which notwithstanding his extreme youth appeared to be rapidly becoming grey he had very long limbs and was apparently tall of stature in which he differed from his elderly companion who must have been somewhat below the usual height no i cant smoke said the youth in reply to the observation of the other i have often tried but could never succeed to my satisfaction is it possible to become a good german without smoking said the senior half speaking to himself i daresay not said the youth but i shant break my heart on that account as for breaking your heart of course you would never think of such a thing he is a fool who breaks his heart on any account but it is good to be a german the germans are the most philosophic people in the world and the greatest smokers now i trace their philosophy to their smoking i have heard say their philosophy is all smokeis that your opinion why no but smoking has a sedative effect upon the nerves and enables a man to bear the sorrows of this life of which every one has his share not only decently but dignifiedly suicide is not a national habit in germany as it is in england but that poor creature werther who committed suicide was a german werther is a fictitious character and by no means a felicitous one i am no admirer either of werther or his author but i should say that if there ever was a werther in germany he did not smoke werther as you very justly observe was a poor creature and a very sinful one i have heard my parents say that suicide is a great crime broadly and without qualification to say that suicide is a crime is speaking somewhat unphilosophically no doubt suicide under many circumstances is a crime a very heinous one when the father of a family for example to escape from certain difficulties commits suicide he commits a crime there are those around him who look to him for support by the law of nature and he has no right to withdraw himself from those who have a claim upon his exertions he is a person who decamps with other peoples goods as well as his own indeed there can be no crime which is not founded upon the depriving others of something which belongs to them a man is hanged for setting fire to his house in a crowded city for he burns at the same time or damages those of other people but if a man who has a house on a heath sets fire to it he is not hanged for he has not damaged or endangered any other individuals property and the principle of revenge upon which all punishment is founded has not been aroused similar to such a case is that of the man who without any family ties commits suicide for example were i to do the thing this evening who would have a right to call me to account i am alone in the world have no family to support and so far from damaging any one should even benefit my heir by myaccelerated death however i am no advocate for suicide under any circumstances there is something undignified in it unheroic ungermanic but if you must commit suicideand there is no knowing to what people may be brought always contrive to do it as decorously as possible the decencies whether of life or of death should never be lost sight of i remember a female quaker who committed suicide by cutting her throat but she did it decorously and decently kneeling down over a pail so that not one drop fell upon the floor thus exhibiting in her last act that nice sense of sweetness for which quakers are distinguished i have always had a respect for that womans memory and here filling his pipe from the canister and lighting it at the taper he recommenced smoking calmly and sedately but is not suicide forbidden in the bible the youth demanded why no but what though it werethe bible is a respectable book but i should hardly call it one whose philosophy is of the soundest i have said that it is a respectable book i mean respectable from its antiquity and from containing as herder says the earliest records of the human race though those records are far from being dispassionately written on which account they are of less value than they otherwise might have been there is too much passion in the bible too much violence now to come to all truth especially historic truth requires cool dispassionate investigation for which the jews do not appear to have ever been famous we are ourselves not famous for it for we are a passionate people the germans are notthey are not a passionate peoplea people celebrated for their oaths we are the germans have many excellent historic writers wetis true we have gibbon you have been reading gibbonwhat do you think of him i think him a very wonderful writer he is a wonderful writerone sui generisuniting the perspicuity of the englishfor we are perspicuouswith the cool dispassionate reasoning of the germans gibbon sought after the truth found it and made it clear then you think gibbon a truthful writer why yes who shall convict gibbon of falsehood many people have endeavoured to convict gibbon of falsehood they have followed him in his researches and have never found him once tripping oh hes a wonderful writer his power of condensation is admirable the lore of the whole world is to be found in his pages sometimes in a single note he has given us the result of the study of years or to speak metaphorically he has ransacked a thousand gulistans and has condensed all his fragrant booty into a single drop of otto but was not gibbon an enemy to the christian faith why no he was rather an enemy to priestcraft so am i and when i say the philosophy of the bible is in many respects unsound i always wish to make an exception in favour of that part of it which contains the life and sayings of jesus of bethlehem to which i must always concede my unqualified admirationof jesus mind you for with his followers and their dogmas i have nothing to do of all historic characters jesus is the most beautiful and the most heroic i have always been a friend to heroworship it is the only rational one and has always been in use amongst civilized people the worship of spirits is synonymous with barbarismit is mere fetish the savages of west africa are all spirit worshippers but there is something philosophic in the worship of the heroes of the human race and the true hero is the benefactor brahma jupiter bacchus were all benefactors and therefore entitled to the worship of their respective peoples the celts worshipped hesus who taught them to plough a highly useful art we who have attained a much higher state of civilization than the celts ever did worship jesus the first who endeavoured to teach men to behave decently and decorously under all circumstances who was the foe of vengeance in which there is something highly indecorous who had first the courage to lift his voice against that violent dogma an eye for an eye who shouted conquer but conquer with kindness who said put up the sword a violent unphilosophic weapon and who finally died calmly and decorously in defence of his philosophy he must be a savage who denies worship to the hero of golgotha but he was something more than a hero he was the son of god wasnt he the elderly individual made no immediate answer but after a few more whiffs from his pipe exclaimed come fill your glass how do you advance with your translation of tell it is nearly finished but i do not think i shall proceed with it i begin to think the original somewhat dull there you are wrong it is the masterpiece of schiller the first of german poets it may be so said the youth but pray excuse me i do not think very highly of german poetry i have lately been reading shakespeare and when i turn from him to the germanseven the best of themthey appear mere pigmies you will pardon the liberty i perhaps take in saying so i like that every one should have an opinion of his own said the elderly individual and what is more declare itnothing displeases me more than to see people assenting to everything that they hear said i at once come to the conclusion that they are either hypocrites or there is nothing in them but with respect to shakespeare whom i have not read for thirty years is he not rather given to bombast crackling bombast as i think i have said in one of my essays i daresay he is said the youth but i cant help thinking him the greatest of all poets not even excepting homer i would sooner have written that series of plays founded on the fortunes of the house of lancaster than the iliad itself the events described are as lofty as those sung by homer in his great work and the characters brought upon the stage still more interesting i think hotspur as much of a hero as hector and young henry more of a man than achilles and then there is the fat knight the quintessence of fun wit and rascality falstaff is a creation beyond the genius even of homer you almost tempt me to read shakespeare againbut the germans i dont admire the germans said the youth somewhat excited i dont admire them in any point of view i have heard my father say that though good sharpshooters they cant much be depended upon as soldiers and that old sergeant meredith told him that minden would never have been won but for the two english regiments who charged the french with fixed bayonets and sent them to the rightabout in doublequick time with respect to poetry setting shakespeare and the english altogether aside i think there is another gothic nation at least entitled to dispute with them the palm indeed to my mind there is more genuine poetry contained in the old danish book which i came so strangely by than has been produced in germany from the period of the niebelungen lay to the present ah the kœmpe viser said the elderly individual breathing forth an immense volume of smoke which he had been collecting during the declamation of his young companion there are singular things in that book i must confess and i thank you for showing it to me or rather your attempt at translation i was struck with that ballad of orm ungarswayne who goes by night to the gravehill of his father to seek for counsel and then again that strange melancholy swayne vonved who roams about the world propounding people riddles slaying those who cannot answer and rewarding those who can with golden bracelets were it not for the violence i should say that ballad has a philosophic tendency i thank you for making me acquainted with the book and i thank the jew mousha for making me acquainted with you that mousha was a strange customer said the youth collecting himself he was a strange customer said the elder individual breathing forth a gentle cloud i love to exercise hospitality to wandering strangers especially foreigners and when he came to this place pretending to teach german and hebrew i asked him to dinner after the first dinner he asked me to lend him five pounds i did lend him five pounds after the fifth dinner he asked me to lend him fifty pounds i did not lend him the fifty pounds he was as ignorant of german as of hebrew said the youth on which account he was soon glad i suppose to transfer his pupil to some one else he told me said the elder individual that he intended to leave a town where he did not find sufficient encouragement and at the same time expressed regret at being obliged to abandon a certain extraordinary pupil for whom he had a particular regard now i who have taught many people german from the love which i bear to it and the desire which i feel that it should be generally diffused instantly said that i should be happy to take his pupil off his hands and afford him what instruction i could in german for as to hebrew i have never taken much interest in it such was the origin of our acquaintance you have been an apt scholar of late however i have seen little of youwhat is the reason the youth made no answer you think probably that you have learned all i can teach you well perhaps you are right not so not so said the young man eagerly before i knew you i knew nothing and am still very ignorant but of late my fathers health has been very much broken and he requires attention his spirits also have become low which to tell you the truth he attributes to my misconduct he says that i have imbibed all kinds of strange notions and doctrines which will in all probability prove my ruin both here and hereafter whichwhich ah i understand said the elder with another calm whiff i have always had a kind of respect for your father for there is something remarkable in his appearance something heroic and i would fain have cultivated his acquaintance the feeling however has not been reciprocated i met him the other day up the road with his cane and dog and saluted him he did not return my salutation he has certain opinions of his own said the youth which are widely different from those which he has heard that you profess i respect a man for entertaining an opinion of his own said the elderly individual i hold certain opinions but i shouldnot respect an individual the more for adopting them all i wish for is tolerance which i myself endeavour to practise i have always loved the truth and sought it if i have not found it the greater my misfortune are you happy said the young man why no and between ourselves it is that which induces me to doubt sometimes the truth of my opinions my life upon the whole i consider a failure on which account i would not counsel you or any one to follow my example too closely it is getting late and you had better be going especially as your father you say is anxious about you but as we may never meet again i think there are three things which i may safely venture to press upon you the first is that the decencies and gentlenesses should never be lost sight of as the practice of the decencies and gentlenesses is at all times compatible with independence of thought and action the second thing which i would wish to impress upon you is that there is always some eye upon us and that it is impossible to keep anything we do from the world as it will assuredly be divulged by somebody as soon as it is his interest to do so the third thing which i would wish to press upon you yes said the youth eagerly bending forward isand here the elderly individual laid down his pipe upon the tablethat it will be as well to go on improving yourself in germanchapter xxiv the alehouse keepercompassion for the richold english gentlemanhow is thismadeirathe greek parr twenty languageswhiters healthabout the fighta sporting gentlemanthe flattened noselend us that pightlethe surly nod holloa master can you tell us where the fight is likely to be such were the words shouted out to me by a short thick fellow in brown topboots and bareheaded who stood with his hands in his pockets at the door of a country alehouse as i was passing by now as i knew nothing about the fight and as the appearance of the man did not tempt me greatly to enter into conversation with him i merely answered in the negative and continued my way it was a fine lovely morning in may the sun shine bright above and the birds were carolling in the hedgerows i was wont to be cheerful at such seasons for from my earliest recollection sunshine and the song of birds have been dear to me yet about that period i was not cheerful my mind was not at rest i was debating within myself and the debate was dreary and unsatisfactory enough i sighed and turning my eyes upward i ejaculated what is truth but suddenly by a violent effort breaking away from my meditations i hastened forward one mile two miles three miles were speedily left behind and now i came to a grove of birch and other trees and opening a gate i passed up a kind of avenue and soon arriving before a large brick house of rather antique appearance knocked at the door in this house there lived a gentleman with whom i had business he was said to be a genuine old english gentleman and a man of considerable property at this time however he wanted a thousand pounds as gentlemen of considerable property every now and then do i had brought him a thousand pounds in my pocket for it is astonishing how many eager helpers the rich find and with what compassion people look upon their distresses he was said to have good wine in his cellar is your master at home said i to a servant who appeared at the door his worship is at home young man said the servant as he looked at my shoes which bore evidence that i had come walking i beg your pardon sir he added as he looked me in the face ay ay servants thought i as i followed the man into the house always look people in the face when you open the door and do so before you look at their shoes or you may mistake the heir of a prime minister for a shopkeepers son i found his worship a jolly redfaced gentleman of about fiftyfive he was dressed in a green coat white corduroy breeches and drab gaiters and sat on an oldfashioned leather sofa with two small thoroughbred english terriers one on each side of him he had all the appearance of a genuine old english gentleman who kept good wine in his cellar sir said i i have brought you a thousand pounds and i said this after the servant had retired and the two terriers had ceased their barking which is natural to all such dogs at the sight of a stranger and when the magistrate had received the money and signed and returned a certain paper which i handed to him he rubbed his hands and looking very benignantly at me exclaimed and now young gentleman that our business is over perhaps you can tell me where the fight is to take place i am sorry sir said i that i cant inform you but everybody seems to be anxious about it and then i told him what had occurred to me on the road with the alehouse keeper i know him said his worship hes a tenant of mine and a good fellow somewhat too much in my debt though but how is this young gentleman you look as if you had been walking you did not come on foot yes sir i came on foot on foot why it is sixteen miles i shant be tired when i have walked back you cant ride i suppose better than i can walk then why do you walk i have frequently to make journeys connected with my profession sometimes i walk sometimes i ride just as the whimtakes me will you take a glass of wine yes thats right what shall it be madeira the magistrate gave a violent slap on his knee i like your taste said he i am fond of a glass of madeira myself and can give you such a one as you will not drink every day sit down young gentleman you shall have a glass of madeira and the best i have thereupon he got up and followed by his two terriers walked slowly out of the room i looked round the room and seeing nothing which promised me much amusement i sat down and fell again into my former train of thought what is truth said i here it is said the magistrate returning at the end of a quarter of an hour followed by the servant with a tray heres the true thing or i am no judge far less a justice it has been thirty years in my cellar last christmas there said he to the servant put it down and leave my young friend and me to ourselves now what do you think of it it is very good said i did you ever taste better madeira i never before tasted madeira then you ask for a wine without knowing what it is i ask for it sir that i may know what it is well there is logic in that as parr would say you have heard of parr old parr yes old parr but not that parr you mean the english i the greek parr as people call him i dont know him perhaps notrather too young for that but were you of my age you might have cause to know him coming from where you do he kept school there i was his first scholar he flogged greek into me till i loved himand he loved me he came to see me last year and sat in that chair i honour parrhe knows much and is a sound man does he know the truth know the truth he knows whats good from an oyster to an ostrichhes not only sound but round suppose we drink his health thank you boy heres parrs health and whiters who is whiter dont you know whiter i thought everybody knew reverend whiter the philologist though i suppose you scarcely know what that means a man fond of tongues and languages quite out of your wayhe understands some twenty what do you say to that is he a sound man why as to that i scarcely know what to say he has got queer notions in his headwrote a book to prove that all words came originally from the earthwho knows words have roots and roots live in the earth but upon the whole i should not call him altogether a sound man though he can talk greek nearly as fast as parris he a round man ay boy rounder than parr ill sing you a song if you like which will let you into his character give me the haunch of a buck to eat and to drink madeira old and a gentle wife to rest with and in my arms to fold an arabic book to study a norfolk cob to ride and a house to live in shaded with trees and near to a river side with such good things around me and blessed with good health withal though i should live for a hundred years for death i would not call heres to whiters healthso you know nothing about the fight no sir the truth is that of late i have been very much occupied with various matters otherwise i should perhaps have been able to afford you some informationboxing is a noble art can you box a little i tell you what my boy i honour you and provided your education had been a little less limited i should have been glad to see you here in company with parr and whiter both can box boxing is as you say a noble arta truly english art may i never see the day when englishmen shall feel ashamed of it or blacklegs and blackguards bring it into disgrace i am a magistrate and of course cannot patronise the thing very openly yet i sometimes see a prizefight i saw the game chicken beat gulley did you ever see big ben no why do you ask but here we heard a noise like that of a gig driving up to the door which was immediately succeeded by a violent knocking and ringing and after a little time the servant who had admitted me made his appearance in the room sir said he with a certain eagerness of manner here are two gentlemen waiting to speak to you gentlemen waiting to speak to me who are they i dont know sir said the servant but they look like sporting gentlemen andandhere he hesitated from a word or two they dropped i almost think that they come about the fight about the fight said the magistrate no that can hardly be however you had better show them in heavy steps were now heard ascending the stairs and the servant ushered two men into the apartment again there was a barking but louder than that which had been directed against myself for here were two intruders both of them were remarkable looking men but to the foremost of them the most particular notice may well be accorded he was a man somewhat under thirty and nearly six feet in height he was dressed in a blue coat white corduroy breeches fastened below the knee with small golden buttons on his legs he wore white lambswool stockings and on his feet shoes reaching to the ankles round his neck was a handkerchief of the blue and birds eye pattern he wore neither whiskers nor moustaches and appeared not to delight in hair that of his head which was of a light brown being closely cropped the forehead was rather high but somewhat narrow the face neither broad nor sharp perhaps rather sharp than broad the nose was almost delicate the eyes were grey with an expression in which there was sternness blended with something approaching to feline his complexion was exceedingly pale relieved however by certain pockmarks which here and there studded his countenance his form was athletic but lean his arms long in the whole appearance of the man there was a blending of the bluff and the sharp you might have supposed him a bruiser his dress was that of one in all its minutiæ something was wanting however in his mannerthe quietness of the professional man he rather looked like one performing the partwellvery wellbut still performing a part his companionthere indeed was the bruiserno mistake about him a tall massive man with a broad countenance and a flattened nose dressed like a bruiser but not like a bruiser going into the ring he wore white topped boots and a loose brown jockey coat as the first advanced towards the table behind which the magistrate sat he doffed a white castor from his head and made rather a genteel bow looking at me who sat somewhat on one side he gave a kind of nod of recognition may i request to know who you are gentlemen said the magistrate sir said the man in a deep but not unpleasant voice allow me to introduce to you my friend mr the celebrated pugilist and he motioned with his hand towards the massive man with the flattened noseand your own name sir said the magistrate my name is no matter said the man were i to mention it to you it would awaken within you no feeling of interest it is neither kean nor belcher and i have as yet done nothing to distinguish myself like either of those individuals or even like my friend here however a time may comewe are not yet buried and whensoever my hour arrives i hope i shall prove myself equal to my destiny however high like a bird thats bred amongst the helicons and here a smile half theatrical passed over his features in what can i oblige you sir said the magistrate well sir the soul of wit is brevity we want a place for an approaching combat between my friend here and a brave from town passing by your broad acres this fine morning we saw a pightle which we deemed would suit lend us that pightle and receive our thanks twould be a favour though not much to grant we neither ask for stonehenge nor for tempe my friend looked somewhat perplexed after a moment however he said with a firm but gentlemanly air sir i am sorry that i cannot comply with your request not comply said the man his brow becoming dark as midnight and with a hoarse and savage tone not comply why not it is impossible sir utterly impossible why so i am not compelled to give my reason to you sir nor to any man let me beg of you to alter your decision said the man in a tone of profound respect utterly impossible sir i am a magistrate magistrate then fare ye well for a greencoated buffer and a harmanbeck sir said the magistrate springing up with a face fiery with wrath but with a surly nod to me the man left the apartment and in a moment more the heavy footsteps of himself and his companion were heard descending the staircase who is that man said my friend turning towards me a sporting gentleman well known in the place from which i come he appeared to know you i have occasionally put on the gloves with him what is his namechapter xxv doubtswise king of jerusalemlet me seea thousand yearsnothing newthe crowdthe hymnfaith charles wesleythere he stoodfarewell brotherdeathsun moon and starswind on the heath there was one question which i was continually asking myself at this period and which has more than once met the eyes of the reader who has followed me through the last chapter what is truth i had involved myself imperceptibly in a dreary labyrinth of doubt and whichever way i turned no reasonable prospect of extricating myself appeared the means by which i had brought myself into this situation may be very briefly told i had inquired into many matters in order that i might become wise and i had read and pondered over the words of the wise so called till i had made myself master of the sum of human wisdom namely that everything is enigmatical and that man is an enigma to himself thence the cry of what is truth i had ceased to believe in the truth of that in which i had hitherto trusted and yet could find nothing in which i could put any fixed or deliberate belief i was indeed in a labyrinth in what did i not doubt with respect to crime and virtue i was in doubt i doubted that the one was blameable and the other praiseworthy are not all things subjected to the law of necessity assuredly time and chance govern all things yet how can this be alas then there was myself for what was i born are not all things born to be forgotten thats incomprehensible yet is it not so those butterflies fall and are forgotten in what is man better than a butterfly all then is born to be forgotten ah that was a pang indeed tis at such a moment that a man wishes to die the wise king of jerusalem who sat in his shady arbours beside his sunny fishpools saying so many fine things wished to die when he saw that not only all was vanity but that he himself was vanity will a time come when all will be forgotten that now is beneath the sun if so of what profit is life in truth it was a sore vexation of spirit to me when i saw as the wise man saw of old that whatever i could hope to perform must necessarily be of very temporary duration and if so why do it i said to myself whatever name i can acquire will it endure for eternity scarcely so a thousand years let me see what have i done already i have learnt welsh and have translated the songs of ab gwilym some ten thousand lines into english rhyme i have also learnt danish and have rendered the old book of ballads cast by the tempest upon the beach into corresponding english metre good have i done enough already to secure myself a reputation of a thousand years no no certainly not i have not the slightest ground for hoping that my translations from the welsh and danish will be read at the end of a thousand years well but i am only eighteen and i have not stated all that i have done i have learnt many other tongues and have acquired some knowledge even of hebrew and arabic should i go on in this way till i am forty i must then be very learned and perhaps among other things may have translated the talmud and some of the great works of the arabians pooh all this is mere learning and translation and such will never secure immortality translation is at best an echo and it must be a wonderful echo to be heard after the lapse of a thousand years no all i have already done and all i may yet do in the same way i may reckon as nothingmere pastime something else must be done i must either write some grand original work or conquer an empire the one just as easy as the other but am i competent to do either yes i think i am under favourable circumstances yes i think i may promise myself a reputation of a thousand years if i do but give myself the necessary trouble well but whats a thousand years after all or twice a thousand years woe is me i may just as well sit still would i had never been born i said to myself and a thought would occasionally intrude but was i ever born is not all that i see a liea deceitful phantom is there a world and earth and sky berkeleys doctrinespinosas doctrine dear reader i had at that time never read either berkeley or spinosa i have still never read them who are they men of yesterday all is a lieall a deceitful phantom are old cries they come naturally from the mouths of those who casting aside that choicest shield against madness simplicity would fain be wise as god and can only know that they are naked this doubting in the universal all is most coeval with the human race wisdom so called was early sought after all is a liea deceitful phantomwas said when the world was yet young its surface save a scanty portion yet untrodden by human foot and when the great tortoise yet crawled about all is a lie was the doctrine of buddh and buddh lived thirty centuries before the wise king of jerusalem who sat in his arbours beside his sunny fishpools saying many fine things and amongst others there is nothing new under the sun one day whilst i bent my way to the heath of which i have spoken on a former occasion at the foot of the hills which formed it i came to a place where a wagon was standing but without horses the shafts resting on the ground there was a crowd about it which extended halfway up the side of the neighbouring hill the wagon was occupied by some halfadozen men some sitting others standingthey were dressed in sobercoloured habiliments of black or brown cut in a plain and rather uncouth fashion and partially white with dust their hair was short and seemed to have been smoothed down by the application of the hand all were bareheadedsitting or standing all were bareheaded one of them a tall man was speaking as i arrived ere however i could distinguish what he was saying he left off and then there was a cry for a hymn to the glory of godthat was the word it was a strange sounding hymn as well it might be for everybody joined in it there were voices of all kinds of men of women and of childrenof those who could sing and ofthose who could nota thousand voices all joined and all joined heartily no voice of all the multitude was silent save mine the crowd consisted entirely of the lower classes labourers and mechanics and their wives and childrendusty people unwashed people people of no account whatever and yet they did not look a mob and when that hymn was overand here let me observe that strange as it sounded i have recalled that hymn to mind and it has seemed to tingle in my ears on occasions when all that pomp and art could do to enhance religious solemnity was being donein the sistine chapel what time the papal band was in full play and the choicest choristers of italy poured forth their melodious tones in presence of batuschca and his cardinalson the ice of the neva what time the long train of stately priests with their noble beards and their flowing robes of crimson and gold with their ebony and ivory staves stalked along chanting their sclavonian litanies in advance of the mighty emperor of the north and his priberjensky guard of giants towards the orifice through which the river running below in its swiftness is to receive the baptismal lymphwhen the hymn was over another man in the wagon proceeded to address the people he was a much younger man than the last speaker somewhat square built and about the middle height his face was rather broad but expressive of much intelligence and with a peculiar calm and serious look the accent in which he spoke indicated that he was not of these parts but from some distant district the subject of his address was faith and how it could remove mountains it was a plain address without any attempt at ornament and delivered in a tone which was neither loud nor vehement the speaker was evidently not a practised oneonce or twice he hesitated as if for words to express his meaning but still he held on talking of faith and how it could remove mountains it is the only thing we want brethren in this world if we have that we are indeed rich as it will enable us to do our duty under all circumstances and to bear our lot however hard it may beand the lot of all mankind is hardthe lot of the poor is hard brethrenand who knows more of the poor than ia poor man myself and the son of a poor man but are the rich better off not so brethren for god is just the rich have their trials too i am not rich myself but i have seen the rich with careworn countenances i have also seen them in madhouses from which you may learn brethren that the lot of all mankind is hard that is till we lay hold of faith which makes us comfortable under all circumstances whether we ride in gilded chariots or walk barefooted in quest of bread whether we be ignorant whether we be wisefor riches and poverty ignorance and wisdom brethren each brings with it its peculiar temptations well under all these troubles the thing which i would recommend you to seek is one and the samefaith faith in our lord jesus christ who made us and allotted to each his station each has something to do brethren do it therefore but always in faith without faith we shall find ourselves sometimes at fault but with faith never for faith can remove the difficulty it will teach us to love life brethren when life is becoming bitter and to prize the blessings around us for as every man has his cares brethren so has each man his blessings it will likewise teach us not to love life over much seeing that we must one day part with it it will teach us to face death with resignation and will preserve us from sinking amidst the swelling of the river jordan and when he had concluded his address he said let us sing a hymn one composed by master charles wesleyhe was my countryman brethren jesus i cast my soul on thee mighty and merciful to save thou shalt to death go down with me and lay me gently in the grave this body then shall rest in hope this body which the worms destroy for thou shalt surely raise me up to glorious life and endless joy farewell preacher with the plain coat and the calm serious look i saw thee once again and that was latelyonly the other day it was near a fishing hamlet by the seaside that i saw the preacher again he stood on the top of a steep monticle used by pilots as a lookout for vessels approaching that coast a dangerous one abounding in rocks and quicksands there he stood on the monticle preaching to weatherworn fishermen and mariners gathered below upon the sand who is he said i to an old fisherman who stood beside me with a book of hymns in his hand but the old man put his hand to his lips and that was the only answer i received not a sound was heard but the voice of the preacher and the roaring of the waves but the voice was heard loud above the roaring of the sea for the preacher now spoke with power and his voice was not that of one who hesitates there he stoodno longer a young man for his black locks were become gray even like my own but there was the intelligent face and the calm serious look which had struck me of yore there stood the preacher one of those menand thank god their number is not fewwho animated by the spirit of christ amidst much poverty and alas much contempt persist in carrying the light of the gospel amidst the dark parishes of what but for their instrumentality would scarcely be christian england i should have waited till he had concluded in order that i might speak to him and endeavour to bring back the ancient scene to his recollection but suddenly a man came hurrying towards the monticle mounted on a speedy horse and holding by the bridle one yet more speedy and he whispered to me why loiterest thou hereknowest thou not all that is to be done before midnight and he flung me the bridle and i mounted on the horse of great speed and i followed the other who had already galloped off and as i departed i waved my hand to him on the monticle and i shouted farewell brother the seed came up at last after a long period and then i gave the speedy horse his way and leaning over the shoulder of thegalloping horse i said would that my life had been like hiseven like that mans i now wandered along the heath until i came to a place where beside a thick furze sat a man his eyes fixed intently on the red ball of the setting sun thats not you jasper indeed brother ive not seen you for years how should you brother what

which are continually forcing themselves upon the mind many years have not passed over my head yet during those which i can call to remembrance how many things have i seen flourish pass away and become forgotten except by myself who in spite of all my endeavours never can forget anything i have known the time when a pugilistic encounter between two noted champions was almost considered in the light of a national affair when tens of thousands of individuals high and low meditated and brooded upon it the first thing in the morning and the last at night until the great event was decided but the time is past and many people will say thank god that it is all i have to say is that the french still live on the other side of the water and are still casting their eyes hitherwardand that in the days of pugilism it was no vain boast to say that one englishman was a match for two of tother race at present it would be a vain boast to say so for these are not the days of pugilism but those to which the course of my narrative has carried me were the days of pugilism it was then at its height and consequently near its decline for corruption had crept into the ring and how many things states and sects among the rest owe their decline to this cause but what a bold and vigorous aspect pugilism wore at that time and the great battle was just then coming off the day had been decided upon and the spota convenient distance from the old town and to the old town were now flocking the bruisers of england men of tremendous renown let no one sneer at the bruisers of englandwhat were the gladiators of rome or the bullfighters of spain in its palmiest days compared to englands bruisers pity that ever corruption should have crept in amongst thembut of that i wish not to talk let us still hope that a spark of the old religion of which they were the priests still lingers in the breasts of englishmen there they come the bruisers from far london or from wherever else they might chance to be at the time to the great rendezvous in the old city some came one way some another some of tiptop reputation came with peers in their chariots for glory and fame are such fair things that even peers are proud to have those invested therewith by their sides others came in their own gigs driving their own bits of blood and i heard one say i have driven through at a heat the whole hundred and eleven miles and only stopped to bait twice oh the bloodhorses of old england but they too have had their dayfor everything beneath the sun there is a season and a time but the greater number come just as they can contrive on the tops of coaches for example and amongst these there are fellows with dark sallow faces and sharp shining eyes and it is these that have planted rottenness in the core of pugilism for they are jews and true to their kind have only base lucre in view it was fierce old cobbett i think who first said that the jews first introduced bad faith amongst pugilists he did not always speak the truth but at any rate he spoke it when he made that observation strange people the jewsendowed with every gift but one and that the highest genius divinegenius which can alone make of men demigods and elevate them above earth and what is earthy and grovelling without which a clever nationand who more clever than the jews may have rambams in plenty but never a fielding nor a shakespeare a rothschild and a mendoza yesbut never a kean nor a belcher so the bruisers of england are come to be present at the grand fight speedily coming off there they are met in the precincts of the old town near the field of the chapel planted with tender saplings at the restoration of sporting charles which are now become venerable elms as high as many a steeple there they are met at a fitting rendezvous where a retired coachman with one leg keeps an hotel and a bowlinggreen i think i now see them upon the bowlinggreen the men of renown amidst hundreds of people with no renown at all who gaze upon them with timid wonder fame after all is a glorious thing though it lasts only for a day theres cribb the champion of england and perhaps the best man in england there he is with his huge massive figure and face wonderfully like that of a lion there is belcher the younger not the mighty one who is gone to his place but the teucer belcher the most scientific pugilist that ever entered a ring only wanting strength to be i wont say what he appears to walk before me now as he did that evening with his white hat white great coat thin genteel figure springy step and keen determined eye crosses him what a contrast grim savage shelton who has a civil word for nobody and a hard blow for anybodyhard one blow given with the proper play of his athletic arm will unsense a giant yonder individual who strolls about with his hands behind him supporting his brown coat lappets undersized and who looks anything but what he is is the king of the light weights so called randall the terrible randall who has irish blood in his veins not the better for that nor the worse and not far from him is his last antagonist ned turner who though beaten by him still thinks himself as good a man in which he is perhaps right for it was a near thing and a better shentleman in which he is quite right for he is a welshman but how shall i name them all they were there by dozens and all tremendous in their way there was bulldog hudson and fearless scroggins who beat the conqueror of sam the jew there was black richmondno he was not there but i knew him well he was the most dangerous of blacks even with a broken thigh there was purcell who could never conquer till all seemed over with him there waswhat shall i name thee last ay why not i believe that thou art the last of all thatstrong family still above the sod where mayst thou long continuetrue piece of english stuff tom of bedfordsharp as winter kind as spring hail to thee tom of bedford or by whatever name it may please thee to be called spring or winter hail to thee sixfoot englishman of the brown eye worthy to have carried a sixfoot bow at flodden where englands yeomen triumphed over scotlands king his clans and chivalry hail to thee last of englands bruisers after all the many victories which thou hast achievedtrue english victories unbought by yellow gold need i recount them nay nay they are already well known to famesufficient to say that bristols bull and irelands champion were vanquished by thee and one mightier still gold itself thou didst overcome for gold itself strove in vain to deaden the power of thy arm and thus thou didst proceed till men left off challenging thee the unvanquishable the incorruptible tis a treat to see thee tom of bedford in thy public in holborn way whither thou hast retired with thy wellearned bays tis friday night and nine by holborn clock there sits the yeoman at the end of his long room surrounded by his friends glasses are filled and a song is the cry and a song is sung well suited to the place it finds an echo in every heartfists are clenched arms are waved and the portraits of the mighty fighting men of yore broughton and slack and ben which adorn the walls appear to smile grim approbation whilst many a manly voice joins in the bold chorus heres a health to old honest john bull when hes gone we shant find such another and with hearts and with glasses brim full we will drink to old england his mother but the fight with respect to the fight what shall i say little can be said about itit was soon over some said that the brave from town who was reputed the best man of the two and whose form was a perfect model of athletic beauty allowed himself for lucre vile to be vanquished by the massive champion with the flattened nose one thing is certain that the former was suddenly seen to sink to the earth before a blow of by no means extraordinary power time time was called but there he lay upon the ground apparently senseless and from thence he did not lift his head till several seconds after the umpires had declared his adversary victor there were shouts indeed theres never a lack of shouts to celebrate a victory however acquired but there was also much grinding of teeth especially amongst the fighting men from town tom has sold us said they sold us to the yokels who would have thought it then there was fresh grinding of teeth and scowling brows were turned to the heaven but what is this is it possible does the heaven scowl too why only a quarter of an hour agobut what may not happen in a quarter of an hour for many weeks the weather had been of the most glorious description the eventful day too had dawned gloriously and so it had continued till some two hours after noon the fight was then over and about that time i looked upwhat a glorious sky of deep blue and what a big fierce sun swimming high above in the midst of that blue not a cloudthere had not been one for weeksnot a cloud to be seen only in the far west just on the horizon something like the extremity of a black wing that was only a quarter of an hour ago and now the whole northern side of the heaven is occupied by a huge black cloud and the sun is only occasionally seen amidst masses of driving vapour what a change but another fight is at hand and the pugilists are clearing the outer ringhow their huge whips come crashing upon the heads of the yokels blood flows more blood than in the fight those blows are given with right goodwill those are not sham blows whether of whip or fist it is with fist that grim shelton strikes down the big yokel he is always dangerous grim shelton but now particularly so for he has lost ten pounds betted on the brave who sold himself to the yokels but the outer ring is cleared and now the second fight commences it is between two champions of less renown than the others but is perhaps not the worse on that account a tall thin boy is fighting in the ring with a man somewhat under the middle size with a frame of adamant thats a gallant boy hes a yokel but he comes from brummagem he does credit to his extraction but his adversary has a frame of adamant in what a strange light they fight but who can wonder on looking at that frightful cloud usurping now onehalf of heaven and at the sun struggling with sulphurous vapour the face of the boy which is turned towards me looks horrible in that light but he is a brave boy he strikes his foe on the forehead and the report of the blow is like the sound of a hammer against a rock but there is a rush and a roar over head a wild commotion the tempest is beginning to break loose theres wind and dust a crash rain and hail is it possible to fight amidst such a commotion yes the fight goes on again the boy strikes the man full on the brow but it is of no use striking that man his frame is of adamant boy thy strength is beginning to give way thou art becoming confused the man now goes to work amidst rain and hail boy thou wilt not hold out ten minutes longer against rain hail and the blows of such an antagonist and now the storm was at its height the black thundercloud had broken into many which assumed the wildest shapes and the strangest colours some of them unspeakably glorious the rain poured in a deluge and more than one waterspout was seen at no great distance an immense rabble is hurrying in one direction a multitude of men of all ranks peers and yokels prizefighters and jews and the last came to plunder and are now plundering amidst that wild confusion of hail and rain men and horses carts and carriages but all hurry in one direction through mud and mire theres a town only three miles distant which is soon reached and soon filled it will not contain onethird of that mighty rabble but theres another town farther onthe good old city is farther on only twelve miles whats that wholl stay here onward to the old townhurry skurry a mixed multitude of men and horses carts and carriages all in the direction of the old town and in the midst of all that mad throng at a moment when the rain gushes were coming down with particular fury and the artillery of the sky was pealing as i had never heard it peal before i felt some one seize me by the armi turned round and beheld mr petulengro i cant hear you mr petulengro said i for the thunder drowned the words which he appeared to be uttering dearginni i heard mr petulengro say it thundereth i was asking brother whether you believe in dukkeripens i do not mr petulengro but this is strange weather to be asking me whether i believe in fortunes grondinni said mr petulengro it haileth i believe in dukkeripens brother and who has more right said i seeing that you live by them but this tempest is truly horrible dearginni grondinni ta villaminni it thundereth it haileth and also flameth said mr petulengro look up there brother i looked up connected with this tempest there was one feature to which i have already alludedthe wonderful colours of the clouds some were of vivid green others of the brightest orange others as black as pitch the gipsys finger was pointed to a particular part of the sky what do you see there brother a strange kind of cloud what does it look like brother something like a stream of blood that cloud foreshoweth a bloody dukkeripen a bloody fortune said i and whom may it betide who knows said the gypsy down the way dashing and splashing and scattering man horse and cart to the left and right came an open barouche drawn by four smoking steeds with postillions in scarlet jackets and leather skullcaps two forms were conspicuous in it that of the successful bruiser and of his friend and backer the sporting gentleman of my acquaintance his said the gypsy pointing to the latter whose stern features wore a smile of triumph as probably recognising me in the crowd he nodded in the direction of where i stood as the barouche hurried by there went the barouche dashing through the rain gushes and in it one whose boast it was that he was equal to either fortune many have heard of that manmany may be desirous of knowing yet more of him i have nothing to do with that mans after lifehe fulfilled his dukkeripen a bad violent man softly friend when thou wouldst speak harshly of the dead remember that thou hast not yet fulfilled thy own dukkeripenchapter xxvii my fatherpremature decaythe easy chaira few questionsso you told mea difficult languagethey call it haikmisused opportunitiessaulwant of candourdont weepheaven forgive medated from parisi wish he were herea fathers reminiscencesfarewell to vanities my father as i have already informed the reader had been endowed by nature with great corporeal strength indeed i have been assured that at the period of his prime his figure had denoted the possession of almost herculean powers the strongest forms however do not always endure the longest the very excess of the noble and generous juices which they contain being the cause of their premature decay but be that as it may the health of my father some few years after his retirement from the service to the quiet of domestic life underwent a considerable change his constitution appeared to be breaking up and he was subject to severe attacks from various disorders with which till then he had been utterly unacquainted he was however wont to rally more or less after his illnesses and might still occasionally be seen taking his walk with his cane in his hand and accompanied by his dog who sympathized entirely with him pining as he pined improving as he improved and never leaving the house save in his company and in this manner matters went on for a considerable time no very great apprehension with respect to my fathers state being raised either in my mothers breast or my own but about six months after the period at which i have arrived in my last chapter it came to pass that my father experienced a severer attack than on any previous occasion he had the best medical advice but it was easy to see from the looks of his doctors that they entertained but slight hopes of his recovery his sufferings were great yet he invariably bore them with unshaken fortitude there was one thing remarkable connected with his illness notwithstanding its severity it never confined him to his bed he was wont to sit in his little parlour in his easy chair dressed in a faded regimental coat his dog at his feet who would occasionally lift his head from the hearthrug on which he lay and look his master wistfully in the face and thus my father spent the greater part of his time sometimes in prayer sometimes in meditation and sometimes in reading the scriptures i frequently sat with him though as i entertained a great awe for my father i used to feel rather ill at ease when as sometimes happened i found myself alone with him i wish to ask you a few questions said he to me one day after my mother had left the room i will answer anything you may please to ask me my dear father what have you been about lately i have been occupied as usual attending at the office at the appointed hours and what do you there whatever i am ordered and nothing else oh yes sometimes i read a book connected with your profession not always i have been lately reading armenian whats that the language of a people whose country is a region on the other side of asia minor well a region abounding with mountains well amongst which is mount ararat well upon which as the bible informs us the ark rested wellit is the language of the people of those regions so you told me and i have been reading the bible in their language well or rather i should say in the ancient language of these people from which i am told the modern armenian differs considerably well as much as the italian from the latin well so i have been reading the bible in ancient armenian you told me so before i found it a highly difficult language yes differing widely from the languages in general with which i am acquainted yes exhibiting however some features in common with them yes and sometimes agreeing remarkably in words with a certain strange wild speech with which i became acquainted irish no father not irishwith which i became acquainted by the greatest chance in the world yes but of which i need say nothing further at present and which i should not have mentioned but for that fact well which i consider remarkable yes the armenian is copious is it with an alphabet of thirtynine letters but it is harsh and guttural yes like the language of most mountainous peoplethe armenians call it haik do they and themselves haik also they are a remarkable people and though their original habitation is the mountain of ararat they are to be found like the jews all over the world wellwell father thats all i can tell you about haiks or armenians and what does it all amount to very little father indeed there is very little known about the armenians their early history in particular is involved in considerable mystery and if you knew all that it was possible to know about them to what would it amount to what earthly purpose could you turn it have you acquired any knowledge of your profession very little father very little have you acquired all in your power i cant say that i have father and yet it was your duty to have done so but i see how it is you have shamefully misused your opportunities you are like one who sent into the field to labour passes his time in flinging stones at the birds of heaven i would scorn to fling a stone at a bird father you know what i mean and all too well and this attempt to evade deserved reproof by feigned simplicity is quite in character with your general behaviour i have ever observed about you a want of frankness which has distressed me you never speak of what you are about your hopes or your projects but cover yourself with mystery i never knew till the present moment that you were acquainted with armenian because you never asked me father theres nothing to conceal in the matteri will tell you in a moment how i came to learn armenian a lady whom i met at one of mrs s parties took a fancy to me and has done me the honour to allow me to go and see her sometimes she is the widow of a rich clergyman and on her husbands death came to this place to live bringing her husbands library with her i soon found my way to it and examined every book her husband must have been a learned man for amongst much greek and hebrew i found several volumes in armenian or relating to the language and why did you not tell me of this before because you never questioned me but i repeat there is nothing to conceal in the matter the lady took a fancy to me and being fond of the arts drew my portrait she said the expression of my countenance put her in mind of alfieris saul and do you still visit her no she soon grew tired of me and told people that she found me very stupid she gave me the armenian books however saul said my father musingly saul i am afraid she was only too right there he disobeyed the commands of his master and brought down on his head the vengeance of heavenhe became a maniac prophesied and flung weapons about him he was indeed an awful characteri hope i shant turn out like him god forbid said my father solemnly but in many respects you are headstrong and disobedient like him i placed you in a profession and besought you to make yourself master of it by giving it your undivided attention this however you did not do you know nothing of it but tell me that you are acquainted with armenian but what i dislike most is your want of candouryou are my son but i know little of your real history you may know fifty things for what i am aware you may know how to shoe a horse for what i am aware not only to shoe a horse father but to make horseshoes perhaps so said my father and it only serves to prove what i am just saying that i know little about you but you easily may my dear father i will tell you anything that you may wish to knowshall i inform you how i learnt to make horseshoes no said my father as you kept it a secret so long it may as well continue so still had you been a frank openhearted boy like one i could name you would have told me all about it of your own accord but i now wish to ask you a serious questionwhat do you propose to doto do father yes the time for which you were articled to your profession will soon be expired and i shall be no more do not talk so my dear father i have no doubt that you will soon be better do not flatter yourself i feel that my days are numbered i am soon going to my rest and i have need of rest for i am weary there there dont weep tears will help me as little as they will you you have not yet answered my question tell me what you intend to do i really do not know what i shall do the military pension which i enjoy will cease with my life the property which i shall leave behind me will be barely sufficient for the maintenance of your mother respectably i again ask you what you intend to do do you think you can support yourself by your armenian or your other acquirements alas i think little at all about it but i suppose i must push into the world and make a good fight as becomes the son of him who fought big ben if i cant succeed and am driven to the worst it is but dying what do you mean by dying leaving the world my loss would scarcely be felt i have never held life in much value and every one has a right to dispose as he thinks best of that which is his own ah now i understand you and well i know how and where you imbibed that horrible doctrine and many similar ones which i have heard from your mouth but i wish not to reproach youi view in your conduct a punishment for my own sins and i bow to the will of god few and evil have been my days upon the earth little have i done to which i can look back with satisfaction it is true i have served my king fifty years and i have fought withheaven forgive me what was i about to saybut you mentioned the mans name and our minds willingly recall our ancient follies few and evil have been my days upon earth i may say with jacob of old though i do not mean to say that my case is so hard as his he had many undutiful children whilst i have only but i will not reproach you i have also like him a son to whom i can look with hope who may yet preserve my name when i am gone so let me be thankful perhaps after all i have not lived in vain boy when i am gone look up to your brother and may god bless you both there dont weep but take the bible and read me something about the old man and his children my brother had now been absent for the space of three years at first his letters had been frequent and from them it appeared that he was following his profession in london with industry they then became rather rare and my father did not always communicate their contents his last letter however had filled him and our whole little family with joy it was dated from paris and the writer was evidently in high spirits after describing in eloquent terms the beauties and gaieties of the french capital he informed us how he had plenty of money having copied a celebrated picture of one of the italian masters for a hungarian nobleman for which he had received a large sum he wishes me to go with him to italy added he but i am fond of independence and if ever i visit old rome i will have no patrons near me to distract my attention but six months had now elapsed from the date of this letter and we had heard no farther intelligence of my brother my fathers complaint increased the gout his principal enemy occasionally mounted high up in his system and we had considerable difficulty in keeping it from the stomach where it generally proves fatal i now devoted almost the whole of my time to my father on whom his faithful partner also lavished every attention and care i read the bible to him which was his chief delight and also occasionally such other books as i thought might prove entertaining to him his spirits were generally rather depressed the absence of my brother appeared to prey upon his mind i wish he were here he would frequently exclaim i cant imagine what can have become of him i trust however he will arrive in time he still sometimes rallied and i took advantage of those moments of comparative ease to question him upon the events of his early life my attentions to him had not passed unnoticed and he was kind fatherly and unreserved i had never known my father so entertaining as at these moments when his life was but too evidently drawing to a close i had no idea that he knew and had seen so much my respect for him increased and i looked upon him almost with admiration his anecdotes were in general highly curious some of them related to people in the highest stations and to men whose names were closely connected with some of the brightest glories of our native land he had frequently conversed almost on terms of familiaritywith good old george he had known the conqueror of tippoo saib and was the friend of townshend who when wolfe fell led the british grenadiers against the shrinking regiments of montcalm pity he added that when oldold as i am nowhe should have driven his own son mad by robbing him of his plighted bride but so it was he married his sons bride i saw him lead her to the altar if ever there was an angelic countenance it was that girls she was almost too fair to be one of the daughters of women is there anything boy that you would wish to ask me now is the time yes father there is one about whom i would fain question youwho is it shall i tell you about elliot no father not about elliot but pray dont be angry i should like to know something about big ben you are a strange lad said my father and though of late i have begun to entertain a more favourable opinion than heretofore there is still much about you that i do not understand why do you bring up that name dont you know that it is one of my temptations you wish to know something about him well i will oblige you this once and then farewell to such vanitiessomething about him i will tell youhis skin when he flung off his clothesand he had a particular knack in doing sohis skin when he bared his mighty chest and back for combat and when he fought he stood soif i remember righthis skin i say was brown and dusky as that of a toad oh me i wish my elder son was herechapter xxviii my brothers arrivalthe interviewnighta dying fatherchrist at last my brother arrived he looked pale and unwell i met him at the door you have been long absent said i yes said he perhaps too long but how is my father very poorly said i he has had a fresh attack but where have you been of late far and wide said my brother but i cant tell you anything now i must go to my father it was only by chance that i heard of his illness stay a moment said i is the world such a fine place as you supposed it to be before you went away not quite said my brother not quite indeed i wishbut ask me no questions now i must hasten to my father there was another question on my tongue but i forbore for the eyes of the young man were full of tears i pointed with my finger and the young man hastened past me to the arms of his father i forbore to ask my brother whether he had been to old rome what passed between my father and brother i do not know the interview no doubt was tender enough for they tenderly loved each other but my brothers arrival did not produce the beneficial effect upon my father which i at first hoped it would it did not even appear to have raised his spirits he was composed enough however i ought to be grateful said he i wished to see my son and god has granted me my wish what more have i to do now than to bless my little family and go my fathers end was evidently at hand and did i shed no tears did i breathe no sighs did i never wring my hands at this period the reader will perhaps be asking whatever i did and thought is best known to god and myself but it will be as well to observe that it is possible to feel deeply and yet make no outward sign and now for the closing scene at the dead hour of night it might be about two i was awakened from sleep by a cry which sounded from the room immediately below that in which i slept i knew the cry it was the cry of my mother and i also knew its import yet i made no effort to rise for i was for the moment paralyzed again the cry sounded yet still i lay motionlessthe stupidity of horror was upon me a third time and it was then that by a violent effort bursting the spell which appeared to bind me i sprang from the bed and rushed down stairs my mother was running wildly about the room she had woke and found my father senseless in the bed by her side i essayed to raise him and after a few efforts supported him in the bed in a sitting posture my brother now rushed in and snatching up a light that was burning he held it to my fathers face the surgeon the surgeon he cried then dropping the light he ran out of the room followed by my mother i remained alone supporting the senseless form of my father the light had been extinguished by the fall and an almost total darkness reigned in the room the form pressed heavily against my bosomat last methought it moved yes i was right there was a heaving of the breast and then a gasping were those words which i heard yes they were words low and indistinct at first and then audible the mind of the dying man was reverting to former scenes i heard him mention names which i had often heard him mention before it was an awful moment i felt stupified but i still contrived to support my dying father there was a pause again my father spoke i heard him speak of minden and of meredith the old minden sergeant and then he uttered another name which at one period of his life was much in his lips the name of but this is a solemn moment there was a deep gasp i shook and thought all was over but i was mistakenmy father moved and revived for a moment he supported himself in bed without my assistance i make no doubt that for a moment he was perfectly sensible and it was then that clasping his hands he uttered another name clearly distinctlyit was the name of christ with that name upon his lips the brave old soldier sank back upon my bosom and with his hands still clasped yielded up his soulchapter xxix the greetingqueer figurecheer upthe cheerful fireit will dothe sally forthtrepidationlet him come in oneandninepence sir or the things which you have brought with you will be taken away from you such were the first words which greeted my ears one damp misty morning in march as i dismounted from the top of a coach in the yard of a london inn i turned round for i felt that the words were addressed to myself plenty of people were in the yardporters passengers coachmen ostlers and others who appeared to be intent on anything but myself with the exception of one individual whose business appeared to lie with me and who now confronted me at the distance of about two yards i looked hard at the manand a queer kind of individual he was to look ata rakish figure about thirty and of the middle size dressed in a coat smartly cut but threadbare very tight pantaloons of blue stuff tied at the ankles dirty white stockings and thin shoes like those of a dancingmaster his features were not ugly but rather haggard and he appeared to owe his complexion less to nature than carmine in fact in every respect a very queer figure oneandninepence sir or your things will be taken away from you he said in a kind of lisping tone coming yet nearer to me i still remained staring fixedly at him but never a word answered our eyes met whereupon he suddenly lost the easy impudent air which he before wore he glanced for a moment at my fist which i had by this time clenched and his features became yet more haggard he faltered a fresh oneandninepence which he was about to utter died on his lips he shrank back disappeared behind a coach and i saw no more of him oneandninepence or my things will be taken away from me said i to myself musingly as i followed the porter to whom i had delivered my scanty baggage am i to expect many of these greetings in the big world well never mind i think i know the countersign and i clenched my fist yet harder than before so i followed the porter through the streets of london to a lodging which had been prepared for me by an acquaintance the morning as i have before said was gloomy and the streets through which i passed were dank and filthy the people also looked dank and filthy and so probably did i for the night had been rainy and i had come upwards of a hundred miles on the top of a coach my heart had sunk within me by the time we reached a dark narrow street in which was the lodging cheer up young man said the porter we shall have a fine afternoon and presently i found myself in the lodging which had been prepared for me it consisted of a small room up two pair of stairs in which i was to sit and another still smaller above it in which i was to sleep i remember that i sat down and looked disconsolate about meeverything seemed so cold and dingy yet how little is required to make a situation however cheerless at first sightcheerful and comfortable the people of the house who looked kindly upon me lighted a fire in the dingy grate and then what a changethe dingy room seemed dingy no more oh the luxury of a cheerful fire after a chill nights journey i drew near to the blazing grate rubbed my hands and felt glad and when i had warmed myself i turned to the table on which by this time the people of the house had placed my breakfast and i ate and i drank and as i ate and drank i mused within myself and my eyes were frequently directed to a small green box which constituted part of my luggage and which with the rest of my things stood in one corner of the room till at last leaving my breakfast unfinished i rose and going to the box unlocked it and took out two or three bundles of papers tied with red tape and placing them on the table i resumed my seat and my breakfast my eyes intently fixed upon the bundles of papers all the time and when i had drained the last cup of tea out of a dingy teapot and ate the last slice of the dingy loaf i untied one of the bundles and proceeded to look over the papers which were closely written over in a singular hand and i read for some time till at last i said to myself it will do and then i looked at the other bundle for some time without untying it and at last i said it will do also and then i turned to the fire and putting my feet against the sides of the grate i leaned back on my chair and with my eyes upon the fire fell into deep thought and there i continued in thought before the fire until my eyes closed and i fell asleep which was not to be wondered at after the fatigue and cold which i had lately undergone on the coachtop and in my sleep i imagined myself still there amidst darkness and rain hurrying now over wild heaths and now along roads overhung with thick and umbrageous trees and sometimes methought i heard the horn of the guard and sometimes the voice of the coachman now chiding now encouraging his horses as they toiled through the deep and miry ways at length a tremendous crack of a whipsaluted the tympanum of my ear and i started up broad awake nearly oversetting the chair on which i reclinedand lo i was in the dingy room before the fire which was by this time half extinguished in my dream i had confounded the noise of the street with those of my nightjourney the crack which had aroused me i soon found proceeded from the whip of a carter who with many oaths was flogging his team below the window looking at a clock which stood upon the mantelpiece i perceived that it was past eleven whereupon i said to myself i am wasting my time foolishly and unprofitably forgetting that i am now in the big world without anything to depend upon save my own exertions and then i adjusted my dress and locking up the bundle of papers which i had not read i tied up the other and taking it under my arm i went down stairs and after asking a question or two of the people of the house i sallied forth into the street with a determined look though at heart i felt somewhat timorous at the idea of venturing out alone into the mazes of the mighty city of which i had heard much but of which of my own knowledge i knew nothing i had however no great cause for anxiety in the present instance i easily found my way to the place which i was in quest ofone of the many new squares on the northern side of the metropolis and which was scarcely ten minutes walk from the street in which i had taken up my abode arriving before the door of a tolerably large house which bore a certain number i stood still for a moment in a kind of trepidation looking anxiously at the door i then slowly passed on till i came to the end of the square where i stood still and pondered for awhile suddenly however like one who has formed a resolution i clenched my right hand flinging my hat somewhat on one side and turning back with haste to the door before which i had stopped i sprang up the steps and gave a loud rap ringing at the same time the bell of the area after the lapse of a minute the door was opened by a maidservant of no very cleanly or prepossessing appearance of whom i demanded in a tone of some hauteur whether the master of the house was at home glancing for a moment at the white paper bundle beneath my arm the handmaid made no reply in words but with a kind of toss of her head flung the door open standing on one side as if to let me enter i did enter and the handmaid having opened another door on the right hand went in and said something which i could not hear after a considerable pause however i heard the voice of a man say let him come in whereupon the handmaid coming out motioned me to enter and on my obeying instantly closed the door behind mechapter xxx the sinister glanceexcellent correspondentquite originalmy systema losing trademeritstarting a reviewwhat have you gotstopdairymans daughteroxford principlesmore conversationhow is this there were two individuals in the room in which i now found myself it was a small study surrounded with bookcases the window looking out upon the square of these individuals he who appeared to be the principal stood with his back to the fireplace he was a tall stout man about sixty dressed in a loose morning gown the expression of his countenance would have been bluff but for a certain sinister glance and his complexion might have been called rubicund but for a considerable tinge of bilious yellow he eyed me askance as i entered the other a pale shrivelledlooking person sat at a table apparently engaged with an accountbook he took no manner of notice of me never once lifting his eyes from the page before him well sir what is your pleasure said the big man in a rough tone as i stood there looking at him wistfullyas well i mightfor upon that man at the time of which i am speaking my principal i may say my only hopes rested sir said i my name is soandso and i am the bearer of a letter to you from mr soandso an old friend and correspondent of yours the countenance of the big man instantly lost the suspicious and lowering expression which it had hitherto exhibited he strode forward and seizing me by the hand gave me a violent squeeze my dear sir said he i am rejoiced to see you in london i have been long anxious for the pleasurewe are old friends though we have never before met taggart said he to the man who sat at the desk this is our excellent correspondent the friend and pupil of our other excellent correspondent the pale shrivelledlooking man slowly and deliberately raised his head from the accountbook and surveyed me for a moment or two not the slightest emotion was observable in his countenance it appeared to me however that i could detect a droll twinkle in his eye his curiosity if he had any was soon gratified he made me a kind of bow pulled out a snuffbox took a pinch of snuff and again bent his head over the page and now my dear sir said the big man pray sit down and tell me the cause of your visit i hope you intend to remain here a day or two more than that said i i am come to take up my abode in london glad to hear it and what have you been about of late got anything which will suit me sir i admire your style of writing and your manner of thinking and i am much obliged to my good friend and correspondent for sending me some of your productions i inserted them all and wished there had been more of themquite original sir quite took with the public especially the essay about the nonexistence of anything i dont exactly agree with you though i have my own peculiar ideas about matteras you know of course from the book i have published nevertheless a very pretty piece of speculative philosophyno such thing as matterimpossible that there should beex nihilowhat is the greek i have forgotvery pretty indeed very original i am afraid sir it was very wrong to write such trash and yet more to allow it to be published trash not at all a very pretty piece of speculative philosophy of course you were wrong in saying there is no world the world must exist to have the shape of a pear and that the world is shaped like a pear and not like an apple as the fools of oxford say i have satisfactorily proved in my book now if there were no world what would become of my system but what do you propose to do in london here is the letter sir said i of our good friend which i have not yet given to you i believe it will explain to you the circumstances under which i come he took the letter and perused it with attention hem said he with a somewhat altered manner my friend tells me that you are come up to london with the view of turning your literary talents to account and desires me to assist you in my capacity of publisher in bringing forth two or three works which you have prepared my good friend is perhaps not aware that for some time past i have given up publishingwas obliged to do sohad many severe lossesdo nothing at present in that line save sending out the magazine once a month and between ourselves am thinking of disposing of thatwish to retirehigh time at my ageso you see i am very sorry sir to hear that you cannot assist me and i remember that i felt very nervous i had hoped a losing trade i assure you sir literature is a drug taggart what oclock is itwell sir said i rising as you cannot assist me i will now take my leave i thank you sincerely for your kind reception and will trouble you no longer oh dont go i wish to have some further conversation with you and perhaps i may hit upon some plan to benefit you i honour merit and always make a point to encourage it when i can buttaggart go to the bank and tell them to dishonour the bill twelve months after date for thirty pounds which becomes due tomorrow i am dissatisfied with that fellow who wrote the fairy tales and intend to give him all the trouble in my power make haste taggart did not appear to be in any particular haste first of all he took a pinch of snuff then rising from his chair slowly and deliberately drew his wig for he wore a wig of a brown colour rather more over his forehead than it had previously been buttoned his coat and taking his hat and an umbrella which stood in a corner made me a low bow and quitted the room well sir where were we oh i remember we were talking about merit sir i always wish to encourage merit especially when it comes so highly recommended as in the present instance sir my good friend and correspondent speaks of you in the highest terms sir i honour my good friend and have the highest respect for his opinion in all matters connected with literaturerather eccentric though sir my good friend has done my periodical more good and more harm than all the rest of my correspondents sir i shall never forget the sensation caused by the appearance of his article about a certain personage whom he provedand i think satisfactorilyto have been a legionary soldierrather startling was it not the s of the world a common soldier in a marching regimentoriginal but startling sir i honour my good friend so you have renounced publishing sir said i with the exception of the magazine why yes except now and then under the rose the old coachman you know likes to hear the whip indeed at the present moment i am thinking of starting a review on an entirely new and original principle and it just struck me that you might be of high utility in the undertakingwhat do you think of the matter i should be happy sir to render you any assistance but i am afraid the employment you propose requires other qualifications than i possess however i can make the essay my chief intention in coming to london was to lay before the world what i had prepared and i had hoped by your assistance ah i see ambition ambition is a very pretty thing but sir we must walk before we run according to the old saying what is that you have got under your arm one of the works to which i was alluding the one indeed which i am most anxious to lay before the world as i hope to derive from it both profit and reputation indeed what do you call it ancient songs of denmark heroic and romantic translated by myself with notes philological critical and historical then sir i assure you that your time and labour have been entirely flung away nobody would read your ballads if you were to give them to the world tomorrow i am sure sir that you would say otherwise if you would permit me to read one to you and without waiting for the answer of the big man nor indeed so much as looking at him to see whether he was inclined or not to hear me i undid my manuscript and with a voice trembling with eagerness i read to the following effect buckshank bold and elfinstone and more than i can mention here they caused to be built so stout a ship and unto iceland they would steer they launched the ship upon the main which bellowed like a wrathful bear down to the bottom the vessel sank a laidly trold has dragged it there down to the bottom sank young roland and round about he groped awhile until he found the path which led unto the bower of ellenlyle stop said the publisher very pretty indeed and very original beats scott hollow and percy too but sir the day forthese things is gone by nobody at present cares for percy nor for scott either save as a novelist sorry to discourage merit sir but what can i do what else have you got the songs of ab gwilym the welsh bard also translated by myself with notes critical philological and historical pass onwhat else nothing else said i folding up my manuscript with a sigh unless it be a romance in the german style on which i confess i set very little value wild yes sir very wild like the miller of the black valley yes sir very much like the miller of the black valley well thats better said the publisher and yet i dont know i question whether any one at present cares for the miller himself no sir the time for those things is also gone by german at present is a drug and between ourselves nobody has contributed to make it so more than my good friend and correspondentbut sir i see you are a young gentleman of infinite merit and i always wish to encourage merit dont you think you could write a series of evangelical tales evangelical tales sir yes sir evangelical novels something in the style of herder herder is a drug sir nobody cares for herderthanks to my good friend sir i have in yon drawer a hundred pages about herder which i dare not insert in my periodical it would sink it sir no sir something in the style of the dairymans daughter i never heard of the work till the present moment then sir procure it by all means sir i could afford as much as ten pounds for a wellwritten tale in the style of the dairymans daughter that is the kind of literature sir that sells at the present day it is not the miller of the black valley no sir nor herder either that will suit the present taste the evangelical body is becoming very strong sir the canting scoundrels but sir surely you would not pander to a scoundrelly taste then sir i must give up business altogether sir i have a great respect for the goddess reasonan infinite respect sir indeed in my time i have made a great many sacrifices for her but sir i cannot altogether ruin myself for the goddess reason sir i am a friend to liberty as is well known but i must also be a friend to my own family it is with the view of providing for a son of mine that i am about to start the review of which i am speaking he has taken into his head to marry sir and i must do something for him for he can do but little for himself well sir i am a friend to liberty as i said before and likewise a friend to reason but i tell you frankly that the review which i intend to get up under the rose and present him with when it is established will be conducted on oxford principles orthodox principles i suppose you mean sir i do sir i am no linguist but i believe the words are synonymous much more conversation passed between us and it was agreed that i should become a contributor to the oxford review i stipulated however that as i knew little of politics and cared less no other articles should be required from me than such as were connected with belleslettres and philology to this the big man readily assented nothing will be required from you said he but what you mention and now and then perhaps a paper on metaphysics you understand german and perhaps it would be desirable that you should review kant and in a review of kant sir you could introduce to advantage your peculiar notions about ex nihilo he then reverted to the subject of the dairymans daughter which i promised to take into consideration as i was going away he invited me to dine with him on the ensuing sunday thats a strange man said i to myself after i had left the house he is evidently very clever but i cannot say that i like him much with his oxford reviews and dairymans daughters but what can i do i am almost without a friend in the world i wish i could find some one who would publish my ballads or my songs of ab gwilym in spite of what the big mansays i am convinced that once published they would bring me much fame and profit but how is thiswhat a beautiful sunthe porter was right in saying that the day would clear upi will now go to my dingy lodging lock up my manuscripts and then take a stroll about the big citychapter xxxi the walklondons cheapestreet of the lombardsstrange bridgemain archthe roaring gulfthe boat clyfakinga comfortthe bookthe blessed womanno trap so i set out on my walk to see the wonders of the big city and as chance would have it i directed my course to the east the day as i have already said had become very fine so that i saw the great city to advantage and the wonders thereof and much i admired all i saw and amongst other things the huge cathedral standing so proudly on the most commanding ground in the big city and i looked up to the mighty dome surmounted by a golden cross and i said within myself that dome must needs be the finest in the world and i gazed upon it till my eyes reeled and my brain became dizzy and i thought that the dome would fall and crush me and i shrank within myself and struck yet deeper into the heart of the big city o cheapside cheapside said i as i advanced up that mighty thoroughfare truly thou art a wonderful place for hurry noise and riches men talk of the bazaars of the easti have never seen thembut i dare say that compared with thee they are poor places silent places abounding with empty boxes o thou pride of londons eastmighty mart of old renownfor thou art not a place of yesterdaylong before the roses red and white battled in fair england thou didst exista place of throng and bustlea place of gold and silver perfumes and fine linen centuries ago thou couldst extort the praises even of the fiercest foes of england fierce bards of wales sworn foes of england sang thy praises centuries ago and even the fiercest of them all red julius himself wild glendowers bard had a word of praise for londons cheape for so the bards of wales styled thee in their flowing odes then if those who were not english and hated england and all connected therewith had yet much to say in thy praise when thou wast far inferior to what thou art now why should trueborn englishmen or those who call themselves so turn up their noses at thee and scoff thee at the present day as i believe they do but let others do as they will i at least who am not only an englishman but an east englishman will not turn up my nose at thee but will praise and extol thee calling thee mart of the worlda place of wonder and astonishmentand were it right and fitting to wish that anything should endure for ever i would say prosperity to cheapside throughout all agesmay it be the worlds resort for merchandise world without end and when i had passed through the cheape i entered another street which led up a kind of ascent and which proved to be the street of the lombards called so from the name of its founders and i walked rapidly up the street of the lombards neither looking to the right nor left for it had no interest for me though i had a kind of consciousness that mighty things were being transacted behind its walls but it wanted the throng bustle and outward magnificence of the cheape and it had never been spoken of by ruddy bards and when i had got to the end of the street of the lombards i stood still for some time deliberating within myself whether i should turn to the right or the left or go straight forward and at last i turned to the right down a street of rapid descent and presently found myself upon a bridge which traversed the river which runs by the big city a strange kind of bridge it was huge and massive and seemingly of great antiquity it had an arched back like that of a hog a high balustrade and at either side at intervals were stone bowers bulking over the river but open on the other side and furnished with a semicircular bench though the bridge was widevery wideit was all too narrow for the concourse upon it thousands of human beings were pouring over the bridge but what chiefly struck my attention was a double row of carts and waggons the generality drawn by horses as large as elephants each row striving hard in a different direction and not unfrequently brought to a standstill oh the cracking of whips the shouts and oaths of the carters and the grating of wheels upon the enormous stones that formed the pavement in fact there was a wild hurlyburly upon the bridge which nearly deafened me but if upon the bridge there was a confusion below it there was a confusion ten times confounded the tide which was fast ebbing obstructed by the immense piers of the old bridge poured beneath the arches with a fall of several feet forming in the river below as many whirlpools as there were arches truly tremendous was the roar of the descending waters and the bellow of the tremendous gulfs which swallowed them for a time and then cast them forth foaming and frothing from their horrid wombs slowly advancing along the bridge i came to the highest point and there i stood still close beside one of the stone bowers in which beside a fruitstall sat an old woman with a pan of charcoal at her feet and a book in her hand in which she appeared to be reading intently there i stood just above the principal arch looking through the balustrade at the scene that presented itselfand such a scene towards the left bank of the river a forest of masts thick and close as far as the eye could reach spacious wharfs surmounted with gigantic edifices and far away cæsars castle with its white tower to the right another forest of masts and a maze of buildings from which here and there shot up to the sky chimneys taller than cleopatras needle vomiting forth huge wreaths of that black smoke which forms the canopyoccasionally a gorgeous oneof the more than babel city stretching before me the troubled breast of the mighty river and immediately below the main whirlpool of the thamesthe maëlstrom of the bulwarks of the middle archa grisly pool which with its superabundance of horror fascinated me who knows but i should have leapt into its depthsi have heard of such thingsbut for a rather startling occurrence which broke the spell as i stood upon the bridge gazing into the jaws of the pool a small boat shot suddenly through the arch beneath my feet there were three persons in it an oarsman in the middle whilst a man and woman sat at the stern i shall never forget the thrill of horror which went through me at thissudden apparition whata boata small boatpassing beneath that arch into yonder roaring gulf yes yes down through that awful waterway with more than the swiftness of an arrow shot the boat or skiff right into the jaws of the pool a monstrous breaker curls over the prowthere is no hope the boat is swamped and all drowned in that strangling vortex no the boat which appeared to have the buoyancy of a feather skipped over the threatening horror and the next moment was out of danger the boatmana true boatman of cockaigne thatelevating one of his sculls in sign of triumph the man hallooing and the woman a true englishwoman thatof a certain classwaving her shawl whether any one observed them save myself or whether the feat was a common one i know not but nobody appeared to take any notice of them as for myself i was so excited that i strove to clamber up the balustrade of the bridge in order to obtain a better view of the daring adventurers before i could accomplish my design however i felt myself seized by the body and turning my head perceived the old fruitwoman who was clinging to me nay dear dontdont said she dont fling yourself overperhaps you may have better luck next time i was not going to fling myself over said i dropping from the balustrade how came you to think of such a thing why seeing you clamber up so fiercely i thought you might have had ill luck and that you wished to make away with yourself ill luck said i going into the stone bower and sitting down what do you mean ill luck in what why no great harm dear clyfaking perhaps are you coming over me with dialects said i speaking unto me in fashions i wot nothing of nay dear dont look so strange with those eyes of yourn nor talk so strangely i dont understand you nor i you what do you mean by clyfaking lor dear no harm only taking a handkerchief now and then do you take me for a thief nay dear dont make use of bad language we never calls them thieves here but prigs and fakers to tell you the truth dear seeing you spring at that railing put me in mind of my own dear son who is now at botny when he had bad luck he always used to talk of flinging himself over the bridge and sure enough when the traps were after him he did fling himself into the river but that was off the bank nevertheless the traps pulled him out and he is now suffering his sentence so you see you may speak out if you have done anything in the harmless line for i am my sons own mother i assure you so you think theres no harm in stealing no harm in the world dear do you think my own child would have been transported for it if there had been any harm in it and whats more would the blessed woman in the book here have written her life as she has done and given it to the world if there had been any harm in faking she too was what they call a thief and a cutpurse ay and was transported for it like my dear son and do you think she would have told the world so if there had been any harm in the thing oh it is a comfort to me that the blessed woman was transported and came backfor come back she did and rich toofor it is an assurance to me that my dear son who was transported too will come back like her what was her name her name blessed mary flanders will you let me look at the book yes dear that i will if you promise me not to run away with it i took the book from her hand a short thick volume at least a century old bound with greasy black leather i turned the yellow and dogseared pages reading here and there a sentence yes and no mistake his pen his style his spirit might be observed in every line of the uncouthlooking old volumethe air the style the spirit of the writer of the book which first taught me to read i covered my face with my hand and thought of my childhood this is a singular book said i at last but it does not appear to have been written to prove that thieving is no harm but rather to show the terrible consequences of crime it contains a deep moral a deep what dearabut no matter i will give you a crown for this volume no dear i will not sell the volume for a crown i am poor said i but i will give you two silver crowns for your volume no dear i will not sell my volume for two silver crowns no nor for the golden one in the kings tower down there without my book i should mope and pine and perhaps fling myself into the river but i am glad you like it which shows that i was right about you after all you are one of our party and you have a flash about that eye of yours which puts me just in mind of my dear son no dear i wont sell you my book but if you like you may have a peep into it whenever you come this way i shall be glad to see you you are one of the right sort for if you had been a common one you would have run away with the thing but you scorn such behaviour and as you are so flash of your money though you say you are poor you may give me a tanner to buy a little baccy with i love baccy dear more by token that it comes from the plantations to which the blessed woman was sent whats a tanner said i lor dont you know dear why a tanner is sixpence and as you were talking just now about crowns it will be as well to tell you that those of our trade never calls them crowns but bulls but i am talking nonsense just as if you did not know all that already as well as myself you are only shammingim no trap dear nor more was the blessed woman in the book thank you dearthank you for the tanner if i dont spend it ill keep it in remembrance of your sweet face what you are goingwell first let me whisper a word to you if you have any clies to sell at any time ill buy them of you all safe with me i never peach and scorns a trap so now dear god bless you and give you good luck thank you for your pleasant company and thank you for the tannerchapter xxxii the tannerthe hoteldrinking claretlondon journalnew fieldcommonplacenessthe three individuals botherationfrank and ardent tanner said i musingly as i left the bridge tanner what can the man who cures raw skins by means of a preparation of oakbark and other materials have to do with the name which these fakers as they call themselves bestow on the smallest silver coin in these dominions tanner i cant trace the connection between the man of bark and the silver coin unless journeymen tanners are in the habit of working for sixpence a day but i have it i continued flourishing my hat over my head tanner in this instance is not an english word is it not surprising that the language of mr petulengro and of tawno chikno is continually coming to my assistance whenever i appear to be at a nonplus with respect to the derivation of crabbed words i have made out crabbed words in æschylus by means of the speech of chikno and petulengro and even in my biblical researches i have derived no slight assistance from it it appears to be a kind of picklock an open sesame tannertawno the one is but a modification of the other they were originally identical and have still much the same signification tanner in the language of the applewoman meaneth the smallest of english silver coins and tawno in the language of the petulengros though bestowed upon the biggest of the romans according to strict interpretation signifieth a little child so i left the bridge retracing my steps for a considerable way as i thought i had seen enough in the direction in which i had hitherto been wandering i should say that i scarcely walked less than thirty miles about the big city on the day of my first arrival night came on but still i was walking about my eyes wide open and admiring everything that presented itself to them everything was new to me for everything is different in london from what it is elsewherethe people their language the horses the tout ensembleeven the stones of london are different from othersat least it appeared to me that i had never walked with the same ease and facility on the flagstones of a country town as on those of london so i continued roving about till night came on and then the splendour of some of the shops particularly struck me a regular arabian nights entertainment said i as i looked into one on cornhill gorgeous with precious merchandise and lighted up with lustres the rays of which were reflected from a hundred mirrors but notwithstanding the excellence of the london pavement i began about nine oclock to feel myself thoroughly tired painfully and slowly did i drag my feet along i also felt very much in want of some refreshment and i remembered that since breakfast i had taken nothing i was now in the strand and glancing about i perceived that i was close by an hotel which bore over the door the somewhat remarkable name of holy lands without a moments hesitation i entered a welllighted passage and turning to the left i found myself in a welllighted coffeeroom with a welldressed and frizzled waiter before me bring me some claret said i for i was rather faint than hungry and i felt ashamed to give a humbler order to so welldressed an individual the waiter looked at me for a moment then making a low bow he bustled off and i sat myself down in the box nearest to the window presently the waiter returned bearing beneath his left arm a long bottle and between the fingers of his right hand two large purple glasses placing the latter on the table he produced a corkscrew drew the cork in a twinkling set the bottle down before me with a bang and then standing still appeared to watch my movements you think i dont know how to drink a glass of claret thought i to myself ill soon show you how we drink claret where i come from and filling one of the glasses to the brim i flickered it for a moment between my eyes and the lustre and then held it to my nose having given that organ full time to test the bouquet of the wine i applied the glass to my lips taking a large mouthful of the wine which i swallowed slowly and by degrees that the palate might likewise have an opportunity of performing its functions a second mouthful i disposed of more summarily then placing the empty glass upon the table i fixed my eyes upon the bottle and saidnothing whereupon the waiter who had been observing the whole process with considerable attention made me a bow yet more low than before and turning on his heel retired with a smart chuck of his head as much as to say it is all right the young man is used to claret and when the waiter had retired i took a second glass of the wine which i found excellent and observing a newspaper lying near me i took it up and began perusing it it has been observed somewhere that people who are in the habit of reading newspapers every day are not unfrequently struck with the excellence of style and general talent which they display now if that be the case how must i have been surprised who was reading a newspaper for the first time and that one of the best of the london journals yes strange as it may seem it was nevertheless true that up to the moment of which i am speaking i had never read a newspaper of any description i of course had frequently seen journals and even handled them but as for reading them what were they to mei cared not for news but here i was now with my claret before me perusing perhaps the best of all the london journalsit was not the and i was astonished an entirely new field of literature appeared to be opened to my view it was a discovery but i confess rather an unpleasant one for i said to myself if literary talent is so very common in london that the journals things which as their very name denotes are ephemeral are written in a style like the article i have been perusing how can i hope to distinguish myself in this big town when for the life of me i dont think i could write anything half so clever as what i have been reading and then i laid down the paper and fell into deep musing rousing myself from which i took a glass of wine and pouring out another began musing again what i have been reading thought i is certainly very clever and very talented but talent and cleverness i think i have heard some one say are very commonplace things only fitted for everydayoccasions i question whether the man who wrote the book i saw this day on the bridge was a clever man but after all was he not something much better i dont think he could have written this article but then he wrote the book which i saw on the bridge then if he could not have written the article on which i now hold my forefingerand i do not believe he couldwhy should i feel discouraged at the consciousness that i too could not write it i certainly could no more have written the article than he could but then like him though i would not compare myself to the man who wrote the book i saw upon the bridge i think i couldand here i emptied the glass of claretwrite something better thereupon i resumed the newspaper and as i was before struck with the fluency of style and the general talent which it displayed i was now equally so with its commonplaceness and want of originality on every subject and it was evident to me that whatever advantage these newspaperwriters might have over me in some points they had never studied the welsh bards translated kæmpe viser or been under the pupilage of mr petulengro and tawno chikno and as i sat conning the newspaper three individuals entered the room and seated themselves in the box at the farther end of which i was they were all three very well dressed two of them elderly gentlemen the third a young man about my own age or perhaps a year or two older they called for coffee and after two or three observations the two eldest commenced a conversation in french which however though they spoke it fluently enough i perceived at once was not their native language the young man however took no part in their conversation and when they addressed a portion to him which indeed was but rarely merely replied by a monosyllable i have never been a listener and i paid but little heed to their discourse nor indeed to themselves as i occasionally looked up however i could perceive that the features of the young man who chanced to be seated exactly opposite to me wore an air of constraint and vexation this circumstance caused me to observe him more particularly than i otherwise should have done his features were handsome and prepossessing he had dark brown hair and a higharched forehead after the lapse of half an hour the two elder individuals having finished their coffee called for the waiter and then rose as if to depart the young man however still remaining seated in the box the others having reached the door turned round and finding that the youth did not follow them one of them called to him with a tone of some authority whereupon the young man rose and pronouncing half audibly the word botheration rose and followed them i now observed that he was remarkably tall all three left the house in about ten minutes finding nothing more worth reading in the newspaper i laid it down and though the claret was not yet exhausted i was thinking of betaking myself to my lodgings and was about to call the waiter when i heard a step in the passage and in another moment the tall young man entered the room advanced to the same box and sitting down nearly opposite to me again pronounced to himself but more audibly than before the same word a troublesome world this sir said i looking at him yes said the young man looking fixedly at me but i am afraid we bring most of our troubles on our own headsat least i can say so of myself he added laughing then after a pause i beg pardon he said but am i not addressing one of my own country of what country are you said i ireland i am not of your country sir but i have an infinite veneration for your country as strap said to the french soldier will you take a glass of wine ah de tout mon cœur as the parasite said to gil blas cried the young man laughing heres to our better acquaintance and better acquainted we soon became and i found that in making the acquaintance of the young man i had indeed made a valuable acquisition he was accomplished highly connected and bore the name of francis ardry frank and ardent he was and in a very little time had told me much that related to himself and in return i communicated a general outline of my own history he listened with profound attention but laughed heartily when i told him some particulars of my visit in the morning to the publisher whom he had frequently heard of we left the house together we shall soon see each other again said he as we separated at the door of my lodgingchapter xxxiii dine with the publisherreligionsno animal foodunprofitable discussionsprinciples of criticismthe book marketnewgate livesgoethe a druggerman acquirementsmoral dignity on the sunday i was punctual to my appointment to dine with the publisher as i hurried along the square in which his house stood my thoughts were fixed so intently on the great man that i passed by him without seeing him he had observed me however and joined me just as i was about to knock at the door let us take a turn in the square said he we shall not dine for half an hour well said he as we were walking in the square what have you been doing since i last saw you i have been looking about london said i and i have bought the dairymans daughter here it is pray put it up said the publisher i dont want to look at such trash well do you think you could write anything like it i do not said i how is that said the publisher looking at me because said i the man who wrote it seems to be perfectly well acquainted with his subject and moreover to write from the heart by the subject you mean religion and ant you acquainted with religion very little i am sorry for that said the publisher seriously for he who sets up for an author ought to be acquainted not only with religion but religions and indeed with all subjects like my good friend in the country it is well that i have changed my mind about the dairymans daughter or i really dont know whom i could apply to on the subject at the present moment unless to himself and after all i question whether his style is exactly suited for an evangelical novel then you do not wish for an imitation of the dairymans daughter i do not sir i have changed my mind as i told you before i wish to employ you in another line but will communicate to you my intentions after dinner at dinner beside the publisher and myself were present his wife and son with his newlymarried bride the wife appeared a quiet respectable woman and the young people looked very happy and goodnatured not so the publisher who occasionally eyed both with contempt and dislike connected with this dinner there was one thing remarkable the publisher took no animal food but contented himself with feeding voraciously on rice and vegetables prepared in various ways you eat no animal food sir said i i do not sir said he i have forsworn it upwards of twenty years in one respect sir i am a brahmin i abhor taking away lifethe brutes have as much right to live as ourselves but said i if the brutes were not killed there would be such a superabundance of them that the land would be overrun with them i do not think so sir few are killed in india and yet there is plenty of room but said i nature intended that they should be destroyed and the brutes themselves prey upon one another and it is well for themselves and the world that they do so what would be the state of things if every insect bird and worm were left to perish of old age we will change the subject said the publisher i have never been a friend of unprofitable discussions i looked at the publisher with some surprise i had not been accustomed to be spoken to so magisterially his countenance was dressed in a portentous frown and his eye looked more sinister than ever at that moment he put me inmind of some of those despots of whom i had read in the history of morocco whose word was law he merely wants power thought i to myself to be a regular muley mehemet and then i sighed for i remembered how very much i was in the power of that man the dinner over the publisher nodded to his wife who departed followed by her daughterinlaw the son looked as if he would willingly have attended them he however remained seated and a small decanter of wine being placed on the table the publisher filled two glasses one of which he handed to myself and the other to his son saying suppose you two drink to the success of the review i would join you said he addressing himself to me but i drink no wine if i am a brahmin with respect to meat i am a mahometan with respect to wine so the son and i drank success to the review and then the young man asked me various questions for examplehow i liked londonwhether i did not think it a very fine placewhether i was at the play the night beforeand whether i was in the park that afternoon he seemed preparing to ask me some more questions but receiving a furious look from his father he became silent filled himself a glass of wine drank it off looked at the table for about a minute then got up pushed back his chair made me a bow and left the room is that young gentleman sir said i well versed in the principles of criticism he is not sir said the publisher and if i place him at the head of the review ostensibly i do it merely in the hope of procuring him a maintenance of the principle of a thing he knows nothing except that the principle of bread is wheat and that the principle of that wine is grape will you take another glass i looked at the decanter but not feeling altogether so sure as the publishers son with respect to the principle of what it contained i declined taking any more no sir said the publisher adjusting himself in his chair he knows nothing about criticism and will have nothing more to do with the reviewals than carrying about the books to those who have to review them the real conductor of the review will be a widely different person to whom i will when convenient introduce you and now we will talk of the matter which we touched upon before dinner i told you then that i had changed my mind with respect to you i have been considering the state of the market sir the book market and i have come to the conclusion that though you might be profitably employed upon evangelical novels you could earn more money for me sir and consequently for yourself by a compilation of newgate lives and trials newgate lives and trials yes sir said the publisher newgate lives and trials and now sir i will briefly state to you the services which i expect you to perform and the terms i am willing to grant i expect you sir to compile six volumes of newgate lives and trials each volume to contain by no manner of means less than one thousand pages the remuneration which you will receive when the work is completed will be fifty pounds which is likewise intended to cover any expenses you may incur in procuring books papers and manuscripts necessary for the compilation such will be one of your employments sir such the terms in the second place you will be expected to make yourself useful in the reviewgenerally useful sir doing whatever is required of you for it is not customary at least with me to permit writers especially young writers to choose their subjects in these two departments sir namely compilation and reviewing i had yesterday after due consideration determined upon employing you i had intended to employ you no further sirat least for the present but sir this morning i received a letter from my valued friend in the country in which he speaks in terms of strong admiration i dont overstate of your german acquirements sir he says that it would be a thousand pities if your knowledge of the german language should be lost to the world or even permitted to sleep and he entreats me to think of some plan by which it may be turned to account sir i am at all times willing if possible to oblige my worthy friend and likewise to encourage merit and talent i have therefore determined to employ you in german sir said i rubbing my hands you are very kind and so is our mutual friend i shall be happy to make myself useful in german and if you think a good translation from goethehis sorrows for example or more particularly his faust sir said the publisher goethe is a drug his sorrows are a drug so is his faustus more especially the last since that fool rendered him into english no sir i do not want you to translate goethe or anything belonging to him nor do i want you to translate anything from the german what i want you to do is to translate into german i am willing to encourage merit sir and as my good friend in his last letter has spoken very highly of your german acquirements i have determined that you shall translate my book of philosophy into german your book of philosophy into german sir yes sir my book of philosophy into german i am not a drug sir in germany as goethe is here no more is my book i intend to print the translation at leipzig sir and if it turns out a profitable speculation as i make no doubt it will provided the translation be well executed i will make you some remuneration sir your remuneration will be determined by thesuccess of your translation but sir sir said the publisher interrupting me you have heard my intentions i consider that you ought to feel yourself highly gratified by my intentions towards you it is not frequently that i deal with a writer especially a young writer as i have done with you and now sir permit me to inform you that i wish to be alone this is sunday afternoon sir i never go to church but i am in the habit of spending part of every sunday afternoon aloneprofitably i hope sirin musing on the magnificence of nature and the moral dignity of manchapter xxxiv the two volumesa young authorintended editorquintilianloose money what cant be cured must be endured and it is hard to kick against the pricks at the period to which i have brought my history i bethought me of the proverbs with which i have headed this chapter and determined to act up to their spirit i determined not to fly in the face of the publisher and to bearwhat i could not curehis arrogance and vanity at present at the conclusion of nearly a quarter of a century i am glad that i came to that determination which i did my best to carry into effect two or three days after our last interview the publisher made his appearance in my apartment he bore two tattered volumes under his arm which he placed on the table i have brought you two volumes of lives sir said he which i yesterday found in my garret you will find them of service for your compilation as i always wish to behave liberally and encourage talent especially youthful talent i shall make no charge for them though i should be justified in so doing as you are aware that by our agreement you are to provide any books and materials which may be necessary have you been in quest of any no said i not yet then sir i would advise you to lose no time in doing so you must visit all the bookstalls sir especially those in the bystreets and blind alleys it is in such places that you will find the description of literature you are in want of you must be up and doing sir it will not do for an author especially a young author to be idle in this town tonight you will receive my book of philosophy and likewise books for the review and bythebye sir it will be as well for you to review my book of philosophy for the review the other reviews not having noticed it sir before translating it i wish you to review my book of philosophy for the review i shall be happy to do my best sir very good sir i should be unreasonable to expect anything beyond a persons best and now sir if you please i will conduct you to the future editor of the review as you are to cooperate sir i deem it right to make you acquainted the intended editor was a little old man who sat in a kind of wooden pavilion in a small garden behind a house in one of the purlieus of the city composing tunes upon a piano the walls of the pavilion were covered with fiddles of various sizes and appearances and a considerable portion of the floor occupied by a pile of books all of one size the publisher introduced him to me as a gentleman scarcely less eminent in literature than in music and me to him as an aspirant critic a young gentleman scarcely less eminent in philosophy than in philology the conversation consisted entirely of compliments till just before we separated when the future editor inquired of me whether i had ever read quintilian and on my replying in the negative expressed his surprise that any gentleman should aspire to become a critic who had never read quintilian with the comfortable information however that he could supply me with a quintilian at halfprice that is a translation made by himself some years previously of which he had pointing to the heap on the floor still a few copies remaining unsold for some reason or other perhaps a poor one i did not purchase the editors translation of quintilian sir said the publisher as we were returning from our visit to the editor you did right in not purchasing a drug i am not prepared sir to say that quintilian is a drug never having seen him but i am prepared to say that mans translation is a drug judging from the heap of rubbish on the floor besides sir you will want any loose money you may have to purchase the description of literature which is required for your compilation the publisher presently paused before the entrance of a very forlornlooking street sir said he after looking down it with attention i should not wonder if in that street you find works connected with the description of literature which is required for your compilation it is in streets of this description sir and blind alleys where such works are to be found you had better search that street sir whilst i continue my way i searched the street to which the publisher had pointed and in the course of the three succeeding days many others of a similar kind i did not find the description of literature alluded to by the publisher to be a drug but on the contrary both scarce and dear i had expended much more than my loose money long before i could procure materials even for the first volume of my compilationchapter xxxv francis ardrycertain sharpersbrave and eloquentoppositesflinging the bonesstrange placesdog fightinglearning and lettersbatch of dogsredoubled application one evening i was visited by the tall young gentleman francis ardry whose acquaintance i had formed at the coffeehouse as it is necessary that the reader should know something more about this young man who will frequently appear in the course of these pages i will state in a few words who and what he was he was born of an ancient roman catholic family in ireland his parents whose only child he was had long been dead his father who had survived his mother several years had been a spendthrift and at his death had left the family property considerably embarrassed happily however the son and the estate fell into the hands of careful guardians near relations of the family by whom the property was managed to the best advantage and every means taken to educate the young man in a manner suitable to his expectations at the age of sixteen he was taken from a celebrated school in england at which he had been placed and sent to a small french university in order that he might form an intimate and accurate acquaintance with the grand language of the continent there he continued three years at the end of which he went under the care of a french abbé to germany and italy it was in this latter country that he first began to cause his guardians serious uneasiness he was in the heyday of youth when he visited italy and he entered wildly into the various delights of that fascinating region and what was worse falling into the hands of certain sharpers not italian but english he was fleeced of considerable sums of money the abbé who it seems was an excellent individual of the old french school remonstrated with his pupil on his dissipation and extravagance but finding his remonstrances vain very properly informed the guardians of the manner of life of his charge they were not slow in commanding francis ardry home and as he was entirely in their power he was forced to comply he had been about three months in london when i met him in the coffeeroom and the two elderly gentlemen in his company were his guardians at this time they were very solicitous that he should choose for himself a profession offering to his choice either the army or lawhe was calculated to shine in either of these professionsfor like many others of his countrymen he was brave and eloquent but he did not wish to shackle himself with a profession as however his minority did not terminate till he was threeandtwenty of which age he wanted nearly two years during which he would be entirely dependent on his guardians he deemed it expedient to conceal to a certain degree his sentiments temporising with the old gentlemen with whom notwithstanding his many irregularities he was a great favourite and at whose death he expected to come into a yet greater property than that which he inherited from his parents such is a brief account of francis ardryof my friend francis ardry for the acquaintance commenced in the singular manner with which the reader is acquainted speedily ripened into a friendship which endured through many long years of separation and which still endures certainly on my part and on hisif he lives but it is many years since i have heard from francis ardry and yet many people would have thought it impossible for our friendship to have lasted a weekfor in many respects no two people could be more dissimilar he was an irishmani an englishmanhe fiery enthusiastic and openhearted i neither fiery enthusiastic nor openheartedhe fond of pleasure and dissipationi of study and reflection yet it is of such dissimilar elements that the most lasting friendships are formed we do not like counterparts of ourselves two great talkers will not travel far together is a spanish saying i will add nor two silent people we naturally love our opposites so francis ardry came to see me and right glad i was to see him for i had just flung my books and papers aside and was wishing for a little social converse and when we had conversed for some little time together francis ardry proposed that we should go to the play to see kean so we went to the play and sawnot kean who at that time was ashamed to show himself buta man who was not ashamed to show himself and who people said was a much better man than keanas i have no doubt he wasthough whether he was a better actor i cannot say for i never saw kean two or three evenings after francis ardry came to see me again and again we went out together and francis ardry took me toshall i saywhy nota gaming house where i saw people playing and where i saw francis ardry play and lose five guineas and where i lost nothing because i did not play though i felt somewhat inclined for a man with a white hat and a sparkling eye held up a box which contained something which rattled and asked me to fling the bones there is nothing like flinging the bones said he and then i thought i should like to know what kind of thing flinging the bones was i however restrained myself there is nothing like flinging the bones shouted the man as my friend and myself left the room long life and prosperity to francis ardry but for him i should not have obtained knowledge which i did of the strange and eccentric places of london some of the places to which he took me were very strange places indeed but however strange the places were i observed that the inhabitants thought there were no places like their several places and no occupations like their several occupations and among other strange places to which francis ardry conducted me was a place not far from the abbey church of westminsterbefore we entered this place our ears were greeted by a confused hubbub of human voices squealing of rats barking of dogs and the cries of various other animals here we beheld a kind of cockpit around which a great many people seeming of all ranks but chiefly of the lower were gathered and in it we saw a dog destroy a great many rats in a very small period and when the dog had destroyed the rats we saw a fight between a dog and a bear then a fight between two dogs then after the diversions of the day were over my friend introduced me to the genius of the place a small man of about five feet high with a very sharp countenance and dressed in a brown jockey coat and top boots joey said he this is a friend of mine joey nodded to me with a patronizing air glad to see you sirwant a dog no said i you have got one thenwant to match him we have a dog at home said i in the country but i cant say i should like to match him indeed i do not like dogfighting not like dogfighting said the man staring the truth is joe that he is just come to town so i should think he looks rather greennot like dogfighting nothing like it is there joey i should think not what is like it a time will come and that speedily when folks will give up everything else and follow dogfighting do you think so said i think so let me ask what there is that a man wouldnt give up for it why said i modestly theres religion religion how you talk why theres myself bred and born an independent and intended to be a preacher didnt i give up religion for dogfighting religion indeed if it were not for the rascally law my pit would fill better on sundays than any other time who would go to church when they could come to my pit religion why the parsons themselves come to my pit and i have now a letter in my pocket from one of them asking me to send him a dog well then politics said i politics why the gemmen in the house would leave pitt himself if he were alive to come to my pit there were three of the best of them here tonight all great horatorsget on with you what comes next why theres learning and letters pretty things truly to keep people from dogfighting why theres the young gentlemen from the abbey school comes here in shoals leaving books and letters and masters too to tell you the truth i rather wish they would mind their letters for a more precious set of young blackguards i never seed it was only the other day i was thinking of calling in a constable for my own protection for i thought my pit would have been torn down by them scarcely knowing what to say i made an observation at random you show by your own conduct said i that there are other things worth following besides dogfighting you practise ratcatching and badgerbaiting as well the dogfancier eyed me with supreme contempt your friend here said he might well call you a new one when i talks of dogfighting i of course means ratcatching and badgerbaiting ay and bullbaiting too just as when i speaks religiously when i says one i means not one but three and talking of religion puts me in mind that i have something else to do besides chaffing here having a batch of dogs to send off by this nights packet to the pope of rome but at last i had seen enough of what london had to show whether strange or commonplace so at least i thought and i ceased to accompany my friend in his rambles about town and to partake of his adventures our friendship however still continued unabated though i saw in consequence less of him i reflected that time was passing onthat the little money i had brought to town was fast consuming and that i had nothing to depend upon but my own exertions for a freshsupply and i returned with redoubled application to my pursuitschapter xxxvi occupationstraduttore traditoreode to the mistapple and pearreviewingcurrent literatureoxfordlike mannera plain storyillregulated mindunsnuffed candlestrange dreams i compiled the chronicles of newgate i reviewed books for the review established on an entirely new principle and i occasionally tried my best to translate into german portions of the publishers philosophy in this last task i experienced more than one difficulty i was a tolerable german scholar it is true and i had long been able to translate german into english with considerable facility but to translate from a foreign language into your own is a widely different thing from translating from your own into a foreign language and in my first attempt to render the publisher into german i was conscious of making miserable failures from pure ignorance of german grammar however by the assistance of grammars and dictionaries and by extreme perseverance i at length overcame all the difficulties connected with the german language but alas another difficulty remained far greater than any connected with germana difficulty connected with the language of the publisherthe language which the great man employed in his writings was very hard to understand i say in his writingsfor his colloquial english was plain enough though not professing to be a scholar he was much addicted when writing to the use of greek and latin terms not as other people used them but in a manner of his own which set the authority of dictionaries at defiance the consequence was that i was sometimes utterly at a loss to understand the meaning of the publisher many a quarter of an hour did i pass at this period staring at periods of the publisher and wondering what he could mean but in vain till at last with a shake of the head i would snatch up the pen and render the publisher literally into german sometimes i was almost tempted to substitute something of my own for what the publisher had written but my conscience interposed the awful words traduttore traditore commenced ringing in my ears and i asked myself whether i should be acting honourably towards the publisher who had committed to me the delicate task of translating him into german should i be acting honourably towards him in making him speak in german in a manner different from that in which he expressed himself in english no i could not reconcile such conduct with any principle of honour by substituting something of my own in lieu of these mysterious passages of the publisher i might be giving a fatal blow to his whole system of philosophy besides when translating into english had i treated foreign authors in this manner had i treated the minstrels of the kæmpe viser in this mannerno had i treated ab gwilym in this manner even when translating his ode to the mist in which he is misty enough had i attempted to make ab gwilym less misty no on referring to my translation i found that ab gwilym in my hands was quite as misty as in his own then seeing that i had not ventured to take liberties with people who had never put themselves into my hands for the purpose of being rendered how could i venture to substitute my own thoughts and ideas for the publishers who had put himself into my hands for that purpose forbid it every proper feelingso i told the germans in the publishers own way the publishers tale of an apple and a pear i at first felt much inclined to be of the publishers opinion with respect to the theory of the pear after all why should the earth be shaped like an apple and not like a pearit would certainly gain in appearance by being shaped like a pear a pear being a handsomer fruit than an apple the publisher is probably right thought i and i will say that he is right on this point in the notice which i am about to write of his publication for the review and yet i dont knowsaid i after a long fit of musingi dont know but what there is more to be said for the oxford theory the world may be shaped like a pear but i dont know that it is but one thing i know which is that it does not taste like a pear i have always liked pears but i dont like the world the world to me tastes much more like an apple and i have never liked apples i will uphold the oxford theorybesides i am writing in an oxford review and am in duty bound to uphold the oxford theory so in my notice i asserted that the world was round i quoted scripture and endeavoured to prove that the world was typified by the apple in scripture both as to shape and properties an apple is round said i and the world is roundthe apple is a sour disagreeable fruit and who has tasted much of the world without having his teeth set on edge i however treated the publisher upon the whole in the most urbane and oxfordlike manner complimenting him upon his style acknowledging the general soundness of his views and only differing with him in the affair of the apple and pear i did not like reviewing at allit was not to my taste it was not in my way i liked it far less than translating the publishers philosophy for that was something in the line of one whom a competent judge had surnamed lavengro i never could understand why reviews were instituted works of merit do not require to be reviewed they can speak for themselves and require no praising works of no merit at all will die of themselves they require no killing the review to which i was attached was as has been already intimated established on an entirely new plan it professed to review all new publications which certainly no review had ever professed to do before other reviews never pretending to review more than onetenth of the current literature of the day when i say it professed to review all new publications i should add which should be sent to it for of course the review would not acknowledge the existence of publications the authors of which did not acknowledge the existence of the review i dont think however that the review had much cause to complain of being neglected i have reason to believe that at least ninetenths of the publications of the day were sent to the review and in due time reviewed i had good opportunity of judgingi was connected with several departments of the review though more particularly with the poetical and philosophic ones an english translation of kants philosophy made its appearance on my table the day before its publication in my notice of this work i said that the english shortly hoped to give the germans a quid pro quo i believe at that time authors were much in the habit of publishing at their ownexpense all the poetry which i reviewed appeared to be published at the expense of the authors if i am asked how i comported myself under all circumstances as a revieweri answeri did not forget that i was connected with a review established on oxford principles the editor of which had translated quintilian all the publications which fell under my notice i treated in a gentlemanly and oxfordlike manner no personalitiesno vituperationno shabby insinuations decorum decorum was the order of the day occasionally a word of admonition but gently expressed as an oxford undergraduate might have expressed it or master of arts how the authors whose publications were consigned to my colleagues were treated by them i know not i suppose they were treated in an urbane and oxfordlike manner but i cannot say i did not read the reviewals of my colleagues i did not read my own after they were printed i did not like reviewing of all my occupations at this period i am free to confess i liked that of compiling the newgate lives and trials the best that is after i had surmounted a kind of prejudice which i originally entertained the trials were entertaining enough but the liveshow full were they of wild and racy adventures and in what racy genuine language were they told what struck me most with respect to these lives was the art which the writers whoever they were possessed of telling a plain story it is no easy thing to tell a story plainly and distinctly by mouth but to tell one on paper is difficult indeed so many snares lie in the way people are afraid to put down what is common on paper they seek to embellish their narratives as they think by philosophic speculations and reflections they are anxious to shine and people who are anxious to shine can never tell a plain story so i went with them to a music booth where they made me almost drunk with gin and began to talk their flash language which i did not understand says or is made to say henry simms executed at tyburn some seventy years before the time of which i am speaking i have always looked upon this sentence as a masterpiece of the narrative style it is so concise and yet so very clear as i gazed on passages like this and there were many nearly as good in the newgate lives i often sighed that it was not my fortune to have to render these lives into german rather than the publishers philosophyhis tale of an apple and pear mine was an illregulated mind at this period as i read over the lives of these robbers and pickpockets strange doubts began to arise in my mind about virtue and crime years before when quite a boy as in one of the early chapters i have hinted i had been a necessitarian i had even written an essay on crime i have it now before me penned in a round boyish hand in which i attempted to prove that there is no such thing as crime or virtue all our actions being the result of circumstances or necessity these doubts were now again reviving in my mind i could not for the life of me imagine how taking all circumstances into consideration these highwaymen these pickpockets should have been anything else than highwaymen and pickpockets any more than how taking all circumstances into consideration bishop latimer the reader is aware that i had read foxs book of martyrs should have been anything else than bishop latimer i had a very illregulated mind at that period my own peculiar ideas with respect to everything being a lying dream began also to revive sometimes at midnight after having toiled for hours at my occupations i would fling myself back on my chair look about the poor apartment dimly lighted by an unsnuffed candle or upon the heaps of books and papers before me and exclaimdo i exist do these things which i think i see about me exist or do they not is not every thing a dreama deceitful dream is not this apartment a dreamthe furniture a dream the publisher a dreamhis philosophy a dream am i not myself a dream dreaming about translating a dream i cant see why all should not be a dream whats the use of the reality and then i would pinch myself and snuff the burdened smoky light i cant see for the life of me the use of all this therefore why should i think that it exists if there was a chance a probability of all this tending to anything i might believe but and then i would stare and think and after some time shake my head and return again to my occupations for an hour or two and then i would perhaps shake and shiver and yawn and look wistfully in the direction of my sleeping apartment and then but not wistfully at the papers and books before me and sometimes i would return to my papers and books but oftener i would arise and after another yawn and shiver take my light and proceed to my sleeping chamber they say that light fare begets light dreams my fare at that time was light enough but i had anything but light dreams for at that period i had all kind of strange and extravagant dreams and amongst other things i dreamt that the whole world had taken to dogfighting and that i myself had taken to dogfighting and that in a vast circus i backed an english bulldog against the bloodhound of the pope of romechapter xxxvii my brotherfits of cryingmayor electthe committeethe norman archa word of greekchurch and state at my own expenseif you please one morning i arose somewhat later than usual having been occupied during the greater part of the night with my literary toil on descending from my chamber into the sitting room i found a person seated by the fire whose glance was directed sideways to the table on which were the usual preparations for my mornings meal forthwith i gave a cry and sprang forward to embrace the person for the person by the fire whose glance was directed to the table was no one else than my brother and how are things going on at home said i to my brother after we had kissed and embraced how is my mother and how is the dog my mother thank god is tolerably well said my brother but very much given to fits of crying as for the dog he is not so well but we will talk more of these matters anon said my brother again glancing at the breakfast things i am very hungry as you may suppose after having travelled all night thereupon i exerted myself to the best of my ability to perform the duties of hospitality and i made my brother welcome i may say more than welcome and when the rage of my brothers hunger was somewhat abated we recommenced talking about the matters of our little family and my brother told me much about my mother he spoke of her fits of crying but said that of late the said fits of crying had much diminished and she appeared to be taking comfort and if i am not much mistaken my brother told me that my mother had of late the prayer book frequently in her hand and yet oftener the bible we were silent for a timeat last i opened my mouth and mentioned the dog the dog said my brother is i am afraid in a very poor way ever since the death he has done nothing but pine and take on a few months ago you remember he was as plump and fine as any dog in the town but at present he is little more than skin and bone once we lost him for two days and never expected to see him again imagining that some mischance had befallen him at length i found himwhere do you think chancing to pass by the churchyard i found him seated on the grave very strange said i but let us talk of something else it was very kind of you to come and see me oh as for that matter i did not come up to see you though of course i am very glad to see you having been rather anxious about you like my mother who has received only one letter from you since your departure no i did not come up on purpose to see you but on quite a different account you must know that the corporation of our town have lately elected a new mayor a person of many qualificationsbig and portly with a voice like boanerges a religious man the possessor of an immense pew loyal so much so that i once heard him say that he would at any time go three miles to hear any one sing god save the king moreover a giver of excellent dinners such is our present mayor who owing to his loyalty his religion and a little perhaps to his dinners is a mighty favourite so much so that the town is anxious to have his portrait painted in a superior style so that remote posterity may know what kind of man he was the colour of his hair his air and gait so a committee was formed some time ago which is still sitting that is they dine with the mayor every day to talk over the subject a few days since to my great surprise they made their appearance in my poor studio and desired to be favoured with a sight of some of my paintings well i showed them some and after looking at them with great attention they went aside and whispered hell do i heard one say yes hell do said another and then they came to me and one of them a little man with a hump on his back who is a watchmaker assumed the office of spokesman and made a long speechthe old town has been always celebrated for oratorsin which he told me how much they had been pleased with my productionsthe old town has been always celebrated for its artistic taste and what do you think offered me the painting of the mayors portrait and a hundred pounds for my trouble well of course i was much surprised and for a minute or two could scarcely speak recovering myself however i made a speech not so eloquent as that of the watchmaker of course being not so accustomed to speaking but not so bad either taking everything into consideration telling them how flattered i felt by the honour which they had conferred in proposing to me such an undertaking expressing however my fears that i was not competent to the task and concluding by saying what a pity it was that crome was dead crome said the little man crome yes he was a clever man a very clever man in his way he was good at painting landscapes and farmhouses but he would not do in the present instance were he alive he had no conception of the heroic sir we want some person capable of representing our mayor striding under the norman arch out of the cathedral at the mention of the heroic an idea came at once into my head oh said i if you are in quest of the heroic i am glad that you came to me dont mistake me i continued i do not mean to say that i could do justice to your subject though i am fond of the heroic but i can introduce you to a great master of the heroic fully competent to do justice to your mayor not to me therefore be the painting of the picture given but to a friend of mine the great master of the heroic to the best the strongest τω κρατιστω i added for being amongst orators ithought a word of greek would tell well said i and what did the orators say they gazed dubiously at me and at one another said my brother at last the watchmaker asked me who this mr christo was adding that he had never heard of such a person that from my recommendation of him he had no doubt that he was a very clever man but that they should like to know something more about him before giving the commission to him that he had heard of christie the great auctioneer who was considered to be an excellent judge of pictures but he supposed that i scarcelywhereupon interrupting the watchmaker i told him that i alluded neither to christo nor to christie but to the painter of lazarus rising from the grave a painter under whom i had myself studied during some months that i had spent in london and to whom i was indebted for much connected with the heroic i have heard of him said the watchmaker and his paintings too but i am afraid that he is not exactly the gentleman by whom our mayor would wish to be painted i have heard say that he is not a very good friend to church and state come young man he added it appears to me that you are too modest i like your style of painting so do we all andwhy should i mince the matterthe money is to be collected in the town why should it go into a strangers pocket and be spent in london thereupon i made them a speech in which i said that art had nothing to do with church and state at least with english church and state which had never encouraged it and that though church and state were doubtless very fine things a man might be a very good artist who cared not a straw for either i then made use of more greek words and told them how painting was one of the nine muses and one of the most independent creatures alive inspiring whom she pleased and asking leave of nobody that i should be quite unworthy of the favours of the muse if on the present occasion i did not recommend them a man whom i considered to be a much greater master of the heroic than myself and that with regard to the money being spent in the city i had no doubt that they would not weigh for a moment such a consideration against the chance of getting a true heroic picture for the city i never talked so well in my life and said so many flattering things to the hunchback and his friends that at last they said that i should have my own way and that if i pleased to go up to london and bring down the painter of lazarus to paint the mayor i might so they then bade me farewell and i have come up to london to put a hundred pounds into the hands of a better man than myself said my brother of course and have you come up at your own expense yes said my brother i have come up at my own expense i made no answer but looked in my brothers face we then returned to the former subjects of conversation talking of the dead my mother and the dog after some time my brother said i will now go to the painter and communicate to him the business which has brought me to town and if you please i will take you with me and introduce you to him having expressed my willingness we descended into the streetchapter xxxviii painter of the heroicill goa modest peepwho is thisa capital pharaohdisproportionably shortimaginary pictureenglish figures the painter of the heroic resided a great way off at the western end of the town we had some difficulty in obtaining admission to him a maidservant who opened the door eyeing us somewhat suspiciously it was not until my brother had said that he was a friend of the painter that we were permitted to pass the threshold at length we were shown into the studio where we found the painter with an easel and brush standing before a huge piece of canvas on which he had lately commenced painting a heroic picture the painter might be about thirtyfive years old he had a clever intelligent countenance with a sharp grey eyehis hair was dark brown and cut àlarafael as i was subsequently told that is there was little before and much behindhe did not wear a neckcloth but in its stead a black riband so that his neck which was rather fine was somewhat exposedhe had a broad muscular breast and i make no doubt that he would have been a very fine figure but unfortunately his legs and thighs were somewhat short he recognised my brother and appeared glad to see him what brings you to london said he whereupon my brother gave him a brief account of his commission at the mention of the hundred pounds i observed the eyes of the painter glisten really said he when my brother had concluded it was very kind to think of me i am not very fond of painting portraits but a mayor is a mayor and there is something grand in that idea of the norman arch ill go moreover i am just at this moment confoundedly in need of money and when you knocked at the door i dont mind telling you i thought it was some dun i dont know how it is but in the capital they have no taste for the heroic they will scarce look at a heroic picture i am glad to hear that they have better taste in the provinces ill go when shall we set off thereupon it was arranged between the painter and my brother that they should depart the next day but one they then began to talk of art ill stick to the heroic said the painter i now and then dabble in the comic but what i do gives me no pleasure the comic is so low there is nothing like the heroic i am engaged here on a heroic picture said he pointing to the canvas the subject is pharaoh dismissing moses from egypt after the last plaguethe death of the firstbornit is not far advancedthat finished figure is moses they both looked at the canvas and i standing behind took a modest peep the picture as the painter said was not far advanced the pharaoh was merely in outline my eye was of course attracted by the finished figure or rather what the painter had called the finished figure but as i gazed upon it it appeared to me that there was some thing defectivesomething unsatisfactory in the figure i concluded however that the painter notwithstanding what he had said had omitted to give it the finishing touch i intend this to be my best picture said the painter what i want now is a face for pharaoh i have long been meditating on a face for pharaoh here chancing to cast his eye upon my countenance of whom he had scarcely taken any manner of notice he remained with his mouth open for some time who is this said he at last oh this is my brother i forgot to introduce him we presently afterwards departed my brother talked much about the painter he is a noble fellow said my brother but like many other noble fellows has a great many enemies he is hated by his brethren of the brushall the land and waterscape painters hate himbut above all the race of portrait painters who are ten times more numerous than the other two sorts detest him for his heroic tendencies it will be a kind of triumph to the last i fear when they hear he has condescended to paint a portrait however that norman arch will enable him to escape from their malicethat is a capital idea of the watchmaker that norman arch i spent a happy day with my brother on the morrow he went again to the painter with whom he dined i did not go with him on his return he said the painter has been asking a great many questions about you and expressed a wish that you would sit to him as pharaoh he thinks you would make a capital pharaoh i have no wish to appear on canvas said i moreover he can find much better pharaohs than myself and if he wants a real pharaoh there is a certain mr petulengro petulengro said my brother a strange kind of fellow came up to me some time ago in our town and asked me about you when i inquired his name he told me petulengro no he will not do he is too short bythebye do you not think that figure of moses is somewhat short and then it appeared to me that i had thought the figure of moses somewhat short and i told my brother so ah said my brother on the morrow my brother departed with the painter for the old town and there the painter painted the mayor i did not see the picture for a great many years when chancing to be at the old town i beheld it the original mayor was a mighty portly man with a bulls head black hair body like that of a dray horse and legs and thighs corresponding a man six foot high at the least to his bulls head black hair and body the painter had done justice there was one point however in which the portrait did not correspond with the originalthe legs were disproportionably short the painter having substituted his own legs for those of the mayor which when i perceived irejoiced that i had not consented to be painted as pharaoh for if i had the chances are that he would have served me in exactly a similar way as he had served moses and the mayor short legs in a heroic picture will never do and upon the whole i think the painters attempt at the heroic in painting the mayor of the old town a decided failure if i am now asked whether the picture would have been a heroic one provided the painter had not substituted his own legs for those of the mayori must say i am afraid not i have no idea of making heroic pictures out of english mayors even with the assistance of norman arches yet i am sure that capital pictures might be made out of english mayors not issuing from norman arches but rather from the door of the checquers or the brewers three the painter in question had great comic power which he scarcely ever cultivated he would fain be a rafael which he never could be when he might have been something quite as goodanother hogarth the only comic piece which he ever presented to the world being something little inferior to the best of that illustrious master i have often thought what a capital picture might have been made by my brothers friend if instead of making the mayor issue out of the norman arch he had painted him moving under the sign of the checquers or the three brewers with maceyes with macethe mace appears in the picture issuing out of the norman arch behind the mayorbut likewise with snap and with whiffler quart pot and frying pan billy blind and owlenglass mr petulengro and pakomovnathen had he clapped his own legs upon the mayor or any one else in the concourse what matter but i repeat that i have no hope of making heroic pictures out of english mayors or indeed out of english figures in general england may be a land of heroic hearts but it is not properly a land of heroic figures or heroic posturemakingitaly what was i going to say about italy chapter xxxix no authority whateverinterferencewondrous farragobrandt and struenseewhat a lifethe hearsemortal relicsgreat poetfashion and famewhat a differenceoh beautifulgood for nothing and now once more to my pursuits to my lives and trials however partial at first i might be to these lives and trials it was not long before they became regular trials to me owing to the whims and caprices of the publisher i had not been long connected with him before i discovered that he was wonderfully fond of interfering with other peoples businessat least with the business of those who were under his control what a life did his unfortunate authors lead he had many in his employ toiling at all kinds of subjectsi call them authors because there is something respectable in the term author though they had little authorship in and no authority whatever over the works on which they were engaged it is true the publisher interfered with some colour of reason the plan of all and every of the works alluded to having originated with himself and be it observed many of his plans were highly clever and promising for as i have already had occasion to say the publisher in many points was a highly clever and sagacious person but he ought to have been contented with planning the works originally and have left to other people the task of executing them instead of which he marred everything by his rage for interference if a book of fairy tales was being compiled he was sure to introduce some of his philosophy explaining the fairy tale by some theory of his own was a book of anecdotes on hand it was sure to be half filled with sayings and doings of himself during the time that he was common councilman of the city of london now however fond the public might be of fairy tales it by no means relished them in conjunction with the publishers philosophy and however fond of anecdotes in general or even of the publisher in particularfor indeed there were a great many anecdotes in circulation about him which the public both read and listened to very readilyit took no pleasure in such anecdotes as he was disposed to relate about himself in the compilation of my lives and trials i was exposed to incredible mortification and ceaseless trouble from this same rage for interference it is true he could not introduce his philosophy into the work nor was it possible for him to introduce anecdotes of himself having never had the good or evil fortune to be tried at the bar but he was continually introducingwhat under a less apathetic government than the one then being would have infallibly subjected him and perhaps myself to a trialhis politics not his oxford or pseudo politics but the politics which he really entertained and which were of the most republican and violent kind but this was not all when about a moiety of the first volume had been printed he materially altered the plan of the work it was no longer to be a collection of mere newgate lives and trials but of lives and trials of criminals in general foreign as well as domestic in a little time the work became a wondrous farrago in which königsmark the robber figured by the side of sam lynn and the marchioness de brinvilliers was placed in contact with a chinese outlaw what gave me the most trouble and annoyance was the publishers remembering some life or trial foreign or domestic which he wished to be inserted and which i was forthwith to go in quest of and purchase at my own expense some of those lives and trials were by no means easy to find where is brandt and struensee cries the publisher i am sure i dont know i replied whereupon the publisher falls to squealing like one of joeys rats find me up brandt and struensee by next morning or have you found brandt and struensee cried the publisher on my appearing before him next morning no i reply i can hear nothing about them whereupon the publisher falls to bellowing like joeys bull by dint of incredible diligence i at length discover the dingy volume containing the lives and trials of the celebrated two who had brooded treason dangerous to the state of denmark i purchase the dingy volume and bring it in triumph to the publisher the perspiration running down my brow the publisher takes the dingy volume in his hand he examines it attentively then puts it down his countenance is calm for a moment almost benign another moment and there is a gleam in the publishers sinister eye he snatches up the paper containing the names of the worthies which i have intended shall figure in the forthcoming volumeshe glances rapidly over it and his countenance once more assumes a terrific expression how is this he exclaims i can scarcely believe my eyesthe most important life and trial omitted to be found in the whole criminal recordwhat gross what utter negligence wheres the life of farmer patch wheres the trial of yeoman patch what a life what a dogs life i would frequently exclaim after escaping from the presence of the publisher one day after a scene with the publisher similar to that which i have described above i found myself about noon at the bottom of oxford street where it forms a right angle with the road which leads or did lead to tottenham court happening to cast my eyes around it suddenly occurred to me that something uncommon was expected people were standing in groups on the pavementthe upstair windows of the houses were thronged with faces especially those of women and many of the shops were partly and not a few entirely closed what could be the reason of all this all at once i bethought me that this street of oxford was no other than the farfamed tyburn way oh oh thought i an execution some handsome young robber is about to be executed at the farther end just so see how earnestly the women are peering perhaps another harry symmsgentleman harry as they called himis about to be carted along this street to tyburn tree but then i remembered that tyburn tree had long since been cut down and that criminals whether young or old goodlooking or ugly were executed before the big stone gaol which i had looked at with a kind of shudder during my short rambles in the city what could be the matter just then i heard various voices cry there it comes and all heads were turned up oxford street down which a hearse was slowly coming nearer and nearer it drew presently it was just opposite the place where i was standing when turning to the left it proceeded slowly alongtottenham road immediately behind the hearse were three or four mourning coaches full of people some of which from the partial glimpse which i caught of them appeared to be foreigners behind these came a very long train of splendid carriages all of which without one exception were empty whose body is in that hearse said i to a dapperlooking individual seemingly a shopkeeper who stood beside me on the pavement looking at the procession the mortal relics of lord byron said the dapperlooking individual mouthing his words and smirkingthe illustrious poet which have been just brought from greece and are being conveyed to the family vault in shire an illustrious poet was he said i beyond all criticism said the dapper man all we of the rising generation are under incalculable obligation to byron i myself in particular have reason to say so in all my correspondence my style is formed on the byronic model i looked at the individual for a moment who smiled and smirked to himself applause and then i turned my eyes upon the hearse proceeding slowly up the almost endless street this man this byron had for many years past been the demigod of england and his verses the daily food of those who read from the peer to the drapers assistant all were admirers or rather worshippers of byron and all doated on his verses and then i thought of those who with genius as high as his or higher had lived and died neglected i thought of milton abandoned to poverty and blindness of witty and ingenious butler consigned to the tender mercies of bailiffs and starving otway they had lived neglected and despised and when they died a few poor mourners only had followed them to the grave but this byron had been made a half god of when living and now that he was dead he was followed by worshipping crowds and the very sun seemed to come out on purpose to grace his funeral and indeed the sun which for many days past had hidden its face in clouds shone out that morning with wonderful brilliancy flaming upon the black hearse and its tall ostrich plumes the mourning coaches and the long train of aristocratic carriages which followed behind great poet sir said the dapperlooking man great poet but unhappy unhappy yes i had heard that he had been unhappy that he had roamed about a fevered distempered man taking pleasure in nothingthat i had heard but was it true was he really unhappy was not this unhappiness assumed with the view of increasing the interest which the world took in him and yet who could say he might be unhappy and with reason was he a real poet after all might he not doubt himself might he not have a lurking consciousness that he was undeserving of the homage which he was receiving that it could not last that he was rather at the top of fashion than of fame he was a lordling a glittering gorgeous lordling and he might have had a consciousness that he owed much of his celebrity to being so he might have felt that he was rather at the top of fashion than of fame fashion soon changes thought i eagerly to myselfa time will come and that speedily when he will be no longer in the fashion when this idiotic admirer of his who is still grinning at my side shall have ceased to mould his style on byrons and this aristocracy squirearchy and what not who now send their empty carriages to pay respect to the fashionable corpse shall have transferred their empty worship to some other animate or inanimate thing well perhaps after all it was better to have been mighty milton in his poverty and blindnesswitty and ingenious butler consigned to the tender mercies of bailiffs and starving otway they might enjoy more real pleasure than this lordling they must have been aware that the world would one day do them justicefame after death is better than the top of fashion in life they have left a fame behind them which shall never die whilst this lordlinga time will come when he will be out of fashion and forgotten and yet i dont know didnt he write childe harold and that ode yes he wrote childe harold and that ode then a time will scarcely come when he will be forgotten lords squires and cockneys may pass away but a time will scarcely come when childe harold and that ode will be forgotten he was a poet after all and he must have known it a real poet equal totowhat a destiny rank beauty fashion immortalityhe could not be unhappy what a difference in the fate of meni wish i could think he was unhappy i turned away great poet sir said the dapper man turning away too but unhappyfate of genius sir i too am frequently unhappy hurrying down a street to the right i encountered francis ardry what means the multitude yonder he demanded they are looking after the hearse which is carrying the remains of byron up tottenham road i have seen the man said my friend as he turned back the way he had come so i can dispense with seeing the hearsei saw the living man at veniceah a great poetyes said i a great poet it must be so everybody says sowhat a destiny what a difference in the fate of men but tis said he was unhappy you have seen him how did he look oh beautiful but did he look happy why i cant say he looked very unhappy i saw him with twovery fair ladies but what is it to you whether the man was unhappy or not come where shall we goto joeys his hugest bear o i have had enough of bears i have just been worried by one the publisher yes then come to joeys three dogs are to be launched at his bear as they pin him imagine him to be the publisher no said i i am good for nothing i think i shall stroll to london bridge thats too far for mefarewellchapter xl london bridgewhy notevery heart has its bitterswicked boysgive me my booksuch a frighthonour bright so i went to london bridge and again took my station on the spot by the booth where i had stood on the former occasion the booth however was empty neither the applewoman nor her stall was to be seen i looked over the balustrade upon the river the tide was now as before rolling beneath the arch with frightful impetuosity as i gazed upon the eddies of the whirlpool i thought within myself how soon human life would become extinct there a plunge a convulsive flounder and all would be over when i last stood over that abyss i had felt a kind of impulsea fascination i had resisted iti did not plunge into it at present i felt a kind of impulse to plunge but the impulse was of a different kind it proceeded from a loathing of life i looked wistfully at the eddieswhat had i to live forwhat indeed i thought of brandt and struensee and yeoman patchshould i yield to the impulsewhy not my eyes were fixed on the eddies all of a sudden i shuddered i thought i saw heads in the pool human bodies wallowing confusedly eyes turned up to heaven with hopeless horror was that water orwhere was the impulse now i raised my eyes from the pool i looked no more upon iti looked forward far down the stream in the far distance ha what is that i thought i saw a kind of fata morgana green meadows waving groves a rustic home but in the far distancei staredi stareda fata morganait was gone i left the balustrade and walked to the farther end of the bridge where i stood for some time contemplating the crowd i then passed over to the other side with the intention of returning home just half way over the bridge in a booth immediately opposite to the one in which i had formerly beheld her sat my friend the old applewoman huddled up behind her stall well mother said i how are you the old woman lifted her head with a startled look dont you know me said i yes i think i do ah yes said she as her features beamed with recollection i know you dear you are the young lad that gave me the tanner well child got anything to sell nothing at all

did why some wicked boys ill tell you all about it eight or ten days ago i sat behind my stall reading my book all of a sudden i felt it snatched from my hand up i started and see three rascals of boys grinning at me one of them held the book in his hand what book is this said he grinning at it what do you want with my book said i clutching at it over my stall give me my book what do you want a book for said he holding it back i have a good mind to fling it into the thames give me my book i shrieked and snatching at it i fell over my stall and all my fruit was scattered about off ran the boysoff ran the rascal with my book oh dear i thought i should have died up i got however and ran after them as well as i could i thought of my fruit but i thought more of my book i left my fruit and ran after my book my book my book i shrieked murder theft robbery i was near being crushed under the wheels of a cart but i didnt care i followed the rascals stop them stop them i ran nearly as fast as theythey couldnt run very fast on account of the crowd at last some one stopped the rascal whereupon he turned round and flinging the book at me it fell into the mud well i picked it up and kissed it all muddy as it was has he robbed you said the man robbed me indeed why he had got my book oh your book said the man and laughed and let the rascal go ah he might laugh but well go on my heart beats so well i went back to my booth and picked up my stall and my fruits what i could find of them i couldnt keep my stall for two days i got such a fright and when i got round i couldnt bide the booth where the thing had happened so i came over to the other side oh the rascals if i could but see them hanged for what why for stealing my book i thought you didnt dislike stealingthat you were ready to buy thingsthere was your son you know yes to be sure he took things to be sure he did but you dont like a thing of yours to be taken no thats quite a different thing whats stealing

reading the book and was soon engrossed by it hours passed away once or twice i lifted up my eyes the applewoman was still confronting me at last my eyes began to ache whereupon i returned the book to the applewoman and giving her another tanner walked awaychapter xli decease of the reviewhomer himselfbread and cheesefinger and thumbimpossible to findsomething granduniversal mixturesome other publisher time passed away and with it the review which contrary to the publishers expectation did not prove a successful speculation about four months after the period of its birth it expired as all reviews must for which there is no demand authors had ceased to send their publications to it and consequently to purchase it for i have already hinted that it was almost entirely supported by authors of a particular class who expected to see their publications foredoomed to immortality in its pages the behaviour of these authors towards this unfortunate publication i can attribute to no other cause than to a report which was industriously circulated namely that the review was low and that to be reviewed in it was an infallible sign that one was a low person who could be reviewed nowhere else so authors took fright and no wonder for it will never do for an author to be considered low homer himself has never yet entirely recovered from the injury he received by lord chesterfields remark that the speeches of his heroes were frequently exceedingly low so the review ceased and the reviewing corps no longer existed as such they forthwith returned to their proper avocationsthe editor to compose tunes on his piano and to the task of disposing of the remaining copies of his quintilianthe inferior members to working for the publisher being to a man dependents of his one to composing fairy tales another to collecting miracles of popish saints and a third newgate lives and trials owing to the bad success of the review the publisher became more furious than ever my money was growing short and i one day asked him to pay me for my labours in the deceased publication sir said the publisher what do you want the money for merely to live on i replied it is very difficult to live in this town without money how much money did you bring with you to town demanded the publisher some twenty or thirty pounds i replied and you have spent it already no said i not entirely but it is fast disappearing sir said the publisher i believe you to be extravagant yes sir extravagant on what grounds do you suppose me to be so sir said the publisher you eat meat yes said i i eat meat sometimes what should i eat bread sir said the publisher bread and cheese so i do sir when i am disposed to indulge but i cannot often afford itit is very expensive to dine on bread and cheese especially when one is fond of cheese as i am my last bread and cheese dinner cost me fourteen pence there is drink sir with bread and cheese one must drink porter sir then sir eat breadbread alone as good men as yourself have eaten bread alone they have been glad to get it sir if with bread and cheese you must drink porter sir with bread alone you can perhaps drink water sir however i got paid at last for my writings in the review not it is true in the current coin of the realm but in certain bills there were two of them one payable at twelve and the other at eighteen months after date it was a long time before i could turn these bills to any account at last i found a person who at a discount of only thirty per cent consented to cash them not however without sundry grimaces and what was still more galling holding more than once the unfortunate papers high in air between his forefinger and thumb so ill indeed did i like this last action that i felt much inclined to snatch them away i restrained myself however for i remembered that it was very difficult to live without money and that if the present person did not discount the bills i should probably find no one else that would but if the treatment which i had experienced from the publisher previous to making this demand upon him was difficult to bear that which i subsequently underwent was far more so his great delight seemed to consist in causing me misery and mortification if on former occasions he was continually sending me in quest of lives and trials difficult to find he now was continually demanding lives and trials which it was impossible to find the personages whom he mentioned never having lived nor consequently been tried moreover some of my best lives and trials which i had corrected andedited with particular care and on which i prided myself no little he caused to be cancelled after they had passed through the press amongst these was the life of gentleman harry they are drugs sir said the publisher drugs that life of harry simms has long been the greatest drug in the calendarhas it not taggart taggart made no answer save by taking a pinch of snuff the reader has i hope not forgotten taggart whom i mentioned whilst giving an account of my first mornings visit to the publisher i beg taggarts pardon for having been so long silent about him but he was a very silent manyet there was much in taggartand taggart had always been civil and kind to me in his peculiar way well young gentleman said taggart to me one morning when we chanced to be alone a few days after the affair of the cancelling how do you like authorship i scarcely call authorship the drudgery i am engaged in said i what do you call authorship said taggart i scarcely know said i that is i can scarcely express what i think it shall i help you out said taggart turning round his chair and looking at me if you like said i to write something grand said taggart taking snuff to be stared atlifted on peoples shoulders well said i that is something like it taggart took snuff well said he why dont you write something grand i have said i what said taggart why said i there are those ballads taggart took snuff and those wonderful versions from ab gwilym taggart took snuff again you seem to be very fond of snuff said i looking at him angrily taggart tapped his box have you taken it long threeandtwenty years what snuff do you take universal mixture and you find it of use taggart tapped his box in what respect said i in manythere is nothing like it to get a man through but for snuff i should scarcely be where i am now have you been long here threeandtwenty years dear me said i and snuff brought you through give me a pinchpah i dont like it and i sneezed take another pinch said taggartno said i i dont like snuff then you will never do for authorship at least for this kind so i begin to thinkwhat shall i do taggart took snuff you were talking of a great workwhat shall it be taggart took snuff do you think i could write one taggart uplifted his two forefingers as if to tap he did not however it would require time said i with half a sigh taggart tapped his box a great deal of time i really think that my ballads taggart took snuff if published would do me credit ill make an effort and offer them to some other publisher taggart took a double quantity of snuffchapter xlii francis ardrythat wont do

young gentleman resided in handsome apartments in the neighbourhood of a fashionable square kept a livery servant and upon the whole lived in very good style going to see him one day between one and two i was informed by the servant that his master was engaged for the moment but that if i pleased to wait a few minutes i should find him at liberty having told the man that i had no objection he conducted me into a small apartment which served as antechamber to a drawingroom the door of this last being half open i could see francis ardry at the farther end speechifying and gesticulating in a very impressive manner the servant in some confusion was hastening to close the door but ere he could effect his purpose francis ardry who had caught a glimpse of me exclaimed come income in by all means and then proceeded as before speechifying and gesticulating filled with some surprise i obeyed his summons on entering the room i perceived another individual to whom francis ardry appeared to be addressing himself this other was a short spare man of about sixty his hair was of badger grey and his face was covered with wrinkleswithout vouchsafing me a look he kept his eye which was black and lustrous fixed full on francis ardry as if paying the deepest attention to his discourse all of a sudden however he cried with a sharp cracked voice that wont do sir that wont domore vehemenceyour argument is at present particularly weak therefore more vehemenceyou must confuse them stun them stultify them sir and at each of these injunctions he struck the back of his right hand sharply against the palm of the left good sirgood he occasionally uttered in the same sharp cracked tone as the voice of francis ardry became more and more vehement infinitely good he exclaimed as francis ardry raised his voice to the highest pitch and now sir abate let the tempest of vehemence declinegradually sir not too fast good sirvery good as the voice of francis ardry declined gradually in vehemence

description you will never redress the wrongs of your country now sir observe my gestures and pay attention to the tone of my voice sir thereupon making use of nearly the same terms which francis ardry had employed the individual in black uttered several sentences in tones and with gestures which were intended to express a considerable degree of pathos though it is possible that some people would have thought both the one and the other highly ludicrous after a pause francis ardry recommenced imitating the tones and the gestures of his monitor in the most admirable manner before he had proceeded far however he burst into a fit of laughter in which i should perhaps have joined provided it were ever my wont to laugh ha ha said the other good humouredly you are laughing at me well well i merely wished to give you a hint but you saw very well what i meant upon the whole i think you improve but i must now go having two other pupils to visit before four then taking from the table a kind of threecornered hat and a cane headed with amber he shook francis ardry by the hand and after glancing at me for a moment made me a half bow attended with a strange grimace and departed who is that gentleman said i to francis ardry as soon as we were alone oh that is said frank smiling the gentleman who gives me lessons in elocution and what need have you of elocution oh i merely obey the commands of my guardians said francis who insist that i should with the assistance of qualify myself for parliament for which they do me the honour to suppose that i have some natural talent i dare not disobey them for at the present moment i have particular reasons for wishing to keep on good terms with them but said i you are a roman catholic and i thought that persons of your religion were excluded from parliament why upon that very thing the whole matter hinges people of our religion are determined to be no longer excluded from parliament but to have a share in the government of the nation not that i care anything about the matter i merely obey the will of my guardians my thoughts are fixed on something better than politics i understand you said i dogfightingwell i can easily conceive that to some minds dogfighting i was not thinking of dogfighting said francis ardry interrupting me not thinking of dogfighting i ejaculated no said francis ardry something higher and much more rational than dogfighting at present occupies my thoughtsdear me said i i thought i had heard you say that there was nothing like it like what said francis ardry dogfighting to be sure said i pooh said francis ardry who but the gross and unrefined care anything for dogfighting that which at present engages my waking and sleeping thoughts is lovedivine lovethere is nothing like that listen to me i have a secret to confide to you and then francis ardry proceeded to make me his confidant it appeared that he had had the good fortune to make the acquaintance of the most delightful young frenchwoman imaginable annette la noire by name who had just arrived from her native country with the intention of obtaining the situation of governess in some english family a position which on account of her many accomplishments she was eminently qualified to fill francis ardry had however persuaded her to relinquish her intention for the present on the ground that until she had become acclimated in england her health would probably suffer from the confinement inseparable from the occupation in which she was desirous of engaging he had moreoverfor it appeared that she was the most frank and confiding creature in the worldsucceeded in persuading her to permit him to hire for her a very handsome first floor in his own neighbourhood and to accept a few inconsiderable presents in money and jewellery i am looking out for a handsome gig and horse said francis ardry at the conclusion of his narration it were a burning shame that so divine a creature should have to go about a place like london on foot or in a paltry hackney coach but said i will not the pursuit of politics prevent your devoting much time to this fair lady it will prevent me devoting all my time said francis ardry as i gladly would but what can i do my guardians wish me to qualify myself for a political orator and i dare not offend them by a refusal if i offend my guardians i should find it impossibleunless i have recourse to jews and moneylendersto support annette present her with articles of dress and jewellery and purchase a horse and cabriolet worthy of conveying her angelic person through the streets of london after a pause in which francis ardry appeared lost in thought his mind being probably occupied with the subject of annette i broke silence by observing so your fellowreligionists are really going to make a serious attempt to procure their emancipation yes said francis ardry starting from his reverie everything has been arranged even a leader has been chosen at least for us of ireland upon the whole the most suitable man in the world for the occasiona barrister of considerable talent mighty voice and magnificent impudence with emancipation liberty and redress for the wrongs of ireland in his mouth he is to force his way into the british house of commons dragging myself and others behind himhe will succeed and when he is in he will cut a figure i have heard himself who has heard him speak say that he will cut a figure and is competent to judge i demanded who but he said francis ardry no one questions his judgment concerning what relates to elocution his fame on that point is so well established that the greatest orators do not disdain occasionally to consult him c himself as i have been told when anxious to produce any particular effect in the house is in the habit of calling in for consultation as to matter or manner said i chiefly the latter said francis ardry though he is competent to give advice as to both for he has been an orator in his day and a leader of the people though he confessed to me that he was not exactly qualified to play the latter parti want paunch said he it is not always indispensable said i there is an orator in my town a hunchback and watchmaker without it who not only leads the people but the mayor too perhaps he has a succedaneum in his hunch but tell me is the leader of your movement in possession of that which wants no more deficient in it than in brass said francis ardry well said i whatever his qualifications may be i wish him success in the cause which he has taken upi love religious liberty we shall succeed said francis ardry john bull upon the whole is rather indifferent on the subject and then we are sure to be backed by the radical party who to gratify their political prejudices would join with satan himselfthere is one thing said i connected with this matter which surprises meyour own lukewarmness yes making every allowance for your natural predilection for dogfighting and your present enamoured state of mind your apathy at the commencement of such a movement is to me unaccountable you would not have cause to complain of my indifference said frank provided i thought my country would be benefited by this movement but i happen to know the origin of it the priests are the originators and what country was ever benefited by a movement which owed its origin to them so says voltaire a page of whom i occasionally read by the present move they hope to increase their influence and to further certain designs which they entertain both with regard to this country and ireland i do not speak rashly or unadvisedly a strange fellowa half italian half english priestwho was recommended to me by my guardians partly as a spiritualpartly as a temporal guide has let me into a secret or two he is fond of a glass of gin and waterand over a glass of gin and water cold with a lump of sugar in it he has been more communicative perhaps than was altogether prudent were i my own master i would kick him politics and religious movements to a considerable distance and now if you are going away do so quickly i have an appointment with annette and must make myself fit to appear before herchapter xliii progressglorious johnutterly unintelligiblewhat a difference by the month of october i had in spite of all difficulties and obstacles accomplished about twothirds of the principal task which i had undertaken the compiling of the newgate lives i had also made some progress in translating the publishers philosophy into german but about this time i began to see very clearly that it was impossible that our connection should prove of long duration yet in the event of my leaving the big man what other resource had ianother publisher but what had i to offer there were my ballads my ab gwilym but then i thought of taggart and his snuff his pinch of snuff however i determined to see what could be done so i took my ballads under my arm and went to various publishers some took snuff others did not but none took my ballads or ab gwilym they would not even look at them one asked me if i had anything elsehe was a snufftakeri said yes and going home returned with my translation of the german novel to which i have before alluded after keeping it for a fortnight he returned it to me on my visiting him and taking a pinch of snuff told me it would not do there were marks of snuff on the outside of the manuscript which was a roll of paper bound with red tape but there were no marks of snuff on the interior of the manuscript from which i concluded that he had never opened it i had often heard of one glorious john who lived at the western end of the town on consulting taggart he told me that it was possible that glorious john would publish my ballads and ab gwilym that is said he taking a pinch of snuff provided you can see him so i went to the house where glorious john resided and a glorious house it was but i could not see glorious johni called a dozen times but i never could see glorious john twenty years after by the greatest chance in the world i saw glorious john and sure enough glorious john published my books but they were different books from the first i never offered my ballads or ab gwilym to glorious john glorious john was no snufftaker he asked me to dinner and treated me with superb rhenish wine glorious john is now gone to his rest but iwhat was i going to saythe world will never forget glorious john so i returned to my last resource for the time then beingto the publisher persevering doggedly in my labour one day on visiting the publisher i found him stamping with fury upon certain fragments of paper sir said he you know nothing of german i have shown your translation of the first chapter of my philosophy to several germans it is utterly unintelligible to them did they see the philosophy i replied they did sir but they did not profess to understand english no more do i i replied if that philosophy be english the publisher was furiousi was silent for want of a pinch of snuff i had recourse to something which is no bad substitute for a pinch of snuff to those who cant take it silent contempt at first it made the publisher more furious as perhaps a pinch of snuff would it however eventually calmed him and he ordered me back to my occupations in other words the compilation to be brief the compilation was completed i got paid in the usual manner and forthwith left him he was a clever man but what a difference in clever menchapter xliv the old spota long historythou shalt not stealno harmeducationnecessityfoam on your lipapples and pearswhat will you readmetaphorthe fur capi dont know him it was past midwinter and i sat on london bridge in company with the old applewoman she had just returned from the other side of the bridge to her place in the booth where i had originally found her this she had done after repeated conversations with me she liked the old place best she said which she would never have left but for the terror which she experienced when the boys ran away with her book so i sat with her at the old spot one afternoon past midwinter reading the book of which i had by this time come to the last pages i had observed that the old woman for some time past had shown much less anxiety about the book than she had been in the habit of doing i was however not quite prepared for her offering to make me a present of it which she did that afternoon when having finished it i returned it to her with many thanks for the pleasure and instruction i had derived from its perusal you may keep it dear said the old woman with a sigh you may carry it to your lodging and keep it for your own looking at the old woman with surprise i exclaimed is it possible that you are willing to part with the book which has been your source of comfort so long whereupon the old woman entered into a long history from which i gathered that the book had become distasteful to her she hardly ever opened it of late she said or if she did it was only to shut it again also that other things which she had been fond of though of a widely different kind were now distasteful to her porter and beefsteaks were no longer grateful to her palate her present diet chiefly consisting of tea and bread and butter ah said i you have been ill and when people are ill they seldom like the things which give them pleasure when they are in health i learned moreover that she slept little at night and had all kinds of strange thoughts that as she lay awake many things connected with her youth which she had quite forgotten came into her mind there were certain words that came into her mind the night before the last which were continually humming in her ears i found that the words were thou shalt not steal on inquiring where she had first heard these words i learned that she had read them at school in a book called the primer to this school she had been sent by her mother who was a poor widow who followed the trade of appleselling in the very spot where her daughter followed it now it seems that the mother was a very good kind of woman but quite ignorant of letters the benefit of which she was willing to procure for her child and at the school the daughter learned to read and subsequently experienced the pleasure and benefit of letters in being able to read the book which she found in an obscure closet of her mothers house and which had been her principal companion and comfort for many years of her life but as i have said before she was now dissatisfied with the book and with most other things in which she had taken pleasure she dwelt much on the words thou shalt not steal she had never stolen things herself but then she had bought things which other people had stolen and which she knew had been stolen and her dear son had been a thief which he perhaps would not have been but for the example which she set him in buying things from characters as she called them who associated with her on inquiring how she had become acquainted with these characters i learned that times had gone hard with her that she had married but her husband had died after a long sickness which had reduced them to great distress that her fruit trade was not a profitable one and that she had bought and sold things which had been stolen to support herself and her son that for a long time she supposed there was no harm in doing so as her book was full of entertaining tales of stealing but she now thought that the book was a bad book and that learning to read was a bad thing her mother had never been able to read but had died in peace though poor so here was a woman who attributed the vices and follies of her life to being able to read her mother she said who could not read lived respectably and died in peace and what was the essential difference between the mother and daughter save that the latter could read but for her literature she might in all probability have lived respectably and honestly like her mother and might eventually have died in peace which at present she could scarcely hope to do education had failed to produce any good in this poor woman on the contrary there could be little doubt that she had been injured by it then was education a bad thing rousseau was of opinion that it was but rousseau was a frenchman at least wrote in french and i cared not the snap of my fingers for rousseau but education has certainly been of benefit in some instances well what did that prove but that partiality existed in the management of the affairs of the worldif education was a benefit to some why was it not a benefit to others could some avoid abusing it any more than others could avoid turning it to a profitable account i did not see how they could this poor simple woman found a book in her mothers closet a book which was a capital book for those who could turn it to the account for which it was intended a book from the perusal of which i felt myself wiser and better but which was by no means suited to the intellect of this poor simple woman who thought that it was written in praise of thieving yet she found it she read it andand i felt myself getting into a maze what is right thought i what is wrong do i exist does the world exist if it does every action is bound up with necessity necessity i exclaimed and cracked my finger joints ah it is a bad thing said the old woman what is a bad thing said i why to be poor dear you talk like a fool said i riches and poverty are only different forms of necessity you should not call me a fool dear you should not call your own mother a fool you are not my mother said i not your mother dearno no more i am but your calling me fool put me in mind of my dear son who often used to call me fooland you just now looked as he sometimes did with a blob of foam on your lip after all i dont know that you are not my mother dont you dear im glad of it i wish you would make it out how shall i make it out who can speak from his own knowledge as to the circumstances of his birth besides before attempting to establish our relationship it would be necessary to prove that such people exist what people dear you and i lord child you are mad that book has made you so dont abuse it said i the book is an excellent one that is provided it exists i wish it did not said the old woman but it shant long ill burn it or fling it into the riverthe voices at night tell me to do so tell the voices said i that they talk nonsense the book if it exists is a good book it contains a deep moral have you read it all all the funny parts dear all about taking things and the manner it was done as for the rest i could not exactly make it out then the book is not to blame i repeat that the book is a good book and contains deep morality always supposing that there is such a thing as morality which is the same thing as supposing that there is anything at all anything at all why ant we here on this bridge in my booth with my stall and my apples and pears baked hot you would sayi dont know all is a mystery a deep question it is a question and probably always will be whether there is a world and consequently apples and pears and provided there be a world whether that world be like an apple or a pear dont talk so dear i wont we will suppose that we all existworld ourselves apples and pears so you wish to get rid of the book yes dear i wish you would take it i have read it and have no farther use for it i do not need books in a little time perhaps i shall not have a place wherein to deposit myself far less books then i will fling it into the river dont do that here give it me now what shall i do with it you were so fond of iti am so no longer but how will you pass your time what will you read i wish i had never learned to read or if i had that i had only read the books i saw at school the primer or the other what was the other i think they called it the bible all about god and job and jesus ah i know it you have read it it is a nice bookall true true truei dont know what to say but if the world be true and not a lie a fiction i dont see why the bible as they call it should not be true bythebye what do you call bible in your tongue or indeed book of any kind as bible merely means a book what do i call the bible in my language dear yes the language of those who bring you things the language of those who did dear they bring them now no longer they call me a fool as you did dear just now they call kissing the bible which means taking a false oath smacking calfskin thats metaphor said i english but metaphorical what an odd language so you would like to have a bibleshall i buy you one i am poor dearno money since i left off the other trade well then ill buy you one no dear no you are poor and may soon want the money but if you can take me one conveniently on the sly you knowi think you may for as it is a good book i suppose there can be no harm in taking it that will never do said i more especially as i should be sure to be caught not having made taking of things my trade but ill tell you what ill dotry and exchange this book of yours for a bible who knows for what great things this same book of yours may serve well dear said the old woman do as you please i should like to see thewhat do you call itbible and to read it as you seem to think it true yes said i seem that is the way to express yourself in this maze of doubti seem to thinkthese apples and pears seem to beand here seems to be a gentleman who wants to purchase either one or the other a person had stopped before the applewomans stall and was glancing now at the fruit now at the old woman and myself he wore a blue mantle and had a kind of fur cap on his head he was somewhat above the middle stature his features were keen but rather hard there was a slight obliquity in his vision selecting a small apple he gave the old woman a penny then after looking at me scrutinizingly for a moment he moved from the booth in the direction of southwark do you know who that man is said i to the old woman no said she except that he is one of my best customers he frequently stops takes an apple and gives me a penny his is the only piece of money i have taken this blessed day i dont know him but he has once or twice sat down in the booth with two strangelooking menmulattos or lascars i think they call themchapter xlv bought and exchangedquite emptya new firmbiblescountenance of a lionclap of thundera truce with thisi have lost itclearly a rightgoddess of the mint in pursuance of my promise to the old woman i set about procuring her a bible with all convenient speed placing the book which she had intrusted to me for the purpose of exchange in my pocket i went to several shops and asked if bibles were to be had i found that there were plenty when however i informed the people that i came to barter they looked blank and declined treating with me saying that they did not do business in that way at last i went into a shop over the window of which i saw written books bought and exchanged there was a smartish young fellow in the shop with black hair and whiskers you exchange said i yes said he sometimes but we prefer selling what book do you want a bible said i ah said he theres a great demand for bibles just now all kinds of people are becoming very pious of late he added grinning at me i am afraid i cant do business with you more especially as the master is not at home what book have you brought taking the book out of my pocket i placed it on the counter the young fellow opened the book and inspecting the titlepage burst into a loud laugh what do you laugh for said i angrily and half clenching my fist laugh said the young fellow laugh who could help laughing i could said i i see nothing to laugh at i want to exchange this book for a bible you do said the young fellow well i daresay there are plenty who would be willing to exchange that is if they dared i wish master were at home but that would never do either masters a family man the bibles are not mine and master being a family man is sharp and knows all his stock id buy it of you but to tell you the truth i am quite empty here said he pointing to his pocket so i am afraid we cant deal whereupon looking anxiously at the young man what am i to do said i i really want a bible cant you buy one said the young man have you no money yes said i i have some but i am merely the agent of another i came to exchange not to buy what am i to do i dont know said the young man thoughtfully laying down the book on the counter i dont know what you can do i think you will find some difficulty in this bartering job the trade are rather precise all at once he laughed louder than before suddenly stopping however he put on a very grave look take my advice said he there is a firm established in this neighbourhood which scarcely sells any books but bibles they are very rich and pride themselves on selling their books at the lowest possible price apply to them who knows but what they will exchange with you thereupon i demanded with some eagerness of the young man the direction to the place where he thought it possible that i might effect the exchangewhich direction the young fellow cheerfully gave me and as i turned away had the civility to wish me success i had no difficulty in finding the house to which the young fellow had directed me it was a very large house situated in a square and upon the side of the house was written in large letters bibles and other religious books at the door of the house were two or three tumbrils in the act of being loaded with chests very much resembling teachests one of the chests falling down burst and out flew not tea but various books in a neat small size and in neat leather covers bibles said ibibles doubtless i was not quite right nor quite wrong picking up one of the books i looked at it for a moment and found it to be the new testament come young lad said a man who stood by in the dress of a porter put that book down it is none of yours if you want a book go in and deal for one deal thought i dealthe man seems to know what i am coming aboutand going in i presently found myself in a very large room behind a counter two men stood with their backs to a splendid fire warming themselves for the weather was cold of these men one was dressed in brown and the other was dressed in black both were tall menhe who was dressed in brown was thin and had a particularly illnatured countenance the man dressed in black was bulky his features were noble but they were those of a lion what is your business young man said the precise personage as i stood staring at him and his companion i want a bible said i what price what size said the preciselooking man as to size said i i should like to have a large onethat is if you can afford me onei do not come to buy oh friend said the preciselooking man if you come here expecting to have a bible for nothing you are mistakenwe i would scorn to have a bible for nothing said i or anything else i came not to beg but to barter there is no shame in that especially in a country like this where all folks barter oh we dont barter said the precise man at least bibles you had better depart stay brother said the man with the countenance of a lion let us ask a few questions this may be a very important case perhaps the young man has had convictions not i i exclaimed i am convinced of nothing and with regard to the biblei dont believe hey said the man with the lion countenance and there he stopped but with that hey the walls of the house seemed to shake the windows rattled and the porter whom i had seen in front of the house came running up the steps and looked into the apartment through the glass of the door there was silence for about a minutethe same kind of silence which succeeds a clap of thunder at last the man with the lion countenance who had kept his eyes fixed upon me said calmly were you about to say that you dont believe in the bible young man no more than in anything else said i you were talking of convictionsi have no convictions it is not easy to believe in the bible till one is convinced that there is a bible he seems to be insane said the primlooking man we had better order the porter to turn him out i am by no means certain said i that the porter could turn me out always provided there is a porter and this system of ours be not a lie and a dream come said the lionlooking man impatiently a truce with this nonsense if the porter cannot turn you out perhaps some other person can but to the pointyou want a bible i do said i but not for myself i was sent by another person to offer something in exchange for one and who is that person a poor old woman who has had what you call convictionsheard voices or thought she heard themi forgot to ask her whether they were loud ones what has she sent to offer in exchange said the man without taking any notice of the concluding part of my speech a book said i let me see it nay brother said the precise man this will never do if we once adopt the system of barter we shall have all the holders of useless rubbish in the town applying to us i wish to see what he has brought said the other perhaps baxter or jewells apology either of which would make a valuable addition to our collection well young man whats the matter with you i stood like one petrified i had put my hand into my pocketthe book was gone whats the matter repeated the man with the lion countenance in a voice very much resembling thunder i have it noti have lost it a pretty story truly said the preciselooking man lost it you had better retire said the other how shall i appear before the party who intrusted me with the book she will certainly think that i have purloined it notwithstanding all that i can say nor indeed can i blame herappearances are certainly against me they are soyou had better retirei moved towards the door stay young man one word more there is only one way of proceeding which would induce me to believe that you are sincere what is that said i stopping and looking at him anxiously the purchase of a bible purchase said i purchase i came not to purchase but to barter such was my instruction and how can i barter if i have lost the book the other made no answer and turning away i made for the door all of a sudden i started and turning round dear me said i it has just come into my head that if the book was lost by my negligence as it must have been i have clearly a right to make it good no answer yes i repeated i have clearly a right to make it good how glad i am see the effect of a little reflection i will purchase a bible instantly that is if i have not lost and with considerable agitation i felt in my pocket the primlooking man smiled i suppose said he that he has lost his money as well as book no said i i have not and pulling out my hand i displayed no less a sum than three halfcrowns o noble goddess of the mint as dame charlotta nordenflycht the swede said a hundred and fifty years ago great is thy power how energetically the possession of thee speaks in favour of mans character only halfacrown for this bible said i putting down the money it is worth three and bowing to the man of noble features i departed with my purchase queer customer said the

alonga great servicethings of importancephilological matters mother of languageszhats a few days after the occurrence of what is recorded in the last chapter as i was wandering in the city chance directed my footsteps to an alley leading from one narrow street to another in the neighbourhood of cheapside just before i reached the mouth of the alley a man in a great coat closely followed by another passed it and at the moment in which they were passing i observed the man behind snatch something from the pocket of the other whereupon darting into the street i seized the hindermost man by the collar crying at the same time to the other my good friend this person has just picked your pocket the individual whom i addressed turning round with a start glanced at me and then at the person whom i held london is the place for strange rencounters it appeared to me that i recognised both individualsthe man whose pocket had been picked and the other the latter now began to struggle violently i have picked no ones pocket said he rascal said the other you have got my pocketbook in your bosom no i have not said the other and struggling more violently than before the pocketbook dropped from his bosom upon the ground the other was now about to lay hands upon the fellow who was still struggling you had better take up your book said i i can hold him he followed my advice and taking up his pocketbook surveyed my prisoner with a ferocious look occasionally glaring at me yes i had seen him beforeit was the stranger whom i had observed on london bridge by the stall of the old applewoman with the cap and cloak but instead of these he now wore a hat and great coat well said i at last what am i to do with this gentleman of ours nodding to the prisoner who had now left off struggling shall i let him go go said the other go the knavethe rascal let him go indeed not so he shall go before the lord mayor bring him along oh let me go said the other let me go this is the first offence i assure yethe first time i ever thought to do anything wrong hold your tongue said i or i shall be angry with you if i am not very much mistaken you once attempted to cheat me i never saw you before in all my life said the fellow though his countenance seemed to belie his words that is not true said i you are the man who attempted to cheat me of oneandninepence in the coachyard on the first morning of my arrival in london i dont doubt it said the other a confirmed thief and here his tones became peculiarly sharp i would fain see him hangedcrucified drag him along i am no constable said i you have got your pocketbooki would rather you would bid me let him go bid you let him go said the other almost furiously i commandstay what was i going to say i was forgetting myself he observed more gently but he stole my pocketbookif you did but know what it contained well said i if it contains anything valuable be the more thankful that you have recovered it as for the man i will help you to take him where you please but i wish you would let him go the stranger hesitated and there was an extraordinary play of emotion in his features he looked ferociously at the pickpocket and more than once somewhat suspiciously at myself at last his countenance cleared and with a good grace he said well you have done me a great service and you have my consent to let him go but the rascal shall not escape with impunity he exclaimed suddenly as i let the man go and starting forward before the fellow could escape he struck him a violent blow on the face the man staggered and had nearly fallen recovering himself however he said i tell you what my fellow if i ever meet you in this street in a dark night and i have a knife about me it shall be the worse for you as for you young man said he to me but observing that the other was making towards him he left whatever he was about to say unfinished and taking to his heels was out of sight in a moment the stranger and myself walked in the direction of cheapside the way in which he had been originally proceeding he was silent for a few moments at length he said you have really done me a great service and i should be ungrateful not to acknowledge it i am a merchant and a merchants pocketbook as you perhaps know contains many things of importance but young man he exclaimed i think i have seen you before i thought so at first but where i cannot exactly say where was it i mentioned london bridge and the old applewoman oh said he and smiled and there was something peculiar in his smile i remember now do you frequently sit on london bridge occasionally said ithat old woman is an old friend of mine friend said the stranger i am glad of it for i shall know where to find you at present i am going to change time you know is precious to a merchant we were by this time close to cheapside farewell said he i shall not forget this service i trust we shall soon meet again he then shook me by the hand and went his way the next day as i was seated beside the old woman in the booth the stranger again made his appearance and after a word or two sat down beside me the old woman was sometimes reading the bible which she had already had two or three days in her possession and sometimes discoursing with me our discourse rolled chiefly on philological matters what do you call bread in your language said i you mean the language of those who bring me things to buy or who did for as i told you before i shant buy any more its no language of mine dearthey call bread pannam in their language pannam said i pannam evidently connected with if not derived from the latin panis even as the word tanner which signifieth a sixpence is connected with if not derived from the latin tener which is itself connected with if not derived from tawno or tawner which in the language of mr petulengro signifieth a sucking child let me see what is the term for bread in the language of mr petulengro morro or manro as i have sometimes heard it called is there not some connection between these words and panis yes i think there is and i should not wonder if morro manro and panis were connected perhaps derived from the same root but what is that root i dont knowi wish i did though perhaps i should not be the happier morromanro i rather think morro is the oldest form it is easier to say morro than manro morro irish aran welsh bara english bread i can see a resemblance between all the words and pannam too and i rather think that the petulengrian word is the elder how odd it would be if the language of mr petulengro should eventually turn out to be the mother of all the languages in the world yet it is certain that there are some languages in which the terms for bread have no connection with the word used by mr petulengro notwithstanding those languages in many other points exhibit a close affinity to the language of the horseshoe master for example bread in hebrew is laham which assuredly exhibits little similitude to the word used by the aforesaid petulengro in armenian it is zhats said the stranger starting up by the patriarch and the three holy churches this is wonderful how came you to know aught

i was about to reply to the interrogation of my newformed acquaintance a man with a dusky countenance probably one of the lascars or mulattos of whom the old woman had spoken came up and whispered to

indicated it was situated in a dark and narrow street in the heart of the city at no great distance from the bank i entered a countingroom in which a solitary clerk with a foreign look was writing the stranger was not at home returning the next day however i met him at the door as he was about to enter he shook me warmly by the hand i am glad to see you said he follow me i was just thinking of you he led me through the countingroom to an apartment up a flight of stairs before ascending however he looked into the book in which the foreignvisaged clerk was writing and seemingly not satisfied with the manner in which he was executing his task he gave him two or three cuffs telling him at the same time that he deserved crucifixion the apartment above stairs to which he led me was large with three windows which opened upon the street the walls were hung with wired cases apparently containing books there was a table and two or three chairs but the principal article of furniture was a long sofa extending from the door by which we entered to the farther end of the apartment seating himself upon the sofa my new acquaintance motioned to me to sit beside him and then looking me full in the face repeated his former inquiry in the name of all that is wonderful how came you to know aught of my language there is nothing wonderful in that said i we are at the commencement of a philological age every one studies languages that is every one who is fit for nothing else philology being the last resource of dulness and ennui i have got a little in advance of the throng by mastering the armenian alphabet but i foresee the time when every unmarriageable miss and desperate blockhead will likewise have acquired the letters of mesroub and will know the term for bread in armenian and perhaps that for wine kini said my companion and that and the other word put me in mind of the duties of hospitality will you eat bread and drink wine with me willingly said i whereupon my companion unlocking a closet produced on a silver salver a loaf of bread with a silverhandled knife and wine in a silver flask with cups of the same metal i hope you like my fare said he after we had both eaten and drunk i like your bread said i for it is stale i like not your wine it is sweet and i hate sweet wine it is wine of cyprus said my entertainer and when i found that it was wine of cyprus i tasted it again and the second taste pleased me much better than the first notwithstanding that i still thought it somewhat sweet so said i after a pause looking at my companion you are an armenian yes said he an armenian born in london but not less an armenian on that account my father was a native of ispahan one of the celebrated armenian colony which was established there shortly after the time of the dreadful hunger which drove the children of haik in swarms from their original country and scattered them over most parts of the eastern and western world in ispahan he passed the greater portion of his life following mercantile pursuits with considerable success certain enemies however having accused him to the despot of the place of using seditious language he was compelled to flee leaving most of his property behind travelling in the direction of the west he came at last to london where he established himself and eventually died leaving behind a large property and myself his only child the fruit of a marriage with an armenian english woman who did not survive my birth more than three months the armenian then proceeded to tell me that he had carried on the business of his father which seemed to embrace most matters from buying silks of lascars to speculating in the funds and that he had considerably increased the property which his father had left him he candidly confessed that he was wonderfully fond of gold and said there was nothing like it for giving a person respectability and consideration in the world to which assertion i made no answer being not exactly prepared to contradict it and when he had related to me his history he expressed a desire to know something more of myself whereupon i gave him the outline of my history concluding with saying i am now a poor author or rather a philologist upon the streets of london possessed of many tongues which i find of no use in the world learning without money is anything but desirable said the armenian as it unfits a man for humble occupations it istrue that it may occasionally beget him friends i confess to you that your understanding something of my language weighs more with me than the service you rendered me in rescuing my pocketbook the other day from the claws of that scoundrel whom i yet hope to see hanged if not crucified notwithstanding there were in that pocketbook papers and documents of considerable value yes that circumstance makes my heart warm towards you for i am proud of my languageas i indeed well may bewhat a language noble and energetic quite original differing from all others both in words and structure you are mistaken said i many languages resemble the armenian both in structure and words for example said the armenian for example said i the english the english said the armenian show me one word in which the english resembles the armenian you walk on london bridge said i yes said the armenian i saw you look over the balustrade the other morning true said the armenian well what did you see rushing up through the arches with noise and foam what was it said the armenian what was ityou dont mean the tide do i not said i well what has the tide to do with the matter much said i what is the tide the ebb and flow of the sea said the armenian the sea itself what is the haik word for sea the armenian gave a strong gasp then nodding his head thrice you are right said he the english word tide is the armenian for sea and now i begin to perceive that there are many english words which are armenian there is and and there again in french there is and derived from the armenian how strange how singulari thank you it is a proud thing to see that the language of my race has had so much influence over the languages of the world i saw that all that related to his race was the weak point of the armenian i did not flatter the armenian with respect to his race or language an inconsiderable people said i shrewd and industrious but still an inconsiderable people a language bold and expressive and of some antiquity derived though perhaps not immediately from some much older tongue i do not think that the armenian has had any influence over the formation of the languages of the world i am not much indebted to the armenian for the solution of any doubts whereas to the language of mr petulengro i have heard you mention that name before said the armenian who is mr petulengro and then i told the armenian who mr petulengro was the armenian spoke contemptuously of mr petulengro and his race dont speak contemptuously of mr petulengro said i nor of anything belonging to him he is a dark mysterious personage all connected with him is a mystery especially his language but i believe that his language is doomed to solve a great philological problemmr petulengro you appear agitated said the armenian take another glass of wine you possess a great deal of philological knowledge but it appears to me that the language of this petulengro is your foible but let us change the subject i feel much interested in you and would fain be of service to you can you cast accounts i shook my head keep books i have an idea that i could write books said i but as to keeping them and here again i shook my head the armenian was silent some time all at once glancing at one of the wire cases with which as i have already said thewalls of the room were hung he asked me if i was well acquainted with the learning of the haiks the books in these cases said he contain the masterpieces of haik learning no said i all i know of the learning of the haiks is their translation of the bible you have never read z no said i i have never read z i have a plan said the armenian i think i can employ you agreeably and profitably i should like to see z in an english dress you shall translate z if you can read the scriptures in armenian you can translate z he is our esop the most acute and clever of all our moral writershis philosophy i will have nothing to do with him said i wherefore said the armenian there is an old proverb said i that a burnt child avoids the fire i have burnt my hands sufficiently with attempting to translate philosophy to make me cautious of venturing upon it again and then i told the armenian how i had been persuaded by the publisher to translate his philosophy into german and what sorry thanks i had received and who knows said i but the attempt to translate armenian philosophy into english might be attended with yet more disagreeable consequences the armenian smiled you would find me very different from the publisher in many points i have no doubt i should i replied but at the present moment i feel like a bird which has escaped from a cage and though hungry feels no disposition to return of what nation is the dark man below stairs whom i saw writing at the desk he is a moldave said the armenian the dog and here his eyes sparkled deserves to be crucified he is continually making mistakes the armenian again renewed his proposition about z which i again refused as i felt but little inclination to place myself beneath the jurisdiction of a person who was in the habit of cuffing those whom he employed when they made mistakes i presently took my departure not however before i had received from the armenian a pressing invitation to call upon him whenever i should feel disposedchapter xlviii what to dostrong enoughfame and profitalliterative euphonyexcellent fellowlisten to mea plan bagnigge wells anxious thoughts frequently disturbed me at this time with respect to what i was to do and how support myself in the great city my future prospects were gloomy enough and i looked forward and feared sometimes i felt half disposed to accept the offer of the armenian and to commence forthwith under his superintendence the translation of the haik esop but the remembrance of the cuffs which i had seen him bestow upon the moldavian when glancing over his shoulder into the ledger or whatever it was on which he was employed immediately drove the inclination from my mind i could not support the idea of the possibility of his staring over my shoulder upon my translation of the haik esop and dissatisfied with my attempts treating me as he had treated the moldavian clerk placing myself in a position which exposed me to such treatment would indeed be plunging into the fire after escaping from the frying pan the publisher insolent and overbearing as he was whatever he might have wished or thought had never lifted his hand against me or told me that i merited crucifixion what was i to do turn porter i was strong but there was something besides strength required to ply the trade of a portera mind of a particularly phlegmatic temperament which i did not possess what should i doenlist as a soldier i was tall enough but something besides height is required to make a man play with credit the part of soldier i mean a private onea spirit if spirit it can be called which would not only enable a man to submit with patience to insolence and abuse and even to cuffs and kicks but occasionally to the lash i felt that i was not qualified to be a soldier at least a private one far better be a drudge to the most ferocious of publishers editing newgate lives and writing in eighteenpenny reviewsbetter to translate the haik esop under the superintendence of ten armenians than be a private soldier in the english service i did not decide rashlyi knew something of soldiering what should i do i thought that i would make a last and desperate attempt to dispose of the ballads and of ab gwilym i had still an idea that provided i could persuade any spirited publisher to give these translations to the world i should acquire both considerable fame and profit not perhaps a worldembracing fame such as byrons but a fame not to be sneered at which would last me a considerable time and would keep my heart from breakingprofit not equal to that which scott had made by his wondrous novels but which would prevent me from starving and enable me to achieve some other literary enterprise i read and reread my ballads and the more i read them the more i was convinced that the public in the event of their being published would freely purchase and hail them with the merited applause were not the deeds and adventures wonderful and heartstirring from which it is true i could claim no merit being but the translator but had i not rendered them into english with all their original fire yes i was confident i had and i had no doubt that the public would say so and then with respect to ab gwilym had i not done as much justice to him as to the danish ballads not only rendering faithfully his thoughts imagery and phraseology but even preserving in my translation the alliterative euphony which constitutes one of the most remarkable features of welsh prosody yes i had accomplished all this and i doubted not that the public would receive my translations from ab gwilym with quite as much eagerness as my version of the danish ballads but i found the publishers as untractable as ever and to this day the public has never had an opportunity of doing justice to the glowing fire of my ballad versification and the alliterative euphony of my imitations of ab gwilym i had not seen francis ardry since the day i had seen him taking lessons in elocution one afternoon as i was seated at my table my head resting on my hands he entered my apartment sitting down he inquired of me why i had not been to see him i might ask the same question of you i replied wherefore have you not been to see me whereupon francis ardry told me that he had been much engaged in his oratorical exercises also in escorting the young frenchwoman about to places of public amusement he then again questioned me as to the reason of my not having been to see him i returned an evasive answer the truth was that for some time past my appearance owing to the state of my finances had been rather shabby and i did not wish to expose a fashionable young man like francis ardry who lived in a fashionable neighbourhood to the imputation of having a shabby acquaintance i was aware that francis ardry was an excellent fellow but on that very account i felt under existing circumstances a delicacy in visiting him it is very possible that he had an inkling of how matters stood as he presently began to talk of my affairs and prospects i told him of my late ill success with the booksellers and inveighed against their blindness to their own interest in refusing to publish my translations the last that i addressed myself to said i told me not to trouble him again unless i could bring him a decent novel or a tale well said frank and why did you not carry him a decent novel or a tale because i have neither said i and to write them is i believe above my capacity at present i feel divested of allenergyheartless and almost hopeless i see how it is said francis ardry you have overworked yourself and worst of all to no purpose take my advice cast all care aside and only think of diverting yourself for a month at least divert myself said i and where am i to find the means be that care on my shoulders said francis ardry listen to memy uncles have been so delighted with the favourable accounts which they have lately received from t of my progress in oratory that in the warmth of their hearts they made me a present yesterday of two hundred pounds this is more money than i want at least for the present do me the favour to take half of it as a loanhear me said he observing that i was about to interrupt him i have a plan in my headone of the prettiest in the world the sister of my charmer is just arrived from france she cannot speak a word of english and as annette and myself are much engaged in our own matters we cannot pay her the attention which we should wish and which she deserves for she is a truly fascinating creature although somewhat differing from my charmer having blue eyes and flaxen hair whilst annette on the contrarybut i hope you will shortly see annette now my plan is thistake the money dress yourself fashionably and conduct annettes sister to bagnigge wells and what should we do at bagnigge wells do said francis ardry dance but said i i scarcely know anything of dancing then heres an excellent opportunity of improving yourself like most frenchwomen she dances divinely however if you object to bagnigge wells and dancing go to brighton and remain there a month or two at the end of which time you can return with your mind refreshed and invigorated and materials perhaps for a tale or novel i never heard a more foolish plan said i or one less likely to terminate profitably or satisfactorily i thank you however for your offer which is i dare say well meant if i am to escape from my cares and troubles and find my mind refreshed and invigorated i must adopt other means than conducting a french demoiselle to brighton or bagnigge wells defraying the expense by borrowing from a friendchapter xlix singular personagea large sumpapa of romewe are christiansdegenerate armeniansroots of ararat regular features the armenian i frequently saw this individual availing myself of the permission which he had given me to call upon him a truly singular personage was he with his love of amassing money and his nationality so strong as to be akin to poetry many an armenian i have subsequently known fond of moneygetting and not destitute of national spirit but never another who in the midst of his schemes of lucre was at all times willing to enter into a conversation on the structure of the haik language or whoever offered me money to render into english the fables of z in the hope of astonishing the stockjobbers of the exchange with the wisdom of the haik esop but he was fond of money very fond within a little time i had won his confidence to such a degree that he informed me that the grand wish of his heart was to be possessed of two hundred thousand pounds i think you might satisfy yourself with the half said i one hundred thousand pounds is a large sum you are mistaken said the armenian a hundred thousand pounds is nothing my father left me that or more at his death no i shall never be satisfied with less than two and what will you do with your riches said i when you have obtained them will you sit down and muse upon them or will you deposit them in a cellar and go down once a day to stare at them i have heard say that the fulfilment of ones wishes is invariably the precursor of extreme misery and forsooth i can scarcely conceive a more horrible state of existence than to be without a hope or wish it is bad enough i dare say said the armenian it will however be time enough to think of disposing of the money when i have procured it i still fall short by a vast sum of the two hundred thousand pounds i had occasionally much conversation with him on the state and prospects of his nation especially of that part of it which still continued in the original country of the haiksararat and its confines which it appeared he had frequently visited he informed me that since the death of the last haik monarch which occurred in the eleventh century armenia had been governed both temporally and spiritually by certain personages called patriarchs their temporal authority however was much circumscribed by the persian and turk especially the former of whom the armenian spoke with much hatred whilst their spiritual authority had at various times been considerably undermined by the emissaries of the papa of rome as the armenian called him the papa of rome sent his emissaries at an early period amongst us said the armenian seducing the minds of weakheaded people persuading them that the hillocks of rome are higher than the ridges of ararat that the roman papa has more to say in heaven than the armenian patriarch and that puny latin is a better language than nervous and sonorous haik they are both dialects said i of the language of mr petulengro one of whose race i believe to have been the original founder of rome but with respect to religion what are the chief points of your faith you are christians i believe yes said the armenian we are christians in our way we believe in god the holy spirit and saviour though we are not prepared to admit that the last personage is not only himself but the other two we believe and then the armenian told me of several things which the haiks believed or disbelieved but what we find most hard of all to believe said he is that the man of the molehills is entitled to our allegiance he not being a haik or understanding the haik language but by your own confession said i he has introduced a schism in your nation and has amongst you many that believe in him it is true said the armenian that even on the confines of ararat there are a great number who consider that mountain to be lower than the hillocks of rome but the greater number of degenerate armenians are to be found amongst those who have wandered to the west most of the haik churches of the west consider rome to be higher than araratmost of the armenians of this place hold that dogma i however have always stood firm in the contrary opinion ha hahere the armenian laughed in his peculiar mannertalking of this matter puts me in mind of an adventure which lately befell me with one of the emissaries of the papa of rome for the papa of rome has at present many emissaries in this country in order to seduce the people from their own quiet religion to the savage heresy of rome this fellow came to me partly in the hope of converting me but principally to extort money for the purpose of furthering the designs of rome in this country i humoured the fellow at first keeping him in play for nearly a month deceiving and laughing at him at last he discovered that he could make nothing of me and departed with the scowl of caiaphas whilsti cried after him the roots of ararat are deeper than those of rome the armenian had occasionally reverted to the subject of the translation of the haik esop which he had still a lurking desire that i should execute but i had invariably declined the undertaking without however stating my reasons on one occasion when we had been conversing on the subject the armenian who had been observing my countenance for some time with much attention remarked perhaps after all you are right and you might employ your time to better advantage literature is a fine thing especially haik literature but neither that nor any other would be likely to serve as a foundation to a mans fortune and to make a fortune should be the principal aim of every ones life therefore listen to me accept a seat at the desk opposite to my moldavian clerk and receive the rudiments of a merchants education you shall be instructed in the armenian way of doing businessi think you would make an excellent merchant why do you think so because you have something of the armenian look i understand you said i you mean to say that i squint not exactly said the armenian but there is certainly a kind of irregularity in your features one eye appears to me larger than the othernever mind but rather rejoice in that irregularity consists your strength all people with regular features are fools it is very hard for them youll say but there is no help all we can do who are not in such a predicament is to pity those who are well will you accept my offer no you are a singular individual but i must not forget my own concerns i must now go forth having an appointment by which i hope to make moneychapter l wish fulfilledextraordinary figurebuenonoahthe two facesi dont blame himtoo fond of moneywere i an armenian the fulfilment of the armenians grand wish was nearer at hand than either he or i had anticipated partly owing to the success of a bold speculation in which he had some time previously engaged and partly owing to the bequest of a large sum of money by one of his nation who died at this period in paris he found himself in the possession of a fortune somewhat exceeding two hundred thousand pounds this fact he communicated to me one evening about an hour after the close of change the hour at which i generally called and at which i mostly found him at home well said i and what do you intend to do next i scarcely know said the armenian i was thinking of that when you came in i dont see anything that i can do save going on in my former course after all i was perhaps too moderate in making the possession of two hundred thousand pounds the summit of my ambition there are many individuals in this town who possess three times that sum and are not yet satisfied no i think i can do no better than pursue the old career who knows but i may make the two hundred thousand three or fourthere is already a surplus which is an encouragement however we will consider the matter over a goblet of wine i have observed of late that you have become partial to my cyprus and it came to pass that as we were seated over the cyprus wine we heard a knock at the door adelante cried the armenian whereupon the door opened and in walked a somewhat extraordinary figurea man in a long loose tunic of a stuff striped with black and yellow breeches of plush velvet silk stockings and shoes with silver buckles on his head he wore a highpeaked hat he was tall had a hooked nose and in age was about fifty welcome rabbi manasseh said the armenian i know your knockyou are welcome sit down i am welcome said manasseh sitting down hehehe you know my knocki bring you moneybueno there was something very peculiar in the sound of that buenoi never forgot it thereupon a conversation ensued between rabbi manasseh and the armenian in a language which i knew to be spanish though a peculiar dialect it related to a mercantile transaction the rabbi sighed heavily as he delivered to the other a considerable sum of money it is right said the armenian handing a receipt it is right and i am quite satisfied you are satisfiedyou have taken money bueno i have nothing to say against your being satisfied come rabbi said the armenian do not despond it may be your turn next to take money in the meantime cant you be persuaded to taste my cyprus hehehe señor you know i do not love wine i love noah when he is himself but as janus i love him not but you are merry bueno you have a right to be so excuse me said i but does noah ever appear as janus hehehe said the rabbi he only appeared as janus onceuna vez quando estuvo borracho which means i understand said i when he was and i drew the side of my right hand sharply across my left wrist are you one of our people said the rabbi no said i i am one of the goyim but i am only half enlightened why should noah be janus when he was in that state hehehe you must know that in lasan akhades wine is janin in armenian kini said i in welsh gwin latin vinum but do you think that janus and janin are one do i think dont the commentators say so does not master leo abarbenel say so in his dialogues of divine love but said i i always thought that janus was a god of the ancient romans who stood in a temple open in time of war and shut in time of peace he was represented with two faces whichwhichhehehe said the rabbi rising from his seat he had two faces had he and what did those two faces typify you do not know no nor did the romans who carved him with two faces know why they did so for they were only half enlightened like you and the rest of the goyim yet they were right in carving him with two faces looking from each other they were right though they knew not why there was a tradition among them that the janinoso had two faces but they knew not that one was for the world which was gone and the other for the world before himfor the drowned world and for the present as master leo abarbenel says in his dialogues of divine love hehehe continued the rabbi who had by this time advanced to the door and turning round waved the two forefingers of his right hand in our faces the goyims and epicouraiyim are clever men they know how to make money better than we of israel my good friend there is a clever man i bring him money he never brought me any bueno i do not blame him he knows much very much but one thing there is my friend does not know nor any of the epicureans he does not know the sacred thinghe has never received the gift of interpretation which god alone gives to the seedhe has his gift i have minehe is satisfied i dont blame him bueno and with this last word in his mouth he departed is that man a native of spain i demanded not a native of spain said the armenian though he is one of those who call themselves spanish jews and who are to be found scattered throughout europe speaking the spanish language transmitted to them by their ancestors who were expelled from spain in the time of ferdinand and isabella the jews are a singular people said i a race of cowards and dastards said the armenian without a home or country servants to servants persecuted and despised by all and what are the haiks i demanded very different from the jews replied the armenian the haiks have a homea country and can occasionally use a good sword though it is true they are not what they might be then it is a shame that they do not become so said i but they are too fond of money there is yourself with two hundred thousand pounds in your pocket craving for more whilst you might be turning your wealth to the service of your country in what manner said the armenian i have heard you say that the grand oppressor of your country is the persian why not attempt to free your country from his oppressionyou have two hundred thousand pounds and money is the sinew of war would you then have me attack the persian i scarcely know what to say fighting is a rough trade and i am by no means certain that you are calculated for the scratch it is not every one who has been brought up in the school of mr petulengro and tawno chikno all i can say is that if i were an armenian and had two hundred thousand pounds to back me i would attack the persian hem said the armenianchapter li the one halfcrownmerit in patiencecementer of friendshipdreadful perplexitythe usual gutturalarmenian lettersmuch indebted to youpure helplessnessdumb people one morning on getting up i discovered that my whole worldly wealth was reduced to one halfcrownthroughout that day i walked about in considerable distress of mind it was now requisite that i should come to a speedy decision with respect to what i was to do i had not many alternatives and before i had retired to rest on the night of the day in question i had determined that i could do no better than accept the first proposal of the armenian and translate under his superintendence the haik esop into english i reflected for i made a virtue of necessity that after all such an employment would be an honest and honourable one honest inasmuch as by engaging in it i should do harm to nobody honourable inasmuch as it was a literary task which not every one was capable of executing it was not everyone of the booksellers writers of london who was competent to translate the haik esop i determined to accept the offer of the armenian once or twice the thought of what i might have to undergo in the translation from certain peculiarities of the armenians temper almost unsettled me but a mechanical diving of my hand into my pocket and the feeling of the solitary halfcrown confirmed me after all this was a life of trial and tribulation and i had read somewhere or other that there was much merit in patience so i determined to hold fast in my resolution of accepting the offer of the armenian but all of a sudden i remembered that the armenian appeared to have altered his intentions towards me he appeared no longer desirous that i should render the haik esop into english for the benefit of the stockjobbers on exchange but rather that i should acquire the rudiments of doing business in the armenian fashion and accumulate a fortune which would enable me to make a figure upon change with the best of the stockjobbers well thought i withdrawing my hand from my pocket whither it had again mechanically dived after all what would the world what would this city be without commerce i believe the world and particularly this city would cut a very poor figure without commerce and there is something poetical in the idea of doing business after the armenian fashion dealing with darkfaced lascars and rabbins of the sephardim yes should the armenian insist upon it i would accept a seat at the desk opposite the moldavian clerk i do not like the idea of cuffs similar to those the armenian bestowed upon the moldavian clerk whatever merit there may be in patience i do not think that my estimation of the merit of patience would be sufficient to induce me to remain quietly sitting under the infliction of cuffs i think i should in the event of his cuffing me knock the armenian down well i think i have heard it said somewhere that a knockdown blow is a great cementer of friendship i think i have heard of two people being better friends than ever after the one had received from the other a knockdown blow that night i dreamed i had acquired a colossal fortune some four hundred thousand pounds by the armenian way of doing business but suddenly woke in dreadful perplexity as to how i should dispose of it about nine oclock next morning i set off to the house of the armenian i had never called upon him so early before and certainly never with a heart beating with so much eagerness but the situation of my affairs had become very critical and i thought that i ought to lose no time in informing the armenian that i was at length perfectly willing either to translate the haik esop under his superintendence or to accept a seat at the desk opposite to the moldavian clerk and acquire the secrets of armenian commerce with a quick step i entered the countingroom where notwithstanding the earliness of the hour i found the clerk busied as usual at his desk he had always appeared to me a singular being this same moldavian clerk a person of fewer words could scarcely be conceived provided his master were at home he would on my inquiring nod his head and provided he were not he would invariably reply with the monosyllable no delivered in a strange guttural tone on the present occasion being full of eagerness and impatience i was about to pass by him to the apartment above without my usual inquiry when he lifted his head from the ledger in which he was writing and laying down his pen motioned to me with his forefinger as if to arrest my progress whereupon i stopped and with a palpitating heart demanded whether the master of the house was at home the moldavian clerk replied with his usual guttural and opening his desk ensconced his head therein it does not much matter said i i suppose i shall find him at home after change it does not much matter i can return i was turning away with the intention of leaving the room at this moment however the head of the moldavian clerk became visible and i observed a letter in his hand which he had inserted in the desk at the same time with his head this he extended towards me making at the same time a sidelong motion with his head as much as to say that it contained something which interested me i took the letter and the moldavian clerk forthwith resumed his occupation the back of the letter bore my name written in armenian characters with a trembling hand i broke the seal and unfolding the letter i beheld several lines alsowritten in the letters of mesroub the cadmus of the armenians i stared at the lines and at first could not make out a syllable of their meaning at last how ever by continued staring i discovered that though the letters were armenian the words were english in about ten minutes i had contrived to decipher the sense of the letter it ran somewhat in this style my dear friend the words which you uttered in our last conversation have made a profound impression upon me i have thought them over day and night and have come to the conclusion that it is my bounden duty to attack the persians when these lines are delivered to you i shall be on the route to ararat a mercantile speculation will be to the world the ostensible motive of my journey and it is singular enough that one which offers considerable prospect of advantage has just presented itself on the confines of persia think not however that motives of lucre would have been sufficiently powerful to tempt me to the east at the present moment i may speculate it is true but i should scarcely have undertaken the journey but for your pungent words inciting me to attack the persians doubt not that i will attack them on the first opportunity i thank you heartily for putting me in mind of my duty i have hitherto to use your own words been too fond of moneygetting like all my countrymen i am much indebted to you farewell and may every prosperity await you for some time after i had deciphered the epistle i stood as if rooted to the floor i felt stunnedmy last hope was gone presently a feeling arose in my minda feeling of selfreproach whom had i to blame but myself for the departure of the armenian would he have ever thought of attacking the persians had i not put the idea into his head he had told me in his epistle that he was indebted to me for the idea but for that he might at the present moment have been in london increasing his fortune by his usual methods and i might be commencing under his auspices the translation of the haik esop with the promise no doubt of a considerable remuneration for my trouble or i might be taking a seat opposite the moldavian clerk and imbibing the first rudiments of doing business after the armenian fashion with the comfortable hope of realizing in a short time a fortune of three or four hundred thousand pounds but the armenian was now gone and farewell to the fine hopes i had founded upon him the day before what was i to do i looked wildly around till my eyes rested on the moldavian clerk who was writing away in his ledger with particular vehemence not knowing what to do or say i thought i might as well ask the moldavian clerk when the armenian had departed and when he thought that he would return it is true it mattered little to me when he departed seeing that he was gone and it was evident that he would not be back soon but i knew not what to do and in pure helplessness thought i might as well ask so i went up to the moldavian clerk and asked him when the armenian had departed and whether he had been gone two days or three whereupon the moldavian clerk looking up from his ledger made certain signs which i could by no means understand i stood astonished but presently recovering myself inquired when he considered it probable that the master would return and whether he thought it would be two months ormy tongue falteredtwo years whereupon the moldavian clerk made more signs than before and yet more unintelligible as i persisted however he flung down his pen and putting his thumb into his mouth moved it rapidly causing the nail to sound against the lower jaw whereupon i saw that he was dumb and hurried away for i had always entertained a horror of dumb people having once heard my mother say when i was a child that dumb people were half demoniacs or little betterchapter lii kind of stuporpeace of goddivine handfarewell childthe fairmassive edificebattered tarslost lost good day gentlemen leaving the house of the armenian i strolled about for some time almost mechanically my feet conducted me to london bridge to the booth in which stood the stall of the old applewoman the sound of her voice aroused me as i sat in a kind of stupor on the stone bench beside her she was inquiring what was the matter with me at first i believe i answered her very incoherently for i observed alarm beginning to depict itself upon her countenance rousing myself however i in my turn put a few questions to her upon her present condition and prospects the old womans countenance cleared up instantly she informed me that she had never been more comfortable in her life that her trade her honest tradelaying an emphasis on the word honesthad increased of late wonderfully that her health was better and above all that she felt no fear and horror here laying her hand on her breast on my asking her whether she still heard voices in the night she told me that she frequently did but that the present were mild voices sweet voices encouraging voices very different from the former ones that a voice only the night previous had cried out about the peace of god in particularly sweet accents a sentence which she remembered to have read in her early youth in the primer but which she had clean forgotten till the voice the night before had brought it to her recollection after a pause the old woman said to me i believe dear that it is the blessed book you brought me which has wrought this goodly change how glad i am now that i can read but oh what a difference between the book you brought to me and the one you took away i believe the one you brought is written by the finger of god and the other by dont abuse the book said i it is an excellent book for those who can understand it it was not exactly suited to you and perhaps it had been better had you never read itand yet who knows peradventure if you had not read that book you would not have been fitted for the perusal of the one which you say is written by the finger of god and pressing my hand to my head i fell into a deep fit of musing what after all thought i if there should be more order and system in the working of the moral world than i have thought does there not seem in the present instance to be something like the working of a divine hand i could not conceive why this woman better educated than her mother should have been as she certainly was a worse character than her mother yet perhaps this woman may be better and happier than her mother ever was perhaps she is so alreadyperhaps this world is not a wild lying dream as i have occasionally supposed it to be but the thought of my own situation did not permit me to abandon myself much longer to these musings i started up where are you going child said the woman anxiously i scarcely know said i anywhere then stay here child said she i have much to say to you no said i i shall be better moving about and i was moving away when it suddenly occurred to me that i might never see this woman again and turning round offered her my hand and bade her goodbye farewell child said the old woman and god bless you i then moved along the bridge until i reached the southwark side and still holding on my course my mind again became quickly abstracted from all surrounding objects at length i found myself in a street or road with terraces on either side and seemingly of interminable length leading as it would appear to the southeast i was walking at a great ratethere were likewise a great number of people also walking at a great rate also carts and carriages driving at a great rate and all men carts and carriages going in the selfsame direction namely to the southeast i stopped for a moment and deliberated whether or not i should proceed what business had i in that direction i could not say that i had any particular business in that direction but what could i do were i to turn back only walk about wellknown streets and if i must walk why not continue in the direction in which i was to see whither the road and its terraces led i was here in a terra incognita and an unknown place had always some interest for me moreover i had a desire to know whither all this crowd was going and for what purpose i thought they could not be going far as crowds seldom go far especially at such a rate so i walked on more lustily than before passing group after group of the crowd and almost vieing in speed with some of the carriages especially the hackneycoaches and by dint of walking at this rate the terraces and houses becoming somewhat less frequent as i advanced i reached in about three quarters of an hour a kind of low dingy town in the neighbourhood of the river the streets were swarming with people and i concluded from the number of wildbeast shows caravans gingerbread stalls and the like that a fair was being held now as i had always been partial to fairs i felt glad that i had fallen in with the crowd which had conducted me to the present one and casting away as much as i was able all gloomy thoughts i did my best to enter into the diversions of the fair staring at the wonderful representations of animals on canvas hung up before the shows of wild beasts which bythebye are frequently found much more worthy of admiration than the real beasts themselves listening to the jokes of the merryandrews from the platforms in front of the temporary theatres or admiring the splendid tinsel dresses of the performers who thronged the stages in the intervals of the entertainments and in this manner occasionally gazing and occasionally listening i passed through the town till i came in front of a large edifice looking full upon the majestic bosom of the thamesit was a massive stone edifice built in an antique style and black with age with a broad esplanade between it and the river on which mixed with a few people from the fair i observed moving about a great many individuals in quaint dresses of blue with strange threecornered hats on their heads most of them were mutilated this had a wooden legthis wanted an arm some had but one eye and as i gazed upon the edifice and the singularlooking individuals who moved before it i guessed where i was i am at said i these individuals are battered tars of old england and this edifice once the favourite abode of glorious elizabeth is the refuge which a grateful country has allotted to them here they can rest their weary bodies at their ease talk over the actions in which they have been injured and with the tear of enthusiasm flowing from their eyes boast how they have trod the deck of fame with rodney or nelson or others whose names stand emblazoned in the naval annals of their country turning to the right i entered a park or wood consisting of enormous trees occupying the foot sides and top of a hill which rose behind the town there were multitudes of people among the trees diverting themselves in various ways coming to the top of the hill i was presently stopped by a lofty wall along which i walked till coming to a small gate i passed through and found myself on an extensive green plain on one side bounded in part by the wall of the park and on the others in the distance by extensive ranges of houses to the southeast was a lofty eminence partially clothed with wood the plain exhibited an animated scene a kind of continuation of the fair below there were multitudes of people upon it many tents and shows there was also horseracing and much noise and shouting the sun shining brightly overhead after gazing at the horseracing for a little time feeling myself somewhat tired i went up to one of the tents and laid myself down on the grass there was much noise in the tent who will stand me said a voice with a slight tendency to lisp will you my lord yes said another voice then there was a sound as of a piece of money banging on a table lost lost lost cried several voices and then the banging down of the money and the lost lost lost were frequently repeated at last the second voice exclaimed i will try no more you have cheated me never cheated any one in my life my lordall fairall chance them that finds winsthem that cant finds loses any one else try wholl try will you my lord and then it appeared that some other lord tried for i heard more money flung down then again the cry of lost lostthen again the sound of money and so on once or twice but not more i heard won won but the predominant cry was lost lost at last there was a considerable hubbub and the words cheat rogue and you filched away the pea were used freely by more voices than one to which the voice with the tendency to lisp replied never filched a pea in my life would scorn it always glad when folks wins but as those here dont appear to be civil nor to wish to play any more i shall take myself off with my table so good day gentlemenchapter liii singular tableno moneyout of employmy bonnetwe of the thimblegood wageswisely resolved strangest way in the worldfat gentlemannot such anotherfirst editionnot very easywont closeavella gorgioalarmed look presently a man emerged from the tent bearing before him a rather singular table it appeared to be of white deal was exceedingly small at the top and with very long legs at a few yards from the entrance he paused and looked round as if to decide on the direction which he should take presently his eye glancing on me as i lay upon the ground he started and appeared for a moment inclined to make off as quick as possible table and all in a moment however he seemed to recover assurance and coming up to the place where i was the long legs of the table projecting before him he cried glad to see you here my lord thank you said i its a fine day very fine my lord will your lordship play them that finds winsthem that dont finds loses play at what said i only at the thimble and pea my lord i never heard of such a game didnt you well ill soon teach you said he placing the table down all you have to do is to put a sovereign down on my table and to find the pea which i put under one of my thimbles if you can find itand it is easy enough to find iti give you a sovereign besides your own for them that finds wins and them that dont find loses said i no i dont wish to play why not my lord why in the first place i have no money oh you have no money that of course alters the case if you have no money you cant play well i suppose i must be seeing after my customers said he glancing over the plain good day said i good day said the man slowly but without moving and as if in reflection after a moment or two looking at me inquiringly he added out of employ yes said i out of employ the man measured me with his eye as i lay on the ground at length he said may i speak a word or two to you my lord as many as you please said i then just come a little out of hearing a little farther on the grass if you please my lord why do you call me my lord said i as i arose and followed him we of the thimble always calls our customers lords said the man but i wont call you such a foolish name any more come along the man walked along the plain till he came to the side of a dry pit when looking round to see that no one was nigh he laid his table on the grass and sitting down with his legs over the side of the pit he motioned me to do the same so you are in want of employ said he after i had sat down beside him yes said i i am very much in want of employ i think i can find you some what kind said iwhy said the man i think you would do to be my bonnet bonnet said i what is that dont you know however no wonder as you had never heard of the thimbleandpea game but i will tell you we of the game are very much exposed folks when they have lost their money as those who play with us mostly do sometimes uses rough language calls us cheats and sometimes knocks our hats over our eyes and whats more with a kick under our table causes the top deals to fly off this is the third table i have used this day the other two being broken by uncivil customers so we of the game generally like to have gentlemen go about with us to take our part and encourage us though pretending to know nothing about us for example when the customer says im cheated the bonnet must say no you ant it is all right or when my hat is knocked over my eyes the bonnet must square and say i never saw the man before in all my life but i wont see him illused and so when they kicks at the table the bonnet must say i wont see the table illused such a nice table too besides i want to play myself and then i would say to the bonnet thank you my lord them that finds wins and then the bonnet plays and i lets the bonnet win in a word said i the bonnet means the man who covers you even as the real bonnet covers the head just so said the man i see you are awake and would soon make a firstrate bonnet bonnet said i musingly bonnet it is metaphorical is it said the man yes said i like the cant words bonnet is cant said the man we of the thimble as well as all clyfakers and the like understand cant as of course must every bonnet so if you are employed by me you had better learn it as soon as you can that we may discourse together without being understood by every one besides covering his principal a bonnet must have his eyes about him for the trade of the pea though a strictly honest one is not altogether lawful so it is the duty of the bonnet if he sees the constable coming to say the gorgios welling that is not cant said i that is the language of the rommany chals do you know those people said the man perfectly said i and their language too i wish i did said the man i would give ten pounds and more to know the language of the rommany chals theres some of it in the language of the pea and thimble how it came there i dont know but so it is i wish i knew it but it is difficult youll make a capital bonnet shall we close what would the wages be i demanded why to a firstrate bonnet as i think you would prove i could afford to give from forty to fifty shillings a week is it possible said i good wages ant they said the man first rate said i bonneting is more profitable than reviewing anan said the man or translating i dont think the armenian would have paid me at that rate for translating his esop who is he said the man esop no i know what that is esops cant for a hunchback but tother you should know said i never saw the man in all my life yes you have said i and felt him too dont you remember the individual from whom you took the pocketbookoh that was he well the less said about that matter the better i have left off that trade and taken to this which is a much better between ourselves i am not sorry that i did not carry off that pocketbook if i had it might have encouraged me in the trade in which had i remained i might have been lagged sent abroad as i had been already imprisoned so i determined to leave it off at all hazards though i was hard up not having a penny in the world and wisely resolved said i it was a bad and dangerous trade i wonder you should ever have embraced it it is all very well talking said the man but there is a reason for everything i am the son of a jewess by a military officerand then the man told me his story i shall not repeat the mans story it was a poor one a vile one at last he observed so that affair which you know of determined me to leave the filching trade and take up with a more honest and safe one so at last i thought of the pea and thimble but i wanted funds especially to pay for lessons at the hands of a master for i knew little about it well said i how did you get over that difficulty why said the man i thought i should never have got over it what funds could i raise i had nothing to sell the few clothes i had i wanted for we of the thimble must always appear decent or nobody would come near us i was at my wits ends at last i got over my difficulty in the strangest way in the world what was that by an old thing which i had picked up some time beforea book a book said i yes which i had taken out of your lordships pocket one day as you were walking the streets in a great hurry i thought it was a pocketbook at first full of bank notes perhaps continued he laughing it was well for me however that it was not for i should have soon spent the notes as it was i had flung the old thing down with an oath as soon as i brought it home when i was so hard up however after the affair with that friend of yours i took it up one day and thought i might make something by it to support myself a day with chance or something else led me into a grand shop there was a man there who seemed to be the master talking to a jolly portly old gentleman who seemed to be a country squire well i went up to the first and offered it for sale he took the book opened it at the titlepage and then all of a sudden his eyes glistened and he showed it to the fat jolly gentleman and his eyes glistened too and i heard him say how singular and then the two talked together in a speech i didnt understandi rather thought it was french at any rate it wasnt cant and presently the first asked me what i would take for the book now i am not altogether a fool nor am i blind and i had narrowly marked all that passed and it came into my head that now was the time for making a man of myself at any rate i could lose nothing by a little confidence so i looked the man boldly in the face and said i will have five guineas for that book there ant such another in the whole world nonsense said the first man there are plenty of them there have been nearly fifty editions to my knowledge i will give you five shillings no said i ill not take it for i dont like to be cheated so give me my book again and i attempted to take it away from the fat gentlemans hand stop said the younger man are you sure that you wont take less not a farthing said i which was not altogether true but i said so well said the fat gentleman i will give you what you ask and sure enough he presently gave me the money so i made a bow and was leaving the shop when it came into my head that there was something odd in all this and as i had got the money in my pocket i turned back and making another bow said may i be so bold as to ask why you gave me all this money for that ere dirty book when i came into the shop i should have been glad to get a shilling for it but i saw you wanted it and asked five guineas then they looked at one another and smiled and shrugged up their shoulders then the first man looking at me said friend you have been a little too sharp for us however we can afford to forgive you as my friend here has long been in quest of this particular book there are plenty of editions as i told you and a common copy is not worth five shillings but this is a first edition and a copy of the first edition is worth its weight in gold so after all they outwitted you i observed clearly said the man i might have got double the price had i known the value but i dont care much good may it do them it has done me plenty by means of it i have got into an honest respectable trade in which theres little danger and plenty of profit and got out of one which would have got me lagged sooner or later but said i you ought to remember that the thing was not yours you took it from me who had been requested by a poor old applewoman to exchange it for a bible well said the man did she ever get her bible yes said i she got her biblethen she has no cause to complain and as for you chance or something else has sent you to me that i may make you reasonable amends for any loss you may have had here am i ready to make you my bonnet with forty or fifty shillings a week which you say yourself are capital wages i find no fault with the wages said i but i dont like the employ not like bonneting said the man ah i see you would like to be principal well a time may comethose long white fingers of yours would just serve for the business is it a difficult one i demanded why it is not very easy two things are needfulnatural talent and constant practice but ill show you a point or two connected with the game and placing his table between his knees as he sat over the side of the pit he produced three thimbles and a small brown pellet something resembling a pea he moved the thimble and pellet about now placing it to all appearance under one and now under another under which is it now he said at last under that said i pointing to the lowermost of the thimbles which as they stood formed a kind of triangle no said he it is not but lift it up and when i lifted up the thimble the pellet in truth was not under it it was under none of them said he it was pressed by my little finger against my palm and then he showed me how he did the trick and asked me if the game was not a funny one and on my answering in the affirmative he said i am glad you like it come along and let us win some money thereupon getting up he placed the table before him and was moving away observing however that i did not stir he asked me what i was staying for merely for my own pleasure said i i like sitting here very well then you wont close said the man by no means i replied your proposal does not suit me you may be principal in time said the man that makes no difference said i and sitting with my legs over the pit i forthwith began to decline an armenian noun that ant cant said the man no nor gypsy either well if you wont close another will i cant lose any more time and forthwith he departed and after i had declined four armenian nouns of different declensions i rose from the side of the pit and wandered about amongst the various groups of people scattered over the green presently i came to where the man of the thimbles was standing with the table before him and many people about him them who finds wins and them who cant find loses he cried various individuals tried to find the pellet but all were unsuccessful till at last considerable dissatisfaction was expressed and the terms rogue and cheat were lavished upon him never cheated anybody in all my life he cried and observing me at hand didnt i play fair my lord he inquired but i made no answer presently some more played and he permitted one or two to win and the eagerness to play with him became greater after i had looked on for some time i was moving away just then i perceived a short thick personage with a staff in his hand advancing in a great hurry whereupon with a sudden impulse i exclaimed shoon thimble engro avella gorgio the man who was in the midst of his peaandthimble process no sooner heard the last word of the distich than he turned an alarmed look in the direction of where i stood then glancing around and perceiving the constable he slipped forthwith his pellet and thimbles into his pocket and lifting up his table he cried to the people about him make way and with a motion with his head to me as if to follow him he darted off with a swiftness which the short pursy constable could by no means rival and whither he went or what became of him i know not inasmuch as i turned away in another directionchapter liv mr petulengrorommany ryelil writersones own hornlawfullyearnt moneythe wooded hilla great favouritethe shop windowmuch wanted and as i wandered along the green i drew near to a place where several men with a cask beside them sat carousing in the neighbourhood of a small tent here he comes said one of them as i advanced and standing up he raised his voice and sang here the gypsy gemman see with his roman jib and his rome and dree rome and dree rum and dry rally round the rommany rye it was mr petulengro who was here diverting himself with several of his comrades they all received me with considerable frankness sit down brother said mr petulengro and take a cup of good ale i sat down your health gentlemen said i as i took the cup which mr petulengro handed to me aukko tu pios adrey rommanis here is your health in rommany brother said mr petulengro who having refilled the cup now emptied it at a draught your health in rommany brother said tawno chikno to whom the cup came next the rommany rye said a third the gypsy gentleman exclaimed a fourth drinking and then they all sang in chorus here the gypsy gemman see with his roman jib and his rome and dree rome and dree rum and dry rally round the rommany rye and now brother said mr petulengro seeing that you have drunk and been drunken you will perhaps tell us where you have been and what about i have been in the big city said i writing lils how much money have you got in your pocket brother said mr petulengro eighteen pence said i all i have in the world i have been in the big city too said mr petulengro but i have not written lilsi have fought in the ringi have fifty pounds in my pocketi have much more in the world brother there is considerable difference between us i would rather be the lilwriter after all said the tall handsome black man indeed i would wish for nothing better why so said mr petulengro because they have so much to say for themselves said the black man even when dead and gone when they are laid in the churchyard it is their own fault if people ant talking of them who will know after i am dead or bitchadey pawdel that i was once the beauty of the world or that you jasper were the best man in england of my inches thats true tawnohowever heres our brother will perhaps let the world know something about us not he said the other with a sigh hell have quite enough to do in writing his own lils and telling the world how handsome and clever he was and who can blame him not i if i could write lils every word should be about myself and my own tacho rommanismy own lawful wedded wife which is the same thing i tell you what brother i once heard a wise man say in brummagem that there is nothing like blowing ones own horn which i conceive to be much the same thing as writing ones own lil after a little more conversation mr petulengro arose and motioned me to follow him only eighteen pence in the worldbrother said he as we walked together nothing more i assure you how came you to ask me how much money i had because there was something in your look brother something very much resembling that which a person showeth who does not carry much money in his pocket i was looking at my own face this morning in my wifes lookingglassi did not look as you do brother i believe your sole motive for inquiring said i was to have an opportunity of venting a foolish boast and to let me know that you were in possession of fifty pounds what is the use of having money unless you let people know you have it said mr petulengro it is not everyone can read faces brother and unless you knew i had money how could you ask me to lend you any i am not going to ask you to lend me any then you may have it without asking as i said before i have fifty pounds all lawfullyearnt money got by fighting in the ringi will lend you that brother you are very kind said i but i will not take it then the half of it nor the half of it but it is getting towards evening i must go back to the great city and what will you do in the boro foros i know not said i earn money if i can and if you cant starve you look ill brother said mr petulengro i do not feel well the great city does not agree with me should i be so fortunate as to earn some money i would leave the big city and take to the woods and fields you may do that brother said mr petulengro whether you have money or not our tents and horses are on the other side of yonder wooded hill come and stay with us we shall all be glad of your company but more especially myself and my wife pakomovna what hill is that i demanded and then mr petulengro told me the name of the hill we stay on tother side of the hill a fortnight he continued and as you are fond of lil writing you may employ yourself profitably whilst there you can write the lil of him whose dook gallops down that hill every night even as the living man was wont to do long ago who was he i demanded jemmy abershaw said mr petulengro one of those whom we call boro drom engroes and the gorgios highwaymen i once heard a rye say that the life of that man would fetch much money so come to the other side of the hill and write the lil in the tent of jasper and his wife pakomovna at first i felt inclined to accept the invitation of mr petulengro a little consideration however determined me to decline it i had always been on excellent terms with mr petulengro but i reflected that people might be excellent friends when they met occasionally in the street or on the heath or in the wood but that these very people when living together in a house to say nothing of a tent might quarrel i reflected moreover that mr petulengro had a wife i had always it is true been a great favourite with mrs petulengro who had frequently been loud in her commendation of the young rye as she called me and his turn of conversation but this was at a time when i stood in need of nothing lived under my parents roof and only visited at the tents to divert and to be diverted the times were altered and i was by no means certain that mrs petulengro when she should discover that i was in need both of shelter and subsistence might not alter her opinionboth with respect to the individual and what he saidstigmatizing my conversation as saucy discourse and myself as a scurvy companion and that she might bring over her husband to her own way of thinking provided indeed he should need any conducting i therefore though without declaring my reasons declined the offer of mr petulengro and presently after shaking him by the hand bent again my course towards the great city i crossed the river at a bridge considerably above that hight of london for not being acquainted with the way i missed the turning which should have brought me to the latter suddenly i found myself in a street of which i had some recollection and mechanically stopped before the window of a shop at which various publications were exposed it was that of the bookseller to whom i had last applied in the hope of selling my ballads or ab gwilym and who had given me hopes that in the event of my writing a decent novel or a tale he would prove a purchaser as i stood listlessly looking at the window and the publications which it contained i observed a paper affixed to the glass by wafers with something written upon it i drew yet nearer for the purpose of inspecting it the writing was in a fair round handa novel or tale is much wanted was what was writtenchapter lv bread and waterfair playfashionable lifecolonel bjoseph sellthe kindly gloweasiest manner imaginable i must do something said i as i sat that night in my lonely apartment with some bread and a pitcher of water before me thereupon taking some of the bread and eating it i considered what i was to do i have no idea what i am to do said i as i stretched my hand towards the pitcher unlessand here i took a considerable draughti write a tale or a novel that bookseller i continued speaking to myself is certainly much in need of a tale or a novel otherwise he would not advertise for one suppose i write one i appear to have no other chance of extricating myself from my present difficulties surely it was fate that conducted me to his window i will do it said i as i struck my hand against the table i will do it suddenly a heavy cloud of despondency came over me could i do it had i the imagination requisite to write a tale or a novel yes yes said i as i struck my hand again against the table i can manage it give me fair play and i can accomplish anything but should i have fair play i must have something to maintain myself with whilst i wrote my tale and i had but eighteen pence in the world would that maintain me whilst i wrote my tale yes i thought it would provided i ate bread which did not cost much and drank water which cost nothing it was poor diet it was true but better men than myself had written on bread and water had not the big man told me so or something to that effect months before it was true there was my lodging to pay for but up to the present time i owed nothing and perhaps by the time the people of the house asked me for money i should have written a tale or a novel which would bring me in money i had paper pens and ink and let me not forget them i had candles in my closet all paid for to light me during my night work enough i would go doggedly to work upon my tale or novel but what was the tale or novel to be about was it to be a tale of fashionable life about sir harry somebody and the countess something but i knew nothing about fashionable people and cared less therefore how should i attempt to describe fashionable life what should the tale consist of the life and adventures of some one goodbut of whom did not mr petulengro mention one jemmy abershaw yes did he not tell me that the life and adventures of jemmy abershaw would bring in much money to the writer yes but i knew nothing of that worthy i heard it is true from mr petulengro that when alive he committed robberies on the hill on the side of which mr petulengro had pitched his tents and that his ghost still haunted the hill at midnight but those were scant materials out of which to write the mans life it is probable indeed that mr petulengro would be able to supply me with further materials if i should apply to him but i was in a hurry and could not afford the time which it would be necessary to spend in passing to and from mr petulengro and consulting him moreover my pride revolted at the idea of being beholden to mr petulengro for the materials of the history no i would not write the history of abershaw whose thenharry simms alas the life of harry simms had been already much better written by himself than i could hope to do it and after all harry simms like jemmy abershaw was merely a robber both though bold and extraordinary men were merely highwaymen i questioned whether i could compose a tale likely to excite any particular interest out of the exploits of a mere robber i want a character for my hero thought i something higher than a mere robber some one likelike colonel b by the way why should i not write the life and adventures of colonel b of londonderry in ireland a truly singular man was this same colonel b of londonderry in ireland a personage of most strange and incredible feats and daring who had been a partizan soldier a bravowho assisted by certain discontented troopers nearly succeeded in stealing the crown and regalia from the tower of london who attempted to hang the duke of ormond at tyburn and whose strange eventful career did not terminate even with his life his dead body on the circulation of an unfounded report that he did not come to his death by fair means having been exhumed by the mob of his native place where he had retired to die and carried in a coffin through the streets of his life i had inserted an account in the newgate lives and trials it was bare and meagre and written in the stiff awkward style of the seventeenth century it had however strongly captivated my imagination and i now thought that out of it something better could be made that if i added to the adventures and purified the style i might fashion out of it a very decent tale or novel on a sudden however the proverb of mending old garments with new cloth occurred to me i am afraid said i any new adventures which i can invent will not fadge well with the old tale one will but spoil the other i had better have nothing to do with colonel b thought i but boldly and independently sit down and write the life of joseph sell this joseph sell dear reader was a fictitious personage who had just come into my head i had never even heard of the name but just at that moment it happened to come into my head i would write an entirely fictitious narrative called the life and adventures of joseph sell the great travelleri had better begin at once thought i and removing the bread and the jug which latter was now empty i seized pen and paper and forthwith essayed to write the life of joseph sell but soon discovered that it was much easier to resolve upon a thing than to achieve it or even to commence it for the life of me i did not know how to begin and after trying in vain to write a line i thought it would be as well to go to bed and defer my projected undertaking till the morrow so i went to bed but not to sleep during the greater part of the night i lay awake musing upon the work which i had determined to execute for a long time my brain was dry and unproductive i could form no plan which appeared feasible at length i felt within my brain a kindly glow it was the commencement of inspiration in a few minutes i had formed my plan i then began to imagine the scenes and the incidents scenes and incidents flitted before my minds eye so plentifully that i knew not how to dispose of them i was in a regular embarrassment at length i got out of the difficulty in the easiest manner imaginable namely by consigning to the depths of oblivion all the feebler and less stimulant scenes and incidents and retaining the better and more impressive ones before morning i had sketched the whole work on the tablets of my mind and then resigned myself to sleep in the pleasing conviction that the most difficult part of my undertaking was achievedchapter lvi considerably soberedpower of writingthe tempterhungry talentwork concluded rather late in the morning i awoke for a few minutes i lay still perfectly still my imagination was considerably sobered the scenes and situations which had pleased me so much over night appeared to me in a far less captivating guise that morning i felt languid and almost hopelessthe thought however of my situation soon roused mei must make an effort to improve the posture of my affairs there was no time to be lost so i sprang out of bed breakfasted on bread and water and then sat down doggedly to write the life of joseph sell it was a great thing to have formed my plan and to have arranged the scenes in my head as i had done on the preceding night the chief thing requisite at present was the mere mechanical act of committing them to paper this i did not find at first so easy as i could wishi wanted mechanical skill but i persevered and before evening i had written ten pages i partook of some bread and water and before i went to bed that night i had completed fifteen pages of my life of joseph sell the next day i resumed my taski found my power of writing considerably increased my pen hurried rapidly over the papermy brain was in a wonderfully teeming state many scenes and visions which i had not thought of before were evolved and as fast as evolved written down they seemed to be more pat to my purpose and more natural to my history than many others which i had imagined before and which i made now give place to these newer creations by about midnight i had added thirty fresh pages to my life and adventures of joseph sell the third day aroseit was dark and dreary out of doors and i passed it drearily enough within my brain appeared to have lost much of its former glow and my pen much of its power i however toiled on but at midnight had only added seven pages to my history of joseph sell on the fourth day the sun shone brightlyi arose and having breakfasted as usual i fell to work my brain was this day wonderfully prolific and my pen never before or since glided so rapidly over the paper towards night i began to feel strangely about the back part of my head and my whole system was extraordinarily affected i likewise occasionally saw doublea tempter now seemed to be at work within me you had better leave off now for a short space said the tempter and go out and drink a pint of beer you have still one shilling leftif you go on at this rate you will go madgo out and spend sixpence you can afford it more than half your work is done i was about to obey the suggestion of the tempter when the idea struck me that if i did not complete the work whilst the fit was on me i should never complete it so i held on i am almost afraid to state how many pages i wrote that day of the life of joseph sell from this time i proceeded in a somewhat more leisurely manner but as i drew nearer and nearer to the completion of my task dreadful fears and despondencies came over me it will be too late thought i by the time i have finished the work the bookseller will have been supplied with a tale or a novel is it probable that in a town like this where talent is so abundanthungry talent tooa bookseller can advertise for a tale or a novel without being supplied with half a dozen in twentyfour hours i may as well fling down my peni am writing to no purpose and these thoughts came over my mind so often that at last in utter despair i flung down the pen whereupon the tempter within me saidand now you have flung down the pen you may as well fling yourself out of the window what remains for you to do why to take it up again thought i to myself for i did not like the latter suggestion at alland then forthwith i resumed the pen and wrote with greater vigour than before from about six oclock in the evening until i could hardly see when i rested for awhile when the tempter within me again said or appeared to sayall you have been writing is stuff it will never doa druga mere drug and methought these last words were uttered in the gruff tones of the big publisher a thing merely to be sneered at a voice like that of taggart added and then i seemed to hear a sternutationas i probably did for recovering from a kind of swoon i found myself shivering with cold the next day i brought my work to a conclusion but the task of revision still remained for an hour or two i shrank from it and remained gazing stupidly at the pile of paper which i had written over i was all but exhausted and i dreaded on inspecting the sheets to find them full of absurdities which i had paid no regard to in the furor of composition but the task however trying to my nerves must be got over at last in a kind of desperation i entered upon it it was far from an easy one there were however fewer errors and absurdities than i had anticipated about twelve oclock at night i had got over the task of revision tomorrow for the bookseller said i as my hand sank on the pillow oh mechapter lvii nervous lookthe booksellers wifethe last staketermsgod forbidwill you come to teaa light heart on arriving at the booksellers shop i cast a nervous look at the window for the purpose of observing whether the paper had been removed or not to my great delight the paper was in its place with a beating heart i entered there was nobody in the shop as i stood at the counter however deliberating whether or not i should call out the door of what seemed to be a backparlour opened and out came a welldressed ladylike female of about thirty with a goodlooking and intelligent countenance what is your business young man said she to me after i had made her a polite bow i wish to speak to the gentleman of the house said i my husband is not within at present she replied what is your business i have merely brought something to show him said i but i will call again if you are the young gentleman who has been here before said the lady with poems and ballads as indeed i know you are she added smiling for i have seen you through the glass door i am afraid it will be useless that is she added with another smile if you bring us nothing else i have not brought you poems and ballads now said i but something widely different i saw your advertisement for a tale or a novel and have written something which i think will suit and here it is i added showing the roll of paper which i held in my hand well said the booksellers wife you may leave it though i cannot promise you much chance of its being accepted my husband has already had several offered to him however you may leave it give it me are you afraid to intrust it to me she demanded somewhat hastily observing that i hesitated excuse me said i but it is all i have to depend upon in the world i am chiefly apprehensive that it will not be read on that point i can reassure you said the good lady smiling and there was now something sweet in her smile i give you my word that it shall be read come again tomorrow morning at eleven when if not approved it shall be returned to you i returned to my lodging and forthwith betook myself to bed notwithstanding the earliness of the hour i felt tolerably tranquil i had now cast my last stake and was prepared to abide by the result whatever that result might be i could have nothing to reproach myself with i had strained all the energies which nature had given me in order to rescue myself from the difficulties which surrounded me i presently sank into a sleep which endured during the remainder of the day and the whole of the succeeding night i awoke about nine on the morrow and spent my last threepence on a breakfast somewhat more luxurious than the immediately preceding ones for one penny of the sum was expended on the purchase of milk at the appointed hour i repaired to the house of the bookseller the bookseller was in his shop ah said he as soon as i entered i am glad to see you there was an unwonted heartiness in the booksellers tones an unwonted benignity in his face so said he after a pause you have taken my advice written a book of adventure nothing like taking the advice young man of your superiors in age well i think your book will do and so does my wife for whose judgment i have a great regard as well i may as she is the daughter of a firstrate novelist deceased i think i shall venture on sending your book to the press but said i we have not yet agreed upon terms terms terms said the bookseller ahem well there is nothing like coming to terms at once i will print the book and allow you half the profit when the edition is sold that will not do said i i intend shortly to leave london i must have something at once ah i see said the bookseller in distress frequently the case with authors especially young ones well i dont care if i purchase it of you but you must be moderate the public are very fastidious and the speculation may prove a losing one after all let me see will fivehemhe stopped i looked the bookseller in the face there was something peculiar in it suddenly it appeared to me as if the voice of him of the thimble sounded in my ear now is your time ask enough never such another chance of establishing yourself respectable trade pea and thimble well said i at last i have no objection to take the offer which you were about to make though i really think fiveandtwenty guineas to be scarcely enough everything considered fiveandtwenty guineas said the bookseller are youwhat was i going to sayi never meant to offer half as muchi mean a quarter i was going to say five guineasi mean pounds i will however make it up guineas that will not do said i but as i find we shall not deal return me my manuscript that i may carry it to some one else the bookseller looked blank dear me said he i should never have supposed that you would have made any objection to such an offer i am quite sure that you would have been glad to take five pounds for either of the two huge manuscripts of songs and ballads that you brought me on a former occasion well said i if you will engage to publish either of those two manuscripts you shall have the present one for five pounds god forbid that i should make any such bargain said the bookseller i would publish neither on any account but with respect to this last book i have really an inclination to print it both for your sake and mine suppose we say ten pounds no said i ten pounds will not do pray restore me my manuscript stay said the bookseller my wife is in the next room i will go and consult her thereupon he went into his back room where i heard him conversing with his wife in a low tone in about ten minutes he returned young gentleman said he perhaps you will take tea with us this evening when we will talk further over the matter that evening i went and took tea with the bookseller and his wife both of whom particularly the latter overwhelmed me with civility it was not long before i learned that the work had been already sent to the press and was intended to stand at the head of a series of entertaining narratives from which my friends promised themselves considerable profit the subject of terms was again brought forward i stood firm to my first demand for a long time when however thebooksellers wife complimented me on my production in the highest terms and said that she discovered therein the germs of genius which she made no doubt would some day prove ornamental to my native land i consented to drop my demand to twenty pounds stipulating however that i should not be troubled with the correction of the work before i departed i received the twenty pounds and departed with a light heart to my lodgings reader amidst the difficulties and dangers of this life should you ever be tempted to despair call to mind these latter chapters of the life of lavengro there are few positions however difficult from which dogged resolution and perseverance may not liberate you chapter lviii indispositiona resolutionpoor equivalentsthe piece of goldflashing eyeshow beautifulbon jour monsieur i had long ago determined to leave london as soon as the means should be in my power and now that they were i determined to leave the great city yet i felt some reluctance to go i would fain have pursued the career of original authorship which had just opened itself to me and have written other tales of adventure the bookseller had given me encouragement enough to do so he had assured me that he should be always happy to deal with me for an article that was the word similar to the one i had brought him provided my terms were moderate and the booksellers wife by her complimentary language had given me yet more encouragement but for some months past i had been far from well and my original indisposition brought on partly by the peculiar atmosphere of the big city partly by anxiety of mind had been much increased by the exertions which i had been compelled to make during the last few days i felt that were i to remain where i was i should die or become a confirmed valetudinarian i would go forth into the country travelling on foot and by exercise and inhaling pure air endeavour to recover my health leaving my subsequent movements to be determined by providence but whither should i bend my course once or twice i thought of walking home to the old town stay some time with my mother and my brother and enjoy the pleasant walks in the neighbourhood but though i wished very much to see my mother and my brother and felt much disposed to enjoy the said pleasant walks the old town was not exactly the place to which i wished to go at this present juncture i was afraid the people would ask where are your northern ballads where are your alliterative translations from ab gwilymof which you were always talking and with which you promised to astonish the world now in the event of such interrogations what could i answer it is true i had compiled newgate lives and trials and had written the life of joseph sell but i was afraid that the people of the old town would scarcely consider these as equivalents for the northern ballads and the songs of ab gwilym i would go forth and wander in any direction but that of the old town but how ones sensibility on any particular point diminishes with time at present i enter the old town perfectly indifferent as to what the people may be thinking on the subject of the songs and ballads with respect to the people themselves whether like my sensibility their curiosity has altogether evaporated or whether which is at least equally probable they never entertained any one thing is certain that never in a single instance have they troubled me with any remarks on the subject of the songs and ballads as it was my intention to travel on foot with a bundle and a stick i despatched my trunk containing some few clothes and books to the old town my preparations were soon made in about three days i was in readiness to start before departing however i bethought me of my old friend the applewoman of london bridge apprehensive that she might be labouring under the difficulties of poverty i sent her a piece of gold by the hands of a young maiden in the house in which i lived the latter punctually executed her commission but brought me back the piece of gold the old woman would not take it she did not want it she said tell the poor thin lad she added to keep it for himself he wants it more than i rather late one afternoon i departed from my lodging with my stick in one hand and a small bundle in the other shaping my course to the southwest when i first arrived somewhat more than a year before i had entered the city by the northeast as i was not going home i determined to take my departure in the direction the very opposite to home just as i was about to cross the street called the haymarket at the lower part a cabriolet drawn by a magnificent animal came dashing along at a furious rate it stopped close by the curbstone where i was a sudden pull of the reins nearly bringing the spirited animal upon its haunches the jehu who had accomplished this feat was francis ardry a small beautiful female with flashing eyes dressed in the extremity of fashion sat beside him holloa friend said francis ardry whither bound i do not know said i all i can say is that i am about to leave london and the means said francis ardry i have them said i with a cheerful smile qui est celuici demanded the small female impatiently cestmon ami le plus intime so you were about to leave london without telling me a word said francis ardry somewhat angrilyi intended to have written to you said i what a splendid mare that is is she not said francis ardry who was holding in the mare with difficulty she cost a hundred guineas questce quil dit demanded his companion il dit que le jument est bien beau allons mon ami il est tard said the beauty with a scornful toss of her head allons encore un moment said francis ardry and when shall i see you again i scarcely know i replied i never saw a more splendid turn out questce quil dit said the lady again il dit que tout léquipage est en assez bon goût allons cest un ours said the lady le cheval même en a peur added she as the mare reared up on high can you find nothing else to admire but the mare and the equipage said francis ardry reproachfully after he had with some difficulty brought the mare to order lifting my hand in which i held my stick i took off my hat how beautiful said i looking the lady full in the face comment said the lady inquiringly il dit que vous êtes belle comme un ange said francis ardry emphatically mais à la bonne heure arrêtez mon ami said the lady to francis ardry who was about to drive off je voudrais bien causer un moment avec lui arrêtez il est délicieuxestce bien ainsi que vous traitez vos amis said she passionately as francis ardry lifted up his whip bon jour monsieur bon jour said she thrusting her head from the side and looking back as francis ardry drove off at the rate of thirteen miles an hourchapter lix the milestonethe meditationwant to get upthe offhand leadersixteen shillingsthe nearhand wheeler all right in about two hours i had cleared the great city and got beyond the suburban villages or rather towns in the direction in which i was travelling i was in a broad and excellent road leading i knew not whither i now slackened my pace which had hitherto been great presently coming to a milestone on which was graven nine miles i rested against it and looking round towards the vast city which had long ceased to be visible i fell into a train of meditation i thought of all my ways and doings since the day of my first arrival in that vast cityi had worked and toiled and though i had accomplished nothing at all commensurate with the hopes which i had entertained previous to my arrival i had achieved my own living preserved my independence and become indebted to no one i was now quitting it poor in purse it is true but not wholly empty rather ailing it may be but not broken in health and with hope within my bosom had i not cause upon the whole to be thankful perhaps there were some who arriving at the same time under not more favourable circumstances had accomplished much more and whose future was far more hopefulgood but there might be others who in spite of all their efforts had been either trodden down in the press never more to be heard of or were quitting that mighty town broken in purse broken in health and oh with not one dear hope to cheer them had i not upon the whole abundant cause to be grateful truly yes my meditation over i left the milestone and proceeded on my way in the same direction as before until the night began to close in i had always been a good pedestrian but now whether owing to indisposition or to not having for some time past been much in the habit of taking such lengthy walks i began to feel not a little weary just as i was thinking of putting up for the night at the next inn or publichouse i should arrive at i heard what sounded like a coach coming up rapidly behind me induced perhaps by the weariness which i felt i stopped and looked wistfully in the direction of the sound presently up came a coach seemingly a mail drawn by four bounding horsesthere was no one upon it but the coachman and the guard when nearly parallel with me it stopped want to get up sounded a voice in the true coachmanlike tonehalf querulous half authoritative i hesitated i was tired it is true but i had left london bound on a pedestrian excursion and i did not much like the idea of having recourse to a coach after accomplishing so very inconsiderable a distance come we cant be staying here all night said the voice more sharply than before i can ride a little way and get down whenever i like thought i and springing forward i clambered up the coach and was going to sit down upon the box next the coachman no no said the coachman who was a man about thirty with a hooked nose and red face dressed in a fashionably cut great coat with a fashionable black castor on his head no no keep behindthe box ant for the like of you said he as he drove off the box is for lords or gentlemen at least i made no answer d that offhand leader said the coachman as the righthand front horse made a desperate start at something he saw in the road and half rising he with great dexterity hit with his long whip the offhand leader a cut on the off cheek these seem to be fine horses said i the coachman made no answer nearly thoroughbred i continued the coachman drew his breath with a kind of hissing sound through his teeth come young fellow none of your chaff dont you think because you ride on my mail im going to talk to you about orses i talk to nobody about orses except lords well said i i have been called a lord in my time it must have been by a thimblerigger then said the coachman bending back and half turning his face round with a broad leer you have hit the mark wonderfully said i you coachmen whatever else you may be are certainly no fools we ant ant we said the coachman there you are right and to show you that you are ill now trouble you for your fare if you have been amongst the thimbleriggers you must be tolerably well cleared out where are you goingto i think i have seen you there the fare is sixteen shillings come tip us the blunt them that has no money cant ride on my mail sixteen shillings was a large sum and to pay it would make a considerable inroad on my slender finances i thought at first that i would say i did not want to go so far but then the fellow would ask at once where i wanted to go and i was ashamed to acknowledge my utter ignorance of the road i determined therefore to pay the fare with a tacit determination not to mount a coach in future without knowing whither i was going so i paid the man the money who turning round shouted to the guardall right jem got fare to and forthwith whipped on his horses especially the offhand leader for whom he seemed to entertain a particular spite to greater speed than beforethe horses flew a young moon gave a feeble light partially illuminating a line of road which appearing by no means interesting i the less regretted having paid my money for the privilege of being hurried along it in the flying vehicle we frequently changed horses and at last my friend the coachman was replaced by another the very image of himselfhawk nose red face with narrowrimmed hat and fashionable benjamin after he had driven about fifty yards the new coachman fell to whipping one of the horses d this nearhand wheeler said he the brute has got a corn whipping him wont cure him of his corn said i who told you to speak said the driver with an oath mind your own business tisnt from the like of you i am to learn to drive orses presently i fell into a broken kind of slumber in an hour or two i was aroused by a rough voicegot to young man get down if you please i opened my eyesthere was a dim and indistinct light like that which precedes dawn the coach was standing still in something like a street just below me stood the guarddo you mean to get down said he or will you keep us here till morning other fares want to get up scarcely knowing what i did i took my bundle and stick and descended whilst two people mounted all right john said the guard to the coachman springing up behind whereupon off whisked the coach one or two individuals who were standing by disappeared and i was left alonechapter lx the still houra thrillthe wondrous circlethe shepherdheaps and barrowswhat do you meanmilk of the plainshengist spared itno presents after standing still a minute or two considering what i should do i moved down what appeared to be the street of a small straggling town presently i passed by a church which rose indistinctly on my right hand anon there was the rustling of foliage and the rushing of waters i reached a bridge beneath which a small stream was running in the direction of the south i stopped and leaned over the parapet for i have always loved to look upon streams especially at the still hours what stream is this i wonder said i as i looked down from the parapet into the water which whirled and gurgled below leaving the bridge i ascended a gentle acclivity and presently reached what appeared to be a tract of moory undulating ground it was now tolerably light but there was a mist or haze abroad which prevented my seeing objects with much precision i felt chill in the damp air of the early morn and walked rapidly forward in about half an hour i arrived where the road divided into two at an angle or tongue of dark green sward to the right or the left said i and forthwith took without knowing why the lefthand road along which i proceeded about a hundred yards when in the midst of the tongue of sward formed by the two roads collaterally with myself i perceived what i at first conceived to be a small grove of blighted trunks of oaks barked and grey i stood still for a moment and then turning off the road advanced slowly towards it over the sward as i drew nearer i perceived that the objects which had attracted my curiosity and which formed a kind of circle were not trees but immense upright stones a thrill pervaded my system just before me were two the mightiest of the whole tall as the stems of proud oaks supporting on their tops a huge transverse stone and forming a wonderful doorway i knew now where i was and laying down my stick and bundle and taking off my hat i advanced slowly and cast myselfit was folly perhaps but i could not help what i didcast myself with my face on the dewy earth in the middle of the portal of giants beneath the transverse stone the spirit of stonehenge was strong upon me and after i had remained with my face on the ground for some time i arose placed my hat on my head and taking up my stick and bundle wandered around the wondrous circle examining each individual stone from the greatest to the least and then entering by the great door seated myself upon an immense broad stone one side of which was supported by several small ones and the other slanted upon the earth and there in deep meditation i sat for an hour or two till the sun shone in my face above the tall stones of the eastern side and as i still sat there i heard the noise of bells and presently a large number of sheep came browzing past the circle of stones two or three entered and grazed upon what they could find and soon a man also entered the circle at the northern side early here sir said the man who was tall and dressed in a dark green slop and had all the appearance of a shepherd a traveller i suppose yes said i i am a traveller are these sheep yours they are sir that is they are my masters a strange place this sir said he looking at the stones ever here before never in body frequently in mind heard of the stones i suppose no wonderall the people of the plain talk of them what do the people of the plain say of them why they sayhow did they ever come here do they not suppose them to have been brought who should have brought them i have read that they were brought by many thousand men where from ireland how did they bring themi dont know and what did they bring them for to form a temple perhaps what is that a place to worship god in a strange place to worship god in why it has no roof yes it has where said the man looking up what do you see above you the sky well well have you anything to say how did those stones come here are there other stones like these on the plains said i none and yet there are plenty of strange things on these downs what are they strange heaps and barrows and great walls of earth built on the top of hills do the people of the plain wonder how they came there they do not why they were raised by hands and these stones how did they ever come here i wonder whether they are here said i these stones yes so sure as the world said the man and as the world they will stand as long i wonder whether there is a world what do you mean an earth and sea moon and stars sheep and men do you doubt itsometimes i never heard it doubted before it is impossible there should be a world it aint possible there shouldnt be a world just so at this moment a fine ewe attended by a lamb rushed into the circle and fondled the knees of the shepherd i suppose you would not care to have some milk said the man why do you suppose so because so be there be no sheep no milk you know and what there bent is not worth having you could not have argued better said i that is supposing you have argued with respect to the milk you may do as you please be still nanny said the man and producing a tin vessel from his scrip he milked the ewe into it here is milk of the plains master said the man as he handed the vessel to me where are those barrows and great walls of earth you were speaking of said i after i had drunk some of the milk are there any near where we are not within many miles the nearest is yonder away said the shepherd pointing to the southeast its a grand place that but not like this quite different and from it you have a sight of the finest spire in the world i must go to it said i and i drank the remainder of the milk yonder you say yes yonder but you cannot get to it in that direction the river lies between what river the avon avon is british said i yes said the man we are all british here no we are not said i what are we then english ant they one no who were the british the men who are supposed to have worshipped god in this place and who raised these stones where are they now our forefathers slaughtered them spilled their blood all about especially in this neighbourhood destroyed their pleasant places and left not to use their own words one stone upon another yes they did said the shepherd looking aloft at the transverse stone and it is well for them they did whenever that stone which english hands never raised is by english hands thrown down woe woe woe to the english race spare it english hengist spared ithere is sixpence i wont have it said the man why notyou talk so prettily about these stones you seem to know all about them i never receive presents with respect to the stones i say with yourself how did they ever come here how did they ever come here said the shepherdchapter lxi the riverarid downsa prospect leaving the shepherd i bent my way in the direction pointed out by him as that in which the most remarkable of the strange remains of which he had spoken lay i proceeded rapidly making my way over the downs covered with coarse grass and fern with respect to the river of which he had spoken i reflected that either by wading or swimming i could easily transfer myself and what i bore to the opposite side on arriving at its banks i found it a beautiful stream but shallow with here and there a deep place where the water ran dark and still always fond of the pure lymph i undressed and plunged into one of these gulfs from which i emerged my whole frame in a glow and tingling with delicious sensations after conveying my clothes and scanty baggage to the farther side i dressed and then with hurried steps bent my course in the direction of some lofty ground i at length found myself on a high road leading over wide and arid downs following the road for some miles without seeing anything remarkable i supposed at length that i had taken the wrong path and wended on slowly and disconsolately for some time till having nearly surmounted a steep hill i knew at once from certain appearances that i was near the object of my search turning to the right near the brow of the hill i proceeded along a path which brought me to a causeway leading over a deep ravine and connecting the hill with another which had once formed part of it for the ravine was evidently the work of art i passed over the causeway and found myself in a kind of gateway which admitted me into a square space of many acres surrounded on all sides by mounds or ramparts of earth though i had never been in such a place before i knew that i stood within the precincts of what had been a roman encampment and one probably of the largest size for many thousand warriors might have found room to perform their evolutions in that space in which corn was now growing the green ears waving in the morning wind after i had gazed about the space for a time standing in the gateway formed by the mounds i clambered up the mound to the left hand and on the top of that mound i found myself at a great altitude beneath at the distance of a mile was a fair old city situated amongst verdant meadows watered with streams and from the heart of that old city from amidst mighty trees i beheld towering to the sky the finest spire in the world after i had looked from the roman rampart for a long time i hurried away and retracing my steps along the causeway regained the road and passing over the brow of the hill descended to the city of the spirechapter lxii the hostelrylife uncertainopen countenancethe grand pointthank you mastera hard motherpoor dearconsiderable oddsthe better countryenglish fashionlandlordlooking person and in the old city i remained two days passing my time as i best couldinspecting the curiosities of the place eating and drinking when i felt so disposed which i frequently did the digestive organs having assumed a tone to which for many months they had been strangersenjoying at night balmy sleep in a large bed in a dusky room at the end of a corridor in a certain hostelry in which i had taken up my quartersreceiving from the people of the hostelry such civility and condescension as people who travel on foot with bundle and stick but who nevertheless are perceived to be not altogether destitute of coin are in the habit of receiving on the third day on a fine sunny afternoon i departed from the city of the spire as i was passing through one of the suburbs i saw all on a sudden a respectablelooking female fall down in a fit several persons hastened to her assistance she is dead said one no she is not said another i am afraid she is said a third life is very uncertain said a fourth it is mrs said a fifth let us carry her to her own house not being able to render any assistance i left the poor female in the hands of her townsfolk and proceeded on my way i had chosen a road in the direction of the northwest it led over downs where corn was growing but where neither tree nor hedge was to be seen two or three hours walking brought me to a beautiful valley abounding with trees of various kinds with a delightful village at its farthest extremity passing through it i ascended a lofty acclivity on the top of which i sat down on a bank and taking off my hat permitted a breeze which swept coolly and refreshingly over the downs to dry my hair dripping from the effects of exercise and the heat of the day and as i sat there gazing now at the blue heavens now at the downs before me a man came along the road in the direction in which i had hitherto been proceeding just opposite to me he stopped and looking at me criedam i right for london master he was dressed like a sailor and appeared to be between twentyfive and thirty years of agehe had an open manly countenance and there was a bold and fearless expression in his eye yes said i in reply to his question this is one of the ways to london do you come from far from said the man naming a wellknown seaport is this the direct road to london from that place i demanded no said the man but i had to visit two or three other places on certain commissions i was entrusted with amongst others to where i had to take a small sum of money i am rather tired master and if you please i will sit down beside you you have as much right to sit down here as i have said i the road is free for every one as for sitting down beside me you have the look of an honest man and i have no objection to your company why as for being honest master said the man laughing and sitting down beside me i havnt much to saymany is the wild thing i have done when i was younger however what is done is done to learn one must live master and i have lived long enough to learn the grand point of wisdom what is that said i that honesty is the best policy master you appear to be a sailor said i looking at his dress i was not bred a sailor said the man though when my foot is on the salt water i can play the partand play it well too i am now from a long voyage from america said i farther than that said the man have you any objection to tell me said i from new south wales said the man looking me full in the facedear me said i why do you say dear me said the man it is a very long way off said i was that your reason for saying so said the man not exactly said i no said the man with something of a bitter smile it was something else that made you say so you were thinking of the convicts well said i what thenyou are no convict how do you know you do not look like one thank you master said the man cheerfully and to a certain extent you are rightbygones are bygonesi am no longer what i was nor ever will be again the truth however is the trutha convict i have beena convict at sydney cove and you have served out the period for which you were sentenced and are now returned as to serving out my sentence replied the man i cant say that i did i was sentenced for fourteen years and i was in sydney cove little more than half that time the truth is that i did the government a service there was a conspiracy amongst some of the convicts to murder and destroyi overheard and informed the government mind one thing however i was not concerned in it those who got it up were no comrades of mine but a bloody gang of villains well the government in consideration of the service i had done them remitted the remainder of my sentence and some kind gentlemen interested themselves about me gave me good books and good advice and being satisfied with my conduct procured me employ in an exploring expedition by which i earned money in fact the being sent to sydney was the best thing that ever happened to me in all my life and you have now returned to your native country longing to see home brought you from new south wales there you are mistaken said the man wish to see england again would never have brought me so far for to tell you the truth master england was a hard mother to me as she has proved to many no a wish to see another kind of mothera poor old woman whose son i amhas brought me back you have a mother then said i does she reside in london she used to live in london said the man but i am afraid she is long since dead how did she support herself said i support herself with difficulty enough she used to keep a small stall on london bridge where she sold fruit i am afraid she is dead and that she died perhaps in misery she was a poor sinful creature but i loved her and she loved me i came all the way back merely for the chance of seeing her did you ever write to her said i or cause others to write to her i wrote to her myself said the man about two years ago but i never received an answer i learned to write very tolerably over there by the assistance of the good people i spoke of as for reading i could do that very well before i wentmy poor mother taught me to read out of a book that she was very fond of a strange book it was i remember poor dearwhat would i give only to know that she is alive life is very uncertain said i that is true said the man with a sigh we are here one moment and gone the next i continued as i passed through the streets of a neighbouring town i saw a respectable woman drop down and people said she was dead who knows but that she too had a son coming to see her from a distance at that very time who knows indeed said the man ah i am afraid my mother is dead well gods will be donehowever said i i should not wonder at your finding your mother alive you wouldnt said the man looking at me wistfully i should not wonder at all said i indeed something within me seems to tell me you will i should not much mind betting five shillings to five pence that you will see your mother within a week now friend five shillings to five pence is very considerable odds said the man rubbing his hands sure you must have good reason to hope when you are willing to give such odds after all said i it not unfrequently happens that those who lay the long odds lose let us hope however what do you mean to do in the event of finding your mother alive i scarcely know said the man i have frequently thought that if i found my mother alive i would attempt to persuade her to accompany me to the country which i have leftit is a better country for a manthat is a free manto live in than this however let me first find my motherif i could only find my mother farewell said i rising go your way and god go with youi will go mine i have but one thing to ask you said the man what is that i inquired that you would drink with me before we partyou have done me so much good how should we drink said i we are on the top of a hill where there is nothing to drink but there is a village below said the man do let us drink before we part i have been through that village already said i and i do not like turning back ah said the man sorrowfully you will not drink with me because i told you i was you are quite mistaken said i i would as soon drink with a convict as with a judge i am by no means certain that under the same circumstances the judge would be one whit better than the convict come along i will go back to oblige you i have an odd sixpence in my pocket which i will change that i may drink with you so we went down the hill together to the village through which i had already passed where finding a publichouse we drank together in true english fashion after which we parted the sailorlooking man going his way and i mine after walking about a dozen miles i came to a town where i rested for the night the next morning i set out again in the direction of the northwest i continued journeying for four days my daily journeys varying from twenty to twentyfive miles during this time nothing occurred to me worthy of any especial notice the weather was brilliant and i rapidly improved both in strength and spirits on the fifth day about two oclock i arrived at a small town feeling hungry i entered a decentlooking innwithin a kind of bar i saw a huge fat landlordlooking person with a very pretty smartlydressed maiden addressing myself to the fat man house said i house can i have dinner housechapter lxiii primitive habitsrosyfaced damsela pleasant momentsuit of blackthe furtive glancethe mighty round degenerate timesthe newspaperthe evil chancei congratulate you young gentleman said the huge fat landlord you are come at the right time dinner will be taken up in a few minutes and such a dinner he continued rubbing his hands as you will not see every day in these times i am hot and dusty said i and should wish to cool my hands and face jenny said the huge landlord with the utmost gravity show the gentleman into number seven that he may wash his hands and face by no means said i i am a person of primitive habits and there is nothing like the pump in weather like this jenny said the landlord with the same gravity as before go with the young gentleman to the pump in the back kitchen and take a clean towel along with you thereupon the rosyfaced cleanlooking damsel went to a drawer and producing a large thick but snowywhite towel she nodded to me to follow her whereupon i followed jenny through a long passage into the back kitchen and at the end of the back kitchen there stood a pump and going to it i placed my hands beneath the spout and said pump jenny and jenny incontinently without laying down the towel pumped with one hand and i washed and cooled my heated hands and when my hands were washed and cooled i took off my neckcloth and unbuttoning my shirt collar i placed my head beneath the spout of the pump and i said unto jenny now jenny lay down the towel and pump for your life thereupon jenny placing the towel on a linenhorse took the handle of the pump with both hands and pumped over my head as handmaid had never pumped before so that the water poured in torrents from my head my face and my hair down upon the brick floor and after the lapse of somewhat more than a minute i called out with a halfstrangled voice hold jenny and jenny desisted i stood for a few moments to recover my breath then taking the towel which jenny proffered i dried composedly my hands and head my face and hair then returning the towel to jenny i gave a deep sigh and said surely this is one of the pleasant moments of life then having set my dress to rights and combed my hair with a pocket comb i followed jenny who conducted me back through the long passage and showed me into a neat sanded parlour on the ground floor i sat down by a window which looked out upon the dusty street presently in came the handmaid and commenced laying the tablecloth shall i spread the table for one sir said she or do you expect anybody to dine with you i cant say that i expect anybody said i laughing inwardly to myself however if you please you can lay for two so that if any acquaintance of mine should chance to step in he may find a knife and fork ready for him so i sat by the window sometimes looking out upon the dusty street and now glancing at certain oldfashioned prints which adorned the wall over against me i fell into a kind of doze from which i was almost instantly awakened by the opening of the door dinner thought i and i sat upright in my chair no a man of the middle age and rather above the middle height dressed in a plain suit of black made his appearance and sat down in a chair at some distance from me but near to the table and appeared to be lost in thought the weather is very warm sir said i very said the stranger laconically looking at me for the first time would you like to see the newspaper said i taking up one which lay upon the window seat i never read newspapers said the stranger nor indeed whatever it might be that he had intended to say he left unfinished suddenly he walked to the mantelpiece at the farther end of the room before which he placed himself with his back towards me there he remained motionless for some time at length raising his hand he touched the corner of the mantelpiece with his finger advanced towards the chair which he had left and again seated himself have you come far said he suddenly looking towards me and speaking in a frank and open manner which denoted awish to enter into conversation you do not seem to be of this place i come from some distance said i indeed i am walking for exercise which i find as necessary to the mind as the body i believe that by exercise people would escape much mental misery scarcely had i uttered these words when the stranger laid his hand with seeming carelessness upon the table near one of the glasses after a moment or two he touched the glass as if inadvertently then glancing furtively at me he withdrew his hand and looked towards the window are you from these parts said i at last with apparent carelessness from this vicinity replied the stranger you think then that it is as easy to walk off the bad humours of the mind as of the body i at least am walking in that hope said i i wish you may be successful said the stranger and here he touched one of the forks which lay on the table near him here the door which was slightly ajar was suddenly pushed open with some fracas and in came the stout landlord supporting with some difficulty an immense dish in which was a mighty round mass of smoking meat garnished all round with vegetables so high was the mass that it probably obstructed his view for it was not until he had placed it upon the table that he appeared to observe the stranger he almost started and quite out of breath exclaimed god bless me your honour is your honour the acquaintance that the young gentleman was expecting is the young gentleman expecting an acquaintance said the stranger there is nothing like putting a good face upon these matters thought i to myself and getting up i bowed to the unknown sir said i when i told jenny that she might lay the tablecloth for two so that in the event of any acquaintance dropping in he might find a knife and fork ready for him i was merely jocular being an entire stranger in these parts and expecting no one fortune however it would seem has been unexpectedly kind to me i flatter myself sir that since you have been in this room i have had the honour of making your acquaintance and in the strength of that hope i humbly entreat you to honour me with your company to dinner provided you have not already dined the stranger laughed outright sir i continued the round of beef is a noble one and seems exceedingly well boiled and the landlord was just right when he said i should have such a dinner as is not seen every day a round of beef at any rate such a round of beef as this is seldom seen smoking upon the table in these degenerate times allow me sir said i observing that the stranger was about to speak allow me another remark i think i saw you just now touch the fork i venture to hail it as an omen that you will presently seize it and apply it to its proper purpose and its companion the knife also the stranger changed colour and gazed upon me in silence do sir here put in the landlord do sir accept the young gentlemans invitation your honour has of late been looking poorly and the young gentleman is a funny young gentleman and a clever young gentleman and i think it will do your honour good to have a dinners chat with the young gentleman it is not my dinner hour said the stranger i dine considerably later taking anything now would only discompose me i shall however be most happy to sit down with the young gentleman reach me that paper and when the young gentleman has satisfied his appetite we may perhaps have a little chat together the landlord handed the stranger the newspaper and bowing retired with his maid jenny i helped myself to a portion of the smoking round and commenced eating with no little appetite the stranger appeared to be soon engrossed with the newspaper we continued thus a considerable timethe one reading and the other dining chancing suddenly to cast my eyes upon the stranger i saw his brow contract he gave a slight stamp with his foot and flung the newspaper to the ground then stooping down he picked it up first moving his fore finger along the floor seemingly slightly scratching it with his nail do you hope sir said i by that ceremony with the finger to preserve yourself from the evil chance the stranger started then after looking at me for some time in silence he said is it possible that you ay ay said i helping myself to some more of the round i have touched myself in my younger days both for the evil chance and the good cant say though that i ever trusted much in the ceremonythe stranger made no reply but appeared to be in deep thought nothing further passed between us until i had concluded the dinner when i said to him i shall now be most happy sir to have the pleasure of your conversation over a pint of wine the stranger rose no my young friend said he smiling that would scarce be fair it is my turn nowpray do me the favour to go home with me and accept what hospitality my poor roof can offer to tell you the truth i wish to have some particular discourse with you which would hardly be possible in this place as for wine i can give you some much better than you can get here the landlord is an excellent fellow but he is an innkeeper after all i am going out for a moment and will send him in so that you may settle your account i trust you will not refuse me i only live about two miles from here i looked in the face of the strangerit was a fine intelligent face with a cast of melancholy in it sir said i i would go with you though you lived four miles instead of two who is that gentleman said i to the landlord after i had settled his bill i am going home with him i wish i were going too said the fat landlord laying his hand upon his stomach young gentleman i shall be a loser by his honours taking you away but after all the truth is the truththere are few gentlemen in these parts like his honour either for learning or welcoming his friends young gentleman i congratulate youchapter lxiv new acquaintanceold french stylethe portraittaciturnitythe evergreen treethe dark hourthe flash ancestorsa fortunate mana posthumous childantagonistic ideasthe hawksflawsthe ponyirresistible impulsefavourable crisisthe topmost branchtwenty feetheartily ashamed i found the stranger awaiting me at the door of the inn like yourself i am fond of walking said he and when any little business calls me to this place i generally come on foot we were soon out of the town and in a very beautiful country after proceeding some distance on the high road we turned off and were presently in one of those mazes of lanes for which england is famous the stranger at first seemed inclined to be taciturn a few observations however which i made appeared to rouse him and he soon exhibited not only considerable powers of observation but stores of information which surprised me so pleased did i become with my new acquaintance that i soon ceased to pay the slightest attention either to place or distance at length the stranger was silent and i perceived that we had arrived at a handsome iron gate and lodge the stranger having rung a bell the gate was opened by an old man and we proceeded along a gravel path which in about five minutes brought us to a large brick house built something in the old french style having a spacious lawn before it and immediately in front a pond in which were golden fish and in the middle a stone swan discharging quantities of water from its bill we ascended a spacious flight of steps to the door which was at once flung open and two servants with powdered hair and in livery of blue plush came out and stood one on either side as we passed the threshold we entered a large hall and the stranger taking me by the hand welcomed me to his poor home as he called it and then gave orders to another servant but out of livery to show me to an apartment and give me whatever assistance i might require in my toilette notwithstanding the plea as to primitive habits which i had lately made to my other host in the town i offered no objection to this arrangement but followed the bowing domestic to a spacious and airy chamber where he rendered me all those little nameless offices which the somewhat neglected state of my dress required when everything had been completed to my perfect satisfaction he told me that if i pleased he would conduct me to the library where dinner would be speedily served in the library i found a table laid for two my host was not there having as i supposed not been quite so speedy with his toilette as his guest left alone i looked round the apartment with inquiring eyes it was long and tolerably lofty the walls from the top to the bottom were lined with cases containing books of all sizes and bindings there were a globe or two a couch and an easy chair statues and busts there were none and only one painting a portrait that of my host but not him of the mansion over the mantelpiece the features staringly like but so ridiculously exaggerated that they scarcely resembled those of a human being daubed evidently by the hand of the commonest signartist hung a halflength portrait of him of round of beef celebritymy sturdy host of the town i had been in the library about ten minutes amusing myself as i best could when my friend entered he seemed to have resumed his taciturnityscarce a word escaped his lips till dinner was served when he said smiling i suppose it would be merely a compliment to ask you to partake i dont know said i seating myself your first course consists of troutlets i am fond of troutlets and i always like to be companionable the dinner was excellent though i did but little justice to it from the circumstance of having already dined the stranger also though without my excuse partook but slightly of the good cheer he still continued taciturn and appeared lost in thought and every attempt which i made to induce him to converse was signally unsuccessful and now dinner was removed and we sat over our wine and i remember that the wine was good and fully justified the encomiums of my host of the town over the wine i made sure that my entertainer would have loosened the chain which seemed to tie his tonguebut no i endeavoured to tempt him by various topics and talked of geometry and the use of the globes of the heavenly sphere and the star jupiter which i said i had heard was a very large star also of the evergreen tree which according to olaus stood of old before the heathen temple of upsal and which i affirmed was a yewbut no nothing that i said could induce my entertainer to relax his taciturnity it grew dark and i became uncomfortable i must presently be going i at last exclaimed at these words he gave a sudden start going said he are you not my guest and an honoured one you know best said i but i was apprehensive i was an intruder to several of my questions you have returned no answer ten thousand pardons he exclaimed seizing me by the hand but you cannot go now i have much to talk to you aboutthere is one thing in particularif it be the evergreen tree at upsal said i interrupting him i hold it to have been a yewwhat else the evergreens of the south as the old bishop observes will not grow in the north and a pine was unfitted for such a locality being a vulgar tree what else could it have been but the yewthe sacred yew which our ancestors were in the habit of planting in their churchyards moreover i affirm it to have been the yew for the honour of the tree for i love the yew and had i home and land i would have one growing before my front window you would do right the yew is indeed a venerable tree but it is not about the yew the star jupiter perhaps nor the star jupiter nor its moons an observation which escaped you at the inn has made a considerable impression upon me but i really must take my departure said i the dark hour is at hand and as i uttered these last words the stranger touched rapidly something which lay near him i forget what it was it was the first action of the kind which i had observed on his part since we sat down to table you allude to the evil chance said i but it is getting both dark and late i believe we are going to have a storm said my friend but i really hope that you will give me your company for a day or two i have as i said before much to talk to you about well said i i shall be most happy to be your guest for this night i am ignorant of the country and it is not pleasant to travel unknown paths by nightdear me what a flash of lightning it had become very dark suddenly a blaze of sheet lightning illumed the room by the momentary light i distinctly saw my host touch another object upon the table will you allow me to ask you a question or two said he at last as many as you please said i but shall we not have lights not unless you particularly wish it said my entertainer i rather like the dark and though a storm is evidently at hand neither thunder nor lightning has any terrors for me it is other things i quake ati should rather say ideas now permit me to ask you and then my entertainer asked me various questions to all of which i answered unreservedly he was then silent for some time at last he exclaimed i should wish to tell you the history of my lifethough not an adventurous one i think it contains some things which will interest you without waiting for my reply he began amidst darkness and gloom occasionally broken by flashes of lightning the stranger related to me as we sat at the table in the library his truly touching history before proceeding to relate the events of my life it will not be amiss to give you some account of my ancestors my great grandfather on the male side was a silk mercer in cheapside who when he died left his son who was his only child a fortune of one hundred thousand pounds and a splendid business the son however had no inclination for trade the summit of his ambition was to be a country gentleman to found a family and to pass the remainder of his days in rural ease and dignity and all this he managed to accomplish he disposed of his business purchased a beautiful and extensive estate for four score thousand pounds built upon it the mansion to which i had the honour of welcoming you today married the daughter of a neighbouring squire who brought him a fortune of five thousand pounds became a magistrate and only wanted a son and heir to make him completely happy this blessing it is true was for a long time denied him it came however at last as is usual when least expected his lady was brought to bed of my father and then who so happy a man as my grandsire he gave away two thousand pounds in charities and in the joy of his heart made a speech at the next quarter sessions the rest of his life was spent in ease tranquillity and rural dignity he died of apoplexy on the day that my father became of age perhaps it would be difficult to mention a man who in all respects was so fortunate as my grandfather his death was sudden it is true but i am not one of those who pray to be delivered from a sudden death i should not call my father a fortunate man it is true that he had the advantage of a firstrate education that he made the grand tour with a private tutor as was the fashion at that time that he came to a splendid fortune on the very day that he came of age that for many years he tasted all the diversions of the capital that at last determined to settle he married the sister of a baronet an amiable and accomplished lady with a large fortune that he had the best stud of hunters in the county on which during the season he followed the fox gallantly had he been a fortunate man he would never have cursed his fate as he was frequently known to do ten months after his marriage his horse fell upon him and so injuredhim that he expired in a few days in great agony my grandfather was indeed a fortunate man when he died he was followed to the grave by the tears of the poormy father was not two remarkable circumstances are connected with my birthi am a posthumous child and came into the world some weeks before the usual time the shock which my mother experienced at my fathers death having brought on the pangs of premature labour both my mothers life and my own were at first despaired of we both however survived the crisis my mother loved me with the most passionate fondness and i was brought up in this house under her own eyei was never sent to school i have already told you that mine is not a tale of adventure my life has not been one of action but of wild imaginings and strange sensations i was born with excessive sensibility and that has been my bane i have not been a fortunate man no one is fortunate unless he is happy and it is impossible for a being constructed like myself to be happy for an hour or even enjoy peace and tranquillity most of our pleasures and pains are the effects of imagination and wherever the sensibility is great the imagination is great also no sooner has my imagination raised up an image of pleasure than it is sure to conjure up one of distress and gloom these two antagonistic ideas instantly commence a struggle in my mind and the gloomy one generally i may say invariably prevails how is it possible that i should be a happy man it has invariably been so with me from the earliest period that i can remember the first playthings that were given me caused me for a few minutes excessive pleasure they were pretty and glittering presently however i became anxious and perplexed i wished to know their history how they were made and what ofwere the materials precious i was not satisfied with their outward appearance in less than an hour i had broken the playthings in an attempt to discover what they were made of when i was eight years of age my uncle the baronet who was also my godfather sent me a pair of norway hawks with directions for managing them he was a great fowler oh how rejoiced was i with the present which had been made me my joy lasted for at least five minutes i would let them breed i would have a house of hawks yes that i wouldbut and here came the unpleasant ideasuppose they were to fly away how very annoying ah but said hope theres little fear of that feed them well and they will never fly away or if they do they will come back my uncle says so so sunshine triumphed for a little time then the strangest of all doubts came into my head i doubted the legality of my tenure of these hawks how did i come by them why my uncle gave them to me but how did they come into his possession what right had he to them after all they might not be his to givei passed a sleepless night the next morning i found that the man who brought the hawks had not departed how came my uncle by these hawks i anxiously inquired they were sent to him from norway master with another pair and who sent them that i dont know master but i suppose his honour can tell you i was even thinking of scrawling a letter to my uncle to make inquiry on this point but shame restrained me and i likewise reflected that it would be impossible for him to give my mind entire satisfaction it is true he could tell who sent him the hawks but how was he to know how the hawks came into the possession of those who sent them to him and by what right they possessed them or the parents of the hawks in a word i wanted a clear valid title as lawyers would say to my hawks and i believe no title would have satisfied me that did not extend up to the time of the first hawk that is prior to adam and could i have obtained such a title i make no doubt that young as i was i should have suspected that it was full of flaws i was now disgusted with the hawks and no wonder seeing all the disquietude they had caused me i soon totally neglected the poor birds and they would have starved had not some of the servants taken compassion upon them and fed them my uncle soon hearing of my neglect was angry and took the birds away he was a very goodnatured man however and soon sent me a fine pony at first i was charmed with the pony soon however the same kind of thoughts arose which had disgusted me on a former occasion how did my uncle become possessed of the pony this question i asked him the first time i saw him oh he had bought it of a gypsy that i might learn to ride upon it a gypsy i had heard that gypsies were great thieves and i instantly began to fear that the gypsy had stolen the pony and it is probable that for this apprehension i had better grounds than for many others i instantly ceased to set any value upon the pony but for that reason perhaps i turned it to some account i mounted it and rode it about which i dont think i should have done had i looked upon it as a secure possession had i looked upon my title as secure i should have prized it so much that i should scarcely have mounted it for fear of injuring the animal but now caring not a straw for it i rode it most unmercifully and soon became a capital rider this was very selfish in me and i tell the fact with shame i was punished however as i deserved the pony had a spirit of its own and moreover it had belonged to gypsies once as i was riding it furiously over the lawn applying both whip and spur it suddenly lifted up its heels and flung me at least five yards over its head i received some desperate contusions and was taken up for dead it was many months before i perfectly recovered but it is time for me to come to the touching part of my story there was one thing that i loved better than the choicest gift which could be bestowed upon me better than life itselfmy motherat length she became unwell and the thought that i might possibly lose her now rushed into my mind for the first time it was terrible and caused me unspeakablemisery i may say horror my mother became worse and i was not allowed to enter her apartment lest by my frantic exclamations of grief i might aggravate her disorder i rested neither day nor night but roamed about the house like one distracted suddenly i found myself doing that which even at the time struck me as being highly singular i found myself touching particular objects that were near me and to which my fingers seemed to be attracted by an irresistible impulse it was now the table or the chair that i was compelled to touch now the bellrope now the handle of the door now i would touch the wall and the next moment stooping down i would place the point of my finger upon the floor and so i continued to do day after day frequently i would struggle to resist the impulse but invariably in vain i have even rushed away from the object but i was sure to return the impulse was too strong to be resisted i quickly hurried back compelled by the feeling within me to touch the object now i need not tell you that what impelled me to these actions was the desire to prevent my mothers death whenever i touched any particular object it was with the view of baffling the evil chance as you would call itin this instance my mothers death a favourable crisis occurred in my mothers complaint and she recovered this crisis took place about six oclock in the morning almost simultaneously with it there happened to myself a rather remarkable circumstance connected with the nervous feeling which was rioting in my system i was lying in bed in a kind of uneasy doze the only kind of rest which my anxiety on account of my mother permitted me at this time to take when all at once i sprang up as if electrified the mysterious impulse was upon me and it urged me to go without delay and climb a stately elm behind the house and touch the topmost branch otherwiseyou know the restthe evil chance would prevail accustomed for some time as i had been under this impulse to perform extravagant actions i confess to you that the difficulty and peril of such a feat startled me i reasoned against the feeling and strove more strenuously than i had ever done before i even made a solemn vow not to give way to the temptation but i believe nothing less than chains and those strong ones could have restrained me the demoniac influence for i can call it nothing else at length prevailed it compelled me to rise to dress myself to descend the stairs to unbolt the door and to go forth it drove me to the foot of the tree and it compelled me to climb the trunk this was a tremendous task and i only accomplished it after repeated falls and trials when i had got amongst the branches i rested for a time and then set about accomplishing the remainder of the ascent this for some time was not so difficult for i was now amongst the branches as i approached the top however the difficulty became greater likewise the danger but i was a light boy and almost as nimble as a squirrel and moreover the nervous feeling was within me impelling me upward it was only by means of a spring however that i was enabled to touch the top of the tree i sprang touched the top of the tree and fell a distance of at least twenty feet amongst the branches had i fallen to the bottom i must have been killed but i fell into the middle of the tree and presently found myself astride upon one of the boughs scratched and bruised all over i reached the ground and regained my chamber unobserved i flung myself on my bed quite exhausted presently they came to tell me that my mother was betterthey found me in the state which i have described and in a fever besides the favourable crisis must have occurred just about the time that i performed the magic touch it certainly was a curious coincidence yet i was not weak enough even though a child to suppose that i had baffled the evil chance by my daring feat indeed all the time that i was performing these strange feats i knew them to be highly absurd yet the impulse to perform them was irresistiblea mysterious dread hanging over me till i had given way to it even at that early period i frequently used to reason within myself as to what could be the cause of my propensity to touch but of course i could come to no satisfactory conclusion respecting it being heartily ashamed of the practice i never spoke of it to any one and was at all times highly solicitous that no one should observe my weaknesschapter lxv maternal anxietythe baronetlittle zestcountry lifemr speakerthe cravingspirited addressan author after a short pause my host resumed his narration though i was never sent to school my education was not neglected on that account i had tutors in various branches of knowledge under whom i made a tolerable progress by the time i was eighteen i was able to read most of the greek and latin authors with facility i was likewise to a certain degree a mathematician i cannot say that i took much pleasure in my studies my chief aim in endeavouring to accomplish my tasks was to give pleasure to my beloved parent who watched my progress with anxiety truly maternal my life at this period may be summed up in a few words i pursued my studies roamed about the woods walked the green lanes occasionally cast my fly in a trout stream and sometimes but not often rode a hunting with my uncle a considerable part of my time was devoted to my mother conversing with her and reading to her youthful companions i had none and as to my mother she lived in the greatest retirement devoting herself to the superintendence of my education and the practice of acts of charity nothing could be more innocent than this mode of life and some people say that in innocence there is happiness yet i cant say that i was happy a continual dread overshadowed my mind it was the dread of my mothers death her constitution had never been strong and it had been considerably shaken by her last illness this i knew and this i sawfor the eyes of fear are marvellously keen well things went on in this way till i had come of age my tutors were then dismissed and my uncle the baronet took me in hand telling my mother that it was high time for him to exert his authority that i must see something of the world for that if i remained much longer with her i should be ruined you must consign him to me said he and i will introduce him to the world my mother sighed and consented so my uncle the baronet introduced me to the world took me to horse races and to london and endeavoured to make a man of me according to his idea of the term and in part succeeded i became moderately dissipatedi say moderately for dissipation had but little zest for me in this manner four years passed over it happened that i was in london in the height of the season with my uncle at his house one morning he summoned me into the parlour he was standing before the fire and looked very serious i have had a letter said he your mother is very ill i staggered and touched the nearest object to me nothing was said for two or three minutes and then my uncle put his lips to my ear and whispered something i fell down senseless my mother wasi remember nothing for a long timefor two years i was out of my mind at the end of this time i recovered or partly so my uncle the baronet was very kind to me he advised me to travel he offered to go with me i told him he was very kind but i would rather go by myself so i went abroad and saw amongst other things rome and the pyramids by frequent change of scene my mind became not happy but tolerably tranquil i continued abroad some years when becoming tired of travelling i came home found my uncle the baronet alive hearty and unmarried as he still is he received me very kindly took me to newmarket and said that he hoped by this time i was become quite a man of the world by his advice i took a house in town in which i lived during the season in summer i strolled from one wateringplace to another and in order to pass the time i became very dissipated at last i became as tired of dissipation as i had previously been of travelling and i determined to retire to the country and live on my paternal estate this resolution i was not slow in putting into effect i sold my house in town repaired and refurnished my country house and for at least ten years lived a regular country life i gave dinner parties prosecuted poachers was charitable to the poor and now and then went into my library during this time i was seldom or never visited by the magic impulse the reason being that there was nothing in the wide world for which i cared sufficiently to move a finger to preserve it when the ten years however were nearly ended i started out of bed one morning in a fit of horror exclaiming mercy mercy what will become of me i am afraid i shall go mad i have lived thirtyfive years and upwards without doing anything shall i pass through life in this manner horror and then in rapid succession i touched three different objects i dressed myself and went down determining to set about something but what was i to dothere was the difficulty i ate no breakfast but walked about the room in a state of distraction at last i thought that the easiest way to do something was to get into parliament there would be no difficulty in that i had plenty of money and could buy a seat but what was i to do in parliament speak of coursebut could i speak ill try at once said i and forthwith i rushed into the largest dining room and locking the door i commenced speaking mr speaker said i and then i went on speaking for about ten minutes as i best could and then i left off for i was talking nonsense no i was not formed for parliament i could do nothing there whatwhat was i to do many many times i thought this question over but was unable to solve it a fear now stole over me that i was unfit for anything in the world save the lazy life of vegetation which i had for many years been leading yet if that were the case thought i why the craving within me to distinguish myself surely it does not occur fortuitously but is intended to rouse and call into exercise certain latent powers that i possess and then with infinite eagerness i set about attempting to discover these latent powers i tried an infinity of pursuits botany and geology amongst the rest but in vain i was fitted for none of them i became very sorrowful and despondent and at one time i had almost resolved to plunge again into the whirlpool of dissipation it was a dreadful resource it was true but what better could i dobut i was not doomed to return to the dissipation of the world one morning a young nobleman who had for some time past shown a wish to cultivate my acquaintance came to me in a considerable hurry i am come to beg an important favour of you said he one of the county memberships is vacanti intend to become a candidate what i want immediately is a spirited address to the electors i have been endeavouring to frame one all the morning but in vain i have therefore recourse to you as a person of infinite genius pray my dear friend concoct me one by the morning what you require of me i replied is impossible i have not the gift of words did i possess it i would stand for the county myself but i cant speak only the other day i attempted to make a speech but left off suddenly utterly ashamed although i was quite alone of the nonsense i was uttering it is not a speech that i want said my friend i can talk for three hours without hesitating but i want an address to circulate through the county and i find myself utterly incompetent to put one together do oblige me by writing one for me i know you can and if at any time you want a person to speak for you you may command me not for three but for six hours good morning tomorrow i will breakfast with you in the morning he came again well said he what success very poor said i but judge for yourself and i put into his hand a manuscript of several pages my friend read it through with considerable attention i congratulate you said he and likewise myself i was not mistaken in my opinion of you the address is too long by at least twothirds or i should rather say it is longer by twothirds than addresses generally are but it will doi will not curtail it of a word i shall win my election and in truth he did win his election and it was not only his own but the general opinion that he owed it to the address but however that might be i had by writing the address at last discovered what had so long eluded my searchwhat i was able to do i who had neither the nerve nor the command of speech necessary to constitute the oratorwho had not the power of patient research required by those who would investigate the secrets of nature had nevertheless a ready pen and teeming imagination this discovery decided my fatefrom that moment i became an authorchapter lxvi trepidationssubtle principleperverse imaginationare they mineanother bookhow hardagricultural dinnerincomprehensible actionsinmost bosomgive it upchance resemblancerascally newspaper an author said i addressing my host is it possible that i am under the roof of an author yes said my host sighing my name is so and so and i am the author of so and so it is more than probable that you have heard both of my name and works i will not detain you much longer with my history the night is advancing and the storm appears to be upon the increase my life since the period of my becoming an author may be summed briefly as an almost uninterrupted series of doubts anxieties and trepidations i see clearly that it is not good to love anything immoderately in this world but it has been my misfortune to love immoderately everything on which i have set my heart this is not good i repeatbut where is the remedy the ancients were always in the habit of saying practise moderation but the ancients appear to have considered only one portion of the subject it is very possible to practise moderation in some things in drink and the liketo restrain the appetitesbut can a man restrain the affections of his mind and tell them so far you shall go and no farther alas no for the mind is a subtle principle and cannot be confined the winds may be imprisoned homer says that odysseus carried certain winds in his ship confined in leathern bags but homer never speaks of confining the affections it were but right that those who exhort us against inordinate affections and setting our hearts too much upon the world and its vanities would tell us how to avoid doing so i need scarcely tell you that no sooner did i become an author than i gave myself up immoderately to my vocation it became my idol and as a necessary consequence it has proved a source of misery and disquietude to me instead of pleasure and blessing i had trouble enough in writing my first work and i was not long in discovering that it was one thing to write a stirring and spirited address to a set of county electors and another widely different to produce a work at all calculated to make an impression upon the great world i felt however that i was in my proper sphere and by dint of unwearied diligence and exertion i succeeded in evolving from the depths of my agitated breast a work which though it did not exactly please me i thought would serve to make an experiment upon the public so i laid it before the public and the reception which it met with was far beyond my wildest expectations the public were delighted with it but what were my feelings anything alas but those of delight no sooner did the public express its satisfaction at the result of my endeavours than my perverse imagination began to conceive a thousand chimerical doubts forthwith i sat down to analyse it and my worst enemy and all people have their enemies especially authorsmy worst enemy could not have discovered or sought to discover a tenth part of the faults which i the author and creator of the unfortunate production found or sought to find in it it has been said that love makes us blind to the faults of the loved objectcommon love does perhapsthe love of a father to his child or that of a lover to his mistress but not the inordinate love of an author to his works at least not the love which one like myself bears to his works to be brief i discovered a thousand faults in my work which neither public nor critics discovered however i was beginning to get over this misery and to forgive my work all its imperfections whenand i shake when i mention itthe same kind of idea which perplexed me with regard to the hawks and the gypsy pony rushed into my mind and i forthwith commenced touching the objects around me in order to baffle the evil chance as you call it it was neither more nor less than a doubt of the legality of my claim to the thoughts expressions and situations contained in the book that is to all that constituted the book how did i get them how did they come into my mind did i invent them did they originate with myself are they my own or are they some other bodys you see into what difficulty i had got i wont trouble you by relating all that i endured at that time but will merely say that after eating my own heart as the italians say and touching every object that came in my way for six months i at length flung my book i mean the copy of it which i possessed into the fire and began another but it was all in vain i laboured at this other finished it and gave it to the world and no sooner had i done so than the same thought was busy in my brain poisoning all the pleasure which i should otherwise have derived from my work how did i get all the matter which composed it out of my own mind unquestionably but how did it come therewas it the indigenous growth of the mind and then i would sit down and ponder over the various scenes and adventures in my book endeavouring to ascertain how i came originally to devise them and by dint of reflecting i remembered that to a single word in conversation or some simple accident in a street or on a road i was indebted for some of the happiest portions of my work they were but tiny seeds it is true which in the soil of my imagination had subsequently become stately trees but i reflected that without them no stately trees would have been produced and that consequently only a part in the merit of these compositions which charmed the worldfor they did charm the worldwas due to myself thus a dead fly was in my phial poisoning all the pleasure which i should otherwise have derived from the result of my brain sweat how hard i would exclaim looking up to the sky how hard i am like virgils sheep bearing fleeces not for themselves but not to tire you it fared with my second work as it did with my first i flung it aside and in order to forget it i began a third on which i am now occupied but the difficulty of writing it is immense my extreme desire to be original sadly cramping the powers of my mind my fastidiousness being so great that i invariably reject whatever ideas i do not think to be legitimately my own but there is one circumstance to which i cannot help alluding here as it serves to show what miseries this love of originality must needs bring upon an author i am constantly discovering that however original imay wish to be i am continually producing the same things which other people say or write whenever after producing something which gives me perfect satisfaction and which has cost me perhaps days and nights of brooding i chance to take up a book for the sake of a little relaxation a book which i never saw before i am sure to find in it something more or less resembling some part of what i have been just composing you will easily conceive the distress which then comes over me tis then that i am almost tempted to execrate the chance which by discovering my latent powers induced me to adopt a profession of such anxiety and misery for some time past i have given up reading almost entirely owing to the dread which i entertain of lighting upon something similar to what i myself have written i scarcely ever transgress without having almost instant reason to repent today when i took up the newspaper i saw in a speech of the duke of rhododendron at an agricultural dinner the very same ideas and almost the same expressions which i had put into the mouth of an imaginary personage of mine on a widely different occasion you saw how i dashed the newspaper downyou saw how i touched the floor the touch was to baffle the evil chance to prevent the critics detecting any similarity between the speech of the duke of rhododendron at the agricultural dinner and the speech of my personage my sensibility on the subject of my writings is so great that sometimes a chance word is sufficient to unman me i apply it to them in a superstitious sense for example when you said some time ago that the dark hour was coming on i applied it to my worksit appeared to bode them evil fortune you saw how i touched it was to baffle the evil chance but i do not confine myself to touching when the fear of the evil chance is upon me to baffle it i occasionally perform actions which must appear highly incomprehensible i have been known when riding in company with other people to leave the direct road and make a long circuit by a miry lane to the place to which we were going i have also been seen attempting to ride across a morass where i had no business whatever and in which my horse finally sank up to its saddlegirths and was only extricated by the help of a multitude of hands i have of course frequently been asked the reason of such conduct to which i have invariably returned no answer for i scorn duplicity whereupon people have looked mysteriously and sometimes put their fingers to their foreheads and yet it cant be i once heard an old gentleman say dont we know what he is capable of and the old man was right i merely did these things to avoid the evil chance impelled by the strange feeling within me and this evil chance is invariably connected with my writings the only things at present which render life valuable to me if i touch various objects and ride into miry places it is to baffle any mischance befalling me as an author to prevent my books getting into disrepute in nine cases out of ten to prevent any expressions thoughts or situations in any work which i am writing from resembling the thoughts expressions and situations of other authors for my great wish as i told you before is to be original i have now related my history and have revealed to you the secrets of my inmost bosom i should certainly not have spoken so unreservedly as i have done had i not discovered in you a kindred spirit i have long wished for an opportunity of discoursing on the point which forms the peculiar feature of my history with a being who could understand me and truly it was a lucky chance which brought you to these parts you who seem to be acquainted with all things strange and singular and who are as well acquainted with the subject of the magic touch as with all that relates to the star jupiter or the mysterious tree at upsal such was the story which my host related to me in the library amidst the darkness occasionally broken by flashes of lightning both of us remained silent for some time after it was concluded it is a singular story said i at last though i confess that i was prepared for some part of it will you permit me to ask you a question certainly said my host did you never speak in public said i never and when you made this speech of yours in the diningroom commencing with mr speaker no one was present none in the world i doublelocked the door what do you mean an idea came into my headdear me how the rain is pouringbut with respect to your present troubles and anxieties would it not be wise seeing that authorship causes you so much trouble and anxiety to give it up altogether were you an author yourself replied my host you would not talk in this manner once an author ever an author besides what could i do return to my former state of vegetation no much as i endure i do not wish that besides every now and then my reason tells me that these troubles and anxieties of mine are utterly without foundation that whatever i write is the legitimate growth of my own mind and that it is the height of folly to afflict myself at any chance resemblance between my own thoughts and those of other writers such resemblance being inevitable from the fact of our common human origin in shorti understand you said i notwithstanding your troubles and anxieties you find life very tolerable has your originality ever been called in question on the contrary every one declares that originality constitutes the most remarkable feature of my writings the man has some faults they say but want of originality is certainly not one of them he is quite different from othersa certain newspaper it is true the i think once insinuated that in a certain work of mine i had taken a hint or two from the writings of a couple of authors which it mentioned it happened however that i had never even read one syllable of the writings of either and of one of them had never even heard the name so much for the discrimination of the bythebye what a rascally newspaper that is a very rascally newspaper said ichapter lxvii disturbed slumbersthe bedposttwo wizardswhat can i doreal librarythe rev mr platitude toleration to dissentersparadoxsword of st peterenemy to humbughigh principlesfalse concordthe damselwhat religionfarther conversationthat would never domay you prosper during the greater part of that night my slumbers were disturbed by strange dreams amongst other things i fancied that i was my host my head appeared to be teeming with wild thoughts and imaginations out of which i was endeavouring to frame a book and now the book was finished and given to the world and the world shouted and all eyes were turned upon me and i shrunk from the eyes of the world and when i got into retired places i touched various objects in order to baffle the evil chance in short during the whole night i was acting over the story which i had heard before i went to bed at about eight oclock i awoke the storm had long since passed away and the morning was bright and shining my couch was so soft and luxurious that i felt loth to quit it so i lay some time my eyes wandering about the magnificent room to which fortune had conducted me in so singular a manner at last i heaved a sigh i was thinking of my own homeless condition and imagining where i should find myself on the following morning unwilling however to indulge in melancholy thoughts i sprang out of bed and proceeded to dress myself and whilst dressing i felt an irresistible inclination to touch the bedpost i finished dressing and left the room feeling compelled however as i left it to touch the lintel of the door is it possible thought i that from what i have lately heard the longforgotten influence should have possessed me again but i will not give way to it so i hurried down stairs resisting as i went a certain inclination which i occasionally felt to touch the rail of the banister i was presently upon the gravel walk before the house it was indeed a glorious morning i stood for some time observing the golden fish disporting in the waters of the pond and then strolled about amongst the noble trees of the park the beauty and freshness of the morningfor the air had been considerably cooled by the late stormsoon enabled me to cast away the gloomy ideas which had previously taken possession of my mind and after a stroll of about half an hour i returned towards the house in high spirits it is true that once i felt very much inclined to go and touch the leaves of a flowery shrub which i saw at some distance and had even moved two or three paces towards it but bethinking myself i manfully resisted the temptation begone i exclaimed ye sorceries in which i formerly trusted begone for ever vagaries which i had almost forgotten good luck is not to be obtained or bad averted by magic touches besides two wizards in one parish would be too much in all conscience i returned to the house and entered the library breakfast was laid on the table and my friend was standing before the portrait which i have already said hung above the mantelpiece so intently was he occupied in gazing at it that he did not hear me enter nor was aware of my presence till i advanced close to him and spoke when he turned round and shook me by the hand what can possibly have induced you to hang that portrait up in your library it is a staring likeness it is true but it appears to me a wretched daub daub as you call it said my friend smiling i would not part with it for the best piece of raphael for many a happy thought i am indebted to that pictureit is my principal source of inspiration when my imagination flags as of course it occasionally does i stare upon those features and forthwith strange ideas of fun and drollery begin to flow into my mind these i round amplify or combine into goodly creations and bring forth as i find an opportunity it is true that i am occasionally tormented by the thought that by doing this i am committing plagiarism though in that case all thoughts must be plagiarisms all that we think being the result of what we hear see or feel what can i do i must derive my thoughts from some source or other and after all it is better to plagiarise from the features of my landlord than from the works of butler and cervantes my works as you are aware are of a seriocomic character my neighbours are of opinion that i am a great reader and so i am but only of those featuresmy real library is that picture but how did you obtain it said i some years ago a travelling painter came into this neighbourhood and my jolly host at the request of his wife consented to sit for his portrait she highly admired the picture but she soon died and then my fat friend who is of an affectionate disposition said he could not bear the sight of it as it put him in mind of his poor wife i purchased it of him for five poundsi would not take five thousand for it when you called that picture a daub you did not see all the poetry of it we sat down to breakfast my entertainer appeared to be in much better spirits than on the preceding day i did not observe him touch once ere breakfast was over a servant enteredthe reverend mr platitude sir said he a shade of dissatisfaction came over the countenance of my host what does the silly pestilent fellow mean by cominghere said he half to himself let him come in said he to the servant the servant went out and in a moment reappeared introducing the reverend mr platitude the reverend mr platitude having what is vulgarly called a game leg came shambling into the room he was about thirty years of age and about five feet three inches high his face was of the colour of pepper and nearly as rugged as a nutmeg grater his hair was black with his eyes he squinted and grinned with his lips which were very much apart disclosing two very irregular rows of teeth he was dressed in the true levitical fashion in a suit of spotless black and a neckerchief of spotless white the reverend mr platitude advanced winking and grinning to my entertainer who received him politely but with evident coldness nothing daunted however the reverend mr platitude took a seat by the table and being asked to take a cup of coffee winked grinned and consented in company i am occasionally subject to fits of what is generally called absence my mind takes flight and returns to former scenes or presses forward into the future one of these fits of absence came over me at this timei looked at the reverend mr platitude for a moment heard a word or two that proceeded from his mouth and saying to myself you are no man for me fell into a fit of musinginto the same train of thought as in the morning no very pleasant onei was thinking of the future i continued in my reverie for some time and probably should have continued longer had i not been suddenly aroused by the voice of mr platitude raised to a very high key yes my dear sir said he it is but too true i have it on good authoritya gone churcha lost churcha ruined churcha demolished church is the church of england toleration to dissenters oh monstrous i suppose said my host that the repeal of the test acts will be merely a precursor of the emancipation of the papists of the catholics said the reverend mr platitude ahem there was a time as i believe you are aware my dear sir when i was as much opposed to the emancipation of the catholics as it was possible for any one to be but i was prejudiced my dear sir labouring under a cloud of most unfortunate prejudice but i thank my maker i am so no longer i have travelled as you are aware it is only by travelling that one can rub off prejudices i think you will agree with me there i am speaking to a traveller i left behind all my prejudices in italy the catholics are at least our fellowchristians i thank heaven that i am no longer an enemy to catholic emancipation and yet you would not tolerate dissenters dissenters my dear sir i hope you would not class such a set as the dissenters with catholics perhaps it would be unjust said my host though to which of the two parties is another thing but permit me to ask you a question does it not smack somewhat of paradox to talk of catholics whilst you admit there are dissenters if there are dissenters how should there be catholics it is not my fault that there are dissenters said the reverend mr platitude if i had my will i would neither admit there were any nor permit any to be of course you would admit there were such as long as they existed but how would you get rid of them i would have the church exert its authority what do you mean by exerting its authority i would not have the church bear the sword in vain what the sword of st peter you remember what the founder of the religion which you profess said about the sword he who striketh with it i think those who have called themselves the church have had enough of the sword two can play with the sword mr platitude the church of rome tried the sword with the lutherans how did it fare with the church of rome the church of england tried the sword mr platitude with the puritans how did it fare with laud and charles oh as for the church of england said mr platitude i have little to say thank god i left all my church of england prejudices in italy had the church of england known its true interests it would long ago have sought a reconciliation with its illustrious mother if the church of england had not been in some degree a schismatic church it would not have fared so ill at the time of which you are speaking the rest of the church would have come to its assistance the irish would have helped it so would the french so would the portuguese disunion has always been the bane of the churchonce more i fell into a reverie my mind now reverted to the past methought i was in a small comfortable room wainscoted with oak i was seated on one side of a fireplace close by a table on which were wine and fruit on the other side of the fire sat a man in a plain suit of brown with the hair combed back from his somewhat high forehead he had a pipe in his mouth which for some time he smoked gravely and placidly without saying a word at length after drawing at the pipe for some time rather vigorously he removed it from his mouth and emitting an accumulated cloud of smoke he exclaimed in a slow and measured tone as i was telling you just now my good chap i have always been an enemy to humbug when i awoke from my reverie the reverend mr platitude was quitting the apartment who is that person said i to my entertainer as the door closed behind him who is he said my host why the rev mr platitude does he reside in this neighbourhood he holds a living about three miles from here his history as far as i am acquainted with it is as follows his father was a respectable tanner in the neighbouring town who wishing to make his son a gentleman sent him to college having never been at college myself i cannot say whether he took the wisest course i believe it is more easy to unmake than to make a gentleman i have known many gentlemanly youths go to college and return anything but what they went young mr platitude did not go to college a gentleman but neither did he return one he went to college an ass and returned a prig to his original folly was superadded a vast quantity of conceit he told his father that he had adopted high principles and was determined to discountenance everything low and mean advised him to eschew trade and to purchase him a living the old man retired from business purchased his son a living and shortly after died leaving him what remained of his fortune the first thing the reverend mr platitude did after his fathers decease was to send his mother and sister into wales to live upon a small annuity assigning as a reason that he was averse to anything low and that they talked ungrammatically wishing to shine in the pulpit he now preached high sermons as he called them interspersed with scraps of learning his sermons did not however procure him much popularity on the contrary his church soon became nearly deserted the greater part of his flock going over to certain dissenting preachers who had shortly before made their appearance in the neighbourhood mr platitude was filled with wrath and abused dissenters in most unmeasured terms coming in contact with some of the preachers at a public meeting he was rash enough to enter into argument with them poor platitude he had better have been quiet he appeared like a child a very infant in their grasp he attempted to take shelter under his college learning but found to his dismay that his opponents knew more greek and latin than himself these illiterate boors as he supposed them caught him at once in a false concord and mr platitude had to slink home overwhelmed with shame to avenge himself he applied to the ecclesiastical court but was told that the dissenters could not be put down by the present ecclesiastical law he found the church of england to use his own expression a poor powerless restricted church he now thought to improve his consequence by marriage and made up to a rich and beautiful young lady in the neighbourhood the damsel measured him from head to foot with a pair of very sharp eyes dropped a curtsey and refused him mr platitude finding england a very stupid place determined to travel he went to italy how he passed his time there he knows best to other people it is a matter of little importance at the end of two years he returned with a real or assumed contempt for everything english and especially for the church to which he belongs and out of which he is supported he forthwith gave out that he had left behind him all his church of england prejudices and as a proof thereof spoke against sacerdotal wedlock and the toleration of schismatics in an evil hour for myself he was introduced to me by a clergyman of my acquaintance and from that time i have been pestered as i was this morning at least once a week i seldom enter into any discussion with him but fix my eyes on the portrait over the mantelpiece and endeavour to conjure up some comic idea or situation whilst he goes on talking tomfoolery by the hour about church authority schismatics and the unlawfulness of sacerdotal wedlock occasionally he brings with him a strange kind of being whose acquaintance he says he made in italy i believe he is some sharking priest who has come over to proselytize and plunder this being has some powers of conversation and some learning but he carries the countenance of an arch villain platitude is evidently his tool of what religion are you said i to my host that of the vicar of wakefieldgood quiet church of england which would live and let live practises charity and rails at no one where the priest is the husband of one wife takes care of his family and his parishsuch is the religion for me though i confess i have hitherto thought too little of religious matters when however i have completed this plaguy work on which i am engaged i hope to be able to devote more attention to them after some further conversation the subjects being if i remember right college education priggism church authority tomfoolery and the like i rose and said to my host i must now leave you whither are you goingi do not know stay here thenyou shall be welcome as many days months and years as you please to stay do you think i would hang upon another man no not if he were emperor of all the chinas i will now make my preparations and then bid you farewell i retired to my apartment and collected the handful of things which i carried with me on my travels i will walk a little way with you said my friend on my return he walked with me to the park gate neither of us said anything by the way when we had come upon the road i said farewell now i will not permit you to give yourself any further trouble on my account receive my best thanks for your kindness before we part however i should wish to ask you a question do you think you shall ever grow tired of authorship i have my fears said my friend advancing his hand to one of the iron bars of the gate dont touch said i it is a bad habit i have but one word to add should you ever grow tired of authorship follow your first idea of getting into parliament you have words enough at command perhaps you want manner and method but in that case you must apply to a teacher you must take lessons of a master of elocution that would never do said my host i know myself too well to think of applying for assistance to any one were i to become a parliamentary orator i should wish to be an original one even if not above mediocrity what pleasure should i take in any speech i might make however original as to thought provided the gestures i employed and the very modulation of my voice were not my own take lessons indeed why the fellow who taught me the professor might be standing in the gallery whilst i spoke and at the best parts of my speech might say to himself that gesture is mine that modulation is mine i could not bear the thought of such a thing farewell said i and may you prosper i have nothing more to say i departed at the distance of twenty yards i turned round suddenly my friend was just withdrawing his finger from the bar of the gate he has been touching said i as i proceeded on my way i wonder what was the evil chance he wished to bafflechapter lxviii elastic stepdisconsolate partynot the seasonmend your draughtgood alecrotchethammer and tongs schoolmastertrue

myself on the great road at the same spot where i had turned aside the day before with my newmade acquaintance in the direction of his house i now continued my journey as before towards the north the weather though beautiful was much cooler than it had been for some time past i walked at a great rate with a springing and elastic step in about two hours i came to where a kind of cottage stood a little way back from the road with a huge oak before it under the shade of which stood a little pony and a cart which seemed to contain various articles i was going pastwhen i saw scrawled over the door of the cottage good beer sold here upon which feeling myself all of a sudden very thirsty i determined to go in and taste the beverage i entered a wellsanded kitchen and seated myself on a bench on one side of a long white table the other side which was nearest the wall was occupied by a party or rather family consisting of a grimylooking man somewhat under the middle size dressed in faded velveteens and wearing a leather aprona rather prettylooking woman but sunburnt and meanly dressed and two ragged children a boy and girl about four or five years old the man sat with his eyes fixed upon the table supporting his chin with both his hands the woman who was next to him sat quite still save that occasionally she turned a glance upon her husband with eyes that appeared to have been lately crying the children had none of the vivacity so general at their age a more disconsolate family i had never seen a mug which when filled might contain halfapint stood empty before them a very disconsolate party indeed house said i house and then as nobody appeared i cried again as loud as i could house do you hear me house whats your pleasure young man said an elderly woman who now made her appearance from a side apartment to taste your ale said i how much said the woman stretching out her hand towards the empty mug upon the table the largest measurefull in your house said i putting back her hand gently this is not the season for halfpint mugs as you will young man said the landlady and presently brought in an earthen pitcher which might contain about three pints and which foamed and frothed withal will this pay for it said i putting down sixpence i have to return you a penny said the landlady putting her hand into her pocket i want no change said i flourishing my hand with an air as you please young gentleman said the landlady and then making a kind of curtsey she again retired to the side apartment here is your health sir said i to the grimylooking man as i raised the pitcher to my lips the tinker for such i supposed him to be without altering his posture raised his eyes looked at me for a moment gave a slight nod and then once more fixed his eyes upon the table i took a draught of the ale which i found excellent wont you drink said i holding the pitcher to the tinker the man again lifted his eyes looked at me and then at the pitcher and then at me again i thought at one time that he was about to shake his head in sign of refusal but no he looked once more at the pitcher and the temptation was too strong slowly removing his head from his arms he took the pitcher sighed nodded and drank a tolerable quantity and then set the pitcher down before me upon the table you had better mend your draught said i to the tinker it is a sad heart that never rejoices thats true said the tinker and again raising the pitcher to his lips he mended his draught as i had bidden him drinking a larger quantity than before pass it to your wife said ithe poor woman took the pitcher from the mans hand before however raising it to her lips she looked at the children true mothers heart thought i to myself and taking the halfpint mug i made her fill it and then held it to the children causing each to take a draught the woman wiped her eyes with the corner of her gown before she raised the pitcher and drank to my health in about five minutes none of the family looked half so disconsolate as before and the tinker and i were in deep discourse oh genial and gladdening is the power of good ale the true and proper drink of englishmen he is not deserving of the name of englishman who speaketh against ale that is good ale like that which has just made merry the hearts of this poor family and yet there are beings calling themselves englishmen who say that it is a sin to drink a cup of ale and who on coming to this passage will be tempted to fling down the book and exclaim the man is evidently a bad man for behold by his own confession he is not only fond of ale himself but is in the habit of tempting other people with it alas alas what a number of silly individuals there are in this world i wonder what they would have had me do in this instance given the afflicted family a cup of cold water go to they could have found water in the road for there was a pellucid spring only a few yards distant from the house as they were well awarebut they wanted not water what should i have given them meat and bread go to they were not hungry there was stifled sobbing in their bosoms and the first mouthful of strong meat would have choked them what should i have given them money what right had i to insult them by offering them money advice words words words friends there is a time for everything there is a time for a cup of cold water there is a time for strong meat and bread there is a time for advice and there is a time for ale and i have generally found that the time for advice is after a cup of ale i do not say many cups the tongue then speaketh more smoothly and the ear listeneth more benignantly but why do i attempt to reason with you do i not know you for conceited creatures with one ideaand that a foolish onea crotchet for the sake of which ye would sacrifice anything religion if requiredcountry there fling down my book i do not wish ye to walk any farther in my company unless you cast your nonsense away which ye will never do for it is the breath of your nostrils fling down my book it was not written to support a crotchet for know one thing my good people i have invariably been an enemy to humbug well said the tinker after we had discoursed some time i little thought when i first saw you that you were of my own trade myselfnor am i at least not exactly there is not much difference tis true between a tinker and a smith tinkeryou are a whitesmith then myselfnot i id scorn to be anything so mean no friend blacks the colour i am a brother of the horseshoe success to the hammer and tongs tinkerwell i shouldnt have thought you had been a blacksmith by your hands myselfi have seen them however as black as yours the truth is i have not worked for many a day tinkerwhere did you serve first myselfin ireland tinkerthats a good way off isnt it myselfnot very far over those mountains to the left and the run of salt water that lies behind them theres ireland tinkerits a fine thing to be a scholar myselfnot half so fine as to be a tinker tinkerhow you talk myselfnothing but the truth what can be better than to be ones own master now a tinker is his own master a scholar is not let us suppose the best of scholars a schoolmaster for example for i suppose you will admit that no one can be higher in scholarship than a schoolmaster do you call his a pleasant life i dont we should call him a schoolslave rather than a schoolmaster only conceive him in blessed weather like this in his close school teaching children to write in copybooks evil communication corrupts good manners or you cannot touch pitch without defilement or to spell out of abedariums or to read out of jack smith or sandford and merton only conceive him i say drudging in such guise from morning till night without any rational enjoyment but to beat the children would you compare such a dogs life as that with your ownthe happiest under heaventrue eden life as the germans would saypitching your tent under the pleasant hedgerows listening to the song of the feathered tribes collecting all the leaky kettles in the neighbourhood soldering and joining earning your honest bread by the wholesome sweat of your browmaking tenholeshey whats this whats the man crying for suddenly the tinker had covered his face with his hands and begun to sob and moan like a man in the deepest distress the breast of his wife was heaved with emotion even the children were agitated the youngest began to roar myselfwhats the matter with you what are you all crying about tinker uncovering his facelord why to hear you talk isnt that enough to make anybody cryeven the poor babes yes you said right tis life in the garden of edenthe tinkers i see so now that im about to give it up myselfgive it up you must not think of such a thing tinkerno i cant bear to think of it and yet i must whats to be done how hard to be frightened to death to be driven off the roads myselfwho has driven you off the roads tinkerwho the flaming tinman myselfwho is he tinkerthe biggest rogue in england and the cruellest or he wouldnt have served me as he has doneill tell you all about it i was born upon the roads and so was my father before me and my mother too and i worked with them as long as they lived as a dutiful child for i have nothing to reproach myself with on their account and when my father died i took up the business and went his beat and supported my mother for the little time she lived and when she died i married this young woman who was not born upon the roads but was a small tradesmans daughter at gloster she had a kindness for me and notwithstanding her friends were against the match she married the poor tinker and came to live with him upon the roads well young man for six or seven years i was the happiest fellow breathing living just the life you described just nowrespected by everybody in this beat when in an evil hour comes this black jack this flaming tinman into these parts driven as they say out of yorkshirefor no good you may be sure now there is no beat will support two tinkers as you doubtless know mine was a good one but it would not support the flying tinker and myself though if it would have supported twenty it would have been all the same to the flying villain wholl brook no one but himself so he presently finds me out and offers to fight me for the beat now being bred upon the roads i can fight a little that is with anything like my match but i was not going to fight him who happens to be twice my size and so i told him whereupon he knocks me down and would have done me further mischief had not some men been nigh and prevented him so he threatened to cut my throat and went his way well i did not like such usage at all and was woundily frightened and tried to keep as much out of his way as possible going anywhere but where i thought i was likely to meet him and sure enough for several months i contrived to keep out of his way at last somebody told me that he was gone back to yorkshire whereupon i was glad at heart and ventured to show myself going here and there as i did before well young man it was yesterday that i and mine set ourselves down in a lane about five miles from here and lighted our fire and had our dinner and after dinner i sat down to mend three kettles and a frying pan which the people in the neighbourhood had given me to mendfor as i told you before i have a good connection owing to my honesty well as i sat there hard at work happy as the days long and thinking of anything but what was to happen who should come up but this black jack this king of the tinkers rattling along in his cart with his wife that they call grey moll by his sidefor the villain has got a wife and a maidservant too the last i never saw but they that has says that she is as big as a house and young and well to look at which cant be all said of moll who though shes big enough in all conscience is neither young nor handsome well no sooner does he see me and mine than giving the reins to grey moll he springs out of his cart and comes straight at me not a word did he say but on he comes straight at me like a wild bull i am a quiet man young fellow but i saw now that quietness would be of no use so i sprang up upon my legs and being bred upon the roads and able to fight a little i squared as he came running in upon me and had a round or two with him lord bless you young man it was like a fly fighting with an elephantone of those big beasts the showfolks carry about i had not a chance with the fellow he knocked me here he knocked me there knocked me into the hedge and knocked me out again i was at my last shifts and my poor wife saw it now my poor wife though she is as gentle as a pigeon has yet a spirit of her own and though she wasnt bred upon the roads can scratch a little so when she saw me at my last shifts she flew at the villainshe couldnt bear to see her partner murderedand scratched the villains face lord bless you young man she had better have been quiet grey moll no sooner saw what she was about than springing out of the cart where she had sat all along perfectly quiet save a little whooping and screeching to encourage her bladegrey moll i say my flesh creeps when i think of itfor i am a kind husband and love my poor wife myselftake another draught of the ale you look frightened and it will do you good stout liquor makes stout heart as the man says in the play tinkerthats true young man heres to youwhere was i grey moll no sooner saw what my wife was about thanspringing out of the cart she flew at my poor wife clawed off her bonnet in a moment and seized hold of her hair lord bless you young man my poor wife in the hands of grey moll was nothing better than a pigeon in the claws of a buzzard hawk or i in the hands of the flaming tinman which when i saw my heart was fit to burst and i determined to give up everythingeverything to save my poor wife out of grey molls claws hold i shouted hold both of you jack moll hold both of you for gods sake and ill do what you will give up trade and business connection bread and everything never more travel the roads and go down on my knees to you in the bargain well this had some effect moll let go my wife and the blazing tinman stopped for a moment it was only for a moment however that he left offall of a sudden he hit me a blow which sent me against a tree and what did the villain then why the flying villain seized me by the throat and almost throttled me roaringwhat do you think young man that the flaming villain roared out myselfi really dont knowsomething horrible i suppose tinkerhorrible indeed you may well say horrible young man neither more nor less than the biblea bible a bible roared the blazing tinman and he pressed my throat so hard against the tree that my senses began to dwaul awaya bible a bible still ringing in my ears now young man my poor wife is a christian woman and though she travels the roads carries a bible with her at the bottom of her sack with which sometimes she teaches the children to readit was the only thing she brought with her from the place of her kith and kin save her own body and the clothes on her back so my poor wife half distracted runs to her sack pulls out the bible and puts it into the hand of the blazing tinman who then thrusts the end of it into my mouth with such fury that it made my lips bleed and broke short one of my teeth which happened to be decayed swear said he swear you mumping villain take your bible oath that you will quit and give up the beat altogether or illand then the hardhearted villain made me swear by the bible and my own damnation halfthrottled as i wastotoi cant go on myselftake another draughtstout liquor tinkeri cant young man my hearts too full and whats more the pitcher is empty myselfand so he swore you i suppose on the bible to quit the roads tinkeryou are right he did so the gypsy villain myselfgypsy is he a gypsy tinkernot exactly what they call a half and half his father was a gypsy and his mother like mine one who walked the roads myselfis he of the smithsthe petulengres tinkeri say young man you know a thing or two one would think to hear you talk you had been bred upon the roads i thought none but those bred upon the roads knew anything of that namepetulengres no not he he fights the petulengres whenever he meets them he likes nobody but himself and wants to be king of the roads i believe he is a boss or a at any rate hes a bad one as i know to my cost myselfand what are you going to do tinkerdo you may well ask that i dont know what to do my poor wife and i have been talking of that all the morning over that halfpint mug of beer we cant determine on whats to be done all we know is that we must quit the roads the villain swore that the next time he saw us on the roads hed cut all our throats and seize our horse and bit of cart that are now standing out there under the tree myselfand what do you mean to do with your horse and cart tinkeranother question what shall we do with our cart and pony they are of no use to us now stay on the roads i will not both for my oaths sake and my own if we had a trifle of money we were thinking of going to bristol where i might get up a little business but we have none our last three farthings we spent about the mug of beer myselfbut why dont you sell your horse and cart tinkersell them and who would buy them unless some one who wished to set up in my line but theres no beat and whats the use of the horse and cart and the few tools without the beat myselfim half inclined to buy your cart and pony and your beat too tinkeryou how came you to think of such a thingmyselfwhy like yourself i hardly know what to do i want a home and work as for a home i suppose i can contrive to make a home out of your tent and cart and as for work i must learn to be a tinker it would not be hard for one of my trade to learn to tinker what better can i do would you have me go to chester and work there now i dont like the thoughts of it if i go to chester and work there i cant be my own man i must work under a master and perhaps he and i should quarrel and when i quarrel i am apt to hit folks and those that hit folks are sometimes sent to prison i dont like the thought either of going to chester or to chester prison what do you think i could earn at chester tinkera matter of eleven shillings a week if anybody would employ you which i dont think they would with those hands of yours but whether they would or not if you are of a quarrelsome nature you must not go to chester you would be in the castle in no time i dont know how to advise you as for selling you my stock id see you farther first for your own sake myselfwhy tinkerwhy you would get your head knocked off suppose you were to meet him myselfpooh dont be afraid on my account if i were to meet him i could easily manage him one way or other i know all kinds of strange words and names and as i told you before i sometimes hit people when they put me out here the tinkers wife who for some minutes past had been listening attentively to our discourse interposed saying in a low soft tone i really dont see john why you shouldnt sell the young man the things seeing that he wishes for them and is so confident you have told him plainly how matters stand and if anything ill should befall him people couldnt lay the blame on you but i dont think any ill will befall him and who knows but god has sent him to our assistance in time of need ill hear of no such thing said the tinker i have drunk at the young mans expense and though he says hes quarrelsome i would not wish to sit in pleasanter company a pretty fellow i should be now if i were to let him follow his own will if he once sets up on my beat hes a lost man his ribs will be stove in and his head knocked off his shoulders there you are crying but you shant have your will though i wont be the young mans destructionif indeed i thought he could manage the tinkerbut he never can he says he can hit but its no use hitting the tinkercrying still you are enough to drive one mad i say young man i believe you understand a thing or two just now you were talking of knowing hard words and namesi dont wish to send you to your mischiefyou say you know hard words and names let us see only on one condition ill sell you the pony and things as for the beat its gone isnt minesworn away by my mouth tell me whats my name if you cant may i myselfdont swear its a bad habit neither pleasant nor profitable your name is slingsbyjack slingsby there dont stare theres nothing in my telling you your name ive been in these parts before at least not very far from here ten years ago when i was little more than a child i was about twenty miles from here in a post chaise at the door of an inn and as i looked from the window of the chaise i saw you standing by a gutter with a big tin ladle in your hand and somebody called you jack slingsby i never forget anything i hear or see i cant i wish i could so theres nothing strange in my knowing your name indeed theres nothing strange in anything provided you examine it to the bottom now what am i to give you for the things i paid slingsby five pounds ten shillings for his stock in trade cart and ponypurchased sundry provisions of the landlady also a wagoners frock which had belonged to a certain son of hers deceased gave my little animal a feed of corn and prepared to depart god bless you young man said slingsby shaking me by the hand you are the best friend ive had for many a day i have but one thing to tell you dont cross that fellows path if you can help it and stayshould the pony refuse to go just touch him so and hell fly like the windchapter lxix effects of cornone night longerthe hoofsa stumbleare you hurtwhat a differencedrowsymaze of busheshousekeepingsticks and furzethe driftwayaccount of stockanvil and bellowstwenty years it was two or three hours past noon when i took my departure from the place of the last adventure walking by the side of my little cart the pony invigorated by the corn to which he was probably not much accustomed proceeded right gallantly so far from having to hasten him forward by the particular application which the tinker had pointed out to me i had rather to repress his eagerness being though an excellent pedestrian not unfrequently left behind the country through which i passed was beautiful and interesting but solitary few habitations appeared as it was quite a matter of indifference to me in what direction i went the whole world being before me i allowed the pony to decide upon the matter it was not long before he left the high road being probably no friend to public places i followed him i knew not whither but from subsequent observation have reason to suppose that our course was in a northwest direction at length night came upon us and a cold wind sprang up which was succeeded by a drizzling rain i had originally intended to pass the night in the cart or to pitch my little tent on some convenient spot by the roads side but owing to the alteration in the weather i thought that it would be advisable to take up my quarters in any hedge alehouse at which i might arrive to tell the truth i was not very sorry to have an excuse to pass the night once more beneath a roof i had determined to live quite independent but i had never before passed a night by myself abroad and felt a little apprehensive at the idea i hoped however on the morrow to be a little more prepared for the step so i determined for one nightonly for one night longerto sleep like a christian but human determinations are not always put into effect such a thing as opportunity is frequently wanting such was the case here i went on for a considerable time in expectation of coming to some rustic hostelry but nothing of the kind presented itself to my eyes the country in which i now was seemed almost uninhabited not a house of any kind was to be seenat least i saw nonethough it is true houses might be near without my seeing them owing to the darkness of the night for neither moon nor star was abroad i heard occasionally the bark of dogs but the sound appeared to come from an immense distance the rain still fell and the ground beneath my feet was wet and miry in short it was a night in which even a tramper by profession would feel more comfortable in being housed than abroad i followed in the rear of the cart the pony still proceeding at a sturdy pace till methought i heard other hoofs than those of my own nag i listened for a moment and distinctly heard the sound of hoofs approaching at a great rate and evidently from the quarter towards which i and my little caravan were moving we were in a dark laneso dark that it was impossible for me to see my own hand apprehensive that some accident might occur i ran forward and seizing the pony by the bridle drew him as near as i could to the hedge on came the hoofstrot trot trot and evidently more than those of one horse their speed as they advanced appeared to slackenit was only however for a moment i heard a voice cry push onthis is a desperate robbing placenever mind the dark and the hoofs came on quicker than before stop said i at the top of my voice stop or before i could finish what i was about to say there was a stumble a heavy fall a cry and a groan and putting out my foot i felt what i conjectured to be the head of a horse stretched upon the road lord have mercy upon us whats the matter exclaimed a voice spare my life cried another voice apparently from the ground only spare my life and take all i have where are you master wise cried the other voice help here master bat cried the voice from the ground help me up or i shall be murdered why whats the matter said bat some one has knocked me down and is robbing me said the voice from the ground help murder cried bat and regardless of the entreaties of the man on the ground that he would stay and help him up he urged his horse forward and galloped away as fast as he could i remained for some time quiet listening to various groans and exclamations uttered by the person on the ground at length i said holloa are you hurt spare my life and take all i have said the voice from the ground have they not done robbing you yet said i when they have finished let me know and i will come and help you who is that said the voice pray come and help me and do me no mischief you were saying that some one was robbing you said i dont think i shall come till he is gone away then you bent he said the voice arnt you robbed said i cant say i be said the voice not yet at any rate but who are you i dont know you a traveller whom you and your partner were going to run over in this dark lane you almost frightened me out of my senses frightened said the voice in a louder tone frightened oh and thereupon i heard somebody getting upon his legs this accomplished the individual proceeded to attend to his horse and with a little difficulty raised him upon his legs also arnt you hurt said i hurt said the voice not i dont think it whatever the horse may be i tell you what my fellow i thought you were a robber and now i find you are not i have a good mind to do what to serve you out arnt you ashamed at what said i not to have robbed you shall i set about it now ha ha said the man dropping the bullying tone which he had assumed you are jokingrobbing who talks of robbing i wonder how my horses knees are not much hurt i think only mired the man whoever he was then got upon his horse and after moving him about a little said good night friend where are you here i am said i just behind you you are are you take that i know not what he did but probably pricking his horse with the spur the animal kicked out violently one of his heels struck me on the shoulder but luckily missed my face i fell back with the violence of the blow whilst the fellow scampered off at a great rate stopping at some distance he loaded me with abuse and then continuing his way at a rapid trot i heard no more of himwhat a difference said i getting up last night i was fêted in the hall of a rich genius and tonight i am knocked down and mired in a dark lane by the heel of master wises horsei wonder who gave him that name and yet he was wise enough to wreak his revenge upon me and i was not wise enough to keep out of his way well i am not much hurt so it is of little consequence i now bethought me that as i had a carriage of my own i might as well make use of it i therefore got into the cart and taking the reins in my hand gave an encouraging cry to the pony whereupon the sturdy little animal started again at as brisk a pace as if he had not already come many a long mile i lay half reclining in the cart holding the reins lazily and allowing the animal to go just where he pleased often wondering where he would conduct me at length i felt drowsy and my head sank upon my breast i soon aroused myself but it was only to doze again this occurred several times opening my eyes after a doze somewhat longer than the others i found that the drizzling rain had ceased a corner of the moon was apparent in the heavens casting a faint light i looked around for a moment or two but my eyes and brain were heavy with slumber and i could scarcely distinguish where we were i had a kind of dim consciousness that we were traversing an uninclosed countryperhaps a heath i thought however that i saw certain large black objects looming in the distance which i had a confused idea might be woods or plantations the pony still moved at his usual pace i did not find the jolting of the cart at all disagreeable on the contrary it had quite a somniferous effect upon me again my eyes closed i opened them once more but with less perception in them than before looked forward and muttering something about woodlands i placed myself in an easier posture than i had hitherto done and fairly fell asleep how long i continued in that state i am unable to say but i believe for a considerable time i was suddenly awakened by the ceasing of the jolting to which i had become accustomed and of which i was perfectly sensible in my sleep i started up and looked around me the moon was still shining and the face of the heaven was studded with stars i found myself amidst a haze of bushes of various kinds but principally hazel and holly through which was a path or driftway with grass growing on either side upon which the pony was already diligently browsing i conjectured that this place had been one of the haunts of his former master and on dismounting and looking about was strengthened in that opinion by finding a spot under an ash tree which from its burnt and blackened appearance seemed to have been frequently used as a fireplace i will take up my quarters here thought i it is an excellent spot for me to commence my new profession in i was quite right to trust myself to the guidance of the pony unharnessing the animal without delay i permitted him to browse at free will on the grass convinced that he would not wander far from a place to which he was so much attached i then pitched the little tent close beside the ash tree to which i have alluded and conveyed two or three articles into it and instantly felt that i had commenced housekeeping for the first time in my life housekeeping however without a fire is a very sorry affair something like the housekeeping of children in their toy houses of this i was the more sensible from feeling very cold and shivering owing to my late exposure to the rain and sleeping in the night air collecting therefore all the dry sticks and furze i could find i placed them upon the fireplace adding certain chips and a billet which i found in the cart it having apparently been the habit of slingsby to carry with him a small store of fuel having then struck a spark in a tinderbox and lighted a match i set fire to the combustible heap and was not slow in raising a cheerful blaze i then drew my cart near the fire and seating myself on one of the shafts hung over the warmth with feelings of intense pleasure and satisfaction having continued in the posture for a considerable time i turned my eyes to the heaven in the direction of a particular star i however could not find the star nor indeed many of the starry train the greater number having fled from which circumstance and from the appearance of the sky i concluded that morning was nigh about this time i again began to feel drowsy i therefore arose and having prepared for myself a kind of couch in the tent i flung myself upon it and went to sleep i will not say that i was awakened in the morning by the carolling of birds as i perhaps might if i were writing a novel i awoke because to use vulgar language i had slept my sleep out not because the birds were carolling around me in numbers as they had probably been for hours without my hearing them i got up and left my tent the morning was yet more bright than that of the preceding day impelled by curiosity i walked about endeavouring to ascertain to what place chance or rather the pony had brought me following the driftway for some time amidst bushes and stunted trees i came to a grove of dark pines through which it appeared to lead i tracked it a few hundred yards but seeing nothing but trees and the way being wet and sloughy owing to the recent rain i returned on my steps and pursuing the path in another direction came to a sandy road leading over a common doubtless the one i had traversed the preceding night my curiosity satisfied i returned to my little encampment and on the way beheld a small footpath on the left winding through the bushes which had before escaped my observation having reached my tent and cart i breakfasted on some of the provisions which i had procured the day before and then proceeded to take a regular account of the stock formerly possessed by slingsby the tinker but now become my own by right of lawful purchase besides the pony the cart and the tent i found i was possessed of a mattress stuffed with straw on which to lie and a blanket to cover me the last quite clean and nearly new then there was a frying pan and a kettle the first for cooking any food which required cooking and the second for heating any water which i might wish to heat i likewise found an earthen teapot and two or three cups of the first i should rather say i found the remains it being broken in three parts no doubt since it came into my possession which would have precluded the possibility of my asking anybody to tea for the present should anybody visit me even supposing i had tea and sugar which was not the case i then overhauled whatmight more strictly be called the stock in trade this consisted of various tools an iron ladle a chafing pan and small bellows sundry pans and kettles the latter being of tin with the exception of one which was of copper all in a state of considerable dilapidationif i may use the term of these first slingsby had spoken in particular advising me to mend them as soon as possible and to endeavour to sell them in order that i might have the satisfaction of receiving some return upon the outlay which i had made there was likewise a small quantity of block tin sheet tin and solder this slingsby said i is certainly a very honest man he has sold me more than my moneys worth i believe however there is something more in the cart thereupon i rummaged the farther end of the cart and amidst a quantity of straw i found a small anvil and bellows of that kind which are used in forges and two hammers such as smiths use one great and the other small the sight of these last articles caused me no little surprise as no word which had escaped from the mouth of slingsby have given me reason to suppose that he had ever followed the occupation of a smith yet if he had not how did he come by them i sat down upon the shaft and pondered the question deliberately in my mind at length i concluded that he had come by them by one of those numerous casualties which occur upon the roads of which i being a young hand upon the roads must have a very imperfect conception honestly of coursefor i scouted the idea that slingsby would have stolen this blacksmiths gearfor i had the highest opinion of his honesty which opinion i still retain at the present day which is upwards of twenty years from the time of which i am speaking during the whole of which period i have neither seen the poor fellow nor received any intelligence of himchapter lxx new professionbeautiful nightjupitersharp and shrillthe rommany chiall alonethree and sixpence what is rommanybe civilparraco tuteslight startshe will be gratefulthe rustling i passed the greater part of the day in endeavouring to teach myself the mysteries of my new profession i cannot say that i was very successful but the time passed agreeably and was therefore not ill spent towards evening i flung my work aside took some refreshment and afterwards a walk this time i turned up the small footpath of which i have already spoken it led in a zigzag manner through thickets of hazel elder and sweet briar after following its windings for somewhat better than a furlong i heard a gentle sound of water and presently came to a small rill which ran directly across the path i was rejoiced at the sight for i had already experienced the want of water which i yet knew must be nigh at hand as i was in a place to all appearance occasionally frequented by wandering people who i was aware never take up their quarters in places where water is difficult to be obtained forthwith i stretched myself on the ground and took a long and delicious draught of the crystal stream and then seating myself in a bush i continued for some time gazing on the water as it purled tinkling away in its channel through an opening in the hazels and should have probably continued much longer had not the thought that i had left my property unprotected compelled me to rise and return to my encampment night came on and a beautiful night it was up rose the moon and innumerable stars decked the firmament of heaven i sat on the shaft my eyes turned upwards i had found it there it was twinkling millions of miles above me mightiest star of the system to which we belong of all stars the one which has the most interest for methe star jupiter why have i always taken an interest in thee o jupiter i know nothing about thee save what every child knows that thou art a big star whose only light is derived from moons and is not that knowledge enough to make me feel an interest in thee ay truly i never look at thee without wondering what is going on in thee what is life in jupiter that there is life in jupiter who can doubt there is life in our own little star therefore there must be life in jupiter which is not a little star but how different must life be in jupiter from what it is in our own little star life here is life beneath the dear sun life in jupiter is life beneath moonsfour moonsno single moon is able to illumine that vast bulk all know what life is in our own little star it is anything but a routine of happiness here where the dear sun rises to us every day then how sad and moping must life be in mighty jupiter on which no sun ever shines and which is never lighted save by pale moonbeams the thought that there is more sadness and melancholy in jupiter than in this world of ours where alas there is but too much has always made me take a melancholy interest in that huge distant star two or three days passed by in much the same manner as the first during the morning i worked upon my kettles and employed the remaining part of the day as i best could the whole of this time i only saw two individuals rustics who passed by my encampment without vouchsafing me a glance they probably considered themselves my superiors as perhaps they were one very brilliant morning as i sat at work in very good spirits for by this time i had actually mended in a very creditable way as i imagined two kettles and a frying pan i heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the path leading to the rivulet at first it sounded from a considerable distance but drew nearer by degrees i soon remarked that the tones were exceedingly sharp and shrill with yet something of childhood in them once or twice i distinguished certain words in the song which the voice was singing the words werebut no i thought again i was probably mistakenand then the voice ceased for a time presently i heard it again close to the entrance of the footpath in another moment i heard it in the lane or glade in which stood my tent where it abruptly stopped but not before i had heard the very words which i at first thought i had distinguished i turned my head at the entrance of the footpath which might be about thirty yards from the place where i was sitting i perceived the figure of a young girl her face was turned towards me and she appeared to be scanning me and my encampment after a little time she looked in the other direction only for a moment however probably observing nothing in that quarter she again looked towards me and almost immediately stepped forward and as she advanced sang the song which i had heard in the wood the first words of which were those which i have already alluded to the rommany chi and the rommany chal shall jaw tasaulor to drab the bawlor and dook the gry of the farming rye a very pretty song thought i falling again hard to work upon my kettle a very pretty song which bodes the farmers much good let them look to their cattleall alone here brother said a voice close by me in sharp but not disagreeable tones i made no answer but continued my work click click with the gravity which became one of my profession i allowed at least half a minute to elapse before i even lifted up my eyes a girl of about thirteen was standing before me her features were very pretty but with a peculiar expression her complexion was a clear olive and her jet black hair hung back upon her shoulders she was rather scantily dressed and her arms and feet were bare round her neck however was a handsome string of corals with ornaments of gold in her hand she held a bulrush all alone here brother said the girl as i looked up all alone here in the lane where are your wife and children why do you call me brother said i i am no brother of yours do you take me for one of your people i am no gypsy not i indeed dont be afraid brother you are no

that is i thank you brother the rikkeni kekaubi is now mine o rare i thank you kindly brother starting up she flung the bulrush aside which she had hitherto held in her hand and seizing the kettle she looked at it for a moment and then began a kind of dance flourishing the kettle over her head the while and singing the rommany chi and the rommany chal shall jaw tasaulor to drab the bawlor and dook the gry of the farming rye good by brother i must be going good by sister why do you sing that wicked song wicked song hey brother you dont understand the song ha ha gypsy daughter said i starting up

lachipen and tatchipen the girl who had given a slight start when i began remained for some time after i had concluded the song standing motionless as a statue with the kettle in her hand at length she came towards me and stared me full in the face grey tall and talks rommany said she to herself in her countenance there was an expression which i had not seen before an expression which struck me as being composed of fear curiosity and the deepest hate it was momentary however and was succeeded by one smiling frank and open ha ha brother said she well i like you all the better for talkingrommany it is a sweet language isnt it especially as you sing it how did you pick it up but you picked it up upon the roads no doubt ha it was funny in you to pretend not to know it and you so flush with it all the time it was not kind in you however to frighten the poor persons child so by screaming out but it was kind in you to give the rikkeni kekaubi to the child of the poor person she will be grateful to you she will bring you her little dog to show you her pretty juggal the poor persons child will come and see you again you are not going away today i hope or tomorrow pretty

tall brother said the girl as she departed singing the rommany chi etc theres something about that girl that i dont understand said i to myself something mysterious however it is nothing to me she knows not who i am and if she did what then late that evening as i sat on the shaft of my cart in deep meditation with my arms folded i thought i heard a rustling in the bushes over against me i turned my eyes in that direction but saw nothing some bird said i an owl perhaps and once more i fell into meditation my mind wandered from one thing to anothermusing now on the structure of the roman tonguenow on the rise and fall of the persian powerand now on the powers vested in recorders at quarter sessions i was thinking what a fine thing it must be to be a recorder of the peace when lifting up my eyes i saw right opposite not a culprit at the bar but staring at me through a gap in the bush a face wild and strange half covered with grey hair i only saw it a moment the next it had

sacramentheavy heart song of poisondrow of gypsiesthe dogelys churchget up bebeethe vehiclecan you speakthe oil the next day at an early hour i harnessed my little pony and putting my things in my cart i went on my projected stroll crossing the moor i arrived in about an hour at a small village from which after a short stay i proceeded to another and from thence to a third i found that the name of slingsby was well known in these parts if you are a friend of slingsby you must be an honest lad said an ancient crone you shall never want for work whilst i can give it you here take my kettle the bottom came out this morning and lend me that of yours till you bring it back im not afraid to trust younot i dont hurry yourself young man if you dont come back for a fortnight i shant have the worse opinion of you i returned to my quarters at evening tired but rejoiced at heart i had work before me for several days having collected various kekaubies which required mending in place of those which i left behindthose which i had been employed upon during the last few days i found all quiet in the lane or glade and unharnessing my little horse i once more pitched my tent in the old spot beneath the ash lighted my fire ate my frugal meal and then after looking for some time at the heavenly bodies and more particularly at the star jupiter i entered my tent lay down upon my pallet and went to sleep nothing occurred on the following day which requires any particular notice nor indeed on the one succeeding that it was about noon on the third day that i sat beneath the shade of the ash tree i was not at work for the weather was particularly hot and i felt but little inclination to make any exertion leaning my back against the tree i was not long in falling into a slumber i particularly remember that slumber of mine beneath the ash tree for it was about the sweetest slumber that i ever enjoyed how long i continued in it i do not know i could almost have wished that it had lasted to the present time all of a sudden it appeared to me that a voice cried in my ear danger danger danger nothing seemingly could be more distinct than the words which i heard then an uneasy sensation came over me which i strove to get rid of and at last succeeded for i awoke the gypsy girl was standing just opposite to me with her eyes fixed upon my countenance a singular kind of little dog stood beside her ha said i was it you that cried danger what danger is there danger brother there is no danger what danger should there be i called to my little dog but that was in the wood my little dogs name is not danger but stranger what danger should there be brother what indeed except in sleeping beneath a tree what is that you have got in your hand something for you said the girl sitting down and proceeding to untie a white napkin a pretty manricli so sweet so nice when i went home to my people i told my grandbebee how kind you had been to the poor persons child and when my grandbebee saw the kekaubi she said hir mi devlis it wont do for the poor people to be ungrateful by my god i will bake a cake for the young harko mescro but there are two cakes yes brother two cakes both for you my grandbebee meant them both for youbut list brother i will have one of them for bringing them i know you will give me one pretty brother greyhaired brotherwhich shall i have brother in the napkin were two round cakes seemingly made of rich and costly compounds and precisely similar in form each weighing about half a pound which shall i have brother said the gypsy girl whichever you please no brother no the cakes are yours not mine it is for you to say well then give me the one nearest you and take the other yes brother yes said the girl and taking the cakes she flung them into the air two or three times catching them as they fell and singing the while pretty brother greyhaired brotherhere brother said she here is your cake this other is mineare you sure said i taking the cake that this

well brother how do you like it said the girl looking fixedly at me it is very rich and sweet and yet there is something strange about it i dont think i shall eat any more fie brother fie to find fault with the poor persons cake see i have nearly eaten mine thats a pretty little dog is it not brother thats my juggal my little sister as i call her come here juggal said i to the animal what do you want with my juggal said the girl only to give her a piece of cake said i offering the dog a piece which i had just broken off what do you mean said the girl snatching the dog away my grandbebees

handsome brother greyhaired brother i will not eat any more i have already eaten more than i wished to oblige you if you must go good day to you the girl rose upon her feet looked hard at me then at the remainder of the cake which i held in my hand and then at me again and then stood for a moment or two as if in deep thought presently an air of satisfaction came over her countenance she smiled and said well brother well do as you please i merely wished you to eat because you have been so kind to the poor persons child she loves you so that she could have wished to have seen you eat it all good by brother i dare say when i am gone you will eat some more of it and if you dont i dare say you have eaten enough to toshow your love for us after all it was a poor persons cake a rommany manricli and all you gorgios are somewhat gorgious farewell brother pretty brother greyhaired brother come juggal i remained under the ash tree seated on the grass for a minute or two and endeavoured to resume the occupation in which i had been engaged before i fell asleep but i felt no inclination for labour i then thought i would sleep again and once more reclined against the tree and slumbered for some little time but my sleep was more agitated than beforesomething appeared to bear heavy on my breast i struggled in my sleep fell on the grass and awoke my temples were throbbing there was a burning in my eyes and my mouth felt parched the oppression about the chest which i had felt in my sleep still continued i must shake off these feelings said i and get upon my legs i walked rapidly up and down upon the green sward at length feeling my thirst increase i directed my steps down the narrow path to the spring which ran amidst the bushes arriving there i knelt down and drank of the water but on lifting up my head i felt thirstier than before again i drank but with the like results i was about to drink for the third time when i felt a dreadful qualm which instantly robbed me of nearly all my strength what can be the matter with me thought i but i suppose i have made myself ill by drinking cold water i got up and made the best of my way back to my tent before i reached it the qualm had seized me again and i was deadly sick i flung myself on my pallet qualm succeeded qualm but in the intervals my mouth was dry and burning and i felt a frantic desire to drink but no water was at hand and to reach the spring once more was impossible the qualms continued deadly pains shot through my whole frame i could bear my agonies no longer and i fell into a trance or swoon how long i continued therein i know not on recovering however i felt somewhat better and attempted to lift my head off my couch the next moment however the qualms and pains returned if possible with greater violence than before i am dying thought i like a dog without any help and then methought i heard a sound at a distance like people singing and then once more i relapsed into my swoon i revived just as a heavy blow sounded upon the canvas of the tent i started but my condition did not permit me to rise again the same kind of blow sounded upon the canvas i thought for a moment of crying out and requesting assistance but an inexplicable something chained my tongue and now i heard a whisper on the outside of the tent he does not move bebee said a voice which i knew i should not wonder if it has done for him already however strike again with your ran and then there was another blow after which another voice cried aloud in a strange tone is the gentleman of the house asleep or is he taking his dinner i remained quite silent and motionless and in another moment the voice continued what no answer what can the gentleman of the house be about that he makes no answer perhaps the gentleman of the house may be darning his stockings thereupon a face peered into the door of the tent at the farther extremity of which i was stretched it was that of a woman but owing to the posture in which she stood with her back to the light and partly owing to a large straw bonnet i could distinguish but very little of the features of her countenance i had however recognised her voice it was that of my old acquaintance mrs herne ho ho sir said she here you are come here leonora said she to the gypsy girl who pressed in at the other side of the door here is the gentleman not asleep but only stretched out after dinner sit down on your ham child at the door i shall do the same thereyou have seen me before sir have you not the gentleman makes no answer bebee perhaps he does not know you i have known him of old leonora said mrs herne and to tell you the truth though i spoke to him just now i expected no answer its a way he has bebee i suppose yes child its a way he has take off your bonnet bebee perhaps he cannot see your face i do not think that will be of much use child however i will take off my bonnetthereand shake out my hairthere you have seen this hair before sir and this face no

the house god grant that i may preserve my temper do you know sir my name my name is herne which signifies a hairy individual though neither greyhaired nor wrinkled it is not the nature of the hernes to be grey or wrinkled even when they are old and i am not old how old are you bebee sixtyfive years childan inconsiderable number my mother was a hundred and onea considerable agewhen she died yet she had not one grey hair and not more than six wrinklesan inconsiderable number she had no griefs bebeeplenty child but not like mine not quite so hard to bear bebee no child my head wanders when i think of them after the death of my husband who came to his end untimeously i went to live with a daughter of mine married out among certain romans who walk about the eastern counties and with whom for some time i found a home and pleasant society for they lived right romanly which gave my heart considerable satisfaction who am a roman born and hope to die so when i say right romanly i mean that they kept to themselves and were not much given to blabbing about their private matters in promiscuous company well things went on in this way for some time when one day my soninlaw brings home a young gorgio of singular and outrageous ugliness and without much preamble says to me and mine this is my pal ant he a beauty fall down and worship him hold said i i for one will never consent to such foolishness that was right bebee i think i should have done the same i think you would child but what was the profit of it the whole party makes an almighty of this gorgio lets him into their ways says prayers of his making till things come to such a pass that my own daughter says to me i shall buy myself a veil and fan and treat myself to a play and sacrament dont says i says she i should like for once in my life to be courtesied to as a christian gentlewoman very foolish of her bebee wasnt it child where was i at the fan and sacrament with a heavy heart i put seven score miles between us came back to the hairy ones and found them overgiven to gorgious companions said i foolish manners is catching all this comes of that there gorgio answers the child leonora take comfort bebee i hate the gorgios as much as you do and i say so again bebee as much or more time flows on i engage in many matters in most miscarry am sent to prison says i to myself i am become foolish am turned out of prison and go back to the hairy ones who receive me not over courteously says i for their unkindness and my own foolishness all the thanks to that gorgio answers to me the child i wish i could set my eyes upon him bebee i did so bebee go on how shall i know him bebee says the child young and grey tall and speaks romanly runs to me the child and says ive found him bebee where child says i come with me bebee says the child thats he says i as i looked at my gentleman through the hedge ha ha bebee and here he lies poisoned like a hog you have taken drows sir said mrs herne do you hear sir drows tip him a stave child of the song of poison and thereupon the girl clapped her hands and sang the rommany churl and the rommany girl tomorrow shall hie to poison the sty and bewitch on the mead the farmers steed do you hear that sir said mrs herne the child has tipped you a stave of the song of poison that is she has sung it christianly though perhaps you would like to hear it romanly you were always fond of what was roman tip it him romanly child he has heard it romanly already bebee twas by that i found him out as i told you halloo sir are you sleeping you have taken drows the gentleman makes no answer god give me patience and what if he doesnt bebee isnt he poisoned like a hog gentleman indeed why call him gentleman if he ever was one hes broke and is now a tinker and a worker of

lets leave him hes as good as gone look there hes dead no hes not hell get upi feel it cant we hasten him hasten him yes to be sure set the dog upon him here juggal look in there my dog the dog made its appearance at the door of the tent and began to bark and tear up the ground at him juggal at him he wished to poison to drab you halloo the dog barked violently and seemed about to spring at my face but retreated the dog wont fly at him child he flashed at the dog with his eye and scared him hell get up nonsense bebee you make me angry how should he get up the dook tells me so and whats more i had a dream i thought i was at york standing amidst a crowd to see a man hung and the crowd shouted there he comes and i looked and lo it was the tinker before i could cry with joy i was whisked away and i found myself in elys big church which was chock full of people to hear the dean preach and all eyes were turned to the big pulpit and presently i heard them say there he mounts and i looked up to the big pulpit and lo the tinker was in the pulpit and he raised his arm and began to preach anon i found myself at york again just as the drop fell and i looked up and i saw not the tinker but my own self hanging in the air you are going mad bebee if you want to hasten him take your stick and poke him in the eye that will be of no use child the dukkerin tells me so but i will try what i can do halloo tinker you must introduce yourself into a quiet family and raise confusionmust you you must steal its language and what was never done before write it down christianlymust you take thatand that and she stabbed violently with her stick towards the end of the tent thats right bebee you struck his face now once more and let it be in the eye stay whats that get up bebee whats the matter child some one is coming come away let me make sure of him child hell be up yet and thereupon mrs herne rising leaned forward into the tent and supporting herself against the pole took aim in the direction of the farther end i will thrust out his eye said she and lunging with her stick she would probably have accomplished her purpose had not at that moment the pole of the tent given way whereupon she fell to the ground the canvas falling upon her and her intended victim heres a pretty affair bebee screamed the girl hell get up yet said mrs herne from beneath the canvas get upget up yourself where are you where is yourhere there bebee heres the door there make haste theyare coming hell get up yet said mrs herne recovering her breath the dook tells me so never mind him or the dook he is drabbed come away or we shall be grabbedboth of us one more blow i know where his head lies you are mad bebee leave the fellowgorgio avella and thereupon the females hurried away a vehicle of some kind was evidently drawing nigh in a little time it came alongside of the place where lay the fallen tent and stopped suddenly there was a silence for a moment and then a parley ensued between two voices one of which was that of a woman it was not in english but in a deep guttural tongue peth yw hono sydd yn gorwedd yna ar y ddaear said a masculine voice yn wirioneddi do not know what it can be said the female voice in the same tongue here is a cart and there are tools but what is that on the ground something moves beneath it and what was thata groan shall i get down of course peter some one may want your help then i will get down though i do not like this place it is frequented by egyptians and i do not like their yellow faces nor their clibberty clabber as master ellis wyn says now i am down it is a tent winifred and see here is a boy beneath it merciful father what a face a middleaged man with a strongly marked and serious countenance dressed in sobercoloured habiliments had lifted up the stifling folds of the tent and was bending over me can you speak my lad said he in english what is the matter with you if you could but tell me i could perhaps help you what is it that you say i cant hear you i will kneel down and he flung himself on the ground and placed his ear close to my mouth now speak if you can hey what no sure god forbid then starting up he cried to a female who sat in the cart anxiously looking ongwenwyn gwenwyn yw y gwas wedi ei gwenwynaw the oil winifred the oil chapter lxxii desired effectthe three oakswinifredthings of timewith gods willthe preachercreature comforts croesawwelsh and englishmayor of chester the oil which the strangers compelled me to take produced the desired effect though during at least two hours it was very doubtful whether or not my life would be saved at the end of that period the man said that with the blessing of god he would answer for my life he then demanded whether i thought i could bear to be removed from the place in which we were for i like it not he continued as something within me tells me that it is not good for any of us to be here i told him as well as i was able that i too should be glad to leave the place whereupon after collecting my things he harnessed my pony and with the assistance of the woman he contrived to place me in the cart he then gave me a draught out of a small phial and we set forward at a slow pace the man walking by the side of the cart in which i lay it is probable that the draught consisted of a strong opiate for after swallowing it i fell into a deep slumber on my awaking i found that the shadows of night had enveloped the earthwe were still moving on shortly however after descending a declivity we turned into a lane at the entrance of which was a gate this lane conducted to a meadow through the middle of which ran a small brook it stood between two rising grounds that on the left which was on the farther side of the water was covered with wood whilst the one on the right which was not so high was crowned with the white walls of what appeared to be a farmhouse advancing along the meadow we presently came to a place where grew three immense oaks almost on the side of the brook over which they flung their arms so as to shade it as with a canopy the ground beneath was bare of grass and nearly as hard and smooth as the floor of a barn having led his own cart on one side of the midmost tree and my own on the other the stranger said to me this is the spot where my wife and myself generally tarry in the summer season when we come into these parts we are about to pass the night here i suppose you will have no objection to do the same indeed i do not see what else you could do under present circumstances after receiving my answer in which i of course expressed my readiness to assent to his proposal he proceeded to unharness his horse and feeling myself much better i got down and began to make the necessary preparations for passing the night beneath the oak whilst thus engaged i felt myself touched on the shoulder and looking round perceived the woman whom the stranger called winifred standing close to me the moon was shining brightly upon her and i observed that she was very goodlooking with a composed yet cheerful expression of countenance her dress was plain and primitive very much resembling that of a quaker she held a straw bonnet in her hand i am glad to see thee moving about young man said she in a soft placid tone i could scarcely have expected it thou must be wondrous strong many after what thou hast suffered would not have stood on their feet for weeks or months what do i saypeter my husband who is skilled in medicine just now told me that not one in five hundred would have survived what thou hast this day undergone but allow me to ask thee one thing hast thou returned thanks to god for thy deliverance i made no answer and the woman after a pause said excuse me young man but do you know anything of god very little i replied but i should say he must be a wondrous strong person if he made all those big bright things up above there to say nothing of the ground on which we stand which bears beings like these oaks each of which is fifty times as strong as myself and will live twenty times as long the woman was silent for some moments and then said i scarcely know in what spirit thy words are uttered if thou art serious however i would caution thee against supposing that the power of god is more manifested in these trees or even in those bright stars above us than in thyselfthey are things of time but thou art a being destined to an eternity it depends upon thyself whether thy eternity shall be one of joy or sorrow here she was interrupted by the man who exclaimed from the other side of the tree winifred it is getting late you had better go up to the house on the hill to inform our friends of our arrival or they will have retired for the night true said winifred and forthwith wended her way to the house in question returning shortly with another woman whom the man speaking in the same language which i had heard him first use greeted by the name of mary the woman replied in the same tongue but almost immediately said in english we hoped to have heard you speak tonight peter but we cannot expect that now seeing that it is so late owing to your having been detained by the way as winifred tells me nothing remains for you to do now but to suptomorrow with gods will we shall hear you and tonight also with gods will providing you be so disposed let those of your family come hither they will be hither presently said mary for knowing that thou art arrived they will of course come and bid thee welcome and scarcely had she spoke when i beheld a party of people descending the moonlit side of the hill they soon arrived at the place where we were they might amount in all to twelve individuals the principal person was a tall athletic man of about forty dressed like a plain country farmer this was i soon found the husband of mary the rest of the group consisted of the children of these two and their domestic servants one after another they all shook peter by the hand men and women boys and girls and expressed their joy at seeing him after which he said now friends if you please i will speak a few words to you a stool was then brought him from the cart which he stepped on and the people arranging themselves round him some standing some seated on the ground he forthwith began to address them in a clear distinct voice and the subject of his discourse was the necessity in all human beings of a change of heart the preacher was better than his promise for instead of speaking a few words he preached for at least three quartersof an hour none of the audience however showed the slightest symptom of weariness on the contrary the hope of each individual appeared to hang upon the words which proceeded from his mouth at the conclusion of the sermon or discourse the whole assembly again shook peter by the hand and returned to their house the mistress of the family saying as she departed i shall soon be back peter i go but to make arrangements for the supper of thyself and company and in effect she presently returned attended by a young woman who bore a tray in her hands set it down jessy said the mistress to the girl and then betake thyself to thy rest i shall remain here for a little time to talk with my friends the girl departed and the preacher and the two females placed themselves on the ground about the tray the man gave thanks and himself and his wife appeared to be about to eat when the latter suddenly placed her hand upon his arm and said something to him in a low voice whereupon he exclaimed ay truly we were both forgetful and then getting up he came towards me who stood a little way off leaning against the wheel of my cart and taking me by the hand he said pardon us young man we were both so engaged in our own creaturecomforts that we forgot thee but it is not too late to repair our fault wilt thou not join us and taste our bread and milk i cannot eat i replied but i think i could drink a little milk whereupon he led me to the rest and seating me by his side he poured some milk into a horn cup saying croesaw that added he with a smile is welsh for welcome the fare upon the tray was of the simplest description consisting of bread cheese milk and curds my two friends partook with a good appetite mary said the preacher addressing himself to the woman of the house every time i come to visit thee i find thee less inclined to speak welsh i suppose in a little time thou wilt entirely have forgotten it hast thou taught it to any of thy children the two eldest understand a few words said the woman but my husband does not wish them to learn it he says sometimes jocularly that though it pleased him to marry a welsh wife it does not please him to have welsh children who i have heard him say would be a welshman if he could be an englishman i for one said the preacher somewhat hastily not to be king of all england would i give up my birthright as a welshman your husband is an excellent person mary but i am afraid he is somewhat prejudiced you do him justice peter in saying that he is an excellent person said the woman as to being prejudiced i scarcely know what to say but he thinks that two languages in the same kingdom are almost as bad as two kings thats no bad observation said the preacher and it is generally the case yet thank god the welsh and english go on very well side by side and i hope will do so till the almighty calls all men to their long account they jog on very well now said the woman but i have heard my husband say that it was not always so and that the welsh in old times were a violent and ferocious people for that once they hanged the mayor of chester ha ha said the preacher and his eyes flashed in the moonlight he told you that did he yes said mary once when the mayor of chester with some of his people was present at one of the fairs over the border a quarrel arose between the welsh and english and the welsh beat the english and hanged the mayor your husband is a clever man said peter and knows a great deal did he tell you the name of the leader of the welsh no then i will the leader of the welsh on that occasion was he was a powerful chieftain and there was an old feud between him and the men of chester afterwards when two hundred of the men of chester invaded his country to take revenge for their mayor he enticed them into a tower set fire to it and burnt them all that was a very fine noblegod forgive me what was i about to saya very bad violent man but mary this is very carnal and unprofitable conversation and in holding it we set a very bad example to the young man herelet us change the subject they then began to talk on religious matters at length mary departed to her abode and the preacher and his wife retired to their tilted cart poor fellow he seems to be almost brutally ignorant said peter addressing his wife in their own native language after they had bidden me farewell for the night i am afraid he is said winifred yet my heart warms to the poor lad he seems so forlornchapter lxxiii morning hymnmuch alonejohn bunyanbeholden to nobodysixtyfivesober greetingearly sabbaths finny broodthe porchno

was awakened by the voices of peter and his wife who were singing a morning hymn in their own language both subsequently prayed long and fervently i lay still till their devotions were completed and then left my tent good morning said peter how dost thou feel much better said i than i could have expected i am glad of it said peter art thou hungry yonder comes our breakfast pointing to the same young woman i had seen the preceding night who was again descending the hill bearing the tray upon her head what dost thou intend to do young man this day said peter when we had about half finished breakfast do said i as i do other days what i can and dost thou pass this day as thou dost other days said peter why not said i what is there in this day different from the rest it seems to be of the same colour as yesterday art thou aware said the wife interposing what day it is that it is sabbath that it is sunday no said i i did not know that it was sunday and how did that happen said winifred with a sigh to tell you the truth said i i live very much alone and pay very little heed to the passing of time and yet of what infinite importance is time said winifred art thou not aware that every year brings thee nearer to thy end i do not think said i that i am so near my end as i was yesterday yes thou art said the woman thou wast not doomed to die yesterday an invisible hand was watching over thee yesterday but thy day will come therefore improve the time be grateful that thou wast saved yesterday and oh reflect on one thing if thou hadst died yesterday where wouldst thou have been now cast into the earth perhaps said i i have heard mr petulengro say that to be cast into the earth is the natural end of man who is mr petulengro said peter interrupting his wife as she was about to speak master of the horseshoe said i and according to his own account king of egypt i understand said peter head of some family of wandering egyptians they are a race utterly godless art thou of thembut no thou art not thou hast not their yellow blood i suppose thou belongest to the family of wandering artizans called i do not like you the worse for belonging to them a mighty speaker of old sprang up from amidst that family who was he said i john bunyan replied peter reverently and the mention of his name reminds me that i have to preach this day wilt thou go and hear the distance is not great only half a mile no said i i will not go and hear wherefore said peter i belong to the church said i and not to the congregations oh the pride of that church said peter addressing his wife in their own tongue exemplified even in the lowest and most ignorant of its members then thou doubtless meanest to go to church said peter again addressing me there is a church on the other side of that wooded hill no said i i do not mean to go to church may i ask thee wherefore said peter because said i i prefer remaining beneath the shade of these trees listening to the sound of the leaves and tinkling of the waters then thou intendest to remain here said peter looking fixedly at me if i do not intrude said i but if i do i will wander away i wish to be beholden to nobodyperhaps you wish me to go on the contrary said peter i wish you to stay i begin to see something in thee which has much interest for me but we must now bid thee farewell for the rest of the day the time is drawing nigh for us to repair to the place of preaching before we leave thee alone however i should wish to ask thee a questiondidst thou seek thy own destruction yesterday and didst thou wilfully take that poison no said i had i known there had been poison in the cake i certainly should not have taken it and who gave it thee said peter an enemy of mine i replied who is thy enemy an egyptian sorceress and poisonmonger thy enemy is a female i fear thou hadst given her cause to hate theeof what did she complain that i had stolen the tongue out of her head i do not understand theeis she young about sixtyfive here winifred interposed thou didst call her just now by hard names young man said she i trust thou dost bear no malice against her no said i i bear no malice against her thou art not wishing to deliver her into the hand of what is called justice by no means said i i have lived long enough upon the roads not to cry out for the constable when my finger is broken i consider this poisoning as an accident of the roads one of those to which those who travel are occasionally subject in short thou forgivest thine adversary both now and for ever said i truly said winifred the spirit which the young man displayeth pleases me much i should be loth that he left us yet i have no doubt that with the blessing of god and a little of thy exhortation he will turn out a true christian before he leaveth us my exhortation said peter and a dark shade passed over his countenance thou forgettest what i amiibut i am forgetting myself the lords will be done and now put away the things for i perceive that our friends are coming to attend us to the place of meeting again the family which i had seen the night before descended the hill from their abode they were now dressed in their sundays best the master of the house led the way they presently joined us when a quiet sober greeting ensued on each side after a little time peter shook me by the hand and bade me farewell till the evening winifred did the same adding that she hoped i should be visited by sweet and holy thoughts the whole party then moved off in the directionby which we had come the preceding night peter and the master leading the way followed by winifred and the mistress of the family as i gazed on their departing forms i felt almost inclined to follow them to their place of worship i did not stir however but remained leaning against my oak with my hands behind me and after a time i sat me down at the foot of the oak with my face turned towards the water and folding my hands i fell into deep meditation i thought on the early sabbaths of my life and the manner in which i was wont to pass them how carefully i said my prayers when i got up on the sabbath morn and how carefully i combed my hair and brushed my clothes in order that i might do credit to the sabbath day i thought of the old church at pretty d the dignified rector and yet more dignified clerk i thought of englands grand liturgy and tate and bradys sonorous minstrelsy i thought of the holy book portions of which i was in the habit of reading between service i thought too of the evening walk which i sometimes took in fine weather like the present with my mother and brothera quiet sober walk during which i would not break into a run even to chase a butterfly or yet more a honeybee being fully convinced of the dread importance of the day which god had hallowed and how glad i was when i had got over the sabbath day without having done anything to profane it and how soundly i slept on the sabbath night after the toil of being very good throughout the day and when i had mused on those times a long while i sighed and said to myself i am much altered since then am i altered for the better and then i looked at my hands and my apparel and sighed again i was not wont of yore to appear thus on the sabbath day for a long time i continued in a state of deep meditation till at last i lifted up my eyes to the sun which as usual during that glorious summer was shining in unclouded majesty and then i lowered them to the sparkling water in which hundreds of the finny brood were disporting themselves and then i thought what a fine thing it was to be a fish on such a fine summer day and i wished myself a fish or at least amongst the fishes and then i looked at my hands again and then bending over the water i looked at my face in the crystal mirror and started when i saw it for it looked squalid and miserable forthwith i started up and said to myself i should like to bathe and cleanse myself from the squalor produced by my late hard life and by mrs hernes drow i wonder if there is any harm in bathing on the sabbath day i will ask winifred when she comes home in the mean time i will bathe provided i can find a fitting place but the brook though a very delightful place for fish to disport in was shallow and by no means adapted for the recreation of so large a being as myself it was moreover exposed though i saw nobody at hand nor heard a single human voice or sound following the winding of the brook i left the meadow and passing through two or three thickets came to a place where between lofty banks the water ran deep and dark and there i bathed imbibing new tone and vigour into my languid and exhausted frame having put on my clothes i returned by the way i had come to my vehicle beneath the oak tree from thence for want of something better to do i strolled up the hill on the top of which stood the farmhouse it was a large and commodious building built principally of stone and seeming of some antiquity with a porch on either side of which was an oaken bench on the right was seated a young woman with a book in her hand the same who had brought the tray to my friends and myself good day said i pretty damsel sitting in the farm porch good day said the girl looking at me for a moment and then fixing her eyes on her book thats a nice book you are reading said i the girl looked at me with surprise how do you know what book it is said she how do i knownever mind but a nice book it isno love no fortunetelling in it the girl looked at me half offended fortunetelling said she i should think not but you know nothing about it and she bent her head once more over the book i tell you what young person said i i know all about that book what will you wager that i do not i never wager said the girl shall i tell you the name of it said i o daughter of the dairy the girl half started i should never have thought said she half timidly that you could have guessed it i did not guess it said i i knew it and meet and proper it is that you should read itwhy so said the girl can the daughter of the dairy read a more fitting book than the dairymans daughter where do you come from said the girl out of the water said i dont start i have been bathing are you fond of the water no said the girl heaving a sigh i am not fond of the water that is of the sea and here she sighed again the sea is a wide gulf said i and frequently separates hearts the girl sobbed why are you alone here said i i take my turn with the rest said the girl to keep at home on sunday and you are said i the masters niece said the girl how came you to know it but why did you not go with the rest and with your friends who are those you call my friends said i peter and his wife and who are they said i do you not know said the girl you came with them they found me ill by the way said i and they relieved me i know nothing about them i thought you knew everything said the girl there are two or three things which i do not know and this is one of them who are they did you never hear of the great welsh preacher peter williams never said i well said the girl this is he and winifred is his wife and a nice person she is some people say indeed that she is as good a preacher as her husband though of that matter i can say nothing having never heard her preach so these two wander over all wales and the greater part of england comforting the hearts of the people with their doctrine and doing all the good they can they frequently come here for the mistress is a welsh woman and an old friend of both and then they take up their abode in the cart beneath the old oaks down there by the stream and what is their reason for doing so said i would it not be more comfortable to sleep beneath a roof i know not their reasons said the girl but so it is they never sleep beneath a roof unless the weather is very severe i once heard the mistress say that peter had something heavy upon his mind perhaps that is the cause if he is unhappy all i can say is that i wish him otherwise for he is a good man and a kind thank you said i i will now depart hem said the girl i was wishing what to ask me a question not exactly but you seem to know everything you mentioned i think fortunetelling do you wish me to tell your fortune by no means but i have a friend at a distance at sea and i should wish to know when he will come back i have told you already there are two or three things which i do not knowthis is another of them however i should not be surprised if he were to come back some of these days i would if i were in his place inthe mean time be patient attend to the dairy and read the dairymans daughter when you have nothing better to do it was late in the evening when the party of the morning returned the farmer and his family repaired at once to their abode and my two friends joined me beneath the tree peter sat down at the foot of the oak and said nothing supper was brought by a servant not the damsel of the porch we sat round the tray peter said grace but scarcely anything else he appeared sad and dejected his wife looked anxiously upon him i was as silent as my friends after a little time we retired to our separate places of rest about midnight i was awakened by a noise i started up and listened it appeared to me that i heard voices and groans in a moment i had issued from my tentall was silentbut the next moment i again heard groans and voices they proceeded from the tilted cart where peter and his wife lay i drew near again there was a pause and then i heard the voice of peter in an accent of extreme anguish exclaim pechod ysprydd glano pechod ysprydd glan and then he uttered a deep groan anon i heard the voice of winifred and never shall i forget the sweetness and gentleness of the tones of her voice in the stillness of that night i did not understand all she saidshe spoke in her native language and i was some way apart she appeared to endeavour to console her husband but he seemed to refuse all comfort and with many groans repeatedpechod ysprydd glano pechod ysprydd glan i felt i had no right to pry into their afflictions and retired now pechod ysprydd glan interpreted is the sin against the holy ghostchapter lxxiv the following daypridethriving tradetylwyth tegellis wynsleeping bardincalculable goodfearful agonythe tale peter and his wife did not proceed on any expedition during the following day the former strolled gloomily about the fields and the latter passed many hours in the farmhouse towards evening without saying a word to either i departed with my vehicle and finding my way to a small town at some distance i laid in a store of various articles with which i returned it was night and my two friends were seated beneath the oak they had just completed their frugal supper we waited for thee some time said winifred but finding that thou didst not come we began without thee but sit down i pray thee there is still enough for thee i will sit down said i but i require no supper for i have eaten where i have been nothing more particular occurred at the time next morning the kind pair invited me to share their breakfast i will not share your breakfast said i wherefore not said winifred anxiously because said i it is not proper that i be beholden to you for meat and drink but we are beholden to other people said winifred yes said i but you preach to them and give them ghostly advice which considerably alters the matter not that i would receive anything from them if i preached to them six times a day thou art not fond of receiving favours then young man said winifred i am not said i and of conferring favours nothing affords me greater pleasure said i than to confer favours what a disposition said winifred holding up her hands and this is pride genuine pridethat feeling which the world agrees to call so noble oh how mean a thing is pride never before did i see all the meanness of what is called pride but how wilt thou live friend said peter dost thou not intend to eat when i went out last night said i i laid in a provision thou hast laid in a provision said peter pray let us see it really friend said he after i had produced it thou must drive a thriving trade here are provisions enough to last three people for several days here are butter and eggs here is tea here is sugar and there is a flitch i hope thou wilt let us partake of some of thy fare i should be very happy if you would said i doubt not but we shall said peter winifred shall have some of thy flitch cooked for dinner in the meantime sit down young man and breakfast at our expensewe will dine at thine on the evening of that day peter and myself sat alone beneath the oak we fell into conversation peter was at first melancholy but he soon became more cheerful fluent and entertaining i spoke but little but i observed that sometimes what i said surprised the good methodist we had been silent some time at length lifting up my eyes to the broad and leafy canopy of the trees i said having nothing better to remark what a noble tree i wonder if the fairies ever dance beneath it fairies said peter fairies how came you young man to know anything about the fair family i am an englishman said i and of course know something about fairies england was once a famous place for them was once i grant you said peter but is so no longer i have travelled for years about england and never heard them mentioned before the belief in them has died away and even their name seems to be forgotten if you had said you were a welshman i should not have been surprised the welsh have much to say of the tylwyth teg or fair family and many believe in them and do you believe in them said i i scarcely know what to say wise and good men have been of opinion that they are nothing but devils who under the form of pretty and amiable spirits would fain allure poor human beings i see nothing irrational in the supposition do you believe in devils then do i believe in devils young man said peter and his frame was shaken as if by convulsions if i do not believe in devils why am i here at the present moment you know best said i but i dont believe the fairies are devils and i dont wish to hear them insulted what learned men have said they are devils many have said it young man and amongst others master ellis wyn in that wonderful book of his the bardd cwsg the bardd cwsg said i what kind of book is that i have never heard of that book before heard of it before i suppose not how should you have heard of it before bythebye can you read very tolerably said i so there are fairies in this book what do you call itthe bardd cwsg yes the bardd cwsg you pronounce welsh very fairly have you ever been in walesnever said i not been in wales then of course you dont understand welsh but we were talking of the bardd cwsgyes there are fairies in the bardd cwsg the author of it master ellis wyn was carried away in his sleep by them over mountains and valleys rivers and great waters incurring mighty perils at their hands till he was rescued from them by an angel of the most high who subsequently showed him many wonderful things i beg your pardon said i but what were those wonderful things i see young man said peter smiling that you are not without curiosity but i can easily pardon any one for being curious about the wonders contained in the book of master ellis wyn the angel showed him the course of this world its pomps and vanities its cruelty and its pride its crimes and deceits on another occasion the angel showed him death in his nether palace surrounded by his grisly ministers and by those who are continually falling victims to his power and on a third occasion the state of the condemned in their place of everlasting torment but this was all in his sleep said i was it not yes said peter in his sleep and on that account the book is called gweledigaethau y bardd cwsg or visions of the sleeping bard i do not care for wonders which occur in sleep said i i prefer real ones and perhaps notwithstanding what he says the man had no visions at allthey are probably of his own invention they are substantially true young man said peter like the dreams of bunyan they are founded on three tremendous facts sin death and hell and like his they have done incalculable good at least in my own country in the language in which they are written many a guilty conscience has the bardd cwsg aroused with its dreadful sights its strong sighs its puffs of smoke from the pit and its showers of sparks from the mouth of the yet lower gulf ofunknownwere it not for the bardd cwsg perhaps i might not be here i would sooner hear your own tale said i than all the visions of the bardd cwsg peter shook bent his form nearly double and covered his face with his hands i sat still and motionless with my eyes fixed upon him presently winifred descended the hill and joined us what is the matter said she looking at her husband who still remained in the posture i have described he made no answer whereupon laying her hand gently on his shoulder she said in the peculiar soft and tender tone which i had heard her use on a former occasion take comfort peter what has happened now to afflict thee peter removed his hands from his face the old pain the old pain said he i was talking with this young man and he would fain know what brought me here he would fain hear my tale winifredmy sin o pechod ysprydd glan o pechod ysprydd glan and the poor man fell into a more fearful agony than before tears trickled down winifreds face i saw them trickling by the moonlight as she gazed upon the writhing form of her afflicted husband i arose from my seat i am the cause of all this said i by my folly and imprudence and it is thus i have returned your kindness and hospitality i will depart from you and wander my way i was retiring but peter sprang up and detained me go not said he you were not in fault if there be any fault in the case it was mine if i suffer i am but paying the penalty of my own iniquity he then paused and appeared to be considering at length he said many things which thou hast seen and heard connected with me require explanation thou wishest to know my tale i will tell it thee but not now not tonight i am too much shaken two evenings later when we were again seated beneath the oak peter took the hand of his wife in his own and then in tones broken and almost inarticulate commenced telling me his talethe tale of the pechod ysprydd glanchapter lxxv taking a cupgetting to heavenafter breakfastwooden gallerymechanical habitreserved and gloomylast wordsa long timefrom the cloudsray of hopemomentary chillpleasing anticipation i was born in the heart of north wales the son of a respectable farmer and am the youngest of seven brothers my father was a member of the church of england and was what is generally called a serious man he went to church regularly and read the bible every sunday evening in his moments of leisure he was fond of holding religious discourse both with his family and his neighbours one autumn afternoon on a week day my father sat with one of his neighbours taking a cup of ale by the oak table in our stone kitchen i sat near them and listened to their discourse i was at that time seven years of age they were talking of religious matters it is a hard matter to get to heaven said my father exceedingly so said the other however i dont despond none need despair of getting to heaven save those who have committed the sin against the holy ghost ah said my father thank god i never committed thathow awful must be the state of a person who has committed the sin against the holy ghost i can scarcely think of it without my hair standing on end and then my father and his friend began talking of the nature of the sin against the holy ghost and i heard them say what it was as i sat with greedy ears listening to their discourse i lay awake the greater part of the night musing upon what i had heard i kept wondering to myself what must be the state of a person who had committed the sin against the holy ghost and how he must feel once or twice i felt a strong inclination to commit it a strange kind of fear however prevented me at last i determined not to commit it and having said my prayers i fell asleep when i awoke in the morning the first thing i thought of was the mysterious sin and a voice within me seemed to say commit it and i felt a strong temptation to do so even stronger than in the night i was just about to yield when the same dread of which i have already spoken came over me and springing out of bed i went down on my knees i slept in a small room alone to which i ascended by a wooden stair open to the sky i have often thought since that it is not a good thing for children to sleep alone after breakfast i went to school and endeavoured to employ myself upon my tasks but all in vain i could think of nothing but the sin against the holy ghost my eyes instead of being fixed upon my book wandered in vacancy my master observed my inattention and chid me the time came for saying my task and i had not acquired it my master reproached me and yet more he beat me i felt shame and anger and i went home with a full determination to commit the sin against the holy ghost but when i got home my father ordered me to do something connected with the farm so that i was compelled to exert myself i was occupied till night and was so busy that i almost forgot the sin and my late resolution my work completed i took my supper and went to my room i began my prayers and when they were ended i thought of the sin but the temptation was slight i felt very tired and was presently asleep thus you see i had plenty of time allotted me by a gracious and kind god to reflect on what i was about to do he did not permit the enemy of souls to take me by surprise and to hurry me at once into the commission of that which was to be my ruin here and hereafter whatever i did was of my own free will after i had had time to reflect thus god is justified he had no hand in my destruction but on the contrary he did all that was compatible with justice to prevent it i hasten to the fatal moment awaking in the night i determined that nothing should prevent my committing the sin arising from my bed i went out upon the wooden gallery and having stood for a few moments looking at the stars with which the heavens were thickly strewn i laid myself down and supporting my face with my hand i murmured out words of horrorwords not to be repeated and in this manner i committed the sin against the holy ghost when the words were uttered i sat up upon the topmost step of the gallery for some time i felt stunned in somewhat the same manner as i once subsequently felt after being stung by an adder i soon arose however and retired to my bed where notwithstanding what i had done i was not slow in falling asleep i awoke several times during the night each time with a dim idea that something strange and monstrous had occurred but i presently fell asleep again in the morning i awoke with the same vague feeling but presently recollection returned and i remembered that i had committed the sin against the holy ghost i lay musing for some time on what i had done and i felt rather stunned as before at last i arose and got out of bed dressed myself and then went down on my knees and was about to pray from the force of mechanical habit before i said a word however i recollected myself and got up again what was the use of praying i thought i had committed the sin against the holy ghosti went to school but sat stupified i was again chidden again beaten by my master i felt no anger this time and scarcely heeded the strokes i looked however at my masters face and thought to myself you are beating me for being idle as you suppose poor man what would you do if you knew i had committed the sin against the holy ghost days and weeks passed by i had once been cheerful and fond of the society of children of my own age but i was now reserved and gloomy it seemed to me that a gulf separated me from all my fellowcreatures i used to look at my brothers and schoolfellows and think how different i was from them they had not done what i had i seemed in my own eyes a lone monstrous being and yet strange to say i felt a kind of pride in being so i was unhappy but i frequently thought to myself i have done what no one else would dare to do there was something grand in the idea i had yet to learn the horror of my condition time passed on and i began to think less of what i had done i began once more to take pleasure in my childish sports i was active and excelled at football and the like all the lads of my age i likewise began what i had never done before to take pleasure in the exercises of the school i made great progress in welsh and english grammar and learnt to construe latin my master no longer chid or beat me but one day told my father that he had no doubt that one day i should be an honour to wales shortly after this my father fell sick the progress of the disorder was rapid feeling his end approaching he called his children before him after tenderly embracing us he said god bless you my children i am going from you but take comfort i trust that we shall all meet again in heaven as he uttered these last words horror took entire possession of me meet my father in heavenhow could i ever hope to meet him there i looked wildly at my brethren and at my mother they were all bathed in tears but how i envied them they might hope to meet my father in heaven but how different were they from me they had never committed the unpardonable sin in a few days my father died he left his family in comfortable circumstances at least such as would be considered so in wales where the wants of the people are few my elder brother carried on the farm for the benefit of my mother and us all in course of time my brothers were put out to various trades i still remained at school but without being a source of expense to my relations as i was by this time able to assist my master in the business of the school i was diligent both in selfimprovement and in the instruction of others nevertheless a horrible weight pressed upon my breast i knew i was a lost being that for me there was no hope that though all others might be saved i must of necessity be lost i had committed the unpardonable sin for which i was doomed to eternal punishment in the flaming gulf as soon as life was overand how long could i hope to live perhaps fifty years at the end of which i must go to my place and then i would count the months and the days nay even the hours which yet intervened between me and my doom sometimes i would comfort myself with the idea that a long time would elapse before my time would be out but then again i thought that however long the term might be it must be out at last and then i would fall into an agony during which i would almost wish that the term were out and that i were in my place the horrors of which i thought could scarcely be worse than what i then endured there was one thought about this time which caused me unutterable grief and shame perhaps more shame than grief it was that my father who was gone to heaven and was there daily holding communion with his god was by this time aware of my crime i imagined him looking down from the clouds upon his wretched son with a countenance of inexpressible horror when this idea was upon me i would often rush to some secret place to hide myselfto some thicket where i would cast myself on the ground and thrust my head into a thick bush in order to escape from the horrorstruck glance of my father above in the clouds and there i would continue groaning till the agony had in some degree passed away the wretchedness of my state increasing daily it at last became apparent to the master of the school who questioned me earnestly and affectionately i however gave him no satisfactory answer being apprehensive that if i unbosomed myself i should become as much an object of horror to him as i had long been to myself at length he suspected that i was unsettled in my intellects and fearing probably the ill effect of my presence upon his scholars he advised me to go home which i was glad to do as i felt myself every day becoming less qualified for the duties of the office which i had undertaken so i returned home to my mother and my brother who received me with the greatest kindness and affection i now determined to devote myself to husbandry and assist my brother in the business of the farm i was still however very much distressed one fine morning however as i was at work in the field and the birds were carolling around me a ray of hope began to break upon my poor dark soul i looked at the earth and looked at the sky and felt as i had not done for many a year presently a delicious feeling stole over me i was beginning to enjoy existence i shall never forget that hour i flung myself on the soil and kissed it then springing up with a sudden impulse i rushed into the depths of a neighbouring wood and falling upon my knees did what i had not done for a long timeprayed to goda change an entire change seemed to have come over me i was no longer gloomy and despairing but gay and happy my slumbers were light and easy not disturbed as before by frightful dreams i arose with the lark and like him uttered a cheerful song of praise to god frequently and earnestly and was particularly cautious not to do anything which i considered might cause his displeasure at church i was constant and when there listened with deepest attention to every word which proceeded from the mouth of the minister in a little time it appeared to me that i had become a good very good young man at times the recollection of the sin would return and i would feel a momentary chill but the thought quickly vanished and i again felt happy and secure one sunday morning after i had said my prayers i felt particularly joyous i thought of the innocent and virtuous life i was leading and when the recollection of the sin intruded for a moment i said i am sure god will never utterly cast away so good a creature as myself i went to church and was as usual attentive the subject of the sermon was on the duty of searching the scriptures all i knew of them was from the liturgy i now however determined to read them and perfect the good work which i had begun my fathers bible was upon the shelf and on that evening i took it with me to my chamber i placed it on the table and sat down my heart was filled with pleasing anticipation i opened the book at random and began to read the first passage on which my eyes lighted was the following he who committeth the sin against the holy ghost shall not be forgiven either in this world or the next here peter was seized with convulsive tremors winifred sobbed violently i got up and went away returning in about a quarter of an hour i found him more calm he motioned me to sit down and after a short pause continued his narrationchapter lxxvi

dreaming but it was no dream but a terrific reality i will not dwell on that period i should only shock you i could not bear my feelings so bidding my friends a hasty farewell i abandoned myself to horror and despair and ran wild through wales climbing mountains and wading streams climbing mountains and wading streams i ran wild about i was burnt by the sun drenched by the rain and had frequently at night no other covering than the sky or the humid roof of some cave but nothing seemed to affect my constitution probably the fire which burned within me counteracted what i suffered from without during the space of three years i scarcely knew what befel me my life was a dreama wild horrible dream more than once i believe i was in the hands of robbers and once in the hands of gypsies i liked the last description of people least of all i could not abide their yellow faces or their ceaseless clabber escaping from these beings whose countenances and godless discourse brought to my mind the demons of the deep unknown i still ran wild through wales i know not how long on one occasion coming in some degree to my recollection i felt myself quite unable to bear the horrors of my situation looking round i found myself near the sea instantly the idea came into my head that i would cast myself into it and thus anticipate my final doom i hesitated a moment but a voice within me seemed to tell me that i could do no better the sea was near and i could not swim so i determined to fling myself into the sea as i was running along at great speed in the direction of a lofty rock which beetled over the waters i suddenly felt myself seized by the coat i strove to tear myself away but in vain looking round i perceived a venerable hale old man who had hold of me let me go said i fiercely i will not let thee go said the old man and now instead of with one he grappled me with both hands in whose name dost thou detain me said i scarcely knowing what i said in the name of my master who made thee and yonder sea and has said to the sea so far shalt thou come and no farther and to thee thou shalt do no murder has not a man a right to do what he pleases with his own said i he has said the old man but thy life is not thy own thou art accountable for it to thy god nay i will not let thee go he continued as i again struggled if thou struggle with me the whole day i will not let thee go as charles wesley says in his wrestlings of jacob and see it is of no use struggling for i am in the strength of my master stronger than thou and indeed all of a sudden i had become very weak and exhausted whereupon the old man beholding my situation took me by the arm and led me gently to a neighbouring town which stood behind a hill and which i had not before observed presently he opened the door of a respectablelooking house which stood beside a large building having the appearance of a chapel and conducted me into a small room with a great many books in it having caused me to sit down he stood looking at me for some time occasionally heaving a sigh i was indeed haggard and forlorn who art thou he said at last a miserable man i replied what makes thee miserable said the old man a hideous crime i replied i can find no rest like cain i wander here and there the old man turned pale hast thou taken anothers life said he if so i advise thee to surrender thyself to the magistrate thou canst do no better thy doing so will be the best proof of thy repentance and though there be no hope for thee in this world there may be much in the next no said i i have never taken anothers life what then anothers goods if so restore them sevenfold if possible or if it be not in thy power and thy conscience accuse thee surrender thyself to the magistrate and make the only satisfaction thou art able i have taken no ones goods said i of what art thou guilty then said he art thou a drunkard a profligate alas no said i i am neither of these would that i were no worse thereupon the old man looked steadfastly at me for some time then after appearing to reflect he said young man i have a great desire to know your name what matters it to you what is my name said i you know nothing of me perhaps you are mistaken said the old man looking kindly at me but at all events tell me your name i hesitated a moment and then told him who i was whereupon he exclaimed with much emotion i thought so how wonderful are the ways of providence i have heard of thee young man and know thy mother well only a month ago when upon a journey i experienced much kindness from her she was speaking to me of her lost child with tears she told me that you were one of the best of sons but that some strange idea appeared to have occupied your mind despair not my son if thou hast been afflicted i doubt not but that thy affliction will eventually turn out to thy benefit i doubt not but that thou wilt be preserved as an example of the great mercy of god i will now kneel down and pray for thee my son he knelt down and prayed long and fervently i remained standing for some time at length i knelt down likewise i scarcely knew what he was saying but when he concluded i said amen and when we had risen from our knees the old man left me for a short time and on his return led me into another room where were two females one was an elderly person the wife of the old manthe other was a young woman of very prepossessing appearance hang not down thy head winifred who i soon found was a distant relation of the old man both received me with great kindness the old man having doubtless previously told them who i wasi staid several days in the good mans house i had still the greater portion of a small sum which i happened to have about me when i departed on my dolorous wandering and with this i purchased clothes and altered my appearance considerably on the evening of the second day my friend said i am going to preach perhaps you will come and hear me i consented and we all went not to a church but to the large building next the house for the old man though a clergyman was not of the established persuasion and there the old man mounted a pulpit and began to preach come unto me all ye that labour and are heavy laden etc etc was his text his sermon was long but i still bear the greater portion of it in my mind the substance of it was that jesus was at all times ready to take upon himself the burden of our sins provided we came to him with a humble and contrite spirit and begged his help this doctrine was new to me i had often been at church but had never heard it preached before at least so distinctly when he said that all men might be saved i shook for i expected he would add all except those who had committed the mysterious sin but no all men were to be saved who with a humble and contrite spirit would come to jesus cast themselves at the foot of his cross and accept pardon through the merits of his bloodshedding alone therefore my friends said he in conclusion despair nothowever guilty you may be despair nothowever desperate your condition may seem said he fixing his eyes upon me despair not there is nothing more foolish and more wicked than despair overweening confidence is not more foolish than despair both are the favourite weapons of the enemy of souls this discourse gave rise in my mind to no slight perplexity i had read in the scriptures that he who committeth a certain sin shall never be forgiven and that there is no hope for him either in this world or the next and here was a man a good man certainly and one who of necessity was thoroughly acquainted with the scriptures who told me that any one might be forgiven however wicked who would only trust in christ and in the merits of his bloodshedding did i believe in christ ay truly was i willing to be saved by christ ay truly did i trust in christ i trusted that christ would save every one but myself and why not myself simply because the scriptures had told me that he who has committed the sin against the holy ghost can never be saved and i had committed the sin against the holy ghostperhaps the only one who ever had committed it how could i hope the scriptures could not lie and yet here was this good old man profoundly versed in the scriptures who bade me hope would he lie no but did the old man know my case ah no he did not know my case but yet he had bid me hope whatever i had done provided i would go to jesus but how could i think of going to jesus when the scriptures told me plainly that all would be useless i was perplexed and yet a ray of hope began to dawn in my soul i thought of consulting the good man but i was afraid he would drive away the small glimmer i was afraid he would say o yes every one is to be saved except a wretch like you i was not aware before that there was anything so horriblebegone once or twice the old man questioned me on the subject of my misery but i evaded him once indeed when he looked particularly benevolent i think i should have unbosomed myself to him but we were interrupted he never pressed me much perhaps he was delicate in probing my mind as we were then of different persuasions hence he advised me to seek the advice of some powerful minister in my own church there were many such in it he said i staid several days in the family during which time i more than once heard my venerable friend preach each time he preached he exhorted his hearers not to despair the whole family were kind to me his wife frequently discoursed with me and also the young person to whom i have already alluded it appeared to me that the latter took a peculiar interest in my fate at last my friend said to me it is now time thou shouldst return to thy mother and thy brother so i arose and departed to my mother and my brother and at my departure my old friend gave me his blessing and his wife and the young person shed tears the last especially and when my mother saw me she shed tears and fell on my neck and kissed me and my brother took me by the hand and bade me welcome and when our first emotions were subsided my mother said i trust thou art come in a lucky hour a few weeks ago my cousin whose favourite thou always wast died and left thee his heirleft thee the goodly farm in which he lived i trust my son that thou wilt now settle and be a comfort to me in my old days and i answered i will if so please the lord and i said to myself god grant that this bequest be a token of the lords favour and in a few days i departed to take possession of my farm it was about twenty miles from my mothers house in a beautiful but rather wild district i arrived at the fall of the leaf all day long i busied myself with my farm and thus kept my mind employed at night however i felt rather solitary and i frequently wished for a companion each night and morning i prayed fervently unto the lord for his hand had been very heavy upon me and i feared him there was one thing connected with my new abode which gave me considerable uneasinessthe want of spiritual instruction there was a church indeed close at hand in which service was occasionally performed but in so hurried and heartless a manner that i derived little benefit from it the clergyman to whom the benefice belonged was a valetudinarian who passed his time in london or at some watering place entrusting the care of his flock to the curate of a distant parish who gave himself very little trouble about the matter now i wanted every sunday to hear from the pulpit words of consolation and encouragement similar to those which i had heard uttered from the pulpit by my good and venerable friend but i was debarred from this privilege at length one day being in conversation with one of mylabourers a staid and serious man i spoke to him of the matter which lay heavy upon my mind whereupon looking me wistfully in the face he said master the want of religious instruction in my church was what drove me to the methodists the methodists said i are there any in these parts there is a chapel said he only half a mile distant at which there are two services every sunday and other two during the week now it happened that my venerable friend was of the methodist persuasion and when i heard the poor man talk in this manner i said to him may i go with you next sunday why not said he so i went with the labourer on the ensuing sabbath to the meeting of the methodists i liked the preaching which i heard at the chapel very well though it was not quite so comfortable as that of my old friend the preacher being in some respects a different kind of man it however did me good and i went again and continued to do so though i did not become a regular member of the body at that time i had now the benefit of religious instruction and also to a certain extent of religious fellowship for the preacher and various members of his flock frequently came to see me they were honest plain men not exactly of the description which i wished for but still good sort of people and i was glad to see them once on a time when some of them were with me one of them enquired whether i was fervent in prayer very fervent said i and do you read the scriptures often said he no said i why not said he because i am afraid to see there my own condemnation they looked at each other and said nothing at the time on leaving me however they all advised me to read the scriptures with fervency and prayer as i had told these honest people i shrank from searching the scriptures the remembrance of the fatal passage was still too vivid in my mind to permit me i did not wish to see my condemnation repeated but i was very fervent in prayer and almost hoped that god would yet forgive me by virtue of the bloodshedding of the lamb time passed on my affairs prospered and i enjoyed a certain portion of tranquillity occasionally when i had nothing else to do i renewed my studies many is the book i read especially in my native language for i was always fond of my native language and proud of being a welshman amongst the books i read were the odes of the great ab gwilym whom thou friend hast never heard of no nor any of thy countrymen for you are an ignorant race you saxons at least with respect to all that relates to wales and welshmen i likewise read the book of master ellis wyn the latter work possessed a singular fascination for me on account of its wonderful delineations of the torments of the nether world but man does not love to be alone indeed the scripture says that it is not good for man to be alone i occupied my body with the pursuits of husbandry and i improved my mind with the perusal of good and wise books but as i have already said i frequently sighed for a companion with whom i could exchange ideas and who could take an interest in my pursuits the want of such a one i more particularly felt in the long winter evenings it was then that the image of the young person whom i had seen in the house of the preacher frequently rose up distinctly before my minds eye decked with quiet graceshang not down your head winifredand i thought that of all the women in the world i should wish her to be my partner and then i considered whether it would be possible to obtain her i am ready to acknowledge friend that it was both selfish and wicked in me to wish to fetter any human being to a lost creature like myself conscious of having committed a crime for which the scriptures told me there is no pardon i had indeed a long struggle as to whether i should make the attempt or notselfishness however prevailed i will not detain your attention with relating all that occurred at this periodsuffice it to say that i made my suit and was successful it is true that the old man who was her guardian hesitated and asked several questions respecting my state of mind i am afraid that i partly deceived him perhaps he partly deceived himself he was pleased that i had adopted his professionwe are all weak creatures with respect to the young person she did not ask many questions and i soon found that i had won her heart to be brief i married her and here she is the truest wife that ever man had and the kindest kind i may well call her seeing that she shrinks not from me who so cruelly deceived her in not telling her at first what i was i married her friend and brought her home to my little possession where we passed our time very agreeably our affairs prospered our garners were full and there was coin in our purse i worked in the field winifred busied herself with the dairy at night i frequently read books to her books of my own country friend i likewise read to her songs of my own holy songs and carols which she admired and which yourself would perhaps admire could you understand them but i repeat you saxons are an ignorant people with respect to us and a perverse inasmuch as you despise welsh without understanding it every night i prayed fervently and my wife admired my gift of prayer one night after i had been reading to my wife a portion of ellis wyn my wife said this is a wonderful book and containing much true and pleasant doctrine but how is it that you who are so fond of good books and good things in general never read the bible you read me the book of master ellis wyn you read me sweet songs of your own composition you edify me with your gift of prayer but yet you never read the bible and when i heard her mention the bible i shook for i thought of my own condemnation however i dearly loved my wife and as she pressed me i commenced on that very night reading the bible all went on smoothly for a long time for months and months i did not find the fatal passage so that i almost thought that i had imagined it my affairs prospered much the while so that i was almost happytaking pleasure in everything around mein my wife in my farm my books and compositions and the welsh language till one night as i was reading the bible feeling particularly comfortable a thought having just come into my head that i would print some of my compositions and purchase a particular field of a neighbouroh godgod i came to the fatal passagefriend friend what shall i say i rushed out my wife followed me asking me what was the matter i could only answer with groansfor three days and three nights i did little else than groan oh the kindness and solicitude of my wife what is the matter husband dear husband she was continually saying i became at last more calm my wife still persisted in asking me the cause of my late paroxysm it is hard to keep a secret from a wife especially such a wife as mine so i told my wife the tale as we sat one nightit was a midwinter nightover the dying brands of our hearth after the family had retired to rest her hand locked in mine even as it is now i thought she would have shrunk from me with horror but she did not her hand it is true trembled once or twice but that was all at last she gave mine a gentle pressure and looking up in my face she saidwhat do you think my wife said young man it is impossible for me to guess said i let us go to rest my love your fears are all groundlesschapter lxxvii getting lateseven years oldchasteninggo forthlondon bridgesame eyescommon occurrencevery sleepy and so i still say said winifred sobbing let us retire to rest dear husband your fears are groundless i had hoped long since that your affliction would have passed away and i still hope that it eventually will so take heart peter and let us retire to rest for it is getting late rest said peter there is no rest for the wicked we are all wicked said winifred but you are afraid of a shadow how often have i told you that the sin of your heart is not the sin against the holy ghost the sin of your heart is its natural pride of which you are scarcely aware to keep down which god in his mercy permitted you to be terrified with the idea of having committed a sin which you never committed then you will still maintain said peter that i never committed the sin against the holy spirit i will said winifred you never committed it how should a child seven years old commit a sin like that have i not read my own condemnation said peter did not the first words which i read in the holy scripture condemn me he who committeth the sin against the holy ghost shall never enter into the kingdom of god you never committed it said winifred but the words the words the words said peter the words are true words said winifred sobbing but they were not meant for you but for those who have broken their profession who having embraced the cross have receded from their master and what sayst thou to the effect which the words produced upon me said peter did they not cause me to run wild through wales for years like merddin wyllt of yore thinkest thou that i opened the book at that particular passage by chance no said winifred not by chance it was the hand of god directed you doubtless for some wise purpose you had become satisfied with yourself the lord wished to rouse thee from thy state of carnal security and therefore directed your eyes to that fearful passage does the lord then carry out his designs by means of guile said peter with a groan is not the lord true would the lord impress upon me that i had committed a sin of which i am guiltless hush winifred hush thou knowest that i have committed the sin thou hast not committed it said winifred sobbing yet more violently were they my last words i would persist that thou hast not committed it though perhaps thou wouldst but for this chastening it was not to convince thee that thou hast committed the sin but rather to prevent thee from committing it that the lord brought that passage before thy eyes he is not to blame if thou art wilfully blind to the truth and wisdom of his ways i see thou wouldst comfort me said peter as thou hast often before attempted to do i would fain ask the young man his opinion i have not yet heard the whole of your history said i my story is nearly told said peter a few words will complete it my wife endeavoured to console and reassure me using the arguments which you have just heard her use and many others but in vain peace nor comfort came to my breast i was rapidly falling into the depths of despair when one day winifred said to me i see thou wilt be lost if we remain here one resource only remains thou must go forth my husband into the wide world and to comfort thee i will go with thee and what can i do in the wide world said i despondingly much replied winifred if you will but exert yourself much good canst thou do with the blessing of god many things of the same kind she said to me and at last i arose from the earth to which god had smitten me and disposed of my property in the best way i could and went into the world we did all the good we were able visiting the sick ministering to the sick and praying with the sick at last i became celebrated as the possessor of a great gift of prayer and people urged me to preach and winifred urged me too and at last i consented and i preached iioutcast peter became the preacher peter williams i the lost one attempted to show others the right road and in this way i have gone on for thirteen years preaching and teaching visiting the sick and ministering to them with winifred by my side hearkening me on occasionally i am visited with fits ofindescribable agony generally on the night before the sabbath for i then ask myself how dare i the outcast attempt to preach the word of god young man my tale is told you seem in thought i am thinking of london bridge said i of london bridge said peter and his wife yes said i of london bridge i am indebted for much wisdom to london bridge it was there that i completed my studies but to the point i was once reading on london bridge a book which an ancient gentlewoman who kept the bridge was in the habit of lending me and there i found written each one carries in his breast the recollection of some sin which presses heavy upon him o if men could but look into each others hearts what blackness would they find there thats true said peter what is the name of the book the life of blessed mary flanders some popish saint i suppose said peter as much of a saint i dare say said i as most popish ones but you interrupted me one part of your narrative brought the passage which i have quoted into my mind you said that after you had committed this same sin of yours you were in the habit at school of looking upon your schoolfellows with a kind of gloomy superiority considering yourself a lone monstrous being who had committed a sin far above the daring of any of them are you sure that many others of your schoolfellows were not looking upon you and the others with much the same eyes with which you were looking upon them how said peter dost thou think that they had divined my secret not they said i they were i dare say thinking too much of themselves and of their own concerns to have divined any secrets of yours all i mean to say is they had probably secrets of their own and who knows that the secret sin of more than one of them was not the very sin which caused you so much misery dost thou then imagine said peter the sin against the holy ghost to be so common an occurrence as you have described it said i of very common occurrence especially amongst children who are indeed the only beings likely to commit it truly said winifred the young man talks wisely peter was silent for some moments and appeared to be reflecting at last suddenly raising his head he looked me full in the face and grasping my hand with vehemence he said tell me young man only one thing hast thou too committed the sin against the holy ghost i am neither papist nor methodist said i but of the church and being so confess myself to no one but keep my own counsel i will tell thee however had i committed at the same age twenty such sins as that which you committed i should feel no uneasiness at these yearsbut i am sleepy and must go to rest god bless thee young man said winifredchapter lxxviii low and calmmuch betterblessed effectno answersuch a sermon before i sank to rest i heard winifred and her husband conversing in the place where i had left them both their voices were low and calm i soon fell asleep and slumbered for some time on my awakening i again heard them conversing but they were now in their cart still the voices of both were calm i heard no passionate bursts of wild despair on the part of the man methought i occasionally heard the word pechod proceeding from the lips of each but with no particular emphasis i supposed they were talking of the innate sin of both their hearts i wish that man were happy said i to myself were it only for his wifes sake and yet he deserves to be happy for his own the next day peter was very cheerful more cheerful than i had ever seen him at breakfast his conversation was animated and he smiled repeatedly i looked at him with the greatest interest and the eyes of his wife were almost constantly fixed upon him a shade of gloom would occasionally come over his countenance but it almost instantly disappeared perhaps it proceeded more from habit than anything else after breakfast he took his welsh bible and sat down beneath a tree his eyes were soon fixed intently on the volume now and then he would call his wife show her some passage and appeared to consult with her the day passed quickly and comfortably your husband seems much better said i at evening fall to winifred as we chanced to be alone he does said winifred and that on the day of the week when he was wont to appear most melancholy for tomorrow is the sabbath he now no longer looks forward to the sabbath with dread but appears to reckon on it what a happy change and to think that this change should have been produced by a few words seemingly careless ones proceeding from the mouth of one who is almost a stranger to him truly it is wonderful to whom do you allude said i and to what words to yourself and to the words which came from your lips last night after you had heard my poor husbands history those strange words drawn out with so much seeming indifference have produced in my husband the blessed effect which you have observed they have altered the current of his ideas he no longer thinks himself the only being in the world doomed to destructionthe only being capable of committing the nevertobeforgiven sin your supposition that that which harrowed his soul is of frequent occurrence amongst children has tranquillized him the mist which hung over his mind has cleared away and he begins to see the groundlessness of his apprehensions the lord has permitted him to be chastened for a season but his lamp will only burn the brighter for what he has undergone sunday came fine and glorious as the last again my friends and myself breakfasted togetheragain the good family of the house on the hill above headed by the respectable master descended to the meadow peter and his wife were ready to receive them again peter placed himself at the side of the honest farmer and winifred by the side of her friend wilt thou not come said peter looking towards me with a face in which there was much emotion wilt thou not come said winifred with a face beaming with kindness but i made no answer and presently the party moved away in the same manner in which it had moved on the preceding sabbath and i was again left alone the hours of the sabbath passed slowly away i sat gazing at the sky the trees and the water at last i strolled up to the house and sat down in the porch it was empty there was no modest maiden there as on the preceding sabbath the damsel of the book had accompanied the rest i had seen her in the procession and the house appeared quite deserted the owners had probably left it to my custody so i sat down in the porch quite alone the hours of the sabbath passed heavily away at last evening came and with it the party of the morning i was now at my place beneath the oak i went forward to meet them peter and his wife received me with a calm and quiet greeting and passed forward the rest of the party had broke into groups there was a kind of excitement amongst them and much eager whispering i went to one of the groups the young girl of whom i have spoken more than once was speaking such a sermon said she it has never been our lot to hear peter never before spoke as he has done this dayhe was always a powerful preacher but oh the unction of the discourse of this morning and yet more of that of the afternoon which was the continuation of it what was the subject said i interrupting her ah you should have been there young man to have heard it it would have made a lasting impression upon you i was bathed in tears all the time those who heard it will never forget the preaching of the good peter williams on the power providence and goodness of godchapter lxxix deep interestgoodly countrytwo mansionswelshmans candlebeautiful universegodly discoursefine churchpoints of doctrinestrange adventurespaltry causeroman pontiffevil spirit on the morrow i said to my friends i am about to depart farewell depart said peter and his wife simultaneously whither wouldst thou go i cant stay here all my days i replied of course not said peter but we had no idea of losing thee so soon we had almost hoped that thou wouldst join us become one of us we are under infinite obligations to thee you mean i am under infinite obligations to you said i did you not save my life perhaps so under god said peter and what hast thou not done for me art thou aware that under god thou hast preserved my soul from despair but independent of that we like thy company and feel a deep interest in thee and would fain teach thee the way that is right hearken tomorrow we go into wales go with us i have no wish to go into wales said i why not said peter with animation wales is a goodly country as the scripture saysa land of brooks of water of fountains and depths that spring out of valleys and hills a land whose stones are iron and out of whose hills thou mayest dig lead i dare say it is a very fine country said i but i have no wish to go there just now my destiny seems to point in another direction to say nothing of my trade thou dost right to say nothing of thy trade said peter smiling for thou seemest to care nothing about it which has led winifred and myself to suspect that thou art not altogether what thou seemest but setting that aside we should be most happy if thou wouldst go with us into wales i cannot promise to go with you into wales said i but as you depart tomorrow i will stay with you through the day and on the morrow accompany you part of the way do said peter i have many people to see today and so has winifred but we will both endeavour to have some serious discourse with thee which perhaps will turn to thy profit in the end in the course of the day the good peter came to me as i was seated beneath the oak and placing himself by me commenced addressing me in the following manner i have no doubt my young friend that you are willing to admit that the most important thing which a human being possesses is his soul it is of infinite more importance than the body which is a frail substance and cannot last for many years but not so the soul which by its nature is imperishable to one of two mansions the soul is destined to depart after its separation from the body to heaven or hell to the halls of eternal bliss where god and his holy angels dwell or to the place of endless misery inhabited by satan and his grisly companions my friend if the joys of heaven are great unutterably great so are the torments of hell unutterably so i wish not to speak of them i wish not to terrify your imagination with the torments of hell indeed i like not to think of them but it is necessary to speak of them sometimes and to think of them sometimes lest you should sink into a state of carnal security authors friend and learned men are not altogether agreed as to the particulars of hell they all agree however in considering it a place of exceeding horror master ellis wyn who bythebye was a churchman calls it amongst other things a place of strong sighs and of flaming sparks master rees pritchard who was not only a churchman but vicar of llandovery and flourished about two hundred years agoi wish many like him flourished nowspeaking of hell in his collection of sweet hymns called the welshmans candle observes the pool is continually blazing it is very deep without any known bottom and the walls are so high that there is neither hope nor possibility of escaping over them but i told you just now i have no great pleasure in talking of hell no friend no i would sooner talk of the other place and of the goodness and hospitality of god amongst his saints above and then the excellent man began to dilate upon the joys of heaven and the goodness and hospitality of god in the mansions above explaining to me in the clearest way how i might get there and when he had finished what he had to say he left me whereupon winifred drew nigh and sitting down by me began to address me i do not think said she from what i have observed of thee that thou wouldst wish to be ungrateful and yet is not thy whole life a series of ingratitude and to whomto thy maker has he not endowed thee with a goodly and healthy form and senses which enable thee to enjoy the delights of his beautiful universethe work of his hands canst thou not enjoy even to rapture the brightness of the sun the perfume of the meads and the song of the dear birds which inhabit among the trees yes thou canst for i have seen thee and observed thee doing so yet during the whole time that i have known thee i have not heard proceed from thy lips one single word of praise or thanksgiving to and in this manner the admirable woman proceeded for a considerable time and to all her discourse i listened with attention and when she had concluded i took her hand and said i thank you and that was all on the next day everything was ready for our departure the good family of the house came to bid us farewell there were shaking of hands and kisses as on the night of our arrivaland as i stood somewhat apart the young girl of whom i have spoken so often came up to me and holding out her hand said farewell young man wherever thou goest then after looking around her she said it was all true you told me yesterday i received a letter from him thou wottest of he is coming soon god bless you young man who would have thought thou knewest so much so after we had taken our farewell of the good family we departed proceeding in the direction of wales peter was very cheerful and enlivened the way with godly discourse and spiritual hymns some of which were in the welsh language at length i said it is a pity that you did not continue in the church you have a turn for psalmody and i have heard of a man becoming a bishop by means of a less qualification very probably said peter more the pity but i have told you the reason of my forsaking it frequently when i went to the church door i found it barred and the priest absent what was i to do my heart was bursting for want of some religious help and comfort what could i do as good master rees pritchard observes in his candle for welshmen it is a doleful thing to see little children burning on the hot coals for want of help but yet more doleful to see a flock of souls falling into the burning lake for want of a priest the church of england is a fine church said i i would not advise any one to speak ill of the church of england before me i have nothing to say against the church said peter all i wish is that it would fling itself a little more open and that its priests would a little more bestir themselves in a word that it would shoulder the cross and become a missionary church it is too proud for that said winifred you are much more of a methodist said i than your husband but tell me said i addressing myself to peter do you not differ from the church in some points of doctrine i of course as a true member of the church am quite ignorant of the peculiar opinions of wandering sectaries oh the pride of that church said winifred half to herself wandering sectaries we differ in no points of doctrine said peter we believe all the church believes though we are not so fond of vain and superfluous ceremonies snowwhite neckcloths and surplices as the church is we likewise think that there is no harm in a sermon by the roadside or in holding free discourse with a beggar beneath a hedge or a tinker he added smiling it was those superfluous ceremonies those surplices and white neckcloths and above all the necessity of strictly regulating his words and conversation which drove john wesley out of the church and sent him wandering up and down as you see me poor welsh peter do nothing further passed for some time we were now drawing near the hills at last i said you must have met with a great many strange adventures since you took up this course of life many said peter it has been my lot to meet with but none more strange than one which occurred to me only a few weeks ago you were asking me not long since whether i believed in devils ay truly young man and i believe that the abyss and the yet deeper unknown do not contain them all some walk about upon the green earth so it happened some weeks ago that i was exercising my ministry about forty miles from here i was alone winifred being slightly indisposed staying for a few days at the house of an acquaintance i had finished afternoons worshipthe people had dispersed and i was sitting solitary by my cart under some green trees in a quiet retired place suddenly a voice said to me good evening pastor i looked up and before me stood a man at least the appearance of a man dressed in a black suit of rather a singular fashion he was about my own age or somewhat older as i looked upon him it appeared to me that i had seen him twice before whilst preaching i replied to his salutation and perceiving that he looked somewhat fatigued i took out a stool from the cart and asked him to sit down we began to discourse i at first supposed that he might be one of ourselves some wandering minister but i was soon undeceived neither his language nor his ideas were those of any one of our body he spoke on all kinds of matters with much fluency till at last he mentioned my preaching complimenting me on my powers i replied as well i might that i could claim no merit of my own and that if i spoke with any effect it was only by the grace of god as i uttered these last words a horrible kind of sneer came over his countenance which made me shudder for there was something diabolical in it i said little more but listened attentively to his discourse at last he said that i was engaged in a paltry cause quite unworthy of one of my powers how can that be said i even if i possessed all the powers in the world seeing that i am engaged in the cause of our lord jesus the same kind of sneer again came on his countenance but he almost instantly observed that if i chose to forsake this same miserable cause from which nothing but contempt and privation were to be expected he would enlist me into another from which i might expect both profit and renown an idea now came into my head and i told him firmly that if hewished me to forsake my present profession and become a member of the church of england i must absolutely decline that i had no illwill against that church but i thought i could do most good in my present position which i would not forsake to be archbishop of canterbury thereupon he burst into a strange laughter and went away repeating to himself church of england archbishop of canterbury a few days after when i was once more in a solitary place he again appeared before me and asked me whether i had thought over his words and whether i was willing to enlist under the banners of his master adding that he was eager to secure me as he conceived that i might be highly useful to the cause i then asked him who his master was he hesitated for a moment and then answered the roman pontiff if it be he said i i can have nothing to do with him i will serve no one who is an enemy of christ thereupon he drew near to me and told me not to talk so much like a simpleton that as for christ it was probable that no such person ever existed but that if he ever did he was the greatest impostor the world ever saw how long he continued in this way i know not for i now considered that an evil spirit was before me and shrank within myself shivering in every limb when i recovered myself and looked about me he was gone two days after he again stood before me in the same place and about the same hour renewing his propositions and speaking more horribly than before i made him no answer whereupon he continued but suddenly hearing a noise behind him he looked round and beheld winifred who had returned to me on the morning of that day who are you said he fiercely this mans wife said she calmly fixing her eyes upon him begone from him unhappy one thou temptest him in vain he made no answer but stood as if transfixed at length recovering himself he departed muttering wife wife if the fool has a wife he will never do for uschapter lxxx the borderthank you bothpipe and fiddletaliesin we were now drawing very near the hills and peter said if you are to go into wales you must presently decide for we are close upon the border which is the border said i yon small brook said peter into which the man on horseback who is coming towards us is now entering i see it said i and the man he stops in the middle of it as if to water his steed we proceeded till we had nearly reached the brook well said peter will you go into wales what should i do in wales i demanded do said peter smiling learn welsh i stopped my little pony then i need not go into wales i already know welsh know welsh said peter staring at me know welsh said winifred stopping her cart how and when did you learn it said peter from books in my boyhood read welsh said peter is it possible read welsh said winifred is it possible well i hope you will come with us said peter come with us young man said winifred let me on the other side of the brook welcome you into wales thank you both said i but i will not come wherefore exclaimed both simultaneously because it is neither fit nor proper that i cross into wales at this time and in this manner when i go into wales i should wish to go in a new suit of superfine black with hat and beaver mounted on a powerful steed black and glossy like that which bore greduv to the fight of catraeth i should wish moreover to see the welshmen assembled on the border ready to welcome me with pipe and fiddle and much whooping and shouting and to attend me to wrexham or even as far as machynllaith where i should wish to be invited to a dinner at which all the bards should be present and to be seated at the right hand of the president who when the cloth was removed should arise and amidst cries of silence exclaimbrethren and welshmen allow me to propose the health of my most respectable friend the translator of the odes of the great ab gwilym the pride and glory of wales how said peter hast thou translated the works of the mighty dafydd with notes critical historical and explanatory come with us friend said peter i cannot promise such a dinner as thou wishest but neither pipe nor fiddle shall be wanting come with us young man said winifred even as thou art and the daughters of wales shall bid thee welcome i will not go with you said i dost thou see that man in the ford who is staring at us so and whose horse has not yet done drinking of course i see him i shall turn back with him god bless you go back with him not said peter he is one of those whom i like not one of the clibbertyclabber as master ellis wynobservesturn not with that man go not back with him said winifred if thou goest with that man thou wilt soon forget all our profitable counsels come with us i cannot i have much to say to him kosko divous mr petulengro kosko divous pal said mr petulengro riding through the water are you turning back i turned back with mr petulengro peter came running after me one moment young man who and what are you i must answer in the words of taliesin said i none can say with positiveness whether i be fish or flesh least of all myself god bless you both take this said peter and he thrust his welsh bible into my handchapter lxxxi at a funeraltwo days agovery coollyroman womanwell and heartysomewhat drearyplum pudding roman fashionquite differentthe dark lanebeyond the timefine fellowsuch a strugglelike a wild cat fair playpleasant enough spotno gloves so i turned back with mr petulengro we travelled for some time in silence at last we fell into discourse you have been in wales mr petulengro ay truly brother what have you been doing there assisting at a funeral at whose funeral mrs hernes brother is she dead then as a nail brother how did she die by hanging brother i am lost in astonishment said i whereupon mr petulengro lifting his sinister leg over the neck of his steed and adjusting himself sideways in the saddle replied with great deliberation two days ago i happened to be at a fair not very far from here i was all alone by myself for our party were upwards of forty miles off when who should come up but a chap that i knew a relation or rather a connection of mine one of those hernes arnt you going to the funeral said he and then brother there passed between him and me in the way of questioning and answering much the same as has just now passed between i and you but when he mentioned hanging i thought i could do no less than ask who hanged her which you forgot to do who hanged her said i and then the man told me that she had done it herself been her own hinjiri and then i thought to myself what a sin and shame it would be if i did not go to the funeral seeing that she was my own motherinlaw i would have brought my wife and indeed the whole of our party but there was no time for that they were too far off and the dead was to be buried early the next morning so i went with the man and he led me into wales where his party had lately retired and when there through many wild and desolate places to their encampment and there i found the hernes and the dead bodythe last laid out on a mattress in a tent dressed romaneskoenæs in a red cloak and big bonnet of black beaver i must say for the hernes that they took the matter very coolly some were eating others drinking and some were talking about their small affairs there was one however who did not take the matter so coolly but took on enough for the whole family sitting beside the dead woman tearing her hair and refusing to take either meat or drink it was the child leonora i arrived at nightfall and the burying was not to take place till the morning which i was rather sorry for as i am not very fond of them hernes who are not very fond of anybody they never asked me to eat or drink notwithstanding i had married into the family one of them however came up and offered to fight me for five shillings had it not been for them i should have come back as empty as i wenthe didnt stand up five minutes brother i passed the night as well as i could beneath a tree for the tents were full and not over clean i slept little and had my eyes about me for i knew the kind of people i was among early in the morning the funeral took place the body was placed not in a coffin but on a bier and carried not to a churchyard but to a deep dell close by and there it was buried beneath a rock dressed just as i have told you and this was done by the bidding of leonora who had heard her bebee say that she wished to be buried not in gorgeous fashion but like a roman woman of the old blood the kosko puro rati brother when it was over and we had got back to the encampment i prepared to be going before mounting my gry however i bethought me to ask what could have induced the dead woman to make away with herself a thing so uncommon amongst romanies whereupon one squinted with his eyes a second spirted saliver into the air and a third said that he neither knew nor cared she was a good riddance having more than once been nearly the ruin of them all from the quantity of brimstone she carried about her one however i suppose rather ashamed of the way in which they had treated me said at last that if i wanted to know all about the matter none could tell me better than the child who was in all her secrets and was not a little like her so i looked about for the child but could find her nowhere at last the same man told me that he shouldnt wonder if i found her at the grave so i went back to the grave and sure enough there i found the child leonora seated on the ground above the body crying and taking on so i spoke kindly to her and said how came all this leonora tell me all about it it was a long time before i could get any answer at last she opened her mouth and spoke and these were the wordsshe said it was all along of your pal and then she told me all about the matter how mrs herne could not abide you which i knew before and that she had sworn your destruction which i did not know before and then she told me how she found you living in the wood by yourself and how you were enticed to eat a poisoned cake and she told me many other things that you wot of and she told me what perhaps you dont wot namely that finding that you had been removed she the child had tracked you a long way and found you at last well and hearty and no ways affected by the poison and heard you as she stood concealed disputing about religion with a welsh methody well brother she told me all this and moreover that when mrs herne heard of it she said that a dream of hers had come to pass i dont know what it was but something about herself a tinker and a dean and then she added that it was all up with her and that she must take a long journey well brother that same night leonora waking from her sleep in the tent where mrs herne and she were wont to sleep missed her bebee and becoming alarmed went in search of her and at last found her hanging from a branch and when the child had got so far she took on violently and i could not get another word from her so i left her and here i am and i am glad to see you mr petulengro but this is sad news which you tell me about mrs herne somewhat dreary brother yet perhaps after all it is a good thing that she is removed she carried so much devils tinder about with her as the man said i am sorry for her said i more especially as i am the cause of her deaththough the innocent one she could not bide you brother thats certain but that is no reasonsaid mr petulengro balancing himself upon the saddlethat is no reason why she should prepare drow to take away your essence of life and when disappointed to hang herself upon a tree if she was dissatisfied with you she might have flown at you and scratched your face or if she did not judge herself your match she might have put down five shillings for a turnup between you and some one she thought could beat youmyself for example and so the matter might have ended comfortably but she was always too fond of covert wars drows and brimstones this is not the first poisoning affair she has been engaged in you allude to drabbing bawlor bah said mr petulengro theres no harm in that no no she has cast drows in her time for other guess things than bawlor both gorgios and romans have tasted of them and died did you never hear of the poisoned plum pudding never then i will tell you about it it happened about six years ago a few months after she had quitted usshe had gone first amongst her own people as she called them but there was another small party of romans with whom she soon became very intimate it so happened that this small party got into trouble whether it was about a horse or an ass or passing bad money no matter to you and me who had no hand in the business three or four of them were taken and lodged in castle and amongst them was a woman but the sherengro or principal man of the party and who it seems had most hand in the affair was still at large all of a sudden a rumour was spread abroad that the woman was about to play false and to peach the rest said the principal man when he heard it if she does i am nashkado mrs herne was then on a visit to the party and when she heard the principal man take on so she said but i suppose you know what to do i do not said he then hir mi devlis said she you are a fool but leave the matter to me i know how to dispose of her in roman fashion why she wanted to interfere in the matter brother i dont know unless it was from pure brimstoneness of dispositionshe had no hand in the matter which had brought the party into troubleshe was only on a visit and it had happened before she came but she was always ready to give dangerous advice well brother the principal man listened to what she had to say and let her do what she would and she made a pudding a very nice one no doubtfor besides plums she put in drows and all the roman condiments that she knew of and she gave it to the principal man and the principal man put it into a basket and directed it to the woman in castle and the woman in the castle took it and ate of it said i just like my case quite different brother she took it it is true but instead of giving way to her appetite as you might have done she put it before the rest whom she was going to impeachperhaps she wished to see how they liked it before she tasted it herselfand all the rest were poisoned and one died and there was a precious outcry and the woman cried the loudest of all and she said it was my death was sought for i know the man and ill be revenged and then the poknees spoke to her and said where can we find him and she said i am awake to his motions three weeks from hence the night before the full moon at such and such an hour he will pass down such a lane with such a man well said i and what did the poknees do do brother sent for a plastramengro from bow street quite secretly and told him what the woman had said and the night before the full moon the plastramengro went to the place which the juwa had pointed out all alone brother and inorder that he might not be too late he went two hours before his time i know the place well brother where the plastramengro placed himself behind a thick hollytree at the end of a lane where a gate leads into various fields through which there is a path for carts and horses the lane is called the dark lane by the gorgios being much shaded by trees so the plastramengro placed himself in the dark lane behind the holly tree it was a cold february night dreary though the wind blew in gusts and the moon had not yet risen and the plastramengro waited behind the tree till he was tired and thought he might as well sit down so he sat down and was not long in falling to sleep and there he slept for some hours and when he awoke the moon had risen and was shining bright so that there was a kind of moonlight even in the dark lane and the plastramengro pulled out his watch and contrived to make out that it was just two hours beyond the time when the men should have passed by brother i do not know what the plastramengro thought of himself but i know brother what i should have thought of myself in his situation i should have thought brother that i was a drowsy scoppelo and that i had let the fellow pass by whilst i was sleeping behind a bush as it turned out however his going to sleep did no harm but quite the contrary just as he was going away he heard a gate slam in the direction of the fields and then he heard the low stumping of horses as if on soft ground for the path in those fields is generally soft and at that time it had been lately ploughed up well brother presently he saw two men on horseback coming towards the lane through the field behind the gate the man who rode foremost was a tall big fellow the very man he was in quest of the other was a smaller chap not so small either but a light wiry fellow and a proper master of his hands when he sees occasion for using them well brother the foremost man came to the gate reached at the hank undid it and rode through holding it open for the other before however the other could follow into the lane out bolted the plastramengro from behind the tree kicked the gate too with his foot and seizing the big man on horseback you are my prisoner said he i am of opinion brother that plastramengro notwithstanding he went to sleep must have been a regular fine fellow i am entirely of your opinion said i but what happened then why brother the rommany chal after he had somewhat recovered from his surprise for it is rather uncomfortable to be laid hold of at nighttime and told you are a prisoner more especially when you happen to have two or three things on your mind which if proved against you would carry you to the nashky the rommany chal i say clubbed his whip and aimed a blow at the plastramengro which if it had hit him on the skull as was intended would very likely have cracked it the plastramengro however received it partly on his staff so that it did him no particular damage whereupon seeing what kind of customer he had to deal with he dropped his staff and seized the chal with both his hands who forthwith spurred his horse hoping by doing so either to break away from him or fling him down but it would not dothe plastramengro held on like a bulldog so that the rommany chal to escape being hauled to the ground suddenly flung himself off the saddle and then happened in that lane close by the gate such a struggle between those twothe chal and the runneras i suppose will never happen again but you must have heard of it every one has heard of the fight between the bow street engro and the rommany chal i never heard of it till now all england rung of it brother there never was a better match than between those two the runner was somewhat the stronger of the twoall these engroes are strong fellowsand a great deal cooler for all of that sort are wondrous cool peoplehe had however to do with one who knew full well how to take his own part the chal fought the engro brother in the old roman fashion he bit he kicked and screamed like a wild cat of benygant casting foam from his mouth and fire from his eyes sometimes he was beneath the engros legs and sometimes he was upon his shoulders what the engro found the most difficult was to get a firm hold of the chal for no sooner did he seize the chal by any part of his wearing apparel than the chal either tore himself away or contrived to slip out of it so that in a little time the chal was three parts naked and as for holding him by the body it was out of the question for he was as slippery as an eel at last the engro seized the chal by the belchers handkerchief which he wore in a knot round his neck and do whatever the chal could he could not free himself and when the engro saw that it gave him fresh heart no doubt its of no use said he you had better give in hold out your hands for the darbies or i will throttle you and what did the other fellow do who came with the chal said i i sat still on my horse brother you said i were you the man i was he brother and why did you not help your comrade i have fought in the ring brother and what had fighting in the ring to do with fighting in the laneyou mean not fighting a great deal brother it taught me to prize fair play when i fought staffordshire dick tother side of london i was alone brother not a rommany chal to back me and he had all his brother pals about him but they gave me fair play brother and i beat staffordshire dick which i couldnt have done had they put one finger on his side the scale for he was as good a man as myself or nearly so now brother had i but bent a finger in favour of the rommany chal the plastramengro would never have come alive out of the lane but i did not for i thought to myself fair play is a precious stone so you see brother that you are quite right mr petulengro i see that clearly and now pray proceed with your narration it is both moral and entertaining but mr petulengro did not proceed with his narration neither did he proceed upon his way he had stopped his horse and his eyes were intently fixed on a broad strip of grass beneath some lofty trees on the left side of the road it was a pleasant enough spot and seemed to invite wayfaring people such as we were to rest from the fatigues of the road and the heat and vehemence of the sun after examining it for a considerable time mr petulengro said i say brother that would be a nice place for a tuzzle i dare say it would said i if two people were inclined to fight the ground is smooth said mr petulengro without holes or ruts and the trees cast much shade i dont think brother that we could find a better place said mr petulengro springing from his horse but you and i dont want to fight speak for yourself brother said mr petulengro however i will tell you how the matter stands there is a point at present between us there can be no doubt that you are the cause of mrs hernes death innocently you will say but still the cause now i shouldnt like it to be known that i went up and down the country with a pal who was the cause of my motherinlaws death thats to say unless he gave me satisfaction now if i and my pal have a tuzzle he gives me satisfaction and if he knocks my eyes out which i know you cant do it makes no difference at all he gives me satisfaction and he who says to the contrary knows nothing of gypsy law and is a dinelo into the bargain but we have no gloves gloves said mr petulengro contemptuously gloves i tell you what brother i always thought you were a better hand at the gloves than the naked fist and to tell you the truth besides taking satisfaction for mrs hernes death i wish to see what you can do with your morleys so now is your time brother and this is your place grass and shade no ruts or holes come on brother or i shall think you what i should not like to call youchapter lxxxii offence and defenceim satisfiedfond of solitudepossession of propertychal devlehiwinding path and when i heard mr petulengro talk in this manner which i had never heard him do before and which i can only account for by his being fasting and illtempered i had of course no other alternative than to accept his challenge so i put myself into a posture which i deemed the best both for offence and defence and the tuzzle commenced and when it had endured for about half an hour mr petulengro said brother there is much blood on your face you had better wipe it off and when i had wiped it off and again resumed my former attitude mr petulengro said i think enough has been done brother in the affair of the old woman i have moreover tried what you are able to do and find you as i thought less apt with the naked morleys than the stuffed gloves nay brother put your hands down im satisfied blood has been shed which is all that can be reasonably expected for an old woman who carried so much brimstone about with her as mrs herne so the struggle ended and we resumed our route mr petulengro sitting sideways upon his horse as before and i driving my little ponycart and when he had proceeded about three miles we came to a small publichouse which bore the sign of the silent woman where we stopped to refresh our cattle and ourselves and as we sat over our bread and ale it came to pass that mr petulengro asked me various questions and amongst others how i intended to dispose of myself i told him that i did not know whereupon with considerable frankness he invited me to his camp and told me that if i chose to settle down amongst them and become a rommany chal i should have his wifes sister ursula who was still unmarried and occasionally talked of me i declined his offer assigning as a reason the recent death of mrs herne of which i was the cause although innocent a pretty life i should lead with those two said i when they came to know it pooh said mr petulengro they will never know it i shant blab and as for leonora that girl has a head on her shoulders unlike the woman in the sign said i whose head is cut off you speak nonsense mr petulengro as long as a woman has a head on her shoulders shell talkbut leaving women out of the case it is impossible to keep anything a secret an old master of mine told me so long ago i have moreover another reason for declining your offer i am at present not disposed for society i am become fond of solitude i wish i could find some quiet place to which i could retire to hold communion with my own thoughts and practise if i thought fit either of my trades what trades said mr petulengro why the one which i have lately been engaged in or my original one which i confess i should like better that of a kaulomescro ah i have frequently heard you talk of making horseshoes said mr petulengro i however never saw you make one and no one else that i am aware i dont believecome brother dont be angry its quite possible that you may have done things which neither i nor any one else has seen you do and that such things may some day or other come to light as you say nothing can be kept secret be that however as it may pay the reckoning and let us be going i think i can advise you to just such a kind of place as you seem to want and how do you know that i have got wherewithal to pay the reckoning i demanded brother said mr petulengro i was just now looking in your face which exhibited the very look of a person conscious of the possession of property there was nothing hungry or sneaking in it pay the reckoning brother and when we were once more upon the road mr petulengro began to talk of the place which he conceived would serve me as a retreat under present circumstances i tell you frankly brother that it is a queer kind of place and i am not very fond of pitching my tent in it it is so surprisingly dreary it is a deep dingle in the midst of a large field on an estate about which there has been a lawsuit for some years past i dare say you will be quiet enough for the nearest town is five miles distant and there are only a few huts and hedge publichouses in the neighbourhood brother i am fond of solitude myself but not that kind of solitude i like a quiet heath where i can pitch my house but i always like to have a gay stirring place not far off where the women can pen dukkerin and i myself can sell or buy a horse if needfulsuch a place as the chong gav i never feel so merry as when there brother or on the heath above it where i taught you rommany shortly after this discourse we reached a milestone and a few yards from the milestone on the left hand was a crossroad thereupon mr petulengro said brother my path lies to the left if you choose to go with me to my camp good if not chal devlehi but i again refused mr petulengros invitation and shaking him by the hand proceeded forward alone and about ten miles farther on i reached the town of which he had spoken and following certain directions which he had given discovered though not without some difficulty the dingle which he had mentioned it was a deep hollow in the midst of a wide field the shelving sides were overgrown with trees and bushes a belt of sallows surrounded it on the top a steep winding path led down into the depths practicable however for a light cart like mine at the bottom was an open space and there i pitched my tent and there i contrived to put up my forge i will here ply the trade of kaulomescro said ichapter lxxxiii highly poeticalvolundrgrecian mythologymaking a petultongues of flamehammeringspite of dukkerin heaviness it has always struck me that there is something highly poetical about a forge i am not singular in this opinion various individuals have assured me that they can never pass by one even in the midst of a crowded town without experiencing sensations which they can scarcely define but which are highly pleasurable i have a decided penchant for forges especially rural ones placed in some quaint quiet spota dingle for example which is a poetical place or at a meeting of four roads which is still more so for how many a superstitionand superstition is the soul of poetryis connected with these cross roads i love to light upon such a one especially after nightfall as everything about a forge tells to most advantage at night the hammer sounds more solemnly in the stillness the glowing particles scattered by the strokes sparkle with more effect in the darkness whilst the sooty visage of the sastramescro half in shadow and half illumined by the red and partial blaze of the forge looks more mysterious and strange on such occasions i draw in my horses rein and seated in the saddle endeavour to associate with the picture before mein itself a picture of romance whatever of the wild and wonderful i have read of in books or have seen with my own eyes in connection with forges i believe the life of any blacksmith especially a rural one would afford materials for a highly poetical history i do not speak unadvisedly having the honour to be free of the forge and therefore fully competent to give an opinion as to what might be made out of the forge by some dextrous hand certainly the strangest and most entertaining life ever written is that of a blacksmith of the olden north a certain volundr or velint who lived in woods and thickets made keen swords so keen indeed that if placed in a running stream they would fairly divide an object however slight which was borne against them by the water and who eventually married a kings daughter by whom he had a son who was as bold a knight as his father was a cunning blacksmith i never see a forge at night when seated on the back of my horse at the bottom of a dark lane but i somehow or other associate it with the exploits of this extraordinary fellow with many other extraordinary things amongst which as i have hinted before are particular passages of my own life one or two of which i shall perhaps relate to the reader i never associate vulcan and his cyclops with the idea of a forge these gentry would be the very last people in the world to flit across my mind whilst gazing at the forge from the bottom of the dark lane the truth is they are highly unpoetical fellows as well they may be connected as they are with the grecian mythology at the very mention of their names the forge burns dull and dim as if snowballs had been suddenly flung into it the only remedy is to ply the bellows an operation which i now hasten to perform i am in the dingle making a horseshoe having no other horses on whose hoofs i could exercise my art i made my first essay on those of my own horse if that could be called horse which horse was none being only a pony perhaps if i had sought all england i should scarcely have found an animal more in need of the kind offices of the smith on three of his feet there were no shoes at all and on the fourth only a remnant of one on which account his hoofs were sadly broken and lacerated by his late journeys over the hard and flinty roads you belonged to a tinker before said i addressing the animal but now you belong to a smith it is said that the household of the shoemaker invariably go worse shod than that of any other craft that may be the case of those who make shoes of leather but it shant be said of the household of him who makes shoes of iron at any rate it shant be said of mine i tell you what my gry whilst you continue with me you shall both be better shod and better fed than you were with your last master i am in the dingle making a petul and i must here observe that whilst i am making a horseshoe the reader need not be surprised if i speak occasionally in the language of the lord of the horseshoemr petulengro i have for some time past been plying the peshota or bellows endeavouring to raise up the yag or fire in my primitive forge the angar or coals are now burning fiercely casting forth sparks and long vagescoe chipes or tongues of flame a small bar of sastra or iron is lying in the fire to the length of ten or twelve inches and so far it is hot very hot exceedingly hot brother and now you see me prala snatch the bar of iron and place the heated end of it upon the covantza or anvil and forthwith i commence cooring the sastra as hard as if i had been just engaged by a master at the rate of dui caulor or two shillings a day brother and when i have beaten the iron till it is nearly cool and my arm tired i place it again in the angar and begin again to rouse the fire with the pudamengro which signifies the blowing thing and is another and more common word for bellows and whilst thus employed i sing a gypsy song the sound of which is wonderfully in unison with the hoarse moaning of the pudamengro and ere the song is finished the iron is again hot and malleable behold i place it once more on the covantza and recommence hammering and now i am somewhat at fault i am in want of assistance i want you brother or some one else to take the bar out of my hand and support it upon the covantza whilst i applying a chinomescro or kind of chisel to the heated iron cut off with a lusty stroke or two of the shukaro baro or big hammer as much as is required for the petul but having no one to help me i go on hammering till i have fairly knocked off as much as i want and then i place the piece in the fire and again apply the bellows and take up the song where i left it off and when i have finished the song i take out the iron but this time with my plaistra or pincers and then i recommence hammering turning the iron round and round with my pincers and now i bend the iron and lo and behold it hasassumed something of the outline of a petul i am not going to enter into farther details with respect to the processit was rather a wearisome one i had to contend with various disadvantages my forge was a rude one my tools might have been better i was in want of one or two highly necessary implements but above all manual dexterity though free of the forge i had not practised the albeytarian art for very many years never sincebut stay it is not my intention to tell the reader at least in this place how and when i became a blacksmith there was one thing however which stood me in good stead in my labour the same thing which through life has ever been of incalculable utility to me and has not unfrequently supplied the place of friends money and many other things of almost equal importanceiron perseverance without which all the advantages of time and circumstance are of very little avail in any undertaking i was determined to make a horseshoe and a good one in spite of every obstacleay in spite of dukkerin at the end of four days during which i had fashioned and refashioned the thing at least fifty times i had made a petul such as no master of the craft need have been ashamed of with the second shoe i had less difficulty and by the time i had made the fourth i would have scorned to take off my hat to the best smith in cheshire but i had not yet shod my little gry this i proceeded now to do after having first well pared the hoofs with my churi i applied each petul hot glowing hot to the pindro oh how the hoofs hissed and oh the pleasant pungent odour which diffused itself through the dingle an odour good for an ailing spirit i shod the little horse bravelymerely pricked him once slightly with a cafi for doing which i remember he kicked me down i was not disconcerted however but getting up promised to be more cautious in future and having finished the operation i filed the hoof well with the rin baro then dismissed him to graze amongst the trees and putting my smaller tools into the muchtar i sat down on my stone and supporting my arm upon my knee leaned my head upon my hand heaviness had come over mechapter lxxxiv several causesfrogs and eftesgloom and twilightwhat should i doour fatherfellow menwhat a mercyalmost calmfresh storehistory of saulpitch dark heaviness had suddenly come over me heaviness of heart and of body also i had accomplished the task which i had imposed upon myself and now that nothing more remained to do my energies suddenly deserted me and i felt without strength and without hope several causes perhaps cooperated to bring about the state in which i then felt myself it is not improbable that my energies had been overstrained during the work the progress of which i have attempted to describe and every one is aware that the results of overstrained energies are feebleness and lassitudewant of nourishment might likewise have something to do with it during my sojourn in the dingle my food has been of the simplest and most unsatisfying description by no means calculated to support the exertions which the labour i had been engaged upon required it had consisted of coarse oaten cakes and hard cheese and for beverage i had been indebted to a neighbouring pit in which in the heat of the day i frequently saw not golden or silver fish but frogs and eftes swimming about i am however inclined to believe that mrs hernes cake had quite as much to do with the matter as insufficient nourishment i had never entirely recovered from the effects of its poison but had occasionally especially at night been visited by a grinding pain in the stomach and my whole body had been suffused with cold sweat and indeed these memorials of the drow have never entirely disappearedeven at the present time they display themselves in my system especially after much fatigue of body and excitement of mind so there i sat in the dingle upon my stone nerveless and hopeless by whatever cause or causes that state had been producedthere i sat with my head leaning upon my hand and so i continued a long long time at last i lifted my head from my hand and began to cast anxious unquiet looks about the dinglethe entire hollow was now enveloped in deep shadei cast my eyes up there was a golden gleam on the tops of the trees which grew towards the upper parts of the dingle but lower down all was gloom and twilightyet when i first sat down on my stone the sun was right above the dingle illuminating all its depths by the rays which it cast perpendicularly downso i must have sat a long long time upon my stone and now once more i rested my head upon my hand but almost instantly lifted it again in a kind of fear and began looking at the objects before me the forge the tools the branches of the trees endeavouring to follow their rows till they were lost in the darkness of the dingle and now i found my right hand grasping convulsively the three fore fingers of the left first collectively and then successively wringing them till the joints cracked then i became quiet but not for long suddenly i started up and could scarcely repress the shriek which was rising to my lips was it possible yes all too certain the evil one was upon me the inscrutable horror which i had felt in my boyhood had once more taken possession of me i had thought that it had forsaken me that it would never visit me again that i had outgrown it that i might almost bid defiance to it and i had even begun to think of it without horror as we are in the habit of doing of horrors of which we conceive we run no danger and lo when least thought of it had seized me again every moment i felt it gathering force and making me more wholly its own what should i doresist of course and i did resist i grasped i tore and strove to fling it from me but of what avail were my efforts i could only have got rid of it by getting rid of myself it was a part of myself or rather it was all myself i rushed amongst the trees and struck at them with my bare fists and dashed my head against them but i felt no pain how could i feel pain with that horror upon me and then i flung myself on the ground gnawed the earth and swallowed it and then i looked round it was almost total darkness in the dingle and the darkness added to my horror i could no longer stay there up i rose from the ground and attempted to escape at the bottom of the winding path which led up the acclivity i fell over something which was lying on the ground the something moved and gave a kind of whine it was my little horse which had made that place its lair my little horse my only companion and friend in that now awful solitude i reached the mouth of the dingle the sun was just sinking in the far west behind me the fields were flooded with his last gleams how beautiful everything looked in the last gleams of the sun i felt relieved for a moment i was no longer in the horrid dingle in another minute the sun was gone and a big cloud occupied the place where he had been in a little time it was almost as dark as it had previously been in the open part of the dingle my horror increased what was i to doit was of no use fighting against the horror that i saw the more i fought against it the stronger it became what should i do say my prayers ah why not so i knelt down under the hedge and said our father but that was of no use and now i could no longer repress cries the horror was too great to be borne what should i do run to the nearest town or village and request the assistance of my fellowmen no that i was ashamed to do notwithstanding the horror was upon me i was ashamed to do that i knew they would consider me a maniac if i went screaming amongst them and i did not wish to be considered a maniac moreover i knew that i was not a maniac for i possessed all my reasoning powers only the horror was upon methe screaming horror but how were indifferent people to distinguish between madness and this screaming horror so i thought and reasoned and at last i determined not to go amongst my fellowmen whatever the result might be i went to the mouth of the dingle and there placing myself on my knees i again said the lords prayer but it was of no use praying seemed to have no effect over the horror the unutterable fear appeared rather to increase than diminish and i again uttered wild cries so loud that i was apprehensive they would be heard by some chance passenger on the neighbouring road i therefore went deeper into the dingle i sat down with my back against a thorn bush the thorns entered my flesh and when i felt them i pressed harder against the bush i thought the pain of the flesh might in some degree counteract the mental agony presently i felt them no longer the power of the mental horror was so great that it was impossible with that upon me to feel any painfrom the thorns i continued in this posture a long time undergoing what i cannot describe and would not attempt if i were able several times i was on the point of starting up and rushing anywhere but i restrained myself for i knew i could not escape from myself so why should i not remain in the dingle so i thought and said to myself for my reasoning powers were still uninjured at last it appeared to me that the horror was not so strong not quite so strong upon me was it possible that it was relaxing its grasp releasing its prey o what a mercy but it could not beand yet i looked up to heaven and clasped my hands and said our father i said no more i was too agitated and now i was almost sure that the horror had done its worst after a little time i arose and staggered down yet farther into the dingle i again found my little horse on the same spot as before i put my hand to his mouth he licked my hand i flung myself down by him and put my arms round his neck the creature whinnied and appeared to sympathize with me what a comfort to have any one even a dumb brute to sympathize with me at such a moment i clung to my little horse as if for safety and protection i laid my head on his neck and felt almost calm presently the fear returned but not so wild as before it subsided came again again subsided then drowsiness came over me and at last i fell asleep my head supported on the neck of the little horse i awoke it was dark dark nightnot a star was to be seenbut i felt no fear the horror had left me i arose from the side of the little horse and went into my tent lay down and again went to sleep i awoke in the morning weak and sore and shuddering at the remembrance of what i had gone through on the preceding day the sun was shining brightly but it had not yet risen high enough to show its head above the trees which fenced the eastern side of the dingle on which account the dingle was wet and dank from the dews of the night i kindled my fire and after sitting by it for some time to warm my frame i took some of the coarse food which i have already mentioned notwithstanding my late struggle and the coarseness of the fare i ate with appetite my provisions had by this time been very much diminished and i saw that it would be speedily necessary in the event of my continuing to reside in the dingle to lay in a fresh store after my meal i went to the pit and filled a can with water which i brought to the dingle and then again sat down on my stone i considered what i should next do it was necessary to do something or my life in this solitude would be insupportable what should i do rouse up my forge and fashion a horseshoe but i wanted nerve and heart for such an employment moreover i had no motive for fatiguing myself in this manner my own horse was shod no other was at hand and it is hard to work for the sake of working what should i do read yes but i had no other book than the bible which the welsh methodist had given me well why not read the bible i was once fond of reading the bible ay but those days were long gone by however i did not see what else i could do on the present occasionso i determined to read the bibleit was in welsh at any rate it might amuse me so i took the bible out of the sack in which it was lying in the cart and began to read at the place where i chanced to open it i opened it at that part where the history of saul commences at first i read with indifference but after some time my attention was riveted and no wonder i had come to the visitations of saul those dark moments of his when he did and said such unaccountable things it almost appeared to me that i was reading of myself i too had my visitations dark as ever his were o how i sympathized with saul the tall dark man i had read his life before but it had made no impression on me it had never occurred to me that i was like him but i now sympathized with saul for my own dark hour was but recently passed and perhaps would soon return again the dark hour came frequently on saul time wore away i finished the book of saul and closing the volume returned it to its place i then returned to my seat on the stone and thought of what i had read and what i had lately undergone all at once i thought i felt wellknown sensations a cramping of the breast and a tingling of the soles of the feetthey were what i had felt on the preceding day they were the forerunners of the fear i sat motionless on my stone the sensations passed away and the fear came not darkness was now coming again over the earth the dingle was again in deep shade i roused the fire with the breath of the bellows and sat looking at the cheerful glow it was cheering and comforting my little horse came now and lay down on the ground beside the forge i was not quite deserted i again ate some of the coarse food and drank plentifully of the water which i had fetched in the morning i then put fresh fuel on the fire and sat for a long time looking on the blaze i then went into my tent i awoke on my own calculation about midnightit was pitch dark and there was much fear upon mechapter lxxxv free and independenti dont see whyoatsa noiseunwelcome visitorswhats the mattergood day to ye the tall

the period to which i have brought the reader in the preceding chapter i sat by my fire at the bottom of the dingle i had just breakfasted and had finished the last morsel of food which i had brought with me to that solitude what shall i now do said i to myself shall i continue here or decampthis is a sad lonely spotperhaps i had better quit it but whither should i go the wide world is before me but what can i do therein i have been in the world already without much success no i had better remain here the place is lonely it is true but here i am free and independent and can do what i please but i cant remain here without food well i will find my way to the nearest town lay in a fresh supply of provision and come back turning my back upon the world which has turned its back upon me i dont see why i should not write a little sometimes i have pens and an inkhorn and for a writingdesk i can place the bible on my knee i shouldnt wonder if i could write a capital satire on the world on the back of that bible but first of all i must think of supplying myself with food i rose up from the stone on which i was seated determining to go to the nearest town with my little horse and cart and procure what i wantedthe nearest town according to my best calculation lay about five miles distant i had no doubt however that by using ordinary diligence i should be back before evening in order to go lighter i determined to leave my tent standing as it was and all the things which i had purchased of the tinker just as they were i need not be apprehensive on their account said i to myself nobody will come here to meddle with themthe great recommendation of this place is its perfect solitudei dare say that i could live here six months without seeing a single human visage i will now harness my little gry and be off to the town at a whistle which i gave the little gry which was feeding on the bank near the uppermost part of the dingle came running to me for by this time he had become so accustomed to me that he would obey my call for all the world as if he had been one of the canine species now said i to him we are going to the town to buy bread for myself and oats for youi am in a hurry to be back therefore i pray you to do your best and to draw me and the cart to the town with all possible speed and to bring us back if you do your best i promise you oats on your return you know the meaning of oats ambrol ambrol whinnied as if to let me know that he understood me perfectly well as indeed he well might as i had never once fed him during the time he had been in my possession without saying the word in question to him now ambrol in the gypsy tongue signifieth a pear so i caparisoned ambrol and then going to the cart i removed two or three things from out it into the tent i then lifted up the shafts and was just going to call to the pony to come and be fastened to them when i thought i heard a noise i stood stock still supporting the shafts of the little cart in my hand and bending the right side of my face slightly towards the ground but i could hear nothing the noise which i thought i had heard was not one of those sounds which i was accustomed to hear in that solitude the note of a bird or the rustling of a bough it wasthere i heard it again a sound very much resembling the grating of a wheel amongst gravel could it proceed from the road oh no the road was too far distant for me to hear the noise of anything moving along it again i listened and now i distinctly heard the sound of wheels which seemed to be approaching the dingle nearer and nearer they drew and presently the sound of wheels was blended with the murmur of voices anon i heard a boisterous shout which seemed to proceed from the entrance of the dingle here are folks at hand said i letting the shaft of the cart fall to the ground is it possible that they can be coming here my doubts on that point if i entertained any were soon dispelled the wheels which had ceased moving for a moment or two where once again in motion and were now evidently moving down the winding path which led to my retreat leaving my cart i came forward and placed myself near the entrance of the open space with my eyes fixed on the path down which my unexpected and i may say unwelcome visitors were coming presently i heard a stamping or sliding as if of a horse in some difficulty and then a loud curse and the next moment appeared a man and a horse and cart the former holding the head of the horse up to prevent him from falling of which he was in danger owing to the precipitous nature of the path whilst thus occupied the head of the man was averted from me when however he had reached the bottom of the descent he turned his head and perceiving me as i stood bareheaded without either coat or waistcoat about two yards from him he gave a sudden start so violent that the backward motion of his hand had nearly flung the horse upon his haunches why dont you move forward said a voice from behind apparently that of a female you are stopping up the way andwe shall be all down upon one another and i saw the head of another horse overtopping the back of the cart why dont you move forward jack said another voice also of a female yet higher up the path the man stirred not but remained staring at me in the posture which he had assumed on first perceiving me his body very much drawn back his left foot far in advance of his right and with his right hand still grasping the halter of the horse which gave way more and more till it was clean down on its haunches what is the matter said the voice which i had last heard get back with you belle moll said the man still staring at me heres something not overcanny or comfortable what is it said the same voice let me pass moll and ill soon clear the way and i heard a kind of rushing down the path you need not be afraid said i addressing myself to the man i mean you no harm i am a wanderer like yourself come here to seek for shelteryou need not be afraid i am a rome chabo by matriculationone of the right sort and no mistakegood day to ye brother i bids ye welcome the man eyed me suspiciously for a momentthen turning to his horse with a loud curse he pulled him up from his haunches and led him and the cart farther down to one side of the dingle muttering as he passed me afraid hm i do not remember ever to have seen a more ruffianlylooking fellow he was about six feet high with an immensely athletic frame his face was black and bluff and sported an immense pair of whiskers but with here and there a grey hair for his age could not be much under fifty he wore a faded blue frock coat corduroys and highlowson his black head was a kind of red nightcap round his bull neck a barcelona handkerchiefi did not like the look of the man at all afraid growled the fellow proceeding to unharness his horse that was the word i think but other figures were now already upon the scene dashing past the other horse and cart which by this time had reached the bottom of the pass appeared an exceedingly tall woman or rather girl for she could scarcely have been above eighteen she was dressed in a tight bodice and a blue stuff gown hat bonnet or cap she had none and her hair which was flaxen hung down on her shoulders unconfined her complexion was fair and her features handsome with a determined but open expressionshe was followed by another female about forty stout and vulgarlooking at whom i scarcely glanced my whole attention being absorbed by the tall girl whats the matter jack said the latter looking at the man only afraid thats all said the man still proceeding with his work afraid at whatat that lad why he looks like a ghosti would engage to thrash him with one hand you might beat me with no hands at all said i fair damsel only by looking at mei never saw such a face and figure both regalwhy you look like ingeborg queen of norway she had twelve brothers you know and could lick them all though they were heroes on dovrefeld in norway were once together seen the twelve heroic brothers of ingeborg the queen none of your chaffing young fellow said the tall girl or i will give you what shall make you wipe your face be civil or you will rue it well perhaps i was a peg too high said i i ask your pardonheres something a bit lower as i was jawing to the gav yeck divvus i met on the drom miro rommany chi none of your rommany chies young fellow said the tall girl looking more menacingly than before and clenching her fist you had better be civil i am none of your chies and though i keep company with gypsies or to speak more proper half and halfs i would have you to know that i come of christian blood and parents and was born in the great house of long melford i have no doubt said i that it was a great house judging from your size i shouldnt wonder if you were born in achurch stay belle said the man putting himself before the young virago who was about to rush upon me my turn is first then advancing to me in a menacing attitude he said with a look of deep malignity afraid was the word wasnt it it was said i but i think i wronged you i should have said aghast you exhibited every symptom of one labouring under uncontrollable fear the fellow stared at me with a look of stupid ferocity and appeared to be hesitating whether to strike or not ere he could make up his mind the tall girl stepped forward crying hes chaffing let me at him and before i could put myself on my guard she struck me a blow on the face which had nearly brought me to the ground enough said i putting my hand to my cheek you have now performed your promise and made me wipe my face now be pacified and tell me fairly the ground of this quarrel grounds said the fellow didnt you say i was afraid and if you hadnt who gave you leave to camp on my ground is it your ground said i a pretty question said the fellow as if all the world didnt know that do you know who i am i guess i do said i unless i am much mistaken you are he whom folks call the flaming tinman to tell you the truth im glad we have met for i wished to see you these are your two wives i suppose i greet them theres no harm done theres room enough here for all of uswe shall soon be good friends i dare say and when we are a little better acquainted ill tell you my history well if that doesnt beat all said the fellow i dont think hes chaffing now said the girl whose anger seemed to have subsided on a sudden the young man speaks civil enough civil said the fellow with an oath but thats just like you with you it is a blow and all over civil i suppose you would have him stay here and get into all my secrets and hear all i may have to say to my two morts two morts said the girl kindling up where are they speak for one and no more i am no mort of yours whatever some one else may be i tell you one thing black john or anselo for tother ant your name the same thing i told the young man here be civil or you will rue it the fellow looked at the girl furiously but his glance soon quailed before hers he withdrew his eyes and cast them on my little horse which was feeding amongst the trees whats this said he rushing forward and seizing the animal why as i am alive this is the horse of that mumping villain slingsby its his no longer i bought it and paid for it its mine now said the fellow i swore i would seize it the next time i found it on my beat ay and beat the master too i am not slingsby alls one for that you dont say you will beat me afraid was the word im sick and feeble hold up your fists wont the horse satisfy you horse nor bellows either no mercy then heres at youmind your eyes jack there youve got it i thought so shouted the girl as the fellow staggered back from a sharp blow in the eye i thought he was chaffing at you all along never mind anselo you know what to dogo in said the vulgar woman who had hitherto not spoken a word but who now came forward with all the look of a fury go in apopli youll smash ten like he the flaming tinman took her advice and came in bent on smashing but stopped short on receiving a lefthanded blow on the nose youll never beat the flaming tinman in that way said the girl looking at me doubtfully and so i began to think myself when in the twinkling of an eye the flaming tinman disengaging himself of his frockcoat and dashing off his red nightcap came rushing in more desperately than ever to a flush hit which he received in the mouth he paid as little attention as a wild bull would have done in a moment his arms were around me and in another he had hurled me down falling heavily upon me the fellows strength appeared to be tremendous pay him off now said the vulgar woman the flaming tinman made no reply but planting his knee on my breast seized my throat with two huge horny hands i gave myself up for dead and probably should have been so in another minute but for the tall girl who caught hold of the handkerchief which the fellow wore round his neck with a grasp nearly as powerful as that with which he pressed my throat do you call that fair play said she hands off belle said the other woman do you call it fair play to interfere hands off or ill be down upon you myself but belle paid no heed to the injunction and tugged so hard at the handkerchief that the flaming tinman was nearly throttled suddenly relinquishing his hold of me he started on his feet and aimed a blow at my fair preserver who avoided it but said coolly finish tother business first and then im your woman whenever you like but finish it fairlyno foul play when im byill be the boys second and moll can pick up you when he happens to knock you down the battle during the next ten minutes raged with considerable fury but it so happened that during this time i was never able to knock the flaming tinman down but on the contrary received six knockdown blows myself i can never stand this said i as i sat on the knee of belle i am afraid i must give in the flaming tinman hits very hard and i spat out a mouthful of blood sure enough youll never beat the flaming tinman in the way you fightits of no use flipping at the flaming tinman with your left hand why dont you use your right because im not handy with it said i and then getting up i once more confronted the flaming tinman and struck him six blows for his one but they were all lefthanded blows and the blow which the flaming tinman gave me knocked me off my legs now will you use long melford said belle picking me up i dont know what you mean by long melford said i gasping for breath why this long right of yours said belle feeling my right armif you do i shouldnt wonder if you yet stand a chance and now the flaming tinman was once more ready much more ready than myself i however rose from my seconds knee as well as my weakness would permit me on he came striking left and right appearing almost as fresh as to wind and spirit as when he first commenced the combat though his eyes were considerably swelled and his nether lip was cut in two on he came striking left and right and i did not like his blows at all or even the wind of them which was anything but agreeable and i gave way before him at last he aimed a blow which had it taken full effect would doubtless have ended the battle but owing to his slipping the fist only grazed my left shoulder and came with terrific force against a tree close to which i had been driven before the tinman could recover himself i collected all my strength and struck him beneath the ear and then fell to the ground completely exhausted and it so happened that the blow which i struck the tinker beneath the ear was a righthanded blow hurrah for long melford i heard belle exclaim there is nothing like long melford for shortness all the world over at these words i turned round my head as i lay and perceived the flaming tinman stretched upon the ground apparently senseless he is dead said the vulgar woman as she vainly endeavoured to raise him up he is dead the best man in all the north country killed in this fashion by a boy alarmed at these words i made shift to get on my feetand with the assistance of the woman placed my fallen adversary in a sitting posture i put my hand to his heart and felt a slight pulsationhes not dead said i only stunned if he were let blood he would recover presently i produced a penknife which i had in my pocket and baring the arm of the tinman was about to make the necessary incision when the woman gave me a violent blow and pushing me aside exclaimed ill tear the eyes out of your head if you offer to touch him do you want to complete your work and murder him outright now hes asleep you have had enough of his blood already you are mad said i i only seek to do him service well if you wont let him be blooded fetch some water and fling it into his face you know where the pit is a pretty manœuvre said the woman leave my husband in the hands of you and that limmer who has never been true to us i should find him strangled or his throat cut when i came back do you go said i to the tall girl take the can and fetch some water from the pit you had better go yourself said the girl wiping a tear as she looked on the yet senseless form of the tinker you had better go yourself if you think water will do him good i had by this time somewhat recovered my exhausted powers and taking the can i bent my steps as fast as i could to the pit arriving there i lay down on the brink took a long draught and then plunged my head into the water after which i filled the can and bent my way back to the dingle before i could reach the path which led down into its depths i had to pass some way along its side i had arrived at a part immediately over the scene of the last encounter where the bank overgrown with trees sloped precipitously down here i heard a loud sound of voices in the dingle i stopped and laying hold of a tree leaned over the bank and listened the two women appeared to be in hot dispute in the dingle it was all owing to you you limmer said the vulgar woman to the other had you not interfered the old man would soon have settled the boy im for fair play and long melford said the other if your old man as you call him could have settled the boy fairly he might for all i should have cared but no foul work for me and as for sticking the boy with our gulleys when he comes back as you proposed i am not so fond of your old man or you that i should oblige you in it to my souls destruction hold your tongue or ill i listened no farther but hastened as fast as i could to the dingle my adversary had just begun to show signs of animation the vulgar woman was still supporting him and occasionally cast glances of anger at the tall girl who was walking slowly up and down i lost no time in dashing the greater part of the water into the tinmans face whereupon he sneezed moved his hands and presently looked round him at first his looks were dull and heavy and without any intelligence at all he soon however began to recollect himself and to be conscious of his situation he cast a scowling glance at me then one of the deepest malignity at the tall girl who was still walking about without taking much notice of what was going forward at last he looked at his right hand which had evidently suffered from the blow against the tree and a halfstifled curse escaped his lips the vulgar woman now said something to him in a low tone whereupon he looked at her for a moment and then got upon his legs again the vulgar woman said something to him her looks were furious and she appeared to be urging him on to attempt something i observed that she had a clasped knife in her hand the fellow remained standing for some time as if hesitating what to do at last he looked at his hand and shaking his head said something to the woman which i did not understand the tall girl however appeared to overhear him and probably repeating his words said no it wont do you are right there and now hear what i have to saylet bygones be bygones and let us all shake hands and camp here as the young man was saying just now the man looked at her and then without any reply went to his horse which was lying down among the trees and kicking it up led it to the cart to which he forthwith began to harness it the other cart and horse had remained standing motionless during the whole affair which i have been recounting at the bottom of the pass the woman now took the horse by the head and leading it with the cart into the open part of the dingle turned both round and then led them back till the horse and cart had mounted a little way up the ascent she then stood still and appeared to be expecting the man during this proceeding belle had stood looking on without saying anything at last perceiving that the man had harnessed his horse to the other cart and that both he and the woman were about to take their departure she said you are not going are you receiving no answer she continued i tell you what both of you black john and you moll his mort this is not treating me over civillyhowever i am ready to put up with it and go with you if you like for i bear no malice im sorry for what has happened but you have only yourselves to thank for it now shall i go with you only tell me the man made no manner of reply but flogged his horse the woman however whose passions were probably under less control replied with a screeching tone stay where you are you jade and may the curse of judas cling to youstay with the bit of a mullo whom you helped and my only hope is that he may gulley you before he comes to behave you with us indeed after whats past no nor nothing belonging to you fetch down your mailla gocart and live here with your chabo she then whipped on the horse and ascended the pass followed by the man the carts were light and they were not long in ascending the winding path i followed to see that they took their departure arriving at the top i found near the entrance a small donkeycart which i concluded belonged to the girl the tinker and his mort were already at some distance i stood looking after them for a little time then taking the donkey by the reins i led it with the cart to the bottom of the dingle arrived there i found belle seated on the stone by the fireplace her hair was all dishevelled and she was in tears they were bad people said she and i did not like them but they were my only acquaintance in the wide worldchapter lxxxvi at teavapoursisopel bernerssoftly and kindlysweet pretty creaturebread and watertwo sailorstruth and constancyvery strangely in the evening of that same day the tall girl and i sat at tea by the fire at the bottom of the dingle the girl on a small stool and myself as usual upon my stone the water which served for the tea had been taken from a spring of pellucid water in the neighbourhood which i had not had the good fortune to discover though it was well known to my companion and to the wandering people who frequented the dingle this tea is very good said i but i cannot enjoy it as much as if i were well i feel very sadly how else should you feel said the girl after fighting with the flaming tinman all i wonder is that you can feel at all as for the tea it ought to be good seeing that it cost me ten shillings a pound thats a great deal for a person in your station to pay in my station id have you to know young manhowever i havent the heart to quarrel with you you look so ill and after all it is a good sum to pay for one who travels the roads but if i must have tea i like to have the best and tea i must have for i am used to it though i cant help thinking that it sometimes fills my head with strange fancieswhat some folk call vapours making me weep and cry dear me said i i should never have thought that one of your size and fierceness would weep and cry my size and fierceness i tell you what young man you are not over civil this evening but you are ill as i said before and i shant take much notice of your language at least for the present as for my size i am not so much bigger than yourself and as for being fierce you should be the last one to fling that at me it is well for you that i can be fierce sometimes if i hadnt taken your part against blazing bosville you wouldnt be now taking tea with me it is true that you struck me in the face first but well let that pass so that mans name is bosville whats your own isopel berners how did you get that name i say young man you seem fond of asking questions will you have another cup of tea i was just going to ask for another well then here it is and much good may it do you as for my name i got it from my mother your mothers name then was isopel isopel berners but had you never a father yes i had a father said the girl sighing but i dont bear his name is it the fashion then in your country for children to bear their mothers name if you ask such questions young man i shall be angry with you i have told you my name and whether my fathers or mothers i am not ashamed of it it is a noble name there you are right young man the chaplain in the great house where i was born told me it was a noble name it was odd enough he said that the only three noble names in the county were to be found in the great house mine was one the other two were devereux and bohun what do you mean by the great house the workhouseis it possible that you were born there yes young man and as you now speak softly and kindly i will tell you my whole tale my father was an officer of the sea and was killed at sea as he was coming home to marry my mother isopel berners he had been acquainted with her and had left her but after a few months he wrote her a letter to say that he had no rest and that he repented and that as soon as his ship came to port he would do her all the reparation in his power well young man the very day before they reached port they met the enemy and there was a fight and my father was killed after he had struck down six of the enemys crew on their own deck for my father was a big man as i have heard and knew tolerably well how to use his hands and when my mother heard the news she became half distracted and ran away into the fields and forests totally neglecting her business for she was a small milliner and so she ran demented about the meads and forests for a long time now sitting under a tree and now by the side of a riverat last she flung herself into some water and would have been drowned had not some one been at hand and rescued her whereupon she was conveyed to the great house lest she should attempt to do herself further mischief for she had neither friends nor parentsand there she died three months after having first brought me into the world she was a sweet pretty creature im told but hardly fit for this world being neither large nor fierce nor able to take her own part so i was born and bred in the great house where i learnt to read and sew to fear god and to take my own part when i was fourteen i was put out to service to a small farmer and his wife with whom however i did not stay long for i was half starved and otherwise illtreated especially by my mistress who one day attempting to knock me down with a besom i knocked her down with my fist and went back to the great house and how did they receive you in the great house not very kindly young manon the contrary i was put into a dark room where i was kept a fortnight on bread and water i did not much care however being glad to have got back to the great house at any rate the place where i was born and where my poor mother died and in the great house i continued two years longer reading and sewing fearing god and taking my own part when necessary at the end of the two years i was again put out to service but this time to a rich farmer and his wife with whom however i did not live long less time i believe than with the poor ones being obliged to leave for knocking your mistress down no young man knocking my master down who conducted himself improperly towards me this time i did not go back to the great house having a misgiving that they would not receive me so i turned my back to the great house where i was born and where my poor mother died and wandered for several days i know not whither supporting myself on a few halfpence which i chanced to have in my pocket it happened one day as i sat under a hedge crying having spent my last farthing that a comfortablelooking elderly woman came up in a cart and seeing the state in which i was she stopped and asked what was the matter with me i told her some part of my story whereupon she said cheer up my dear if you like you shall go with me and wait upon me of course i wanted little persuasion so i got into the cart and went with her she took me to london and various other places and i soon found that she was a travelling woman who went about the country with silks and linen i was of great use to her more especially in those places where we met evil company once as we were coming from dover we were met by two sailors who stopped our cart and would have robbed and stripped us let me get down said i so i got down and fought with them both till they turned round and ran away two years i lived with the old gentlewoman who was very kind to me almost as kind as a mother at last she fell sick at a place in lincolnshire and after a few days died leaving me her cart and stock in trade praying me only to see her decently buried which i did giving her a funeral fit for a gentlewoman after which i travelled the country melancholy enough for want of company but so far fortunate that i could take my own part when any body was uncivil to me at last passing through the valley of todmorden i formed the acquaintance of blazing bosville and his wife with whom i occasionally took journeys for companys sake for it is melancholy to travel about alone even when one can take ones own part i soon found they were evil people but upon the whole they treated me civilly and i sometimes lent them a little money so that we got on tolerably well together he and i it is true had once a dispute and nearly came to blows for once when we were alone he wanted me to marry him promising if i would to turn off grey moll or if i liked it better to make her wait upon me as a maidservant i never liked him much but from that hour less than ever of the two i believe grey moll to be the best for she is at any rate true and faithful to him and i like truth and constancy dont you young man yes said i they are very nice things i feel very strangely how do you feel young man very much afraid afraid at what at the flaming tinman dont be afraid of him he wont come back and if he did he shouldnt touch you in this state id fight him for you but he wont come back so you neednt be afraid of himim not afraid of the flaming tinman what then are you afraid of the evil one the evil one said the girl where is he coming upon me never heed said the girl ill stand by you chapter lxxxvii hubbub of voicesno offencenoddingthe guests the kitchen of the publichouse was a large one and many people were drinking in it there was a confused hubbub of voices i sat down on a bench behind a deal table of which there were three or four in the kitchen presently a bulky man in a green coat of the newmarket cut and without a hat entered and observing me came up and in rather a gruff tone cried want anything young fellow bring me a jug of ale said i if you are the master as i suppose you are by that same coat of yours and your having no hat on your head dont be saucy young fellow said the landlord for such he was dont be saucy or whatever he intended to say he left unsaid for fixing his eyes upon one of my hands which i had placed by chance upon the table he became suddenly still this was my left hand which was raw and swollen from the blows dealt on a certain hard skull in a recent combat what do you mean by staring at my hand so said i withdrawing it from the table no offence young man no offence said the landlord in a quite altered tone but the sight of your hand then observing that our conversation began to attract the notice of the guests in the kitchen he interrupted himself saying in an under tone but mums the word for the present i will go and fetch the ale in about a minute he returned with a jug of ale foaming high heres your health said he blowing off the foam and drinking but perceiving that i looked rather dissatisfied he murmured alls right i glory in you but mums the word then placing the jug on the table he gave me a confidential nod and swaggered out of the room what can the silly impertinent fellow mean thought i but the ale was now before me and i hastened to drink for my weakness was great and my mind was full of dark thoughts the remains of the indescribable horror of the preceding night it may kill me thought i as i drank deep but who cares anything is better than what i have suffered i drank deep and then leaned back against the wall it appeared as if a vapour was stealing up into my brain gentle and benign soothing and stilling the horror and the fear higher and higher it mounted and i felt nearly overcome but the sensation was delicious compared with that i had lately experienced and now i felt myself nodding and bending down i laid my head on the table on my folded hands and in that attitude i remained some time perfectly unconscious at length by degrees perception returned and i lifted up my head i felt somewhat dizzy and bewildered but the dark shadow had withdrawn itself from me and now once more i drank of the jug this second draught did not produce an overpowering effect upon meit revived and strengthened mei felt a new man i looked around me the kitchen had been deserted by the greater part of the guests besides myself only four remained these were seated at the farther end one was haranguing fiercely and eagerly he was abusing england and praising america at last he exclaimed so when i gets to new york i will toss up my hat and damn the king that man must be a radical thought ichapter lxxxviii a radicalsimplelooking manchurch of englandthe presidentaristocracygin and watermending the roadspersecuting churchsimon de montfordbroken bellsget upnot for the popequay of new york mumpers dingleno wish to fightfirst draughta poor pipehalfacrown broke the individual whom i supposed to be a radical after a short pause again uplifted his voice he was rather a strongbuilt fellow of about thirty with an illfavoured countenance a white hat on his head a snuffcoloured coat on his back and when he was not speaking a pipe in his mouth who would live in such a country as england he shouted there is no country like america said his nearest neighbour a man also in a white hat and of a very illfavoured countenancethere is no country like america said he withdrawing a pipe from his mouth i think i shall and here he took a draught from a jug the contents of which he appeared to have in common with the othergo to america one of these days myself poor old england is not such a bad country after all said a third a simplelooking man in a labouring dress who sat smoking a pipe without anything before him if there was but a little more work to be got i should have nothing to say against her i hope however you hope who cares what you hope interrupted the first in a savage tone you are one of those sneaking hounds who are satisfied with dogs wages a bit of bread and a kick work indeed who with the spirit of a man would work for a country where there is neither liberty of speech nor of action a land full of beggarly aristocracy hungry boroughmongers insolent parsons and their wives and daughters as william cobbett says in his register ah the church of england has been a source of incalculable mischief to these realms said another the person who uttered these words sat rather aloof from the rest he was dressed in a long black surtout i could not see much of his face partly owing to his keeping it very much directed to the ground and partly owing to a large slouched hat which he wore i observed however that his hair was of a reddish tinge on the table near him was a glass and spoon you are quite right said the first alluding to what this last had said the church of england has done incalculable mischief here i value no religion three halfpence for i believe in none but the one that i hate most is the church of england so when i get to new york after i have shown the fine fellows on the quay a spice of me by the king ill toss up my hat again and the church of england too and suppose the people of new york should clap you in the stocks said i these words drew upon me the attention of the whole four the radical and his companion stared at me ferociously the man in black gave me a peculiar glance from under his slouched hat the simplelooking man in the labouring dress laughed what are you laughing at you fool said the radical turning and looking at the other who appeared to be afraid of him hold your noise and a pretty fellow you said he looking at me to come here and speak against the great american nation i speak against the great american nation said i i rather paid them a compliment by supposing they would put me in the stocks well i call it abusing them to suppose they would do any such thing stocks indeedthere are no stocks in all the land put me in the stocks why the president will come down to the quay and ask me to dinner as soon as he hears what i have said about the king and church i shouldnt wonder said i if you go to america you will say of the president and country what now you say of the king and church and cry out for somebody to send you back to england the radical dashed his pipe to pieces against the table i tell you what young fellow you are a spy of the aristocracy sent here to kick up a disturbance kicking up a disturbance said i is rather inconsistent with the office of spy if i were a spy i should hold my head down and say nothing the man in black partially raised his head and gave me another peculiar glance well if you arnt sent to spy you are sent to bully to prevent people speaking and to run down the great americannation but you shant bully me i say down with the aristocracy the beggarly british aristocracy come what have you to say to that nothing said i nothing repeated the radical no said i down with them as soon as you can as soon as i can i wish i could but i can down with a bully of theirs come will you fight for them no said i you wont no said i though from what i have seen of them i should say they are tolerably able to fight for themselves you wont fight for them said the radical triumphantly i thought so all bullies especially those of the aristocracy are cowards here landlord said he raising his voice and striking against the table with the jug some more alehe wont fight for his friends a white feather said his companion he he tittered the man in black landlord landlord shouted the radical striking the table with the jug louder than before who called said the landlord coming in at last fill this jug again said the other and be quick about it does any one else want anything said the landlord yes said the man in black you may bring me another glass of gin and water cold said the landlord yes said the man in black with a lump of sugar in it gin and water cold with a lump of sugar in it said i and struck the table with my fist take some said the landlord inquiringly no said i only something came into my head hes mad said the man in black not he said the radical hes only shamming he knows his master is here and therefore has recourse to those manœuvres but it wont do come landlord what are you staring at why dont you obey your orders keeping your customers waiting in this manner is not the way to increase your business the landlord looked at the radical and then at me at last taking the jug and glass he left the apartment and presently returned with each filled with its respective liquor he placed the jug with beer before the radical and the glass with the gin and water before the man in black and then with a wink to me he sauntered out here is your health sir said the man of the snuffcoloured coat addressing himself to the man in black i honour you for what you said about the church of england every one who speaks against the church of england has my warm heart down with it i say and may the stones of it be used for mending the roads as my friend william says in his register the man in black with a courteous nod of his head drank to the man in the snuffcoloured coat with respect to the steeples said he i am not altogether of your opinion they might be turned to better account than to serve to mend the roads they might still be used as places of worship but not for the worship of the church of england i have no fault to find with the steeples it is the church itself which i am compelled to arraign but it will not stand long the respectable part of its ministers are already leaving it it is a bad church a persecuting church whom does it persecute said i the man in black glanced at me slightly and then replied slowly the catholics and do those whom you call catholics never persecute said i never said the man in black did you ever read foxs book of martyrs said ihe he tittered the man in black there is not a word of truth in foxs book of martyrs ten times more than in the flos sanctorum said i the man in black looked at me but made no answer and what say you to the massacre of the albigenses and the vaudois whose bones lie scattered on the cold alp or the revocation of the edict of nantes the man in black made no answer go to said i it is because the church of england is not a persecuting church that those whom you call the respectable part are leaving her it is because they cant do with the poor dissenters what simon de montford did with the albigenses and the cruel piedmontese with the vaudois that they turn to bloody rome the pope will no doubt welcome them for the pope do you see being very much in want will welcome hollo said the radical interfering what are you saying about the pope i say hurrah for the pope i value no religion three halfpence as i said before but if i were to adopt any it should be the popish as its called because i conceives the popish to be the grand enemy of the church of england of the beggarly aristocracy and the boroughmonger system so i wont hear the pope abused while i am by come dont look fierce you wont fight you know i have proved it but i will give you another chancei will fight for the pope will you fight against him o dear me yes said i getting up and stepping forward i am a quiet peaceable young man and being so am always ready to fight against the popethe enemy of all peace and quietto refuse fighting for the aristocracy is a widely different thing from refusing to fight against the popeso come on if you are disposed to fight for him to the pope broken bells to saint james broken shells no popish vile oppression but the protestant succession confusion to the groyne hurrah for the boyne for the army at clonmel and the protestant young gentlemen who live there as well an orangeman said the man in black not a platitude said i the man in black gave a slight start amongst that family said i no doubt something may be done but amongst the methodist preachers i should conceive that the success would not be great the man in black sat quite still especially amongst those who have wives i added the man in black stretched his hand towards his gin and water however said i we shall see what the grand movement will bring about and the results of the lessons in elocution the man in black lifted the glass up to his mouth and in doing so let the spoon fall but what has this to do with the main question said i i am waiting here to fight against the pope come hunter said the companion of the man in the snuffcoloured coat get up and fight for the pope i dont care for the young fellow said the man in the snuffcoloured coat i know you dont said the other so get up and serve him out i could serve out three like him said the man in the snuffcoloured coat so much the better for you said the other the present work will be all the easier for you get up and serve him out at once the man in the snuffcoloured coat did not stir who shows the white feather now said the simplelooking man he he he tittered the man in blackwho told you to interfere said the radical turning ferociously towards the simplelooking man say another word and illand you said he addressing himself to the man in black a pretty fellow you to turn against me after i had taken your part i tell you what you may fight for yourself ill see you and your pope in the pit of eldon before i fight for either of you so make the most of it then you wont fight said i not for the pope said the radical ill see the pope dear me said i not fight for the pope whose religion you would turn to if you were inclined for any i see how it is you are not fond of fighting but ill give you another chanceyou were abusing the church of england just now ill fight for itwill you fight against it come hunter said the other get up and fight against the church of england i have no particular quarrel against the church of england said the man in the snuffcoloured coat my quarrel is with the aristocracy if i said anything against the church it was merely for a bit of corollary as master william cobbett would say the quarrel with the church belongs to this fellow in black so let him carry it on however he continued suddenly i wont slink from the matter either it shall never be said by the fine fellows on the quay of new york that i wouldnt fight against the church of england so down with the beggarly aristocracy the church and the pope to the bottom of the pit of eldon and may the pope fall first and the others upon him thereupon dashing his hat on the table he placed himself in an attitude of offence and rushed forward he was as i have said before a powerful fellow and might have proved a dangerous antagonist more especially to myself who after my recent encounter with the flaming tinman and my wrestlings with the evil one was in anything but fighting order any collision however was prevented by the landlord who suddenly appearing thrust himself between us there shall be no fighting here said he no one shall fight in this house except it be with myself so if you two have anything to say to each other you had better go into the field behind the house but you fool said he pushing hunter violently on the breast do you know whom you are going to tackle withthis is the young chap that beat blazing bosville only as late as yesterday in mumpers dingle grey moll told me all about it last night when she came for some brandy for her husband who she said had been half killed and she described the young man to me so closely that i knew him at once that is as soon as i saw how his left hand was bruised for she told me he was a left hand hitter arnt it all true young man arnt you he that beat flaming bosville in mumpers dingle i never beat flaming bosville said i he beat himself had he not struck his hand against a tree i shouldnt be here at the present moment hear hear said the landlord now thats just as it should be i like a modest man for as the parson says nothing sits better upon a young man than modesty i remember when i was young fighting with tom of hopton the best man that ever pulled off coat in england i remember too that i won the battle for i happened to hit tom of hopton in the mark as he was coming in so that he lost his wind and falling squelch on the ground do ye see he lost the battle though i am free to confess that he was a better man than myself indeed the best man that ever fought in england yet still i won the battle as every customer of mine and everybody within twelve miles round has heard over and over again now mr hunter i have one thing to say if you choose to go into the field behind the house and fight the young man you can ill back him for ten pounds but no fighting in my kitchenbecause why i keeps a decent kind of an establishment i have no wish to fight the young man said hunter more especially as he has nothing to say for the aristocracy if he chose to fight for them indeedbut he wont i know for i see hes a decent respectable young man and after all fighting is a blackguard way of settling a dispute so i have no wish to fight however there is one thing ill do said he uplifting his fist ill fight this fellow in black here for halfacrown or for nothing if he pleases it was he that got up the last dispute between me and the young man with his pope and his nonsense so i will fight him for anything he pleases and perhaps the young man will be my second whilst you come doctor said the landlord or whatsoever you be will you go into the field with hunter ill second you only you must back yourself ill lay five pounds on hunter if you are inclined to back yourself and will help you to win it as far do you see as a second can because why i always likes to do the fair thing oh i have no wish to fight said the man in black hastily fighting is not my trade if i have given any offence i beg anybodys pardon landlord said i what have i to pay nothing at all said the landlord glad to see you this is the first time that you have been at my house and i never charge new customers at least customers such as you anything for the first draught youll come again i dare say shall always be glad to see you i wont take it said he as i put sixpence on the table i wont take it yes you shall said i but not in payment for anything i have had myself it shall serve to pay for a jug of ale for thatgentleman said i pointing to the simplelooking individual he is smoking a poor pipe i do not mean to say that a pipe is a bad thing but a pipe without ale do you see bravo said the landlord thats just the conduct i like bravo said hunter i shall be happy to drink with the young man whenever i meet him at new york where do you see things are better managed than here if i have given offence to anybody said the man in black i repeat that i ask pardonmore especially to the young gentleman who was perfectly right to stand up for his religion just as inot that i am of any particular religion no more than this honest gentleman here bowing to hunter but i happen to know something of the catholicsseveral excellent friends of mine are catholicsand of a surety the catholic religion is an ancient religion and a widelyextended religion though it certainly is not a universal religion but it has of late made considerable progress even amongst those nations who have been particularly opposed to itamongst the prussians and the dutch for example to say nothing of the english and then in the east amongst the persians among the armenians the armenians said i o dear me the armenians have you anything to say about these people sir said the man in black lifting up his glass to his mouth i have nothing further to say said i than that the roots of ararat are occasionally found to be deeper than those of rome theres halfacrown broke said the landlord as the man in black let fall the glass which was broken to pieces on the floor you will pay me the damage friend before you leave this kitchen i like to see people drink freely in my kitchen but not too freely and i hate breakages because why i keeps a decent kind of an establishmentchapter lxxxix the dinglegive them alenot over complimentaryamericamany peoplewashingtonpromiscuous company language of the roadsthe old womennumeralsthe man in black the publichouse where the scenes which i have attempted to describe in the preceding chapters took place was at the distance of about two miles from the dingle the sun was sinking in the west by the time i returned to the latter spot i found belle seated by a fire over which her kettle was suspended during my absence she had prepared herself a kind of tent consisting of large hoops covered over with tarpaulin quite impenetrable to rain however violent i am glad you are returned said she as soon as she perceived me i began to be anxious about you did you take my advice yes said i i went to the publichouse and drank ale as you advised me it cheered strengthened and drove away the horror from my mindi am much beholden to you i knew it would do you good said belle i remembered that when the poor women in the great house were afflicted with hysterics and fearful imaginings the surgeon who was a good kind man used to say ale give them ale and let it be strong he was no advocate for tea then said i he had no objection to tea but he used to say everything in its season shall we take ours nowi have waited for you i have no objection said i i feel rather heated and at present should prefer tea to aleeverything in its season as the surgeon said thereupon belle prepared tea and as we were taking it she said what did you see and hear at the publichouse really said i you appear to have your full portion of curiosity what matters it to you what i saw and heard at the publichouse it matters very little to me said belle i merely inquired of you for the sake of a little conversationyou were silent and it is uncomfortable for two people to sit together without opening their lipsat least i think so one only feels uncomfortable said i in being silent when one happens to be thinking of the individual with whom one is in company to tell you the truth i was not thinking of my companion but of certain company with whom i had been at the publichouse really young man said belle you are not over complimentary but who may this wonderful company have been some young and here belle stopped no said i there was no young personif person you were going to say there was a big portly landlord whom i dare say you have seen a noisy savage radical who wanted at first to fasten upon me a quarrel about america but who subsequently drew in his horns then there was a strange fellow a prowling priest i believe whom i have frequently heard of who at first seemed disposed to side with the radical against me and afterwards with me against the radical there you know my company and what took place was there no one else said belle you are mighty curious said i no none else except a poor simple mechanic and some common company who soon went away belle looked at me for a moment and then appeared to be lost in thoughtamerica said she musinglyamerica what of america said i i have heard that it is a mighty country i dare say it is said i i have heard my father say that the americans are firstrate marksmen i heard nothing about that said belle what i heard was that it is a great and goodly land where people can walk about without jostling and where the industrious can always find bread i have frequently thought of going thither well said i the radical in the publichouse will perhaps be glad of your company thither he is as great an admirer of america as yourself though i believe on different groundsi shall go by myself said belle unlessunless that should happen which is not likelyi am not fond of radicals no more than i am of scoffers and mockers do you mean to say that i am a scoffer and mocker i dont wish to say you are said belle but some of your words sound strangely like scoffing and mocking i have now one thing to beg which is that if you have anything to say against america you would speak it out boldly what should i have to say against america i never was there many people speak against america who never were there many people speak in praise of america who never were there but with respect to myself i have not spoken for or against america if you liked america you would speak in its praise by the same rule if i disliked america i should speak against it i cant speak with you said belle but i see you dislike the country the country well the peopledont you i do why do you dislike them why i have heard my father say that the american marksmen led on by a chap of the name of washington sent the english to the rightabout in doublequick time and that is your reason for disliking the americans yes said i that is my reason for disliking them will you take another cup of tea said belle i took another cup we were again silent it is rather uncomfortable said i at last for people to sit together without having anything to say were you thinking of your company said belle what company said i the present company the present company oh ahi remember that i said one only feels uncomfortable in being silent with a companion when one happens to be thinking of the companion well i had been thinking of you the last two or three minutes and had just come to the conclusion that to prevent us both feeling occasionally uncomfortable towards each other having nothing to say it would be as well to have a standing subject on which to employ our tongues belle i have determined to give you lessons in armenian what is armenian did you ever hear of ararat yes that was the place where the ark rested i have heard the chaplain in the great house talk of it besides i have read of it in the bible well armenian is the speech of people of that place and i should like to teach it you to prevent ay ay to prevent our occasionally feeling uncomfortable together your acquiring it besides might prove of ulterioradvantage to us both for example suppose you and i were in promiscuous company at court for example and you had something to communicate to me which you did not wish anyone else to be acquainted with how safely you might communicate it to me in armenian would not the language of the roads do as well said belle in some places it would said i but not at court owing to its resemblance to thieves slang there is hebrew again which i was thinking of teaching you till the idea of being presented at court made me abandon it from the probability of our being understood in the event of our speaking it by at least half a dozen people in our vicinity there is latin it is true or greek which we might speak aloud at court with perfect confidence of safety but upon the whole i should prefer teaching you armenian not because it would be a safer language to hold communication with at court but because not being very well grounded in it myself i am apprehensive that its words and forms may escape from my recollection unless i have sometimes occasion to call them forth i am afraid we shall have to part company before i have learnt it said belle in the mean time if i wish to say anything to you in private somebody being by shall i speak in the language of the roads if no roadster is nigh you may said i and i will do my best to understand you belle i will now give you a lesson in armenian i suppose you mean no harm said belle not in the least i merely propose the thing to prevent our occasionally feeling uncomfortable together let us begin stop till i have removed the teathings said belle and getting up she removed them to her own encampment i am ready said belle returning and taking her former seat to join with you in anything which will serve to pass away the time agreeably provided there is no harm in it belle said i i have determined to commence the course of armenian lessons by teaching you the numerals but before i do that it will be as well to tell you that the armenian language is called haik i am sure that word will hang upon my memory said belle why hang upon it said i because the old women in the great house used to call so the chimneyhook on which they hung the kettle in like manner on the hake of my memory i will hang your hake good said i you will make an apt scholar but mind that i did not say hake but haik the words are however very much alike and as you observe upon your hake you may hang my haik we will now proceed to the numerals what are numerals said belle numbers i will say the haikan numbers up to ten there have you heard themyes well try and repeat them i only remember number one said belle and that because it is me i will repeat them again said i and pay great attention now try again me jergo earache i neither said jergo nor earache i said yergou and yerek belle i am afraid i shall have some difficulty with you as a scholar belle made no answer her eyes were turned in the direction of the winding path which led from the bottom of the hollow where we were seated to the plain above gorgio shunella she said at length in a low voice pure rommany said i where i added in a whisper dovey odoi said belle nodding with her head towards the path i will soon see who it is said i and starting up i rushed towards the pathway intending to lay violent hands on any one i might find lurking in its windings before however i had reached its commencement a man somewhat above the middle height advanced from it into the dingle in whom i recognised the man in black whom i had seen in the publichouse chapter xc buona serarather apprehensivethe steep banklovely virginhospitalitytory ministercustom of the countrysneering smilewandering zigangypsies cloakscertain facultyacute answervarious waysadio best hollands the man in black and myself stood opposite to each other for a minute or two in silence i will not say that we confronted each other that time for the man in black after a furtive glance did not look me in the face but kept his eyes fixed apparently on the leaves of a bunch of ground nuts which were growing at my feet at length looking around the dingle he exclaimed buona sera i hope i dont intrude you have as much right here said i as i or my companion but you had no right to stand listening to our conversation i was not listening said the man i was hesitating whether to advance or retire and if i heard some of your conversation the fault was not mine i do not see why you should have hesitated if your intentions were good said i i think the kind of place in which i found myself might excuse some hesitation said the man in black looking around moreover from what i had seen of your demeanour at the publichouse i was rather apprehensive that the reception i might experience at your hands might be more rough than agreeable and what may have been your motive for coming to this place said i per far visita a sua signoria ecco il motivo why do you speak to me in that gibberish said i do you think i understand it it is not armenian said the man in black but it might serve in a place like this for the breathing of a little secret communication were any common roadster near at hand it would not do at court it is true being the language of singing women and the like but we are not at courtwhen we are i can perhaps summon up a little indifferent latin if i have anything private to communicate to the learned professor at the conclusion of this speech the man in black lifted up his head and for some moments looked me in the face the muscles of his own seemed to be slightly convulsed and his mouth opened in a singular manner i see said i that for some time you were standing near me and my companion in the mean act of listening not at all said the man in black i heard from the steep bank above that to which i have now alluded whilst i was puzzling myself to find the path which leads to your retreat i made indeed nearly the compass of the whole thicket before i found it and how did you know that i was here i demanded the landlord of the publichouse with whom i had some conversation concerning you informed me that he had no doubt i should find you in this place to which he gave me instructions not very clear but now i am here i crave permission to remain a little time in order that i may hold some communion with you well said i since you are come you are welcome please to step this way thereupon i conducted the man in black to the fireplace where belle was standing who had risen from her stool on my springing up to go in quest of the stranger the man in black looked at her with evident curiosity then making her rather a graceful bow lovely virgin said he stretching out his hand allow me to salute your fingers i am not in the habit of shaking hands with strangers said belle i did not presume to request to shake hands with you said the man in black i merely wished to be permitted to salute with my lips the extremity of your two forefingers i never permit anything of the kind said belle i do not approve of such unmanly ways they are only befitting those who lurk in corners or behind trees listening to the conversation of people who would fain be private do you take me for a listener then said the man in black ay indeed i do said belle the young man may receive your excuses and put confidence in them if he please but formy part i neither admit them nor believe them and thereupon flinging her long hair back which was hanging over her cheeks she seated herself on her stool come belle said i i have bidden the gentleman welcome i beseech you therefore to make him welcome he is a stranger where we are at home therefore even did we wish him away we are bound to treat him kindly thats not english doctrine said the man in black i thought the english prided themselves on their hospitality said i they do so said the man in black they are proud of showing hospitality to people above them that is to those who do not want it but of the hospitality which you were now describing and which is arabian they know nothing no englishman will tolerate another in his house from whom he does not expect advantage of some kind and to those from whom he does he can be civil enough an englishman thinks that because he is in his own house he has a right to be boorish and brutal to any one who is disagreeable to him as all those are who are really in want of assistance should a hunted fugitive rush into an englishmans house beseeching protection and appealing to the masters feelings of hospitality the englishman would knock him down in the passage you are too general said i in your strictures lord the unpopular tory minister was once chased through the streets of london by a mob and being in danger of his life took shelter in the shop of a whig linendraper declaring his own unpopular name and appealing to the linendrapers feelings of hospitality whereupon the linendraper utterly forgetful of all party rancour nobly responded to the appeal and telling his wife to conduct his lordship upstairs jumped over the counter with his ell in his hand and placing himself with halfadozen of his assistants at the door of his boutique manfully confronted the mob telling them that he would allow himself to be torn to a thousand pieces ere he would permit them to injure a hair of his lordships head what do you think of that he he he tittered the man in black well said i i am afraid your own practice is not very different from that which you have been just now describing you sided with the radical in the publichouse against me as long as you thought him the most powerful and then turned against him when you saw he was cowed what have you to say to that o when one is in rome i mean england one must do as they do in england i was merely conforming to the custom of the country he he but i beg your pardon here as i did in the publichouse i made a mistake well said i we will drop the matter but pray seat yourself on that stone and i will sit down on the grass near you the man in black after proffering two or three excuses for occupying what he supposed to be my seat sat down upon the stone and i squatted down gypsy fashion just opposite to him belle sitting on her stool a slight distance on my right after a time i addressed him thus am i to reckon this a mere visit of ceremony should it prove so it will be i believe the first visit of the kind ever paid me will you permit me to ask said the man in blackthe weather is very warm said he interrupting himself and taking off his hat i now observed that he was partly bald his red hair having died away from the fore part of his crownhis forehead was high his eyebrows scanty his eyes grey and sly with a downward tendency his nose was slightly aquiline his mouth rather largea kind of sneering smile played continually on his lips his complexion was somewhat rubicund a bad countenance said belle in the language of the roads observing that my eyes were fixed on his face does not my countenance please you fair damsel said the man in black resuming his hat and speaking in a peculiarly gentle voice how said i do you understand the language of the roads as little as i do armenian said the man in black but i understand look and tone so do i perhaps retorted belle and to tell you the truth i like your tone as little as your face for shame said i have you forgot what i was saying just now about the duties of hospitality you have not yet answered my question said i addressing myself to the man with respect to your visit will you permit me to ask who you aredo you see the place where i live said i i do said the man in black looking around do you know the name of this place i was told it was mumpers or gypsies dingle said the man in black good said i and this forge and tent what do they look like like the forge and tent of a wandering zigan i have seen the like in italy good said i they belong to me are you then a gypsy said the man in black what else should i be but you seem to have been acquainted with various individuals with whom i have likewise had acquaintance and you have even alluded to matters and even words which have passed between me and them do you know how gypsies live said i by hammering old iron i believe and telling fortunes well said i theres my forge and yonder is some iron though not old and by your own confession i am a soothsayer but how did you come by your knowledge o said i if you want me to reveal the secrets of my trade i have of course nothing further to say go to the scarlet dyer and ask him how he dyes cloth why scarlet said the man in black is it because gypsies blush like scarlet gypsies never blush said i but gypsies cloaks are scarlet i should almost take you for a gypsy said the man in black but for for what said i but for that same lesson in armenian and your general knowledge of languages as for your manners and appearance i will say nothing said the man in black with a titter and why should not a gypsy possess a knowledge of languages said i because the gypsy race is perfectly illiterate said the man in black they are possessed it is true of a knavish acuteness and are particularly noted for giving subtle and evasive answersand in your answers i confess you remind me of them but that one of the race should acquire a learned language like the armenian and have a general knowledge of literature is a thing che io non credo afatto what do you take me for said i why said the man in black i should consider you to be a philologist who for some purpose has taken up a gypsy life but i confess to you that your way of answering questions is far too acute for a philologist and why should not a philologist be able to answer questions acutely said i because the philological race is the most stupid under heaven said the man in black they are possessed it is true of a certain faculty for picking up words and a memory for retaining them but that any one of the sect should be able to give a rational answer to say nothing of an acute one on any subjecteven though the subject were philologyis a thing of which i have no idea but you found me giving a lesson in armenian to this handmaid i believe i did said the man in blackand you heard me give what you are disposed to call acute answers to the questions you asked me i believe i did said the man in black and would any one but a philologist think of giving a lesson in armenian to a handmaid in a dingle i should think not said the man in black well then dont you see that it is possible for a philologist to give not only a rational but an acute answer i really dont know said the man in black whats the matter with you said i merely puzzled said the man in black puzzled yes really puzzled yes remain so well said the man in black rising puzzled or not i will no longer trespass upon your and this young ladys retirement only allow me before i go to apologize for my intrusion no apology is necessary said i will you please to take anything before you go i think this young lady at my request would contrive to make you a cup of tea tea said the man in blackhe he i dont drink tea i dont like itif indeed you had and here he stopped theres nothing like gin and water is there said i but i am sorry to say i have none gin and water said the man in black how do you know that i am fond of gin and water did i not see you drinking some at the publichouse you did said the man in black and i remember that when i called for some you repeated my wordspermit me to ask is gin and water an unusual drink in england it is not usually drunk cold and with a lump of sugar said i and did you know who i was by my calling for it so gypsies have various ways of obtaining information said i with all your knowledge said the man in black you do not appear to have known that i was coming to visit you gypsies do not pretend to know anything which relates to themselves said i but i advise you if you ever come again to come openly have i your permission to come again said the man in black come when you please this dingle is as free for you as me i will visit you again said the man in blacktill then addio belle said i after the man in black had departed we did not treat that man very hospitably he left us without having eaten or drunk at our expense you offered him some tea said belle which as it is mine i should have grudged him for i like him not our liking or disliking him had nothing to do with the matter he was our visitor and ought not to have been permitted to depart dry living as we do in this desert we ought always to be prepared to administer to the wants of our visitors belledo you know where to procure any good hollands i think i do said belle but i will have no buts belle i expect that with as little delay as possible you procure at my expense the best hollands you can findchapter xci excursionsadventurous englishopaque foreststhe greatest patience time passed on and belle and i lived in the dingle when i say lived the reader must not imagine that we were always there she went out upon her pursuits and i went out where inclination led me but my excursions were very short ones and hers occasionally occupied whole days and nights if i am asked how we passed the time when we were together in the dingle i would answer that we passed the time very tolerably all things considered we conversed together and when tired of conversing i would sometimes give belle a lesson in armenian her progress was not particularly brilliant but upon the whole satisfactory in about a fortnight she had hung up one hundred haikan numerals upon the hake of her memory i found her conversation highly entertaining she had seen much of england and wales and had been acquainted with some of the most remarkable characters who travelled the roads at that period and let me be permitted to say that many remarkable characters have travelled the roads of england of whom fame has never said a word i loved to hear her anecdotes of these people some of whom i found had occasionally attempted to lay violent hands either upon her person or effects and had invariably been humbled by her without the assistance of either justice or constable i could clearly see however that she was rather tired of england and wished for a change of scene she was particularly fond of talking of america to which country her aspirations chiefly tended she had heard much of america which had excited her imagination for at that time america was much talked of on roads and in homesteads at least so said belle who had good opportunities of knowing and most people allowed that it was a good country for adventurous english the people who chiefly spoke against it as she informed me were soldiers disbanded upon pensions the sextons of village churches and excisemen belle had a craving desire to visit that country and to wander with cart and little animal amongst its forests when i would occasionally object that she would be exposed to danger from strange and perverse customers she said that she had not wandered the roads of england so long and alone to be afraid of anything which might befall in america and that she hoped with gods favour to be able to take her own part and to give to perverse customers as good as they might bring she had a dauntless heart that same belle such was the staple of belles conversation as for mine i would endeavour to entertain her with strange dreams of adventure in which i figured in opaque forests strangling wild beasts or discovering and plundering the hordes of dragons and sometimes i would narrate to her other things far more genuinehow i had tamed savage mares wrestled with satan and had dealings with ferocious publishers belle had a kind heart and would weep at the accounts i gave her of my early wrestlings with the dark monarch she would sigh too as i recounted the many slights and degradations i had received at the hands of ferocious publishers but she had the curiosity of a woman and once when i talked to her of the triumphs which i had achieved over unbroken mares she lifted up her head and questioned me as to the secret of the virtue which i possessed over the aforesaid animals whereupon i sternly reprimanded and forthwith commanded her to repeat the armenian numerals and on her demurring i made use of words to escape which she was glad to comply saying the armenian numerals from one to a hundred which numerals as a punishment for her curiosity i made her repeat three times loading her with the bitterest reproaches whenever she committed the slightest error either in accent or pronunciation which reproaches she appeared to bear with the greatest patience and now i have given a very fair account of the manner in which isopel berners and myself passed our time in the dinglechapter xcii the landlordrather too oldwithout a shillingreputationa fortnight agoliquidsthe main chance respectabilityirrational beingsparliament covemy brewer amongst other excursions i went several times to the publichouse to which i introduced the reader in a former chapter i had experienced such beneficial effects from the ale i had drunk on that occasion that i wished to put its virtue to a frequent test nor did the ale on subsequent trials belie the good opinion which i had at first formed of it after each visit which i made to the publichouse i found my frame stronger and my mind more cheerful than they had previously been the landlord appeared at all times glad to see me and insisted that i should sit within the bar where leaving his other guests to be attended to by a niece of his who officiated as his housekeeper he would sit beside me and talk of matters concerning the ring indulging himself with a cigar and a glass of sherry which he told me was his favourite wine whilst i drank my ale i loves the conversation of all you coves of the ring said he once which is natural seeing as how i have fought in a ring myself ah there is nothing like the ring i wish i was not rather too old to go again into it i often think i should like to have another rallyone more rally and thenbut theres a time for all thingsyouth will be served every dog has his day and mine has been a fine onelet me be content after beating tom of hopton there was not much more to be done in the way of reputation i have long sat in my bar the wonder and glory of this here neighbourhood im content as far as reputation goes i only wish money would come in a little faster however the next main of cocks will bring me in something handsomecomes off next wednesday at have ventured ten five pound notesshouldnt say ventured eitherrun no risk at all because why i knows my birds about ten days after this harangue i called again at about three oclock one afternoon the landlord was seated on a bench by a table in the common room which was entirely empty he was neither smoking nor drinking but sat with his arms folded and his head hanging down over his breast at the sound of my step he looked up ah said he i am glad you are come i was just thinking about you thank you said i it was very kind of you especially at a time like this when your mind must be full of your good fortune allow me to congratulate you on the sums of money you won by the main of cocks at i hope you brought it all safe home safe home said the landlord i brought myself safe home and that was all came home without a shilling regularly done cleaned out i am sorry for that said i but after you had won the money you ought to have been satisfied and not risked it againhow did you lose it i hope not by the pea and thimble pea and thimble said the landlordnot i those confounded cocks left me nothing to lose by the pea and thimble dear me said i i thought that you knew your birds well so i did said the landlord i knew the birds to be good birds and so they proved and would have won if better birds had not been brought against them of which i knew nothing and so do you see i am done regularly done well said i dont be cast down there is one thing of which the cocks by their misfortune cannot deprive youyour reputation make the most of that give up cockfighting and be content with the custom of your house of which you will always have plenty as long as you are the wonder and glory of the neighbourhood the landlord struck the table before him violently with his fist confound my reputation said he no reputation that i have will be satisfaction to my brewer for the seventy pounds i owe him reputation wont pass for the current coin of this here realm and let me tell you that if it ant backed by some of it it ant a bit better than rotten cabbage as i have found only three weeks since i was as i told you the wonder and glory of the neighbourhood and people used to come and look at me and worship me but as soon as it began to be whispered about that i owed money to the brewer they presently left off all that kind of thing and now during the last three days since the tale of my misfortune with the cocks has got wind almost everybody has left off coming to the house and the few who does merely comes to insult and flout me it was only last night that fellow hunter called me an old fool in my own kitchen here he wouldnt have called me a fool a fortnight ago twas i called him fool then and last night he called me old fool what do you think of that the man that beat tom of hopton to be called not only a fool but an old fool and i hadnt heart with one blow of this here fist into his face to send his head ringing against the wall for when a mans pocket is low do you see his heart ant much higher but it is of no use talking something must be done i was thinking of you just as you came in for you are just the person that can help me if you mean said i to ask me to lend you the money which you want it will be to no purpose as i have very little of my own just enough for my own occasions it is true if you desired it i would be your intercessor with the person to whom you owe the money though i should hardly imagine that anything i could say you are right there said the landlord much the brewer would care for anything you could say on my behalfyour going would be the very way to do me up entirely a pretty opinion he would have of the state of my affairs if i were to send him such a cessor as you and as for your lending me money dont think i was ever fool enough to suppose either that you had any or if you had that you would be fool enough to lend me any no no the coves of the ring knows better i have been in the ring myself and knows what a fighting cove is and though i was fool enough to back those birds i was never quite fool enough to lend anybody money what i am about to propose is something very different from going to my landlord or lending any capital something which though it will put money into my pocket will likewise put something handsome into your own i want to get up a fight in this here neighbourhood which would be sure to bring plenty of people to my house for a week before and after it takes place and as people cant come without drinking i think i could during one fortnight get off forthe brewer all the sour and unsaleable liquids he now has which people wouldnt drink at any other time and by that means do you see liquidate my debt then by means of betting making first all right do you see i have no doubt that i could put something handsome into my pocket and yours for i should wish you to be the fighting man as i think i can depend upon you you really must excuse me said i i have no wish to figure as a pugilist besides there is such a difference in our ages you may be the stronger man of the two and perhaps the hardest hitter but i am in much better condition am more active on my legs so that i am almost sure i should have the advantage for as you very properly observed youth will be served oh i didnt mean to fight said the landlord i think i could beat you if i were to train a little but in the fight i propose i looks more to the main chance than anything else i question whether half so many people could be brought together if you were to fight with me as the person i have in view or whether there would be half such opportunities for betting for i am a man do you see the person i wants you to fight with is not a man but the young woman you keeps company with the young woman i keep company with said i pray what do you mean we will go into the bar and have something said the landlord getting up my niece is out and there is no one in the house so we can talk the matter over quietly thereupon i followed him into the bar where having drawn me a jug of ale helped himself as usual to a glass of sherry and lighted a cigar he proceeded to explain himself farther what i wants is to get up a fight between a man and a woman there never has yet been such a thing in the ring and the mere noise of the matter would bring thousands of people together quite enough to drink out for the thing should be close to my house all the brewers stock of liquids both good and bad but said i you were the other day boasting of the respectability of your house do you think that a fight between a man and a woman close to your establishment would add to its respectability confound the respectability of my house said the landlord will the respectability of my house pay the brewer or keep the roof over my head no no when respectability wont keep a man do you see the best thing is to let it go and wander only let me have my own way and both the brewer myself and every one of us will be satisfied and then the bettingwhat a deal we may make by the bettingand that we shall have all to ourselves you i and the young woman the brewer will have no hand in that i can manage to raise ten pounds and if by flashing that about i dont manage to make a hundred call me horse but suppose said i the party should lose on whom you sport your money even as the birds did we must first make all right said the landlord as i told you before the birds were irrational beings and therefore couldnt come to an understanding with the others as you and the young woman can the birds fought fair but i intend that you and the young woman should fight cross what do you mean by cross said i come come said the landlord dont attempt to gammon me you in the ring and pretend not to know what fighting cross is that wont do my fine fellow but as no one is near us i will speak out i intend that you and the young woman should understand one another and agree beforehand which should be beat and if you take my advice you will determine between you that the young woman shall be beat as i am sure that the odds will run high upon her her character as a fist woman being spread far and wide so that all the flats who think it will be all right will back her as i myself would if i thought it would be a fair thing then said i you would not have us fight fair by no means said the landlord because why i conceives that a cross is a certainty to those who are in it whereas by the fair thing one may lose all he has but said i you said the other day that you liked the fair thing that was by way of gammon said the landlord just do you see as a parliament cove might say speechifying from a barrel to a set of flats whom he means to sell come what do you think of the plan it is a very ingenious one said i ant it said the landlord the folks in this neighbourhood are beginning to call me old fool but if they dont call me something else when they sees me friends with the brewer and money in my pocket my name is not catchpole come drink your ale and go home to the young gentlewoman i am going said i rising from my seat after finishing the remainder of the ale do you think shell have any objection said the landlord to do what said i why to fight cross yes i do said i but you will do your best to persuade her no i will not said i are you fool enough to wish to fight fair no said i i am wise enough to wish not to fight at alland hows my brewer to be paid said the landlord i really dont know said i ill change my religion said the landlordchapter xciii another visita la margutteclever mannapoleons estimateanother statue one evening belle and myself received another visit from the man in black after a little conversation of not much importance i asked him whether he would not take some refreshment assuring him that i was now in possession of some very excellent hollands which with a glass a jug of water and a lump of sugar were heartily at his service he accepted my offer and belle going with a jug to the spring from which she was in the habit of procuring water for tea speedily returned with it full of the clear delicious water of which i have already spoken having placed the jug by the side of the man in black she brought him a glass and spoon and a teacup the latter containing various lumps of snowywhite sugar in the meantime i had produced a bottle of the stronger liquid the man in black helped himself to some water and likewise to some hollands the proportion of water being about twothirds then adding a lump of sugar he stirred the whole up tasted it and said that it was good this is one of the good things of life he added after a short pause what are the others i demanded there is malvoisia sack said the man in black and partridge and beccafico and what do you say to high mass said i high mass said the man in black however he continued after a pause i will be frank with you i came to be so i may have heard high mass on a time and said it too but as for any predilection for it i assure you i have no more than for a long high church sermon you speak à la margutte said i margutte said the man in black musingly margutte you have read pulci i suppose said i yes yes said the man in black laughing i remember he might be rendered into english said i something in this style to which margutte answered with a sneer i like the blue no better than the black my faith consists alone in savoury cheer in roasted capons and in potent sack but above all in famous gin and clear which often lays the briton on his back with lump of sugar and with lympth from well i drink it and defy the fiends of hell he he he said the man in black that is more than mezzofante could have done for a stanza of byron a clever man said i who said the man in black mezzofante di bologna he he he said the man in black now i know that you are not a gypsy at least a soothsayer no soothsayer would have said that why said i does he not understand fiveandtwenty tongues o yes said the man in black and fiveandtwenty added to them buthe he he it was principally from him who is certainly the greatest of philologists that i formed my opinion of the sect you ought to speak of him with more respect said i i have heard say that he has done good service to your see o yes said the man in black he has done good service to our see that is in his way when the neophytes of the propaganda are to be examined in the several tongues in which they are destined to preach he is appointed to questionthem the questions being first written down for him or else he he he of course you know napoleons estimate of mezzofante he sent for the linguist from motives of curiosity and after some discourse with him told him that he might depart then turning to some of his generals he observed nous avons eu ici un exemple quun homme peut avoir beaucoup de paroles avec bien peu desprit you are ungrateful to him said i well perhaps when he is dead and gone you will do him justice true said the man in black when he is dead and gone we intend to erect him a statue of wood on the lefthand side of the door of the vatican library of wood said i he was the son of a carpenter you know said the man in black the figure will be of wood for no other reason i assure you he he you should place another statue on the right perhaps we shall said the man in black but we know of no one amongst the philologists of italy nor indeed of the other countries inhabited by the faithful worthy to sit parallel in effigy with our illustrissimo when indeed we have conquered those regions of the perfidious by bringing the inhabitants thereof to the true faith i have no doubt that we shall be able to select one worthy to bear him company one whose statue shall be placed on the right hand of the library in testimony of our joy at his conversion for as you know there is more joy etc wood said i i hope not said the man in black no if i be consulted as to the material for the statue i should strongly recommend bronze and when the man in black had said this he emptied his second tumbler of its contents and prepared himself anotherchapter xciv prerogativefeeling of gratitudea long historyalliterative styleadvantageous specimenjesuit beneficenot sufficientqueen storks tragedygood sensegrandeur and

glassmoneyquite original so you hope to bring these regions again beneath the banner of the roman see said i after the man in black had prepared the beverage and tasted it hope said the man in black how can we fail is not the church of these regions going to lose its prerogative its prerogative yes those who should be the guardians of the religion of england are about to grant papists emancipation and to remove the disabilities from dissenters which will allow the holy father to play his own game in england on my inquiring how the holy father intended to play his game the man in black gave me to understand that he intended for the present to cover the land with temples in which the religion of protestants would be continually scoffed at and reviled on my observing that such behaviour would savour strongly of ingratitude the man in black gave me to understand that if i entertained the idea that the see of rome was ever influenced in its actions by any feeling of gratitude i was much mistaken assuring me that if the see of rome in any encounter should chance to be disarmed and its adversary from a feeling of magnanimity should restore the sword which had been knocked out of its hand the see of rome always endeavoured on the first opportunity to plunge the said sword into its adversarys bosomconduct which the man in black seemed to think was very wise and which he assured me had already enabled it to get rid of a great many troublesome adversaries and would he had no doubt enable it to get rid of a great many more on my attempting to argue against the propriety of such behaviour the man in black cut the matter short by saying that if one party was a fool he saw no reason why the other should imitate it in its folly after musing a little while i told him that emancipation had not yet passed through the legislature and that perhaps it never would reminding him that there was often many a slip between the cup and the lip to which observation the man in black agreed assuring me however that there was no doubt that emancipation would be carried inasmuch as there was a very loud cry at present in the land a cry of tolerance which had almost frightened the government out of its wits who to get rid of the cry was going to grant all that was asked in the way of toleration instead of telling the people to hold their nonsense and cutting them down provided they continued bawling longer i questioned the man in black with respect to the origin of this cry but he said to trace it to its origin would require a long history that at any rate such a cry was in existence the chief raisers of it being certain of the nobility called whigs who hoped by means of it to get into power and to turn out certain ancient adversaries of theirs called tories who were for letting things remain in statu quo that these whigs were backed by a party amongst the people called radicals a specimen of whom i had seen in the publichouse a set of fellows who were always in the habit of bawling against those in place and so he added by means of these parties and the hubbub which the papists and other smaller sects are making a general emancipation will be carried and the church of england humbled which is the principal thing which the see of rome cares for on my telling the man in black that i believed that even among the high dignitaries of the english church there were many who wished to grant perfect freedom to religions of all descriptions he said he was aware that such was the fact and that such a wish was anything but wise inasmuch as if they had any regard for the religion they professed they ought to stand by it through thick and thin proclaiming it to be the only true one and denouncing all others in an alliterative style as dangerous and damnable whereas by their present conduct they were bringing their religion into contempt with the people at large who would never continue long attached to a church the ministers of which did not stand up for it and likewise cause their own brethren who had a clearer notion of things to be ashamed of belonging to it i speak advisedly said he in continuation there is one platitude and i hope there is only one said i you surely would not adduce the likes and dislikes of that poor silly fellow as the criterions of the opinions of any party you know him said the man in black nay i heard you mention him in the publichouse the fellow is not very wise i admit but he has sense enough to know that unless a church can make people hold their tongues when it thinks fit it is scarcely deserving the name of a church no i think that the fellow is not such a very bad stick and that upon the wholehe is or rather was an advantageous specimen of the high church english clergy who for the most part so far from troubling their heads about persecuting people only think of securing their tithes eating their heavy dinners puffing out their cheeks with importance on country justice benches and occasionally exhibiting their conceited wives hoyden daughters and gawky sons at country balls whereas platitude stop said i you said in the publichouse that the church of england was a persecuting church and here in the dingle you have confessed that one section of it is willing to grant perfect freedom to the exercise of all religions and the other only thinks of leading an easy life saying a thing in the publichouse is a widelydifferent thing from saying it in the dingle said the man in black had the church of england been a persecuting church it would not stand in the position in which it stands at present it might with its opportunities have spread itself over the greater part of the world i was about to observe that instead of practising the indolent habits of his high church brethren platitude would be working for his money preaching the proper use of fire and faggot or rather of the halter and the whippingpost encouraging mobs to attack the houses of dissenters employing spies to collect the scandal of neighbourhoods in order that he might use it for sacerdotal purposes and in fact endeavouring to turn an english parish into something like a jesuit benefice in the south of france he tried that game said i and the parish saidpooh pooh and for the most part went over to the dissenters very true said the man in black taking a sip at his glass but why were the dissenters allowed to preach why were they not beaten on the lips till they spat out blood with a dislodged tooth or two why but because the authority of the church of england has by its own fault become so circumscribed that mr platitude was not able to send a host of beadles and sbirri to their chapel to bring them to reason on which account mr platitude is very properly ashamed of his church and is thinking of uniting himself with one which possesses more vigour and authority it may have vigour and authority said i in foreign lands but in these kingdoms the day for practising its atrocities is gone by it is at present almost below contempt and is obliged to sue for grace in formâ pauperis very true said the man in black but let it once obtain emancipation and it will cast its slough put on its fine clothes and make converts by thousands what a fine church theyll say with what authority it speaksno doubts no hesitation no sticking at trifles what a contrast to the sleepy english church theyll go over to it by millions till it preponderates here over every other when it will of course be voted the dominant one and thenand then and here the man in black drank a considerable quantity of gin and water what then said i what then said the man in black why she will be true to herself let dissenters whether they be church of england as perhaps they may still call themselves methodist or presbyterian presume to grumble and there shall be bruising of lips in pulpits tying up to whippingposts cutting off ears and noseshe he the farce of king log has been acted long enough the time for queen storks tragedy is drawing nigh and the man in black sipped his gin and water in a very exulting manner and this is the church which according to your assertion in the publichouse never persecutes i have already given you an answer said the man in black with respect to the matter of the publichouse it is one of the happy privileges of those who belong to my church to deny in the publichouse what they admit in the dingle we have high warranty for such double speaking did not the foundation stone of our church saint peter deny in the publichouse what he had previously professed in the valley and do you think said i that the people of england who have shown aversion to anything in the shape of intolerance will permit such barbarities as you have described let them become papists said the man in black only let the majority become papists and you will see they will never become so said i the good sense of the people of england will never permit them to commit such an absurdity the good sense of the people of england said the man in black filling himself another glass yes said i the good sense of not only the upper but the middle and lower classes and of what description of people are the upper class said the man in black putting a lump of sugar into his gin and watervery fine people said i monstrously fine people so at least they are generally believed to be he he said the man in black only those think them so who dont know them the male part of the upper class are in youth a set of heartless profligates in old age a parcel of poor shaking nervous paillards the female part worthy to be the sisters and wives of such wretches unmarried full of cold vice kept under by vanity and ambition but which after marriage they seek not to restrain in old age abandoned to vapours and horrors do you think that such beings will afford any obstacle to the progress of the church in these regions as soon as her movements are unfettered i cannot give an opinion i know nothing of them except from a distance but what think you of the middle classes their chief characteristic said the man in black is a rage for grandeur and gentility and that same rage makes us quite sure of them in the long run everything thats lofty meets their unqualified approbation whilst everything humble or as they call it low is scouted by them they begin to have a vague idea that the religion which they have hitherto professed is low at any rate that it is not the religion of the mighty ones of the earth of the great kings and emperors whose shoes they have a vast inclination to kiss nor was used by the grand personages of whom they have read in their novels and romances their ivanhoes their marmions and their ladies of the lake do you think that the writings of scott have had any influence in modifying their religious opinions most certainly i do said the man in black the writings of that man have made them greater fools than they were before all their conversation now is about gallant knights princesses and cavaliers with which his pages are stuffed all of whom were papists or very high church which is nearly the same thing and they are beginning to think that the religion of such nice sweetscented gentry must be something very superfine why i know at birmingham the daughter of an ironmonger who screeches to the piano the lady of the lakes hymn to the virgin mary always weeps when mary queen of scots is mentioned and fasts on the anniversary of the death of that very wise martyr charles the first why i would engage to convert such an idiot to popery in a week were it worth my trouble o cavalière gualtiero avete fatto molto in favore delle santa sede if he has said i he has done it unwittingly i never heard before that he was a favourer of the popish delusion only in theory said the man in black trust any of the clan macsycophant for interfering openly and boldly in favour of any cause on which the sun does not shine benignantly popery is at present as you say suing for grace in these regions in formâ pauperis but let royalty once take it up let old gouty george once patronize it and i would consent to drink puddlewater if the very next time the canny scot was admitted to the royal symposium he did not say by my faith yere majesty i have always thought at the bottom of my heart that popery as ill scrapit tongues ca it was a very grand religion i shall be proud to follow your majestys example in adopting it i doubt not said i that both gouty george and his devoted servant will be mouldering in their tombs long before royalty in england thinks about adopting popery we can wait said the man in black in these days of rampant gentility there will be no want of kings nor of scots about them but not walters said i our work has been already tolerably well done by one said the man in black but if we wanted literature we should never lack in these regions hosts of literary men of some kind or other to eulogize us provided our religion were in the fashion and our popish nobles choose and they always do our bidding to admit the canaille to their tables their kitchen tables as for literature in general said he the santa sede is not particularly partial to it it may be employed both ways in italy in particular it has discovered that literary men are not always disposed to be lickspittles for example dante said i yes said the man in black a dangerous personage that poem of his cuts both ways and then there was pulci that morgante of his cuts both ways or rather one way and that sheer against us and then there was aertino who dealt so hard with the poveri frati all writers at least italian ones are not lickspittles and then in spaintis true lope de vega and calderon were most inordinate lickspittles the principe constante of the last is a curiosity in its way and then the mary stuart of lope i think i shall recommend the perusal of that work to the birmingham ironworkers daughter she has been lately thinking of adding a slight knowledge of the magneeficent language of the peninsula to the rest of her accomplishments he he he but then there was cervantes starving but straight he deals us some hard knocks in that second part of his quixote then there was some of the writers of the picaresque novels no all literary men are not lickspittles whether in italy or spain or indeed upon the continent it is only in england that all come said i mind what you are about to say of english literary menwhy should i mind said the man in black there are no literary men here i have heard of literary men living in garrets but not in dingles whatever philologists may do i may therefore speak out freely it is only in england that literary men are invariably lickspittles on which account perhaps they are so despised even by those who benefit by their dirty services look at your fashionable novel writers he he and above all at your newspaper editors ho ho you will of course except the editors of the from your censure of the last class said i them said the man in black why they might serve as models in the dirty trade to all the rest who practise it see how they bepraise their patrons the grand whig nobility who hope by raising the cry of liberalism and by putting themselves at the head of the populace to come into power shortly i dont wish to be hard at present upon those whigs he continued for they are playing our game but a time will come when not wanting them we will kick them to a considerable distance and then when toleration is no longer the cry and the whigs are no longer backed by the populace see whether the editors of the will stand by them they will prove themselves as expert lickspittles of despotism as of liberalism dont think they will always bespatter the tories and austria well said i i am sorry to find that you entertain so low an opinion of the spirit of english literary men we will now return if you please to the subject of the middle classes i think your strictures upon them in general are rather too sweepingthey are not altogether the foolish people you have described look for example at that very powerful and numerous body the dissenters the descendants of those sturdy patriots who hurled charles the simple from his throne there are some sturdy fellows amongst them i do not deny said the man in black especially amongst the preachers clever withaltwo or three of that class nearly drove mr platitude mad as perhaps you are aware but they are not very numerous and the old sturdy sort of preachers are fast dropping off and as we observe with pleasure are generally succeeded by frothy coxcombs whom it would not be very difficult to gain over but what we most rely upon as an instrument to bring the dissenters over to us is the mania for gentility which amongst them has of late become as great and more ridiculous than amongst the middle classes belonging to the church of england all the plain and simple fashions of their forefathers they are either about to abandon or have already done so look at the most part of their chapels no longer modest brick edifices situated in quiet and retired streets but lunaticlooking erections in what the simpletons call the modern gothic taste of portlandstone with a cross upon the top and the site generally the most conspicuous that can be found and look at the manner in which they educate their children i mean those that are wealthy they do not even wish them to be dissenters the sweet dears shall enjoy the advantages of good society of which their parents were debarred so the girls are sent to tiptop boarding schools where amongst other trash they read rokeby and are taught to sing snatches from that highflying ditty the cavalier would you match the base skippon and massey and brown with the barons of england who fight for the crown he he their own names whilst the lads are sent to those hotbeds of pride and follycolleges whence they return with a greater contempt for everything low and especially for their own pedigree than they went with i tell you friend the children of dissenters if not their parents are going over to the church as you call it and the church is going over to rome i do not see the justice of that latter assertion at all said i some of the dissenters children may be coming over to the church of england and yet the church of england be very far from going over to rome in the high road for it i assure you said the man in black part of it is going to abandon the rest to lose their prerogative and when a church no longer retains its prerogative it speedily loses its own respect and that of others well said i if the higher classes have all the vices and follies which you represent on which point i can say nothing as i have never mixed with them and even supposing the middle classes are the foolish beings you would fain make them and which i do not believe them as a body to be you would still find some resistance amongst the lower classes i have a considerable respect for their good sense and independence of character but pray let me hear your opinion of them as for the lower classes said the man in black i believe them to be the most brutal wretches in the world the most addicted to foul feeding foul language and foul vices of every kind wretches who have neither love for country religion nor anything save their own vile selves you surely do not think that they would oppose a change of religion why there is not one of them but would hurrah for the pope or mahomet for the sake of a hearty gorge and a drunken bout like those which they are treated with at election contests has your church any followers amongst them said i wherever there happens to be a romish family of considerable possessions said the man in black our church is sure to have followers of the lower class who have come over in the hope of getting something in the shape of dole ordonation as however the romish is not yet the dominant religion and the clergy of the english establishment have some patronage to bestow the churches are not quite deserted by the lower classes yet were the romish to become the established religion they would to a certainty all go over to it you can scarcely imagine what a selfinterested set they arefor example the landlord of that publichouse in which i first met you having lost a sum of money upon a cockfight and his affairs in consequence being in a bad condition is on the eve of coming over to us in the hope that two old popish females of property whom i confess will advance a sum of money to set him up again in the world and what could have put such an idea into the poor fellows head said i oh he and i have had some conversation upon the state of his affairs said the man in black i think he might make a rather useful convert in these parts provided things take a certain turn as they doubtless will it is no bad thing to have a fighting fellow who keeps a publichouse belonging to ones religion he has been occasionally employed as a bully at elections by the tory party and he may serve us in the same capacity the fellow comes of a good stock i heard him say that his father headed the high church mob who sacked and burnt priestleys house at birmingham towards the end of the last century a disgraceful affair said i what do you mean by a disgraceful affair said the man in black i assure you that nothing has occurred for the last fifty years which has given the highchurch party so much credit in the eyes of rome as that we did not imagine that the fellows had so much energy had they followed up that affair by twenty others of a similar kind they would by this time have had everything in their own power but they did not and as a necessary consequence they are reduced to almost nothing i suppose said i that your church would have acted very differently in its place it has always done so said the man in black coolly sipping our church has always armed the brutepopulation against the genius and intellect of a country provided that same intellect and genius were not willing to become its instruments and eulogists and provided we once obtain a firm hold here again we would not fail to do so we would occasionally stuff the beastly rabble with horseflesh and bitter ale and then halloo them on against all those who were obnoxious to us horseflesh and bitter ale i replied yes said the man in black horseflesh and bitter ale the favourite delicacies of their saxon ancestors who were always ready to do our bidding after a liberal allowance of such cheer there is a tradition in our church that before the northumbrian rabble at the instigation of austin attacked and massacred the presbyterian monks of bangor they had been allowed a good gorge of horseflesh and bitter ale he he he continued the man in black what a fine spectacle to see such a mob headed by a fellow like our friend the landlord sack the house of another priestley then you dont deny that we have had a priestley said i and admit the possibility of our having another you were lately observing that all english literary men were sycophants lickspittles said the man in black yes i admit that you have had a priestley but he was a dissenter of the old class you have had him and perhaps may have another perhaps we may said i but with respect to the lower classes have you mixed much with them i have mixed with all classes said the man in black and with the lower not less than the upper and middle they are much as i have described them and of the three the lower are the worst i never knew one of them that possessed the slightest principle no not it is true there was one fellow whom i once met who but it is a long story and the affair happened abroad i ought to know something of the english people he continued after a moments pause i have been many years amongst them labouring in the cause of the church your see must have had great confidence in your powers when it selected you to labour for it in these parts said i they chose me said the man in black principally because being of british extraction and education i could speak the english language and bear a glass of something strong it is the opinion of my see that it would hardly do to send a missionary into a country like this who is not well versed in english a country where they think so far from understanding any language besides his own scarcely one individual in ten speaks his own intelligibly or an ascetic person where as they say high and low male and female are at some period of their lives fond of a renovating glass as it is styled in other words of tipplingyour see appears to entertain a very strange opinion of the english said i not altogether an unjust one said the man in black lifting the glass to his mouth well said i it is certainly very kind on its part to wish to bring back such a set of beings beneath its wing why as to the kindness of my see said the man in black i have not much to say my see has generally in what it does a tolerably good motive these heretics possess in plenty what my see has a great hankering for and can turn to a good accountmoney the founder of the christian religion cared nothing for money said i what have we to do with what the founder of the christian religion cared for said the man in black how could our temples be built and our priests supported without money but you are unwise to reproach us with a desire of obtaining money you forget that your own church if the church of england be your own church as i suppose it is from the willingness which you displayed in the publichouse to fight for it is equally avaricious look at your greedy bishops and your corpulent rectors do they imitate christ in his disregard for money you might as well tell me that they imitate christ in his meekness and humility well said i whatever their faults may be you cant say that they go to rome for money the man in black made no direct answer but appeared by the motion of his lips to be repeating something to himself i see your glass is again empty said i perhaps you will replenish it the man in black arose from his chair adjusted his habiliments which were rather in disorder and placed upon his head his hat which he had laid aside then looking at me who was still lying on the ground he saidi might perhaps take another glass though i believe i have had quite as much as i can well bear but i do not wish to hear you utter anything more this evening after that last observation of yoursit is quite original i will meditate upon it on my pillow this night after having said an ave and a patergo to rome for money he then made belle a low bow slightly motioned to me with his hand as if bidding farewell and then left the dingle with rather uneven steps go to rome for money i heard him say as he ascended the winding path he he he go to rome for money ho ho hochapter xcv wooded retreatfresh shoeswood fireash when greenqueen of chinacleverest peopledeclensions armenianthunderdeep olivewhat do you meankoul adonaithe thick busheswood pigeonold goethe nearly three days elapsed without anything of particular moment occurring belle drove the little cart containing her merchandise about the neighbourhood returning to the dingle towards the evening as for myself i kept within my wooded retreat working during the periods of her absence leisurely at my forge having observed that the quadruped which my companion drove was as much in need of shoes as my own had been some time previously i had determined to provide it with a set and during the aforesaid periods occupied myself in preparing them as i was employed three mornings and afternoons about them i am sure that the reader will agree that i worked leisurely or rather lazily on the third day belle arrived somewhat later than usual i was lying on my back at the bottom of the dingle employed in tossing up the shoes which i had produced and catching them as they fell some being always in the air mounting or descending somewhat after the fashion of the waters of a fountain why have you been absent so long said i to belle it must be long past four by the day i have been almost killed by the heat said belle i was never out in a more sultry daythe poor donkey too could scarcely move along he shall have fresh shoes said i continuing my exercise here they are quite ready tomorrow i will tack them on and why are you playing with them in that manner said belle partly in triumph at having made them and partly to show that i can do something besides making them it is not every one who after having made a set of horseshoes can keep them going up and down in the air without letting one fall one has now fallen on your chin said belle and another on my cheek said i getting up it is time to discontinue the game for the last shoe drew blood belle went to her own little encampment and as for myself after having flung the donkeys shoes into my tent i put some fresh wood on the fire which was nearly out and hung the kettle over it i then issued forth from the dingle and strolled round the wood that surrounded it for a long time i was busied in meditation looking at the ground striking with my foot half unconsciously the tufts of grass and thistles that i met in my way after some time i lifted up my eyes to the sky at first vacantly and then with more attention turning my head in all directions for a minute or two after which i returned to the dingle isopel was seated near the fire over which the kettle was now hung she had changed her dressno signs of the dust and fatigue of her late excursion remained she had just added to the fire a small billet of wood two or three of which i had left beside it the fire cracked and a sweet odour filled the dingle i am fond of sitting by a wood fire said belle when abroad whether it be hot or cold i love to see the flames dart out of the wood but what kind is this and where did you get it it is ash said i green ash somewhat less than a week ago whilst i was wandering along the road by the side of a wood i came to a place where some peasants were engaged in cutting up and clearing away a confused mass of fallen timber a mighty aged oak had given way the night before and in its fall had shivered some smaller trees the upper part of the oak and the fragments of the rest lay across the road i purchased for a trifle a bundle or two and the wood on the fire is part of itash green ash that makes good the old rhyme said belle which i have heard sung by the old women in the great house ash when green is fire for a queen and on fairer form of queen ash fire never shone said i than on thine o beauteous queen of the dingle i am half disposed to be angry with you young man said belle and why not entirely said i belle made no reply shall i tell you i demanded you had no objection to the first part of the speech but you did not like being calledqueen of the dingle well if i had the power i would make you queen of something better than the dinglequeen of china come let us have tea something less would content me said belle sighing as she rose to prepare our evening meal so we took tea together belle and i how delicious tea is after a hot summers day and a long walk said she i dare say it is most refreshing then said i but i have heard people say that they most enjoy it on a cold winters night when the kettle is hissing on the fire and their children playing on the hearth belle sighed where does tea come from she presently demanded from china said i i just now mentioned it and the mention of it put me in mind of tea what kind of country is china i know very little about it all i know is that it is a very large country far to the east but scarcely large enough to contain its inhabitants who are so numerous that though china does not cover oneninth part of the world its inhabitants amount to onethird of the population of the world and do they talk as we do o no i know nothing of their language but i have heard that it is quite different from all others and so difficult that none but the cleverest people amongst foreigners can master it on which account perhaps only the french pretend to know anything about it are the french so very clever then said belle they say there are no people like them at least in europe but talking of chinese reminds me that i have not for some time past given you a lesson in armenian the word for tea in armenian isbythebye what is the armenian word for tea thats your affair not mine said belle it seems hard that the master should ask the scholar well said i whatever the word may be in armenian it is a noun and as we have never yet declined an armenian noun together we may as well take this opportunity of declining one belle there are ten declensions in armenian whats a declension the way of declining a noun then in the civilest way imaginable i decline the noun is that a declension you should never play on words to do so is low vulgar smelling of the pothouse the workhouse belle i insist on your declining an armenian noun i have done so already said belle if you go on in this way said i i shall decline taking any more tea with you will you decline an armenian noun i dont like the language said belle if you must teach me languages why not teach me french or chinese i know nothing of chinese and as for french none but a frenchman is clever enough to speak itto say nothing of teaching no we will stick to armenian unless indeed you would prefer welsh welsh i have heard is vulgar said belle so if i must learn one of the two i will prefer armenian which i never heard of till you mentioned it to me though of the two i really think welsh sounds best the armenian noun said i which i propose for your declension this night is which signifieth master i neither like the word nor the sound said belle i cant help that said i it is the word i choose master with all its variations being the first noun the sound of which i would have you learn from my lips come let us begin a master of a master etc repeati am not much used to say the word said belle but to oblige you i will decline it as you wish and thereupon belle declined master in armenian you have declined the noun very well said i that is in the singular number we will now go to the plural what is the plural said belle that which implies more than one for example masters you shall now go through masters in armenian never said belle never it is bad to have one master but more i would never bear whether in armenian or english you do not understand said i i merely want you to decline masters in armenian i do decline them i will have nothing to do with them nor with master either i was wrong towhat sound is that i did not hear it but i dare say it is thunder in armenian never mind what it is in armenian but why do you think it is thunder ere i returned from my stroll i looked up into the heavens and by their appearance i judged that a storm was nigh at hand and why did you not tell me so you never asked me about the state of the atmosphere and i am not in the habit of giving my opinion to people on any subject unless questioned but setting that aside can you blame me for not troubling you with forebodings about storm and tempest which might have prevented the pleasure you promised yourself in drinking tea or perhaps a lesson in armenian though you pretend to dislike the latter my dislike is not pretended said belle i hate the sound of it but i love my tea and it was kind of you not to wish to cast a cloud over my little pleasures the thunder came quite time enough to interrupt it without being anticipatedthere is another peali will clear away and see that my tent is in a condition to resist the storm and i think you had better bestir yourself isopel departed and i remained seated on my stone as nothing belonging to myself required any particular attention in about a quarter of an hour she returned and seated herself upon her stool how dark the place is become since i left you said she just as if night were just at hand look up at the sky said i and you will not wonder it is all of a deep olive the wind is beginning to rise hark how it moans among the branches and see now their tops are bendingit brings dust on its wingsi felt some fall on my face and what is this a drop of rain we shall have plenty anon said belle do you hear it already begins to hiss upon the embers that fire of ours will soon be extinguished it is not probable that we shall want it said i but we had better seek shelter let us go into my tent go in said belle but you go in alone as for me i will seek my own you are right said i to be afraid of me i have taught you to decline master in armenian you almost tempt me said belle to make you decline mistress in english to make matters short said i i decline a mistress what do you mean said belle angrily i have merely done what you wished me said i and in your own style there is no other way of declining anything in english for in english there are no declensions the rain is increasing said belle it is so said i i shall go to my tent you may come if you please i do assure you i am not afraid of you nor i of you said belle so i will come why should i be afraid i can take my own part that iswe went into the tent and sat down and now the rain began to pour with vehemence i hope we shall not be flooded in this hollow said i to belle there is no fear of that said belle the wandering people amongst other names call it the dry hollow i believe there is a passage somewhere or other by which the wet is carried off there must be a cloud right above us it is so dark oh what a flash and what a peal said i that is what the hebrews call koul adonaithe voice of the lord are you afraid no said belle i rather like to hear it you are right said i i am fond of the sound of thunder myself there is nothing like it koul adonai behadar the voice of the lord is a glorious voice as the prayerbook version hath it there is something awful in it said belle and then the lightning the whole dingle is now in a blaze the voice of the lord maketh the hinds to calve and discovereth the thick bushes as you say there is something awful in thunder there are all kinds of noises above us said belle surely i heard the crashing of a tree the voice of the lord breaketh the cedar trees said i but what you hear is caused by a convulsion of the air during a thunderstorm there are occasionally all kinds of aërial noises ab gwilym who next to king david has best described a thunderstorm speaks of these aërial noises in the following manner astonied now i stand at strains as of ten thousand clanking chains and once methought that overthrown the welkins oaks came whelming down upon my head up starts my hair why hunt abroad the hounds of air what cursed hag is screeching high whilst crash goes all her crockery you would hardly believe belle that though i offered at least ten thousand lines nearly as good as those to the booksellers in london the simpletons were so blind to their interest as to refuse purchasing them i dont wonder at it said belle especially if such dreadful expressions frequently occur as that towards the end surely that was the crash of a tree ah said i there falls the cedar treei mean the sallow one of the tall trees on the outside of the dingle has been snapped short what a pity said belle that the fine old oak which you saw the peasants cutting up gave way the other night when scarcely a breath of air was stirring how much better to have fallen in a storm like this the fiercest i remember i dont think so said i after braving a thousand tempests it was meeter for it to fall of itself than to be vanquished at last but to return to ab gwilyms poetry he was above culling dainty words and spoke boldly his mind on all subjects enraged with the thunder for parting him and morfydd he says at the conclusion of his ode my curse o thunder cling to thee for parting my dear pearl and me you and i shall part this is i shall go to my tent if you persist in repeating from him the man must have been a savage a poor woodpigeon has fallen dead yes said i there he lies just outside the tent often have i listened to his note when alone in this wilderness so you do not like ab gwilym what say you to old goethe mist shrouds the night and rack hear in the woods what an awful crack wildly the owls are flitting hark to the pillars splitting of palaces verdant ever the branches quiver and sever the mighty stems are creakingthe poor roots breaking and shrieking in wild mixt ruin down dashing oer one another theyre crashing whilst midst the rocks so hoary whirlwinds hurry and worry hearst not sister hark said belle hark hearst not sister a chorus of voices no said belle but i hear a voicechapter xcvi a shouta fire ballsee to the horsespassing awaygap in the hedgeon three wheelswhy do you stop no craven heartthe cordialacross the countrysmall bags i listened attentively but i could hear nothing but the loud clashing of branches the pattering of rain and the muttered growl of thunder i was about to tell belle that she must have been mistaken when i heard a shout indistinct it is true owing to the noises aforesaid from some part of the field above the dingle i will soon see whats the matter said i to belle starting up i will go too said the girl stay where you are said i if i need you i will call and without waiting for any answer i hurried to the mouth of the dingle i was about a few yards only from the top of the ascent when i beheld a blaze of light from whence i knew not the next moment there was a loud crash and i appeared involved in a cloud of sulphurous smoke lord have mercy upon us i heard a voice say and methought i heard the plunging and struggling of horses i had stopped short on hearing the crash for i was half stunned but i now hurried forward and in a moment stood upon the plain here i was instantly aware of the cause of the crash and the smoke one of those balls generally called fireballs had fallen from the clouds and was burning on the plain at a short distance and the voice which i had heard and the plunging were as easily accounted for near the lefthand corner of the grove which surrounded the dingle and about ten yards from the fireball i perceived a chaise with a postillion on the box who was making efforts apparently useless to control his horses which were kicking and plunging in the highest degree of excitement i instantly ran towards the chaise in order to offer what help was in my power help me said the poor fellow as i drew nigh but before i could reach the horses they had turned rapidly round one of the forewheels flew from its axletree the chaise was overset and the postillion flung violently from his seat upon the field the horses now became more furious than before kicking desperately and endeavouring to disengage themselves from the fallen chaise as i was hesitating whether to run to the assistance of the postillion or endeavour to disengage the animals i heard the voice of belle exclaiming see to the horses i will look after the man she had it seems been alarmed by the crash which accompanied the firebolt and had hurried up to learn the cause i forthwith seized the horses by the heads and used all the means i possessed to soothe and pacify them employing every gentle modulation of which my voice was capable belle in the meantime had raised up the man who was much stunned by his fall but presently recovering his recollection to a certain degree he came limping to me holding his hand to his right thigh the first thing that must now be done said i is to free these horses from the traces can you undertake to do so i think i can said the man looking at me somewhat stupidly i will help said belle and without loss of time laid hold of one of the traces the man after a short pause also set to work and in a few minutes the horses were extricated now said i to the man what is next to be done i dont know said he indeed i scarcely know anything i have been so frightened by this horrible storm and so shaken by my fall i think said i that the storm is passing away so cast your fears away too and as for your fall you must bear it as lightly as you can i will tie the horses amongst those trees and then we will all betake us to the hollow below and whats to become of my chaise said the postillion looking ruefully on the fallen vehicle let us leave the chaise for the present said i we can be of no use to it i dont like to leave my chaise lying on the ground in this weather said the man i love my chaise and him whom it belongs to you are quite right to be fond of yourself said i on which account i advise you to seek shelter from the rain as soon as possible i was not talking of myself said the man but my master to whom the chaise belongs i thought you called the chaise yours said i thats my way of speaking said the man but the chaise is my masters and a better master does not live dont you think we could manage to raise up the chaise and what is to become of the horses said i i love my horses well enough said the man but they will take less harm than the chaise we two can never lift up that chaise but we three can said belle at least i think so and i know where to find two poles which will assist us you had better go to the tent said i you will be wet through i care not for a little wetting said belle moreover i have more gowns than onesee you after the horses thereupon i led the horses past the mouth of the dingle to a place where a gap in the hedge afforded admission to the copse or plantation on the southern side forcing them through the gap i led them to a spot amidst the trees which i deemed would afford them the most convenient place for standing then darting down into the dingle i brought up a rope and also the halter of my own nag and with these fastened them each to a separate tree in the best manner i could this done i returned to the chaise and the postillion in a minute or two belle arrived with two poles which it seems had long been lying overgrown with brushwood in a ditch or hollow behind the plantation with these both she and i set to work in endeavouring to raise the fallen chaise from the ground we experienced considerable difficulty in this undertaking at length with the assistance of the postillion we saw our efforts crowned with successthe chaise was lifted up and stood upright on three wheels we may leave it here in safety said i for it will hardly move away on three wheels even supposing it could run by itself i am afraid there is work here for a wheelwright in which case i cannot assist you if you were in need of a blacksmith it would be otherwise i dont think either the wheel or the axle is hurt said the postillion who had been handling both it is only the linchpin having dropped out that caused the wheel to fly off if i could but find the linchpin though perhaps it fell out a mile away very likely said i but never mind the linchpin i can make you one or something that will serve but i cant stay here any longer i am going to my place below with this young gentlewoman and you had better follow us i am ready said the man and after lifting up the wheel and propping it against thechaise he went with us slightly limping and with his hand pressed to his thigh as we were descending the narrow path belle leading the way and myself the last of the party the postillion suddenly stopped short and looked about him why do you stop said i i dont wish to offend you said the man but this seems to be a strange place you are leading me into i hope you and the young gentlewoman as you call her dont mean me any harmyou seemed in a great hurry to bring me here we wished to get you out of the rain said i and ourselves too that is if we can which i rather doubt for the canvas of a tent is slight shelter in such a rain but what harm should we wish to do you you may think i have money said the man and i have some but only thirty shillings and for a sum like that it would be hardly worth while to would it not said i thirty shillings after all are thirty shillings and for what i know halfadozen throats may have been cut in this place for that sum at the rate of five shillings each moreover there are the horses which would serve to establish the young gentlewoman and myself in housekeeping provided we were thinking of such a thing then i suppose i have fallen into pretty hands said the man putting himself in a posture of defence but ill show no craven heart and if you attempt to lay hands on me ill try to pay you in your own coin im rather lamed in the leg but i can still use my fists so come on both of you man and woman if woman this be though she looks more like a grenadier let me hear no more of this nonsense said belle if you are afraid you can go back to your chaisewe only seek to do you a kindness why he was just now talking of cutting throats said the man you brought it on yourself said belle you suspected us and he wished to pass a joke upon you he would not hurt a hair of your head were your coach laden with gold nor would i well said the man i was wrongheres my hand to both of you shaking us by the hands ill go with you where you please but i thought this a strange lonesome place though i ought not much to mind strange lonesome places having been in plenty of such when i was a servant in italy without coming to any harmcome let us move on for tis a shame to keep you two in the rain so we descended the path which led into the depths of the dingle at the bottom i conducted the postillion to my tent which though the rain dripped and trickled through it afforded some shelter there i bade him sit down on the log of wood while i placed myself as usual on my stone belle in the meantime had repaired to her own place of abode after a little time i produced a bottle of the cordial of which i have previously had occasion to speak and made my guest take a considerable draught i then offered him some bread and cheese which he accepted with thanks in about an hour the rain had much abated what do you now propose to do said i i scarcely know said the man i suppose i must endeavour to put on the wheel with your help how far are you from your home i demanded upwards of thirty miles said the man my master keeps an inn on the great north road and from thence i started early this morning with a family which i conveyed across the country to a hall at some distance from here on my return i was beset by the thunderstorm which frightened the horses who dragged the chaise off the road to the field above and overset it as you saw i had proposed to pass the night at an inn about twelve miles from here on my way back though how i am to get there tonight i scarcely know even if we can put on the wheel for to tell you the truth i am shaken by my fall and the smoulder and smoke of that fireball have rather bewildered my head i am moreover not much acquainted with the way the best thing you can do said i is to pass the night here i will presently light a fire and endeavour to make you comfortablein the morning we will see to your wheel well said the man i shall be glad to pass the night here provided i do not intrude but i must see to the horses thereupon i conducted the man to the place where the horses were tied the trees drip very much upon them said the man and it will not do for them to remain here all night they will be better out on the field picking the grass but first of all they must have a good feed of corn thereupon he went to his chaise from which he presently brought two small bags partly filled with corninto them he inserted the mouths of the horses tying them over their heads here we will leave them for a time said the man when i think they have had enough i will come back tie their forelegs and let them pick aboutchapter xcvii fire of charcoalthe new comerno wondernot a blacksmitha love affairgretna greena cool thousand family estatesborough interestgrand educationlet us hearalready quarrellinghonourable parentsmost heroicallynot common peoplefresh charcoal it might be about ten oclock at night belle the postillion and myself sat just within the tent by a fire of charcoal which i had kindled in the chafingpan the man had removed the harness from his horses and after tethering their legs had left them for the night in the field above to regale themselves on what grass they could find the rain had long since entirely ceased and the moon and stars shone bright in the firmament up to which putting aside the canvas i occasionally looked from the depths of the dingle large drops of water however falling now and then upon the tent from the neighbouring trees would have served could we have forgotten it to remind us of the recent storm and also a certain chilliness in the atmosphere unusual to the season proceeding from the moisture with which the ground was saturated yet these circumstances only served to make our party enjoy the charcoal fire the more there we sat bending over it belle with her long beautiful hair streaming over her magnificent shoulders the postillion smoking his pipe in his shirtsleeves and waistcoat having flung aside his great coat which had sustained a thorough wetting and i without my wagoners slop of which it being in the same plight i had also divested myself the new comer was a wellmade fellow of about thirty with an open and agreeable countenance i found him very well informed for a man in his station and with some pretensions to humour after we had discoursed for some time on indifferent subjects the postillion who had exhausted his pipe took it from his mouth and knocking out the ashes upon the ground exclaimed i little thought when i got up in the morning that i should spend the night in such agreeable company and after such a fright well said i i am glad that your opinion of us has improved it is not long since you seemed to hold us in rather a suspicious light and no wonder said the man seeing the place you were taking me to i was not a little but very much afraid of ye both and so i continued for some time though not to show a craven heart i pretended to be quite satisfied but i see i was altogether mistaken about ye i thought you vagrant gypsy folks and trampers but now vagrant gypsy folks and trampers said i and what are we but people of that stamp oh said the postillion if you wish to be thought such i am far too civil a person to contradict you especially after your kindness to me but but said i what do you mean by but i would have you to know that i am proud of being a travelling blacksmith look at these donkeyshoes i finished them this day the postillion took the shoes and examined them so you made these shoes he cried at last to be sure i did do you doubt it not in the least said the man ah ah said i i thought i should bring you back to your original opinion i am then a vagrant gypsy body a tramper a wandering blacksmith not a blacksmith whatever else you may be said the postillion laughing then how do you account for my making those shoes by your not being a blacksmith said the postillion no blacksmith would have made shoes in that manner besides what did you mean just now by saying you had finished these shoes today a real blacksmith would have flung off three or four sets of donkeyshoes in one morning but you i will be sworn have been hammering at these for days and they do you credit but why because you are no blacksmith no friend your shoes may do for this young gentlewomans animal but i shouldnt like to have my horses shod by you unless at a great pinch indeed then said i for what do you take me why for some runaway young gentleman said the postillion no offence i hope none at all no one is offended at being taken or mistaken for a young gentleman whether runaway or not but from whence do you suppose i have run awaywhy from college said the man no offence none whatever and what induced me to run away from college a love affair ill be sworn said the postillion you had become acquainted with this young gentlewoman so she and you mind how you get on friend said belle in a deep serious tone pray proceed said i i dare say you mean no offence none in the world said the postillion all i was going to say was that you agreed to run away together you from college and she from boardingschool well theres nothing to be ashamed of in a matter like that such things are done every day by young folks in high life are you offended said i to belle belle made no answer but placing her elbows on her knees buried her face in her hands so we ran away together said i ay ay said the postillion to gretna green though i cant say that i drove ye though i have driven many a pair and from gretna green we came here ill be bound you did said the man till you could arrange matters at home and the horseshoes said i the donkeyshoes you mean answered the postillion why i suppose you persuaded the blacksmith who married you to give you before you left a few lessons in his trade and we intend to stay here till we have arranged matters at home ay ay said the postillion till the old people are pacified and they send you letters directed to the next post town to be left till called for beginning with dear children and enclosing you each a cheque for one hundred pounds when you will leave this place and go home in a coach like gentlefolks to visit your governors i should like nothing better than to have the driving of you and then there will be a grand meeting of the two families and after a few reproaches the old people will agree to do something handsome for the poor thoughtless things so you will have a genteel house taken for you and an annuity allowed you you wont get much the first year five hundred at the most in order that the old folks may let you feel that they are not altogether satisfied with you and that you are yet entirely in their power but the second if you dont get a cool thousand may i catch cold especially should young madam here present a son and heir for the old people to fondle destined one day to become sole heir of the two illustrious houses and then all the grand folks in the neighbourhood who have bless their prudent hearts kept rather aloof from you till then for fear you should want anything from themi say all the carriage people in the neighbourhood when they see how swimmingly matters are going on will come in shoals to visit you really said i you are getting on swimmingly oh said the postillion i was not a gentlemans servant nine years without learning the ways of gentry and being able to know gentry when i see them and what do you say to all this i demanded of belle stop a moment interposed the postillion i have one more word to sayand when you are surrounded by your comforts keeping your nice little barouche and pair your coachman and livery servant and visited by all the carriage people in the neighbourhoodto say nothing of the time when you come to the family estates on the death of the old peoplei shouldnt wonder if now and then you look back with longing and regret to the days when you lived in the damp dripping dingle had no better equipage than a pony or donkeycart and saw no better company than a tramper or gypsy except once when a poor postillion was glad to seat himself at your charcoal fire pray said i did you ever take lessons in elocution not directly said the postillion but my old master who was in parliament did and so did his son who was intended to be an orator a great professor used to come and give them lessons and i used to stand and listen by which means ipicked up a considerable quantity of what is called rhetoric in what i last said i was aiming at what i have heard him frequently endeavouring to teach my governors as a thing indispensably necessary in all oratory a graceful perepere peregrination peroration perhaps just so said the postillion and now im sure i am not mistaken about you you have taken lessons yourself at first hand in the college vacations and a promising pupil you were i make no doubt well your friends will be all the happier to get you back has your governor much borough interest i ask you once more said i addressing myself to belle what you think of the history which this good man has made for us what should i think of it said belle still keeping her face buried in her hands but that it is mere nonsense nonsense said the postillion yes said the girl and you know it may my leg always ache if i do said the postillion patting his leg with his hand will you persuade me that this young man has never been at college i have never been at college but ay ay said the postillion but i have been to the best schools in britain to say nothing of a celebrated one in ireland well then it comes to the same thing said the postillion or perhaps you know more than if you had been at college and your governor my governor as you call him said i is dead and his borough interest my father had no borough interest said i had he possessed any he would perhaps not have died as he did honourably poor no no said the postillion if he had had borough interest he wouldnt have been poor nor honourable though perhaps a right honourable however with your grand education and genteel manners you made all right at last by persuading this noble young gentlewoman to run away from boardingschool with you i was never at boardingschool said belle unless you call ay ay said the postillion boardingschool is vulgar i know i beg your pardon i ought to have called it academy or by some other much finer nameyou were in something much greater than a boardingschool there you are right said belle lifting up her head and looking the postillion full in the face by the light of the charcoal fire for i was bred in the workhouse wooh said the postillion it is true that i am of good ay ay said the postillion let us hear of good blood continued belle my name is berners isopel berners though my parents were unfortunate indeed with respect to blood i believe i am of better blood than the young man there you are mistaken said i by my fathers side i am of cornish blood and by my mothers of brave french protestant extraction now with respect to the blood of my fatherand to be descended well on the fathers side is the principal thingit is the best blood in the world for the cornish blood as the proverb says i dont care what the proverb says said belle i say my blood is the bestmy name is berners isopel bernersit was my mothers name and is better i am sure than any you bear whatever that may be and though you say that the descent on the fathers side is the principal thingand i know why you say so she added with some excitementi saythat descent on the mothers side is of most account because the mother just come from gretna green and already quarrelling said the postillion we do not come from gretna green said belle ah i had forgot said the postillion none but great people go to gretna green well then from church and already quarrelling about family just like two great people we have never been to church said belle and to prevent any more guessing on your part it will be as well for me to tell you friend that i am nothing to the young man and he of course nothing to me i am a poor travelling girl born in a workhouse journeying on my occasions with certain companions i came to this hollow where my company quarrelled with the young man who had settled down here as he had a right to do if he pleased and not being able to drive him out they went away after quarrelling with me too for not choosing to side with them so i stayed here along with the young man there being room for us both and the place being as free to me as to him and in order that you may be no longer puzzled with respect to myself said i i will give you a brief outline of my history i am the son of honourable parents who gave me a firstrate education as far as literature and languages went with which education i endeavoured on the death of my father to advance myself to wealth and reputation in the big city but failing in the attempt i conceived a disgust for the busy world and determined to retire from it after wandering about for some time and meeting with various adventures in one of which i contrived to obtain a pony cart and certain tools used by smiths and tinkers i came to this place where i amused myself with making horseshoes or rather ponyshoes having acquired the art of wielding the hammer and tongs from a strange kind of smithnot him of gretna greenwhom i knew in my childhood and here i lived doing harm to no one quite lonely and solitary till one fine morning the premises were visited by this young gentlewoman and her companions she did herself anything but justice when she said that her companions quarrelled with her because she would not side with them against me they quarrelled with her because she came most heroically to my assistance as i was on the point of being murdered and she forgot to tell you that after they had abandoned her she stood by me in the dark hour comforting and cheering me when unspeakable dread to which i am occasionally subject took possession of my mind she says she is nothing to me even as i am nothing to her i am of course nothing to her but she is mistaken in thinking she is nothing to me i entertain the highest regard and admiration for her being convinced that i might search the whole world in vain for a nature more heroic and devoted and for my part said belle with a sob a more quiet agreeable partner in a place like this i would not wish to have it is true he has strange ways and frequently puts words into my mouth very difficult to utter butbut and here she buried her face once more in her hands well said the postillion i have been mistaken about you that is not altogether but in part you are not rich folks it seems but you are not common people and that i could have sworn what i call a shame is that some people i have known are not in your place and you in theirsyou with their estates and borough interest they in this dingle with these carts and animals but there is no help for these things were i the great mumbo jumbo above i would endeavour to manage matters better but being a simple postillion glad to earn three shillings a day i cant be expected to do much who is mumbo jumbo said i ah said the postillion i see there may be a thing or two i know better than yourself mumbo jumbo is a god of the black coast to which people go for ivory and gold were you ever there i demanded no said the postillion but i heard plenty of mumbo jumbo when i was a boy i wish you would tell us something about yourself i believe that your own real history would prove quite as entertaining if not more than that which you imagined about us i am rather tired said the postillion and my leg is rather troublesome i should be glad to try to sleep upon one of your blankets however as you wish to hear something about me i shall be happy to oblige you but your fire is rather low and this place is chilly thereupon i arose and put fresh charcoal on the pan then taking it outside the tent with a kind of fan which i had fashioned i fanned the coals into a red glow and continued doing so until the greater part of the noxious gas which the coals are in the habit of exhaling was exhausted i then brought it into the tent and reseated myself scattering over the coals a small portion of sugar no bad smell said the postillion but upon the whole i think i like the smell of tobacco better and with your permission i will once more light my pipethereupon he relighted his pipe and after taking two or three whiffs began in the following mannerchapter xcviii an exordiumfine shipshigh

priestvirgiliolessons in italiantwo opinionsholy marypriestly confederatesmethodist chapelveturinisome of our partylike a sepulchreall for themselves i am a poor postillion as you see yet as i have seen a thing or two and heard a thing or two of what is going on in the world perhaps what i have to tell you connected with myself may not prove altogether uninteresting now my friends this manner of opening a story is what the man who taught rhetoric would call a hexhex exordium said i just so said the postillion i treated you to a perperperoration some time ago so that i have contrived to put the cart before the horse as the irish orators frequently do in the honourable house in whose speeches especially those who have taken lessons in rhetoric the perperwhats the wordfrequently goes before the exordium i was born in the neighbouring county my father was landsteward to a squire of about a thousand a year my father had two sons of whom i am the youngest by some years my elder brother was of a spirited roving disposition and for fear that he should turn out what is generally termed ungain my father determined to send him to sea so once upon a time when my brother was about fifteen he took him to the great seaport of the county where he apprenticed him to a captain of one of the ships which trade to the high barbary coast fine ships they were i have heard say more than thirty in number and all belonging to a wonderful great gentleman who had once been a parish boy but had contrived to make an immense fortune by trading to that coast for golddust ivory and other strange articles and for doing so i mean for making a fortune had been made a knight baronet so my brother went to the high barbary shore on board the fine vessel and in about a year returned and came to visit us he repeated the voyage several times always coming to see his parents on his return strange stories he used to tell us of what he had been witness to on the high barbary coast both off shore and on he said that the fine vessel in which he sailed was nothing better than a painted hell that the captain was a veritable fiend whose grand delight was in tormenting his men especially when they were sick as they frequently were there being always fever on the high barbary coast and that though the captain was occasionally sick himself his being so made no difference or rather it did make a difference though for the worse he being when sick always more inveterate and malignant than at other times he said that once when he himself was sick his captain had pitched his face all over which exploit was much applauded by the other high barbary captains all of whom from what my brother said appeared to be of much the same disposition as my brothers captain taking wonderful delight in tormenting the crews and doing all manner of terrible things my brother frequently said that nothing whatever prevented him from running away from his ship and never returning but the hope he entertained of one day being captain himself and able to torment people in his turn which he solemnly vowed he would do as a kind of compensation for what he himself had undergone and if things were going on in a strange way off the high barbary shore amongst those who came there to trade they were going on in a way yet stranger with the people who lived upon it oh the strange ways of the black men who lived on that shore of which my brother used to tell us at home selling their sons daughters and servants for slaves and the prisoners taken in battle to the spanish captains to be carried to havannah and when there sold at a profit the idea of which my brother said went to the hearts of our own captains who used to say what a hard thing it was that freeborn englishmen could not have a hand in the traffic seeing that it was forbidden by the laws of their country talking fondly of the good old times when their forefathers used to carry slaves to jamaica and barbadoes realizing immense profit besides the pleasure of hearing their shrieks on the voyage and then the superstitions of the blacks which my brother used to talk of their sharks teeth their wisps of fowls feathers their halfbaked pots full of burnt bones of which they used to make what they called fetish and bow down to and ask favours of and then perhaps abuse and strike provided the senseless rubbish did not give them what they asked for and then above all mumbo jumbo the grand fetish master who lived somewhere in the woods and who used to come out every now and then with his fetish companions a monstrous figure all wound round with leaves and branches so as to be quite indistinguishable and seating himself on the high seat in the villages receive homage from the people and also gifts and offerings the most valuable of which were pretty damsels and then betake himself back again with his followers into the woods oh the tales that my brother used to tell us of the high barbary shore poor fellow what became of him i cant say the last time he came back from a voyage he told us that his captain as soon as he had brought his vessel to port and settled with his owner drowned himself off the quay in a fit of the horrors which it seems high barbary captains after a certain number of years are much subject to after staying about a month with us he went to sea again with another captain and bad as the old one had been it appears the new one was worse for unable to bear his treatment my brother left his ship off the high barbary shore and ran away up the country some of his comrades whom we afterwards saw said that there were various reports about him on the shore one that he had taken on with mumbo jumbo and was serving him in his house in the woods in the capacity of swashbuckler or lifeguardsman another that he was gone in quest of a mighty city in the heart of the negro country another that inswimming a stream he had been devoured by an alligator now these two last reports were bad enough the idea of their flesh and blood being bit asunder by a ravenous fish was sad enough to my poor parents and not very comfortable was the thought of his sweltering over the hot sands in quest of the negro city but the idea of their son their eldest child serving mumbo jumbo as swashbuckler was worst of all and caused my poor parents to shed many a scalding tear i stayed at home with my parents until i was about eighteen assisting my father in various ways i then went to live at the squires partly as groom partly as footman after living in the country some time i attended the family in a trip of six weeks which they made to london whilst there happening to have some words with an old illtempered coachman who had been for a great many years in the family my master advised me to leave offering to recommend me to a family of his acquaintance who were in need of a footman i was glad to accept his offer and in a few days went to my new place my new master was one of the great gentry a baronet in parliament and possessed of an estate of about twenty thousand a year his family consisted of his lady a son a fine young man just coming of age and two very sweet amiable daughters i liked this place much better than my first there was so much more pleasant noise and bustleso much more grand companyand so many more opportunities of improving myself oh how i liked to see the grand coaches drive up to the door with the grand company and though amidst that company there were some who did not look very grand there were others and not a few who did some of the ladies quite captivated me there was the marchioness of in particular this young lady puts me much in mind of her it is true the marchioness as i saw her then was about fifteen years older than this young gentlewoman is now and not so tall by some inches but she had the very same hair and much the same neck and shouldersno offence i hope and then some of the young gentlemen with their cool haughty carefornothing looks struck me as being very fine fellows there was one in particular whom i frequently used to stare at not altogether unlike some one i have seen hereaboutshe had a slight cast in his eye and but i wont enter into every particular and then the footmen oh how those footmen helped to improve me with their conversation many of them could converse much more glibly than their masters and appeared to have much better taste at any rate they seldom approved of what their masters did i remember being once with one in the gallery of the playhouse when something of shakspeares was being performed some one in the first tier of boxes was applauding very loudly thats my fool of a governor said he he is weak enough to like shakspearei donthes so confoundedly low but he wont last longgoing down shakspeare culminatedi think that was the wordculminated some time ago and then the professor of elocution of whom my governors used to take lessons and of which lessons i had my share by listening behind the door but for that professor of elocution i should not be able to round my periodsan expression of hisin the manner i do after i had been three years at this place my mistress died her death however made no great alteration in my way of living the family spending their winters in london and their summers at their old seat in s as before at last the young ladies who had not yet got husbands which was strange enough seeing as i told you before they were very amiable proposed to our governor a travelling expedition abroad the old baronet consented though young master was much against it saying they would all be much better at home as the girls persisted however he at last withdrew his opposition and even promised to follow them as soon as his parliamentary duties would permit for he was just got into parliament and like most other young members thought that nothing could be done in the house without him so the old gentleman and the two young ladies set off taking me with them and a couple of ladies maids to wait upon them first of all we went to paris where we continued three months the old baronet and the ladies going to see the various sights of the city and the neighbourhood and i attending them they soon got tired of sightseeing and of paris too and so did i however they still continued there in order i believe that the young ladies might lay in a store of french finery i should have passed my idle time at paris of which i had plenty after the sightseeing was over very unpleasantly but for black jack eh did you never hear of black jack ah if you had ever been an english servant in paris you would have known black jack not an english gentlemans servant who has been at paris for this last ten years but knows black jack and his ordinary a strange fellow he wasof what country no one could exactly sayfor as for judging from speech that was impossible jack speaking all languages equally ill some said he came direct from satans kitchen and that when he gives up keeping ordinary he will return there again though the generallyreceived opinion at paris was that he was at one time butler to king pharaoh and that after lying asleep for four thousand years in a place called the kattycombs he was awaked by the sound of nelsons cannon at the battle of the nile and going to the shore took on with the admiral and became in course of time ship steward and that after nelsons death he was captured by the french on board one of whose vessels he served in a somewhat similar capacity till the peace when he came to paris and set up an ordinary for servants sticking the name of katcomb over the door in allusion to the place where he had his long sleep but whatever his origin was jack kept his own council and appeared to care nothing for what people said about him or called him yes i forgot there was one name he would not be called and that was portuguese i once saw black jack knock down a coachman six foot high who called him blackfaced portuguese any name but dat you shab said black jack who was a little round fellow of about five feet two i would not stand to be called portuguese by nelson himself jack was rather fond of talking about nelson and hearing people talk about him so that it is not improbable that he may have sailed with him and with respect to his having been king pharaohs butler all i have to say is i am not disposed to give the downright lie to the report jack was always ready to do a kind turn to a poor servant out of place and has often been known to assist such as were in prison which charitable disposition he perhapsacquired from having lost a good place himself having seen the inside of a prison and known the want of a meals victuals all which trials king pharaohs butler underwent so he may have been that butler at any rate i have known positive conclusions come to on no better premises if indeed as good as for the story of his coming direct from satans kitchen i place no confidence in it at all as black jack had nothing of satan about him but blackness on which account he was called black jack nor am i disposed to give credit to a report that his hatred of the portuguese arose from some ill treatment which he had once experienced when on shore at lisbon from certain gentlewomen of the place but rather conclude that it arose from an opinion he entertained that the portuguese never paid their debts one of the ambassadors of that nation whose house he had served having left paris several thousand francs in his debt this is all that i have to say about black jack without whose funny jokes and good ordinary i should have passed my time in paris in a very disconsolate manner after we had been at paris between two and three months we left it in the direction of italy which country the family had a great desire to see after travelling a great many days in a thing which though called a diligence did not exhibit much diligence we came to a great big town seated around a nasty saltwater basin connected by a narrow passage with the sea here we were to embark and so we did as soon as possible glad enough to get away at least i was and so i make no doubt were the rest for such a place for bad smells i never was in it seems all the drains and sewers of the place run into that same salt basin voiding into it all their impurities which not being able to escape into the sea in any considerable quantity owing to the narrowness of the entrance there accumulate filling the whole atmosphere with these same outrageous scents on which account the town is a famous lodginghouse of the plague the ship in which we embarked was bound for a place in italy called naples where we were to stay some time the voyage was rather a lazy one the ship not being moved by steam for at the time of which i am speaking some five years ago steamships were not so plentiful as now there were only two passengers in the grand cabin where my governor and his daughters were an italian lady and a priest of the lady i have not much to say she appeared to be a quiet respectable person enough and after our arrival at naples i neither saw nor heard anything more of her but of the priest i shall have a good deal to say in the sequel that bythebye is a word i learned from the professor of rhetoric and it would have been well for our family had they never met him on the third day of the voyage the priest came to me who was rather unwell with seasickness which he of course felt nothing of that kind of people being never affected like others he was a finishlooking man of about fortyfive but had something strange in his eyes which i have since thought denoted that all was not right in a certain place called the heart after a few words of condolence in a broken kind of english he asked me various questions about our family and i won by his seeming kindness told him all i knew about them of which communicativeness i afterwards very much repented as soon as he had got out of me all he desired he left me and i observed that during the rest of the voyage he was wonderfully attentive to our governor and yet more to the young ladies both however kept him rather at a distance the young ladies were reserved and once or twice i heard our governor cursing him between his teeth for a sharking priest the priest however was not disconcerted and continued his attentions which in a little time produced an effect so that by the time we landed at naples our great folks had conceived a kind of liking for the man and when they took their leave invited him to visit them which he promised to do we hired a grand house or palace at naples it belonged to a poor kind of prince who was glad enough to let it to our governor and also his servants and carriages and glad enough were the poor servants for they got from us what they never got from the princeplenty of meat and moneyand glad enough i make no doubt were the horses for the provender we gave them and i daresay the coaches were not sorry to be cleaned and furbished up well we went out and came in going to see the sights and returning amongst other things we saw was the burning mountain and the tomb of a certain sorcerer called virgilio who made witch rhymes by which he could raise the dead plenty of people came to see us both english and italians and amongst the rest the priest he did not come amongst the first but allowed us to settle and become a little quiet before he showed himself and after a day or two he paid us another visit then another till at last his visits were daily i did not like that jack priest so i kept my eye upon all his motions lord how that jack priest did curry favour with our governor and the two young ladies and he curried and curried till he had got himself into favour with the governor and more especially with the two young ladies of whom their father was doatingly fond at last the ladies took lessons in italian of the priest a language in which he was said to be a grand proficient and of which they had hitherto known but very little and from that time his influence over them and consequently over the old governor increased till the tables were turned and he no longer curried favour with them but they with him yes as true as my leg aches the young ladies curried and the old governor curried favour with that same priest when he was with them they seemed almost to hang on his lips that is the young ladies and as for the old governor he never contradicted him and when the fellow was absent which bythebye was not often it was father soandso said this and father soandso said that father soandso thinks we should do soandso or that we should not do soandso i at first thought that he must have given them something some philtre or the like but one of the english maidservants who had a kind of respect for me and who saw much more behind the scenes than i did informed me that he was continually instilling strange notions into their heads striving by every possible method to make them despise the religion of their own land and take up that of the foreign country in which they were and sure enough in a little time the girls had altogether left off going to an english chapel and were continually visiting places of italian worship the old governor it is true still went to his church but he appeared to be hesitating between two opinions and once when he was at dinner he said to two or three englishfriends that since he had become better acquainted with it he had conceived a much more favourable opinion of the catholic religion than he had previously entertained in a word the priest ruled the house and everything was done according to his will and pleasure by degrees he persuaded the young ladies to drop their english acquaintances whose place he supplied with italians chiefly females my poor old governor would not have had a person to speak to for he never could learn the language but for two or three englishmen who used to come occasionally and take a bottle with him in a summerhouse whose company he could not be persuaded to resign notwithstanding the entreaties of his daughters instigated by the priest whose grand endeavour seemed to be to render the minds of all three foolish for his own ends and if he was busy above stairs with the governor there was another busy below with us poor english servants a kind of subordinate priest a low italian as he could speak no language but his own he was continually jabbering to us in that and by hearing him the maids and myself contrived to pick up a good deal of the language so that we understood most that was said and could speak it very fairly and the themes of his jabber were the beauty and virtues of one whom he called holy mary and the power and grandeur of one whom he called the holy father and he told us that we should shortly have an opportunity of seeing the holy father who could do anything he liked with holy mary in the mean time we had plenty of opportunities of seeing holy mary for in every church chapel and convent to which we were taken there was an image of holy mary who if the images were dressed at all in her fashion must have been very fond of short petticoats and tinsel and who if those said figures at all resembled her in face could scarcely have been half as handsome as either of my two fellowservants not to speak of the young ladies now it happened that one of the female servants was much taken with what she saw and heard and gave herself up entirely to the will of the subordinate who had quite as much dominion over her as his superior had over the ladies the other maid however the one who had a kind of respect for me was not so easily besotted she used to laugh at what she saw and at what the fellow told her and from her i learnt that amongst other things intended by these priestly confederates was robbery she said that the poor old governor had already been persuaded by his daughters to put more than a thousand pounds into the superior priests hands for purposes of charity and religion as was said and that the subordinate one had already inveigled her fellowservant out of every penny which she had saved from her wages and had endeavoured likewise to obtain what money she herself had but in vain with respect to myself the fellow shortly after made an attempt towards obtaining a hundred crowns of which by some means he knew me to be in possession telling me what a meritorious thing it was to give ones superfluities for the purposes of religion that is true said i and if after my return to my native country i find i have anything which i dont want myself i will employ it in helping to build a methodist chapel by the time that the three months were expired for which we had hired the palace of the needy prince the old governor began to talk of returning to england at least of leaving italy i believe he had become frightened at the calls which were continually being made upon him for money for after all you know if there is a sensitive part of a mans wearing apparel it is his breeches pocket but the young ladies could not think of leaving dear italy and the dear priest and then they had seen nothing of the country they had only seen naples before leaving dear italia they must see more of the country and the cities above all they must see a place which they called the eternal city or by some similar nonsensical name and they persisted so that the poor governor permitted them as usual to have their way and it was decided what route they should take that is the priest was kind enough to decide for them and was also kind enough to promise to go with them part of the route as far as a place where there was a wonderful figure of holy mary which the priest said it was highly necessary for them to see before visiting the eternal city so we left naples in hired carriages driven by fellows they call veturini cheating drunken dogs i remember they were besides our own family there was the priest and his subordinate and a couple of hired lackeys we were several days upon the journey travelling through a very wild country which the ladies pretended to be delighted with and which the governor cursed on account of the badness of the roads and when we came to any particularly wild spot we used to stop in order to enjoy the scenery as the ladies said and then we would spread a horsecloth on the ground and eat bread and cheese and drink wine of the country and some of the holes and corner in which we bivouacked as the ladies called it were something like this place where we are now so that when i came down here it put me in mind of them at last we arrived at the place where was the holy image we went to the house or chapel in which the holy image was kept a frightful ugly black figure of holy mary dressed in her usual way and after we had stared at the figure and some of our party had bowed down to it we were shown a great many things which were called holy relics which consisted of thumbnails and forenails and toenails and hair and teeth and a feather or two a mighty thighbone but whether of a man or a camel i cant say all of which things i was told if properly touched and handled had mighty power to cure all kinds of disorders and as we went from the holy house we saw a man in a state of great excitement he was foaming at the mouth and cursing the holy image and all its household because after he had worshipped it and made offerings to it and besought it to assist him in a game of chance which he was about to play it had left him in the lurch allowing him to lose all his money and when i thought of all the rubbish i had seen and the purposes which it was applied to in conjunction with the rage of the losing gamester at the deaf and dumb image i could not help comparing the whole with what my poor brother used to tell me of the superstitious practices of the blacks on the high barbary shore and their occasional rage and fury at the things they worshipped and i said to myself if all this here doesnt smell of fetish may i smell fetid at this place the priest left us returning to naples with his subordinate on some particular business i suppose it washowever agreed that he should visit us at the holy city we did not go direct to the holy city but bent our course to two or three other cities which the family were desirous of seeing but as nothing occurred to us in these places of any particular interest i shall take the liberty of passing them by in silence at length we arrived at the eternal city an immense city it was looking as if it had stood for a long time and would stand for a long time still compared with it london would look like a mere assemblage of beeskeps however give me the beeskeps with their merry hum and bustle and life and honey rather than that huge town which looked like a sepulchre where there was no life no busy hum no bees but a scanty sallow population intermixed with black priests white priests grey priests and though i dont say there was no honey in the place for i believe there was i am ready to take my bible oath that it was not made there and that the priests kept it all for themselves chapter xcix a cloisterhalf englishnew acquaintancemixed liquorsturning papistpurposes of charityforeign religion melancholyelbowing and pushingoutlandish sightthe figurei dont care for youmerry andrewsone goodreligion of my countryfellow of spirita disputethe next morningfemale dollproper dignityfetish country the day after our arrival continued the postillion i was sent under the guidance of a lackey of the place with a letter which the priest when he left had given us for a friend of his in the eternal city we went to a large house and on ringing were admitted by a porter into a cloister where i saw some illlooking shabby young fellows walking about who spoke english to one another to one of these the porter delivered the letter and the young fellow going away presently returned and told me to follow him he led me into a large room where behind a table on which were various papers and a thing which they call in that country a crucifix sat a man in a kind of priestly dress the lad having opened the door for me shut it behind me and went away the man behind the table was so engaged in reading the letter which i had brought that at first he took no notice of me he had red hair a kind of halfenglish countenance and was seemingly about fiveandthirty after a little time he laid the letter down appeared to consider a moment and then opened his mouth with a strange laugh not a loud laugh for i heard nothing but a kind of hissing deep down the throat all of a sudden however perceiving me he gave a slight start but instantly recovering himself he inquired in english concerning the health of the family and where we lived on my delivering him a card he bade me inform my master and the ladies that in the course of the day he would do himself the honour of waiting upon them he then arose and opened the door for me to depart the man was perfectly civil and courteous but i did not like that strange laugh of his after having read the letter he was as good as his word and that same day paid us a visit it was now arranged that we should pass the winter in rome to my great annoyance for i wished to return to my native land being heartily tired of everything connected with italy i was not however without hope that our young master would shortly arrive when i trusted that matters as far as the family were concerned would be put on a better footing in a few days our new acquaintance who it seems was a mongrel englishman had procured a house for our accommodation it was large enough but not near so pleasant as that we had at naples which was light and airy with a large garden this was a dark gloomy structure in a narrow street with a frowning church beside it it was not far from the place where our new friend lived and its being so was probably the reason why he selected it it was furnished partly with articles which we bought and partly with those which we hired we lived something in the same way as at naples but though i did not much like naples i yet liked it better than this place which was so gloomy our new acquaintance made himself as agreeable as he could conducting the ladies to churches and convents and frequently passing the afternoon drinking with the governor who was fond of a glass of brandy and water and a cigar as the new acquaintance also wasno i remember he was fond of gin and water and did not smoke i dont think he had so much influence over the young ladies as the other priest which was perhaps owing to his not being so good looking but i am sure he had more influence with the governor owing doubtless to his bearing him company in drinking mixed liquors which the other priest did not do he was a strange fellow that same new acquaintance of ours and unlike all the priests i saw in that country and i saw plenty of various nationsthey were always upon their guard and had their features and voice modulated but this man was subject to fits of absence during which he would frequently mutter to himself then though he was perfectly civil to everybody as far as words went i observed that he entertained a thorough contempt for most people especially for those whom he was making dupes i have observed him whilst drinking with our governor when the old mans head was turned look at him with an air which seemed to say what a thundering old fool you are and at our young ladies when their backs were turned with a glance which said distinctly enough you precious pair of ninnyhammers and then his laughhe had two kinds of laughsone which you could hear and another which you could only see i have seen him laugh at our governor and the young ladies when their heads were turned away but i heard no sound my mother had a sandy cat which sometimes used to open its mouth wide with a mew which nobody could hear and the silent laugh of that redhaired priest used to put me wonderfully in mind of the silent mew of my mothers sandyred cat and then the other laugh which you could hear what a strange laugh that was never loud yes i have heard it tolerably loud he once passed near me after having taken leave of a silly english fellowa limping parson of the name of platitude who they said was thinking of turning papist and was much in his company i was standing behind the pillar of a piazza and as he passed he was laughing heartily o he was a strange fellow that same redhaired acquaintance of ours after we had been at rome about six weeks our old friend the priest of naples arrived but without his subordinate for whose services he now perhaps thought that he had no occasion i believe he found matters in our family wearing almost as favourable an aspect as he could desire with what he had previously taught them and shown them at naples and elsewhere and with what the redhaired confederate had taught them and shown them at rome the poor young ladies had become quite handmaids of superstition so that they especially the youngest were prepared to bow down to anything and kiss anything however vile and ugly provided a priest commanded them and as for the old governor what with the influence which his daughters exerted and what with the ascendancy which the redhaired man had obtained over him he dared not say his purse far less his soul was his own only think of an englishman not beingmaster of his own purse my acquaintance the ladys maid assured me that to her certain knowledge he had disbursed to the redhaired man for purposes of charity as it was said at least one thousand pounds during the five weeks we had been at rome she also told me that things would shortly be brought to a conclusion and so indeed they were though in a different manner from what she and i and some other people imagined that there was to be a grand festival and a mass at which we were to be present after which the family were to be presented to the holy father for so those two priestly sharks had managed it and thenshe said she was certain that the two ladies and perhaps the old governor would forsake the religion of their native land taking up with that of these foreign regions for so my fellowservant expressed it and that perhaps attempts might be made to induce us poor english servants to take up with the foreign religion that is herself and me for as for our fellowservant the other maid she wanted no inducing being disposed body and soul to go over to it whereupon i swore with an oath that nothing should induce me to take up with the foreign religion and the poor maid my fellowservant bursting into tears said that for her part she would sooner die than have anything to do with it thereupon we shook hands and agreed to stand by and countenance one another and moreover provided our governors were fools enough to go over to the religion of these here foreigners we would not wait to be asked to do the like but leave them at once and make the best of our way home even if we were forced to beg on the road at last the day of the grand festival came and we were all to go to the big church to hear the mass now it happened that for some time past i had been much afflicted with melancholy especially when i got up of a morning produced by the strange manner in which i saw things going on in our family and to dispel it in some degree i had been in the habit of taking a dram before breakfast on the morning in question feeling particularly lowspirited when i thought of the foolish step our governor would probably take before evening i took two drams before breakfast and after breakfast feeling my melancholy still continuing i took another which produced a slight effect upon my head though i am convinced nobody observed it away we drove to the big church it was a dark misty day i remember and very cold so that if anybody had noticed my being slightly in liquor i could have excused myself by saying that i had merely taken a glass to fortify my constitution against the weather and of one thing i am certain which is that such an excuse would have stood me in stead with our governor who looked i thought as if he had taken one too but i may be mistaken and why should i notice him seeing that he took no notice of me so away we drove to the big church to which all the population of the place appeared to be moving on arriving there we dismounted and the two priests who were with us led the family in whilst i followed at a little distance but quickly lost them amidst the throng of people i made my way however though in what direction i knew not except it was one in which everybody seemed striving and by dint of elbowing and pushing i at last got to a place which looked like the aisle of a cathedral where the people stood in two rows a space between being kept open by certain strangelydressed men who moved up and down with rods in their hands all were looking to the upper end of this place or aisle and at the upper end separated from the people by palings like those of an altar sat in magnificentlooking stalls on the right and the left various wonderfullooking individuals in scarlet dresses at the farther end was what appeared to be an altar on the left hand was a pulpit and on the right a stall higher than any of the rest where was a figure whom i could scarcely see i cant pretend to describe what i saw exactly for my head which was at first rather flurried had become more so from the efforts which i had made to get through the crowd also from certain singing which proceeded from i know not where and above all from the bursts of an organ which were occasionally so loud that i thought the roof which was painted with wondrous colours would come toppling down on those below so there stood ia poor english servantin that outlandish place in the midst of that foreign crowd looking at that outlandish sighthearing those outlandish sounds and occasionally glancing at our party which by this time i distinguished at the opposite side to where i stood but much nearer the place where the red figures sat yes there stood our poor governor and the sweet young ladies and i thought they never looked so handsome before and close by them were the sharking priests and not far from them was that idiotical parson platitude winking and grinning and occasionally lifting up his hands as if in ecstasy at what he saw and heard so that he drew upon himself the notice of the congregation and now an individual mounted the pulpit and began to preach in a language which i did not understand but which i believe to be latin addressing himself seemingly to the figure in the stall and when he had ceased there was more singing more organ playing and then two men in robes brought forth two things which they held up and then the people bowed their heads and our poor governor bowed his head and the sweet young ladies bowed their heads and the sharking priests whilst the idiotical parson platitude tried to fling himself down and then there were various evolutions withinside the pale and the scarlet figures got up and sat down and this kind of thing continued for some time at length the figure which i had seen in the principal stall came forth and advanced towards the people an awful figure he was a huge old man with a sugarloaf hat with a sulphurcoloured dress and holding a crook in his hand like that of a shepherd and as he advanced the people fell on their knees our poor old governor amongst them the sweet young ladies the sharking priests the idiotical parson platitude all fell on their knees and somebody or other tried to pull me on my knees but by this time i had become outrageous all that my poor brother used to tell me of the superstitions of thehigh barbary shore rushed into my mind and i thought they were acting them over here above all the idea that the sweet young ladies to say nothing of my poor old governor were after the conclusion of all this mummery going to deliver themselves up body and soul into the power of that horridlooking old man maddened me and rushing forward into the open space i confronted the horriblelooking old figure with the sugarloaf hat the sulphurcoloured garments and shepherds crook and shaking my fist at his nose i bellowed out in english i dont care for you old mumbo jumbo though you have fetish i can scarcely tell you what occurred for some time i have a dim recollection that hands were laid upon me and that i struck out violently left and right on coming to myself i was seated on a stone bench in a large room something like a guardroom in the custody of certain fellows dressed like merry andrews they were bluff goodlooking wholesome fellows very different from the sallow italians they were looking at me attentively and occasionally talking to each other in a language which sounded very like the cracking of walnuts in the mouth very different from cooing italian at last one of them asked me in italian what had ailed me to which i replied in an incoherent manner something about mumbo jumbo whereupon the fellow one of the bluffest of the lot a jovial rosyfaced rascal lifted up his right hand placing it in such a manner that the lips were between the forefinger and thumb then lifting up his right foot and drawing back his head he sucked in his breath with a hissing sound as if to imitate one drinking a hearty draught and then slapped me on the shoulder saying something which sounded like goot wine goot companion whereupon they all laughed exclaiming ya ya goot companion and now hurried into the room our poor old governor with the redhaired priest the first asked what could have induced me to behave in such a manner in such a place to which i replied that i was not going to bow down to mumbo jumbo whatever other people might do whereupon my master said he believed i was mad and the priest said he believed i was drunk to which i answered that i was neither so mad nor drunk but i could distinguish how the wind lay whereupon they left me and in a little time i was told by the blufflooking merry andrews i was at liberty to depart i believe the priest in order to please my governor interceded for me in high quarters but one good resulted from this affair there was no presentation of our family to the holy father for old mumbo was so frightened by my outrageous looks that he was laid up for a week as i was afterwards informed i went home and had scarcely been there half an hour when i was sent for by the governor who again referred to the scene in church said that he could not tolerate such scandalous behaviour and that unless i promised to be more circumspect in future he should be compelled to discharge me i said that if he was scandalized at my behaviour in the church i was more scandalized at all i saw going on in the family which was governed by two rascally priests who not content with plundering him appeared bent on hurrying the souls of us all to destruction and that with respect to discharging me he could do so that moment as i wished to go i believe his own reason told him that i was right for he made no direct answer but after looking on the ground for some time he told me to leave him as he did not tell me to leave the house i went to my room intending to lie down for an hour or two but scarcely was i there when the door opened and in came the redhaired priest he showed himself as he always did perfectly civil asked me how i was took a chair and sat down after a hem or two he entered into a long conversation on the excellence of what he called the catholic religion told me that he hoped i would not set myself against the light and likewise against my interest for that the family were about to embrace the catholic religion and would make it worth my while to follow their example i told him that the family might do what they pleased but that i would never forsake the religion of my country for any consideration whatever that i was nothing but a poor servant but i was not to be bought by base gold i admire your honourable feelings said he you shall have no gold and as i see you are a fellow of spirit and do not like being a servant for which i commend you i can promise you something better i have a good deal of influence in this place and if you will not set your face against the light but embrace the catholic religion i will undertake to make your fortune you remember those fine fellows today who took you into custody they are the guards of his holiness i have no doubt that i have interest enough to procure your enrolment amongst them what said i become swashbuckler to mumbo jumbo up here may iand here i sworeif i do the mere possibility of one of their children being swashbuckler to mumbo jumbo on the high barbary shore has always been a source of heartbreaking to my poor parents what then would they not undergo if they knew for certain that their other child was swashbuckler to mumbo jumbo up here thereupon he asked me even as you did some time ago what i meant by mumbo jumbo and i told him all i had heard about the mumbo jumbo of the high barbary shore telling him that i had no doubt that the old fellow up here was his brother or nearly related to him the man with the red hair listened with the greatest attention to all i said and when i had concluded he got up nodded to me and moved to the door ere he reached the door i saw his shoulders shaking and as he closed it behind him i heard him distinctly laughing to the tune ofhe he he but now matters began to mend that same evening my young master unexpectedly arrived i believe he soon perceived that something extraordinary had been going on in the family he was for some time closeted with the governor with whom i believe he had a dispute for my fellowservant the ladies maid informed me that she heard high words rather late at night the young gentleman sent for me into his room and asked me various questions with respect to what had been going on and my behaviour in the church of which he had heard something i told him all i knew withrespect to the intrigues of the two priests in the family and gave him a circumstantial account of all that had occurred in the church adding that under similar circumstances i was ready to play the same part over again instead of blaming me he commended my behaviour told me i was a fine fellow and said he hoped that if he wanted my assistance i would stand by him this i promised to do before i left him he entreated me to inform him the very next time i saw the priests entering the house the next morning as i was in the courtyard where i had placed myself to watch i saw the two enter and make their way up a private stair to the young ladies apartment they were attended by a man dressed something like a priest who bore a large box i instantly ran to relate what i had seen to my young master i found him shaving i will just finish what i am about said he and then wait upon these gentlemen he finished what he was about with great deliberation then taking a horsewhip and bidding me follow him he proceeded at once to the door of his sisters apartment finding it fastened he burst it open at once with his foot and entered followed by myself there we beheld the two unfortunate young ladies down on their knees before a large female doll dressed up as usual in rags and tinsel the two priests were standing near one on either side with their hands uplifted whilst the fellow who brought the trumpery stood a little way down the private stair the door of which stood open without a moments hesitation my young master rushed forward gave the image a cut or two with his horsewhipthen flying at the priests he gave them a sound flogging kicked them down the private stair and spurned the man box and image after themthen locking the door he gave his sisters a fine sermon in which he represented to them their folly in worshipping a silly wooden graven image which though it had eyes could see not though it had ears could hear not though it had hands could not help itself and though it had feet could not move about unless it were carried oh it was a fine sermon that my young master preached and sorry i am that the father of the fetish old mumbo did not hear it the elder sister looked ashamed but the youngest who was very weak did nothing but wring her hands weep and bewail the injury which had been done to the dear image the young man however without paying much regard to either of them went to his father with whom he had a long conversation which terminated in the old governor giving orders for preparations to be made for the familys leaving rome and returning to england i believe that the old governor was glad of his sons arrival and rejoiced at the idea of getting away from italy where he had been so plundered and imposed upon the priests however made another attempt upon the poor young ladies by the connivance of the female servant who was in their interest they found their way once more into their apartment bringing with them the fetish image whose body they partly stripped exhibiting upon it certain sanguine marks which they had daubed upon it with red paint but which they said were the result of the lashes which it had received from the horsewhip the youngest girl believed all they said and kissed and embraced the dear image but the eldest whose eyes had been opened by her brother to whom she was much attached behaved with proper dignity for going to the door she called the female servant who had a respect for me and in her presence reproached the two deceivers for their various impudent cheats and especially for this their last attempt at imposition adding that if they did not forthwith withdraw and rid her sister and herself of their presence she would send word by her maid to her brother who would presently take effectual means to expel them they took the hint and departed and we saw no more of them at the end of three days we departed from rome but the maid whom the priests had cajoled remained behind and it is probable that the youngest of our ladies would have done the same thing if she could have had her own will for she was continually raving about her image and saying she should wish to live with it in a convent but we watched the poor thing and got her on board ship oh glad was i to leave that fetish country

peace and tranquillity of the family had been marred and i no longer found my place the pleasant one which it had formerly been there was nothing but gloom in the house for the youngest daughter exhibited signs of lunacy and was obliged to be kept under confinement the next season i attended my master his son and eldest daughter to london as i had previously done there i left them for hearing that a young baronet an acquaintance of the family wanted a servant i applied for the place with the consent of my masters both of whom gave me a strong recommendation and being approved of i went to live with him my new master was what is called a sporting character very fond of the turf upon which he was not very fortunate he was frequently very much in want of money and my wages were anything but regularly paid nevertheless i liked him very much for he treated me more like a friend than a domestic continually consulting me as to his affairs at length he was brought nearly to his last shifts by backing the favourite at the derby which favourite turned out a regular brute being found nowhere at the rush whereupon he and i had a solemn consultation over fourteen glasses of brandy and water and as many cigarsi mean between usas to what was to be done he wished to start a coach in which event he was to be driver and i guard he was quite competent to drive a coach being a firstrate whip and i dare say i should have made a firstrate guard but to start a coach requires money and we neither of us believed that anybody would trust us with vehicles and horses so that idea was laid aside we then debated as to whether or not he should go into the church but to go into the churchat any rate to become a dean or bishop which would have been our aimit is necessary for a man to possess some education and my master although he had been at the best school in england that is the most expensive and also at college was almost totally illiterate so we let the church scheme follow that of the coach at last bethinking me that he was tolerably glib at the tongue as most people are who are addicted to the turf also a great master of slang remembering also that he had a crabbed old uncle who had some borough interest i proposed that he should get into the house promising in one fortnight to qualify him to make a figure in it by certain lessons which i would give him he consented and during the next fortnight i did little else than give him lessons in elocution following to a tittle the method of the great professor which i had picked up listening behind the door at the end of that period we paid a visit to his relation an old gouty tory who at first received us very coolly my master however by flattering a predilection of his for billy pitt soon won his affections so much that he promised to bring him into parliament and in less than a month was as good as his word my master partly by his own qualifications and the assistance which he had derived and still occasionally derived from me cut a wonderful figure in the house and was speedily considered one of the most promising speakers he was always a good hand at promisinghe is at present i believe a cabinet minister but as he got up in the world he began to look down on me i believe he was ashamed of the obligation under which he lay to me and at last requiring no further hints as to oratory from a poor servant like me he took an opportunity of quarrelling with me and discharging me however as he had still some grace he recommended me to a gentleman with whom since he had attached himself to politics he had formed an acquaintance the editor of a grand tory review i lost caste terribly amongst the servants for entering the service of a person connected with a profession so mean as literature and it was proposed at the servants club in park lane to eject me from that society the proposition however was not carried into effect and i was permitted to show myself among them though few condescended to take much notice of me my master was one of the best men in the world but also one of the most sensitive on his veracity being impugned by the editor of a newspaper he called him out and shot him through the arm though servants are seldom admirers of their masters i was a great admirer of mine and eager to follow his example the day after the encounter on my veracity being impugned by the servant of lord c in something i said in praise of my master i determined to call him out so i went into another room and wrote a challenge but whom should i send it by several servants to whom i applied refused to be the bearers of it they said i had lost caste and they could not think of going out with me at length the servant of the duke of b consented to take it but he made me to understand that though he went out with me he did so merely because he despised the whiggish principles of lord cs servant and that if i thought he intended to associate with me i should be mistaken politics i must tell you at that time ran as high amongst the servants as the gentlemen the servants however being almost invariably opposed to the politics of their respective masters though both parties agreed in one point the scouting of everything low and literary though i think of the two the liberal or reform party were the most inveterate so he took my challenge which was accepted we went out lord cs servant being seconded by a reformado footman from the palace we fired three times without effect but this affair lost me my place my master on hearing it forthwith discharged me he was as i have said before very sensitive and he said this duel of mine was a parody of his own being however one of the best men in the world on his discharging me he made me a donation of twenty pounds and it was well that he made me this present for without it i should have been penniless having contracted rather expensive habits during the time that i lived with the young baronet i now determined to visit my parents whom i had notseen for years i found them in good health and after staying with them for two months i returned again in the direction of town walking in order to see the country on the second day of my journey not being used to such fatigue i fell ill at a great inn on the north road and there i continued for some weeks till i recovered but by that time my money was entirely spent by living at the inn i had contracted an acquaintance with the master and the people and become accustomed to inn life as i thought that i might find some difficulty in procuring any desirable situation in london owing to my late connection with literature i determined to remain where i was provided my services would be accepted i offered them to the master who finding i knew something of horses engaged me as a postillion i have remained there since you have now heard my story stay you shant say that i told my tale without a perperoration what shall it be oh i remember something which will serve for one as i was driving my chaise some weeks ago i saw standing at the gate of an avenue which led up to an old mansion a figure which i thought i recognised i looked at it attentively and the figure as i passed looked at me whether it remembered me i do not know but i recognised the face it showed me full well if it was not the identical face of the redhaired priest
