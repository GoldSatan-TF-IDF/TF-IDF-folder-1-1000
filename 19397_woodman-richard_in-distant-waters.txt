in distant waters richard woodman for my brother oliver part one low water it is very difficult for history to get at the real facts luckily they are more often objects of curiosity than truly important there are so many facts napoleon the deserter although he had been waiting for it the knock at his cabin door made him start an unnaturally expectant silence had fallen upon the ship following the noisy tumult of reaction to the pipes and calls for all hands beyond the cabin windows the spring ebbtide and the westerly gale churned the yeasty water of the great nore and tore its surface into long streaks of dirty spume patrician snubbed her cable in the tideway her fabric creaking and groaning to the interplay of the elements somehow these noises the working of the rudder stock in its trunking below him the rattle of the window sashes the whine of the wind seeking gaps in the closed gunports and the thrum of it aloft acting upon the great sounding box of the stilled hull exploited the strange silence of her company and permeated the very air he breathed with a sinister foreboding beyond the vibrating windows the shapes of the ships in company faded and reappeared in his field of view as squalls swept dismal curtains of rain across the anchorage at least the weather prevented a close mustering of the squadrons boats about patrician she could do her dirty work in a measure of privacy the knock simultaneously nervous and stridently impatient came again captain drinkwater stood and picked up the paper at which he had been staring he felt the hilt of his sword tap his hip as he reached with his other hand for the cockaded hat his chair scraped on the decking with a jarring squeal come in midshipman frey appeared in the opened doorway he too was in full dress the white collar patches bright on the dark blue cloth of a new uniform to fit his suddenly grown frame above the collar his face was pale with apprehension first lieutenants compliments sir and the ships companys mustered to witness punishment frey choked on the last word registering its inadequacy drinkwater sighed he could delay the matter no longer very well mr frey thank you the boy bobbed out and drinkwater followed ducking under the deck beams out on the gun deck he raised two fingers to the forecock of his firmly seated hat as the marine sentry saluted and emerged a few seconds later onto the quarterdeck the wind tore at him from a lowering sky that seemed scarcely a fathom above the mastheads in his right hand the piece of paper suddenly fluttered drawing attention to itself ships company mustered to witness punishment sir lieutenant fraser his scots burr muted by the solemnity of the occasion made his formal report as first lieutenant looking round the deck drinkwater sensed the awe with which this moment was touched it was one thing to kill a man in the equal heat of battle but quite another to cut short his life with this cold and ruthless act that ended the judicial process like fraser drinkwater sought refuge in the euphemistic naval formulae under which personal feelings could be hidden and hated himself for his cowardice he met frasers eyes very well he walked forward to stand beside the binnacle and looked steadily around the ship she was much larger than his last command but the same faces stared back at him an old company that was growing tired of war augmented by a draft from the nore guardship to bring his crew up to complement well almost they spilled across the upper deck perched up on the larboard hammock nettings and across the launch and longboat hoisted on the booms to accommodate them only the starboard gangway was uncluttered occupied by a detail of a dozen men the ships most persistent petty offenders against cleanliness and propriety they stood with downcast eyes in contemplation of their melancholy duty for the rope they held ran up to the starboard foreyardarm and back on deck to terminate in a noose beyond the people massed amidships drinkwater could see the anxious face of midshipman wickham supervising the men closed up round the heavy carronade on the focsle he stared alertly aft awaiting the signal behind drinkwater dominating the men in the waist with their muskets and fixed bayonets the scarlet ranks of the patricians forty marines stood rigid bright against the monotone of the morning in front of them still wearing the bandages of his recent wound and with his hanger drawn lieutenant mount stood at his post his gorget was the only glint of brilliance on the quarterdeck alongside mount tense with expectancy his drum acock and twin sticks held down the seams of his breeches was the diminutive figure of the marine drummer close about the captain in a ragged semicircle were the commissioned and warrant officers wearing their swords and the fulldress uniform prescribed for their ranks above them all the white ensign snapped out jerking the slender larch staff as the gale moaned through the recently tautened rigging bring up the prisoner a ripple of expectancy ran through the assembly amidships led by the new and lugubrious figure of the chaplain and escorted by sergeant blixoe of the marines the wretched man was brought on deck as he emerged midshipman frey hoisted the yellow flag to the masthead drinkwater nodded and wickham fired the focsle carronade the short shocking bark of the pounder thudded out a brief acrid stench of powdersmoke whipped aft and drinkwater saw the prisoner blench at the guns report despite the liberal dose of rum he had been given the poor fellow was shaking though his tied hands drew back his shoulders and conferred upon him a spurious dignity clearing his throat drinkwater raised the crackling paper and began to read to nathaniel drinkwater esquire captain in the royal navy commanding his britannic majestys frigate patrician at the great nore whereas thomas stanham able seaman late of his majestys ship antigone hath been examined by a courtmartial on charges of desertion stanham had drawn himself up perhaps in his extremity feeling some cold comfort from the tacit sympathies of his old messmates around him drinkwater knew enough of the mans history not to feel grave misgivings as to the natural justice of the present proceedings together with a profound sense of regret that stanham had been tried and sentenced with no one to plead for him his crime was that of having deserted drinkwaters last command hms antigone just prior to her departure to the baltic in the spring a topman of no more than twentyone or twentytwo years of age stanham had been driven to this desperate course of action by lack of shoreleave and a wellmeant letter from a neighbour living near his home in norwich according to this informant stanhams wife had been carryingon in her husbands prolonged absence in company with another norfolk man stanham had deserted slipping ashore from a bumboat when a marine sentry was distracted had he shortly thereafter returned to his duty drinkwater would have taken a lenient view of the matter and treated stanham as a mere straggler such things were best dealt with within the ship and the catonine tails was a swift justiciar and powerful deterrent but the enforced and hurried transfer of his entire company from the shattered antigone to the patrician had necessitated the submission of all her books to the admiralty and the navy office drinkwater was sick at heart at the circumstances that had conspired to set stanham before his shipmates in these last few moments of his life antigone had returned from the baltic with the most momentous secret of the entire war in order to preserve the source of this news no one connected with the ship was allowed leave a proscription that included drinkwater himself but the antigone had suffered mortal damage to her hull when the dutch cruiser zaandam had exploded alongside her as a result she had been condemned and her remaining company transferred to the razee patrician just then commissioning as a heavy frigate at sheerness the tedious and often protracted business of closing a ships books had been specially expedited on the express instructions of john barrow the allpowerful second secretary of the admiralty behind this obfuscation drinkwater knew loomed the figures of george canning the foreign secretary and lord castlereagh the secretary for war even lord dungarth the director of the admiraltys secret department had apparently condoned barrows severity and expedition it only added to drinkwaters present mortification to consider his own personal interest in this cloak of secrecy see baltic mission but there were other agencies at work conniving against the unfortunate stanham even as the admiralty clerks examined antigones books and discovered the rubric r against the name of thomas stanham a letter arrived at whitehall appraising their lordships that acting upon information laid before them the norwich magistrates had apprehended thomas stanham a deserter from his majestys service there was not the slightest doubt to contest the information affidavits had been sworn accordingly by reliable persons and to compound the matter the said stanham had caused an affray in resisting arrest in which he had maliciously caused one of the constables to be gravely wounded the magistrates desired to know their lordships pleasure drinkwater knew the scuttlebutt well enough stanham had been betrayed by the man who had made him a cuckold he read on pitching his voice against the gale whereas it has been enacted under the several laws relating to the seaservice quite apart from the necessity to get the former antigones to sea the admiralty were increasingly worried about desertions from the ships of the royal navy the long war with the french empire was dragging on russia was no longer an ally the prussian military machine perfected by frederick the great had been smashed in a single day by napoleon at jena and davout at auerstadt while austrian defiance seemed likely to be the next object of napoleons indefatigable attention it suited their lordships to visit the utmost extremity of the articles of war upon the wronged stanham and no plea in mitigation had been allowed every person in or belonging to the fleet who shall desert or entice others to desert shall suffer death drinkwater paused to look up again that phrase in or belonging to the fleet bound stanham like an iron shackle it ran contrary to the common canting notions of liberty so cherished by rubicund englishmen up and down the shires his eyes met those of the prisoner stanham stopped shaking at that terrible final word and his gaze held something else something unnerving drinkwater hurried on and the court hath adjudged the said thomas stanham to suffer death by being hanged by the neck at the yardarm you are hereby required and directed to see the said sentence of death carried into execution upon the body of the said thomas stanham there followed the languid flourish of the presiding admirals signature drinkwater lowered the paper and crushed it in his fist do you wish to say anything stanham again their eyes met the gulf between them immense stanham nodded and coughed to clear his throat good luck to me shipmates sir and god save the king the sudden upward modulation of stanhams homely norfolk voice struck drinkwater as having been the accent of the late lamented lord nelson he nodded at stanham as a low rumbling came from the hands silence there frasers voice cut nervously through the wind masteratarms do your duty behind drinkwater there was a snicker of accoutrements at a low order from mount the marines muskets came to the port forty thumbs resting upon forty firelock hammers the drummer hitched his snaredrum brought his sticks up to the chin and then down to beat the long roll as the masteratarms led stanham to the starboard gangway with a lugubrious expression that drinkwater found revolting the chaplain brought up the rear the shamefaced hanging party moved aside to let the grim procession pass a short ladder had been set against the rail and the hammock nettings removed just abaft the forechains stanham was halted at the foot of the ladder and the chaplain moved closer while the masteratarms drew the noose down over stanhams head and settled the knot beneath his left ear drinkwater watched the chaplain bend forward his lips moving above the open prayerbook a thin strand of hair streaming out from his almost bald head even at a distance drinkwater felt the inappropriateness of another stilted formula being deployed he saw stanham shake his head vigorously the chaplain stepped back and nodded an expression of exasperation on his gaunt face drinkwater found his revulsion increase at this untimely meanness a dark cotton bag was pulled down over the prisoners head stanhams face was extinguished like a candle and a gasp ran through the ship there was a muffled thump as a small midshipman fainted no one moved to his assistance it was mr belchamberss third day in the royal navy stanham was guided up onto the rail beyond the lonely figure drinkwater could see the rigging of the neighbouring ships dark with their men piped to witness the example of their lordships remorseless justice being carried out on board patrician drinkwater nodded his head and wickham saw the signal the report of the carronade rolled across the water the brief white puff of smoke alerting the other ships of the solemnity of the moment again the sharp stench of powdersmoke stung their nostrils and drinkwater caught a glimpse of the flaming wadding as it disintegrated in the wind beside him the marine drummer stopped his ruffle prisoner made ready sir with the gale blowing aft the masteratarmss voice carried with unnatural loudness he had done his duty it extended thus far to launch stanham into eternity waited for drinkwaters own command mr comley drinkwaters voice rasped with a sudden unbidden harshness sir the boatswain stood with his rattan beside the hanging party drinkwater could no longer take refuge in formulae his honest nature revolted against it to instruct comleys party to carry out the sentence would have smacked of cowardice to his puritan soul the awful implications of power were for his shoulders alone it was to him that the death warrant had been addressed in this was some small atonement for his own part in this grisly necessity hang the prisoner the hanging party moved as though spurred by the vehemence in drinkwaters voice there was no time for thought no cause for apprehension to the watching mount ready to coerce the party with his muskets comleys men leaned to stanhams sudden weight as his body rose jerking to the starboard foreyardarm amidships another man fainted as all watched in terrible fascination stanham kicked with his legs tightening the noose with every desperate movement in his muscles arching his back as he fought vainly for air he was a strong man with a powerful neck that resisted the snapping of the spinal cord and the separation of the vertebrae that would bring a quick merciful end drinkwater found himself willing the man to stop to submit to the admiraltys omnipotent will and die quietly as an example to others but stanham was not going to oblige the dark tangle of his bloodchoked brain was roaring with the anger of betrayal of treachery and injustice the dark shape of his body set against the rolling scud seemed possessed of a protest from beyond the grave drinkwater cursed the norwich informer cursed john barrow and his lack of compassion and cursed himself for bringing back such a secret from russia that men still died for it gradually asphyxia subdued the spasms stanham had given up the ghost it seemed that a collective sigh audible above the wind and the responding hiss of the sea came from the patricians assembled company eight bells sir make it so and pipe the hands to dinner the yellow flag fluttered down from the masthead as the four double rings of the bell tolled the hour of noon pipes twittered amidships and the men began to move below faintly similar noises could be heard from other ships the rumble of voices grew as the men glanced upwards in passing forward another good man bin stabbed by the bridport dagger en no goodll come of it tis bad luck the mutter was drowned by the crash of the marines boots as mount dismissed his guard and reposted his sentries frey was bending over the swooning midshipman mr belchambers was not yet thirteen years of age and his name was sonorously inappropriate for so small and insubstantial a figure it was odd drinkwater thought that men like stanham had to be hanged while there seemed no lack of foolish boys to come and play at being men we shall get under weigh the instant the wind eases mr fraser drinkwater growled as he turned below i received my orders by the same despatchboat as brought this he held up the crumpled piece of paper very well sir and him sir frasers eyes jerked aloft leave him for an hour but no more mr fraser no more i pray you above their heads stanhams body turned slowly in the wind dark stains spread across his clothing and it was subject to the most humiliating ignominy of all his cuckolded member was engorged with his stilled blood chapter one cape horn december drinkwater lay soaked in sweat aware that it was neither the jerking of his cot nor the violent motion of patrician that had woken him but something fading beyond his recall the substance of his nightmare wiping his forehead and at the same time shivering in the predawn chill he lay back and tugged the shed blankets back over his aching body the quinsy that had presaged his fever was worse this morning but the terrors of the nightmare far exceeded the disturbances of illness he stared into the darkness trying to remember what had so upset him driven by some instinct to revive the images of the nightmare and then with the unpredictability of imagination they flooded back it was an old dream a haunting from bad times when as a frightened midshipman he had learned the real meaning of fear and loneliness the figure of the white lady had loomed over him as he sunk helplessly beneath her her power to overwhelm him sharpened by the crescendo of clanking chains that always accompanied her manifestation as he recollected the dream he strove to hear the reassuring grind of patricians own pumps but he could hear nothing beyond the thrum of wind in the rigging transmitted down to the timbers of her labouring hull the big frigate creaked and groaned in response to the mighty forces acting upon her as she fought her way to windward of cape horn then drinkwater recognised the face the white lady had had many forms in her various visitations though he thought of her as female she possessed the transsexual ability of phantoms to appear in any guise this morning she had worn a most horrible mask that of the hanged man stanham drinkwater recognised it at once for after the dead man had been cut down he and lallo the surgeon had inspected the cadaver it had been no mere idly morbid curiosity that had spurred him to do so that day at the nore ten weeks earlier he had felt himself driven to see what he had done as if to do so might avert some haunting of the ship by the mans spirit drinkwater had seen again in his nightmare the savage furrow the noose had cut in stanhams neck the face above was darkly cyanotic with wild protuberant eyes in the flesh stanhams body had been pale below the furrowed neck gradually darkening with blotchy suggillations where the blood had settled into its dependent parts this morning beneath the horrors of the face stanhams ghost had worn the white veils which marked his apparition as a disguise of the white lady full recollection brought drinkwater out of himself unpleasant though the memory was he was no stranger to death or the bluedevils that misanthropic preoccupation of naval officers forced to the lonely exile of distant commands with an oath he swung his legs over the edge of the swaying cot and deftly hoisted himself to his feet as patrician hesitated on a wave crest before driving down into a huge trough he half ran half skidded across the cabin fetching up against the forward bulkhead as the ship smashed her bluffbows into the advancing wall of the next sea and reared her bowsprit skywards drinkwater swore again barking his shins on the leg of an overturned chair and bellowed through the thin bulkhead at the marine sentry pass word for my coxswain as he rubbed his bruised knee and swallowed with difficulty he finally remembered the true disturbance of the nightmare it was not its recurrence nor the ghastly transmogrification of poor stanham but the fact that the dream was always presentient he fought his way aft across the dark cabin and slumped in a chair until tregembo arrived with a light and hot water and he could shave passing the moments in reaction to the knowledge that came with this realisation god knew that a great deal could go wrong in this forsaken corner of the world where there seemed no possible justification for sending him even given the anxieties of the most pusillanimous jackinoffice in the extremity of his sickness and depression he felt acutely the apparent abandonment of the only man in power with whom he felt he had both earned and enjoyed an intimacy lord dungarth once first lieutenant of midshipman drinkwaters original ship had treated him with uncharacteristic coolness since he had brought the momentous news of the secret accord between tsar alexander and napoleon out of russia it was not the only service drinkwater had rendered his lordships secret department and dungarths inexplicable change of attitude had greatly pained him combined as it was with the proscription against shoreleave and the enforced estrangement from his wife and family but these were selfpitying considerations as the patrician fought her way from the atlantic to the pacific ocean he had gloomier thoughts pressing him presentiments of disaster were to be expected and as he shuddered from his ague he felt inadequate to the task the admiralty had set him not for its complexity but for its apparent simplicity it seemed in essence to be a mere exercise upon which almost any interpretation might be put by persons anxious to discredit him so hazy were his orders so vague in their intent that he was at a loss as to how to pursue them to carry his majestys flag upon the pacific coast of north america on a particular service was all very high faluting to make war upon spanish trade upon the said coast was all very encouraging if one took as ones example the exploits of anson fifty years earlier but this was the modern world and he was not allowed a free hand being ordered to concentrate his efforts upon the north american coast far from the rich spanish trade routed to the viceroyalties of peru and the entrepot of panama besides to any british commander the pacific was haunted by the ghosts of a murdered cook and the piratically seized bounty as for what he took to be the core of his orders the instruction to discourage russian incursions into that sea and upon the coasts of new albion they seemed to drinkwater to be the most nonsensical of them all harking back to the dubious claims of francis drake and serving to remind him that his russian connections had landed him in this desperate plight thousands of miles from home or support mulling such thoughts as he fought his quinsy and waited for tregembo shaking with the mild fever of an infection he was in a foul and savage mood his coxwains unannounced appearance stung him to an uncharacteristic rebuke knock before you enter damn you sourly he watched tregembo fuss over the hot water and the glim whose light was transferred to a lantern and the lashed candelabra illuminating the cabin with a cheerlessness that revealed the tumbled state of its contents youll catch your death zur sitting like that dont fuss tregembo replied drinkwater mellowing and seeing in the seams and scars of the old mans highlit face the harrowing of age and service he opened his mouth to apologise but tregembo forestalled him the fevers no better zur if im a judge o temper drinkwater stood with the sweat dry on him and drew his nightshirt over his head he grunted and took the soap from tregembos outstretched hand ill get mr lallo to make up some jamess powders zur youll do no such damned thing tregembo dovers powders then zur they be a powerful sudorific damn james and dover fresh air will cure me fresh air and hot coffee be off and find me some hot coffee instead of standing over me like a poxed nursemaid there be fresh air aplenty this morning zur muttered tregembo as he left the cabin and the remark brought the ghost of a smile to drinkwaters haggard face even as it reminded him of his greatest problem his crew over four years earlier in the spring of and the brief period of peace he had taken command of the sloop melusine she had been manned by picked volunteers men who chose to stay at sea in the royal navy rather than chance their luck in the uncertain world ashore many of them had been aboard ship for long before that the resumption of war had carried them to the arctic aboard melusine and to the atlantic and baltic in the frigate antigone into which ship they had been turned over when drinkwater reached postrank now the process of transfer had been repeated and that core of volunteers still lingered at the heart of patricians company but men volunteer for perceived goals and these resented being taken advantage of even more than the pressed men the latter were made up of the victims of the impress service the quotamen and the lord mayors men the dregs of debtors prisons and the hedgesleeping vagrants that armed parties of officers and seamen had discovered in sweeps made along the agueplagued coast of essex whence drinkwater had sent his boats in successive waves these men had made up the deficiencies in number that death and an increase in tonnage had made necessary to man the enlarged complements of drinkwaters successive ships what to those eager volunteers had been thought of as a single commission an arctic voyage with a bounty at its conclusion had not yet ended the people were divided the onetime volunteers forming a slowly contracting minority apt to regard itself as an elite and suffering from the poor conditions of a royal navy on a wartime footing earlier that year in the baltic their mood had become ugly lieutenant quilhampton had suppressed an incipient mutiny by the force of his personality alone but the news of it had made all the officers wary heightening the tensions in the ship and drawing again those sharp social distinctions that blurred easily in a happy ship inconsequential things assumed new importance the rivalry between seamen and marines coalesced into something less friendly more suspicious and the twinkle of the marines bayonets lost its ceremonial glitter fencing the vulnerable minority of the officers from the murmurs of the berthdeck for his own part drinkwater had that summer been driven to supplementing the mens pay by a bounty of his own a circumstance which had imperilled his domestic finances leaving his wife and dependants at a disadvantage and a prey to the fiscal inroads of inflation and income tax drinkwater scraped his face nicking his cheek as patrician staggered into another heavy sea he swore rinsed his razor and bent unsteadily to his task the face that stared back at him was drawn with anxiety the receding hair exposed his high forehead and the streaks of grey at his temples were prominent even in the halflight of the candlelit cabin he still wore a queue an unfashionable defiance behind for what nature deprived him of in front but though his eyes were tired and their lids dotted with powder burns like random inkspots though the scar that puckered down one side of his face joined the distortion of his features necessary to the task of shaving and though he was gaunt from the effects of ague and quinsy there was about the line of the mouth a determination that marked him for one of the most experienced frigate commanders in the royal navy ungraced by much political interest only his longstanding friendship with lord dungarth could be said to have aided his career but even that had not been without effort on his own part dungarth had ensured that all drinkwaters skills had been fully exploited by his secret department that great coup from beneath the raft at tilsit when the two emperors conversation had been overheard verbatim had repaid any debt of advancement his lordship might conceive to be owing drinkwater wiped his chin and called for tregembo indicating he had finished with bowl and razor he tied his stock and drew on soft leather hessian boots winding a muffler around his neck he put on his undress uniform coat and a heavy boatcloak tregembo fussed about the cabin moving quietly in respect of the captains ominous silence picking up his hat drinkwater jammed it on his head and went on deck in the high southern latitude dawn was early the eastern horizon was suffused with a light still too weak to penetrate the cloud rolling to leeward from the west on the starboard bow an inky darkness blurred the meeting of sea and sky and the perceptible horizon was reduced to the crest of the great waves that loomed out of the gloom and roared down upon them driven by the interminable winds of the southern ocean as patrician dipped her reefed jibboom one such wall of water rose on her bow its vast face gaining in brightness as it approached the vertical and reflected the growing light from the east patrician rolled away from it her topsails hard reefed though they were suddenly flapping from want of wind and a hush falling eerily upon her decks her hull seemed suddenly inert as the advancing sea sped towards them its slope streaked with spindrift debris of a million million successive disintegrations of its toppling crest hold on there drinkwater grabbed the nearest hammock stanchion and braced himself as lieutenant quilhampton called the warning to his watch it seemed as if they all held their breath and then the frigate began to lift her bow as the trough that preceded the wave passed beneath her and she felt the breasting rise of that mountainous wave from a sluggish tremor the angle rapidly increased and then she canted and the bow reared skywards aft the waterlevel rose almost to the rail so that the sea squirted in round the gunports and from below came the crash and curse of men and loose gear tumbling about drinkwater prayed that the doublelashed breechings of the guns had not worked slack during the night and the dual crash that ended this strange hiatus momentarily persuaded him that he was mistaken but instinct made him look upwards to where the wind had reached the topsails the maintopsail was already in shreds pulling at its bolt ropes like wool caught on a fence and the foretopsail was bending its yard like a bow an explosion of white reared up all along the starboard rail as they reached the breaking crest and it flung all its fury at the ship she rolled to leeward and lay down under the violent onslaught of the wind the air a moment earlier almost motionless before the advancing mass of water was now suddenly filled with the terrible noise of the gale solid with the particles of water it had ripped from the surface of the ocean and drove downwind with the velocity of buckshot but the leeward roll saved patricians deck from the worst of the breaking sea though there was not a man upon it who was not instantly soaked to the skin the ship toppled as the wave passed beyond her tippingcentre and she plunged downwards into the welter of lesser waves that scarred the back of the great sea foretopmasts sprung above the lower cap mr q up helm get the ship before the wind and well take that topsl off her aye aye sir quilhampton dashed the water from his face with his one good hand and swung round staggering as patrician lurched but the huge sea had been the culmination of many an oceanbred monster in whose trail for a while at least midgets would follow up helm there the ships bow paid off to the southward and then to the east of south drinkwater anxiously stared aloft trying to gauge the extent of the damage in the growing daylight and irritated at losing distance to windward he had brought the frigate well south of cape horn in a great tack to the south and west in order to double the tip of america as speedily as possible in an area where days of low scud made obtaining meridian altitudes difficult and only a fool would feel confident of his latitude stand by to take in the foretopsail quilhampton was bawling at his watch their response was slow they seemed dazed as if the great wave had some strange effect on them but that was impossible a figment of drinkwaters fevered imagination he held his peace for a moment longer man the clewlines and buntlines the men were mustered about the pinrails and drinkwater was reminded of something he had tried hard to forget the dilatory action they had fought with a danish privateer caught off duncansby head and which had escaped by superior sailing through the rocks off the orkneys by superior sailing how that phrase haunted him that sudden failure in performance that had endangered the ship now as it had done before his patience snapped call all hands damn it all hands dyou hear there the squealing pipes made little impact on the gale but the thin noise roused the ship as quilhampton continued to shout at his men clewlines and buntlines haul taut drinkwater caught sight of the rise and fall of starters of a scuffle forward of the boats and a man thrust out of the huddle round the mast leggo top bowline there lively there leggo halliards clew down clew down god damn you clew down i think we have trouble forrard mr q aye sir no there goes the yard lay aloft and furl aloft and furl men from the watches below were coming on deck and filling the waist with a worse confusion as another crack from aloft met the violence of a heavy leeward roll above the shouting and the orders the wind screamed with renewed venom and the heeling deck bucked and canted beneath their slithering feet green water poured aboard and sluiced aft streaming over the men at the pinrails and knocking several off their feet aloft and furl mr comley damn you forrard sir and hustle the men perhaps it was the disgruntled look which the boatswain comley threw at quilhampton perhaps the passing of an aguefit which stimulated drinkwater to intervene but he could stand chaos no better than inefficiency and such chaos and inefficiency threatened them all in that wild sea he began to move forward along the starboard gangway towards the forechains what he found forward of the boats appalled him the sharp perceptions of a feverish brain the madness of the morning and the lingering suspicions and doubts about his crew coalesced into an instant comprehension the few men who had begun to climb into the weather shrouds were halfhearted in their efforts and though no one actively prevented them there were shouted discouragements thick in the howling air dont risk yer life for the bastards jimmy let the fucking mast go by the board well be home the sooner oill fockin kill you if you so much as lay that rope on me again so i will a man rolled against drinkwater one of the boatswains mates his face pale in the cruel horizontal light of dawn his eye already dark with bruising aloft and furl damn you all drinkwater roared and hoisted himself up into the starboard foremast shrouds he caught sight of the small white face of midshipman belchambers take my hat and cloak the wind tore the heavy cloak from his grasp and thrust it at the boy who escaped thankfully aft gods bones dyou want to rot in hell you damned lubbers aloft and furl he was aware of sullen faces the spray stinging them as they looked up at him the wind tore at his own body and already the cold had found his hands there was no time to delay above them the foretopsail flogged and the mast shook and groaned while something was working loose its destructive oscillations increasing with every roll of the ship he began to climb the force of the wind tore at him patrician was running before it now throwing away the hardwon windward yards rolling with an unrestrained ferocity that threatened to tear loose the sprung topmast and send the resulting wrack down on deck for the preservation of the ship speed was essential he did not look down but the vibration of the thick hemp shrouds told him that men were following him aloft he fought his way upwards the thin ratlines twisting beneath his feet and the wind tearing at the bulk of his body so that his clothing bellied and pulled him forward to where the sea hissed and roared alongside the running frigate some active topman drew alongside him thats it my lad up you go up you go he caught a glimpse of a sheepish grin that was instantly lost as more men caught him up swinging outwards into the futtock shrouds with the agility of monkeys captains aloft were such a rare event that even the most discontented topman would be put on his mettle to outdo the intrusion midshipman frey struggled up good morning mr frey freys eyes widened and drinkwater nodded upwards have the goodness to pass ahead of me the boy gulped and swung himself outboard his back hanging downwards as patricians hull rolled them out over the sea then his kicking heels disappeared and drinkwater took advantage of the return roll and followed him into the top pausing for breath drinkwater took stock of the situation the foretopsail yard loosed by its halliards lay roughly over the top of the foreyard the huge flapping bunt of sail thundered in wild billows only partially restrained by the weight of the yard and the buntlines and clewlines drinkwater waved the topmen aloft and out along the yard he could see frey already at the extremity of the windward yardarm his peajacket blown over his back and his sparse shirttail flapping madly come on lads lay out and furl that topsl he clung to the topgallantmast heelrope downhaul and looked aloft the foretopgallantmast had been struck sent down and lashed parallel to its corresponding topmast to reduce the windage of unneeded tophamper now as he stared upwards his eyes watering and the wind tugging at him he saw that the housed topgallantmast was acting like a splint to the fractured mast the latter had sprung badly the split starting from a shake in the timber drinkwater cursed and wondered how long that spar had been pickling in the mastpond at chatham the topmast was almost split in two whatever he decided to do it would have to be quick before both spars were lost he peered on deck morning had broken now though the sun had risen into a cloud bank and daylight was dimmed its arrival somehow surprised him such had been his preoccupation quilhampton looked upwards anxiously clearly considering that drinkwaters action in going aloft was unseemly beside him fraser stood staring up one hand clapped over his tricorne hat the men were laying in from the yard having passed the reefpoints and drinkwater called to them to begin to clear the gear away ready to send the topmast down on deck it would be a long complex and difficult job in the sea that was running but he sensed in their changed expressions that the surly disinterest had been replaced by a sudden realisation of the danger they were in besides he had no intention of making life too easy for them those lost miles to leeward nagged him as he made his way down on deck after the clamour of the foretop the quarterdeck seemed a sanctuary fraser began to remonstrate sir you shouldnt ha be damned to you fraser the men are disaffected in your absence it was necessary i set em an example now have the kindness to order the spanker and foretopmast staysl set just the clew of the spanker mind you i want this ship on the wind and then well sort out the mess of the foremast fraser nodded his understanding and drinkwater regretted the jibe at the first lieutenant it was mean but he was in a damnably mean mood and meant to ride down this discontent even if it first meant riding his officers well set a goosewinged maintopsl when weve finished and see if we cant claw back some of the leeway weve made hill the elderly sailing master summoned on deck at the cry for all hands nodded his agreement and put the traverse board back by the binnacle its a damn deck deck there the scream was highpitched and uttered with such urgency that it carried above the gale the officers looked up at midshipman frey he was leaning against the barricade of the foretop pointing ahead sir theres a ship sir a ship right ahead impossible that first reaction was gone in an instant as he scrambled into the mizen rigging drinkwaters active mind considered the odds of another ship being under their feet in this remote spot and then he saw her an irregular spiky outline flung up against the eastern sky as she breasted a crest his practised eye saw her hull and her straining sails and then she was gone separated from them by a wave she was perhaps three quarters of a mile away when she reappeared she was fine to starboard under closereefed topsails and beating to windward as patrician had been doing an hour earlier a curious idleness had filled the hands as they waited for the officers to get over their astonishment drinkwater rounded on the latter gentlemen you have your orders kindly attend to them they scattered like chastened schoolboys only hill his white hair streaming in the wind stood close to drinkwater trying to catch the stranger in the watchglass fishing in his pocket drinkwater pulled out his dollond glass and raised it to his eye swearing with the difficulty of focusing it on the other ship shes a ship of force sir hill muttered beside him drinkwater grunted agreement her dark hull seemed pierced by two rows of gunports and like themselves she wore no colours she beat to windward bravely passing his own lamed ship as she licked her wound and escaped the worst fury of the storm by running before it once again that phrase by superior sailing was recalled to his mind although not superstitious drinkwater was like most philosophical sailors aware of the influence of providence and the caprice of fortune nothing had yet happened aboard patrician that persuaded him he was in command of anything but an unlucky ship among his illeducated crew he knew that feeling had developed to a conviction since the execution what dyou make of her mr hill with that black hull and making for the pacific id stake my hat and wig on her being a don sir your shoregoing wig mr hill drinkwater joked grimly and neither man took his glass from his eye for a certainty sir drinkwater grunted he had seen the spaniards lugubriously popish fancy for black ships in cadiz shortly before trafalgar but he was recalling the nightmare and its ominous warning he stared at the ship for other clues but found none a minute later she was gone lost in the bleak and heaving wastes of the southern ocean captain and master lowered their glasses at the same moment a don you say mr hill my life upon it sir drinkwater shook his head rash mr hill rash you dont agree sir drinkwater managed a grin at the obviously discomfited hill ive a hunch mr hill a hunch nothing more and not worth the trouble of a wager come now lets get a new foretopmast off the booms chapter two the radoub december drinkwater swallowed painfully and stared balefully at the first lieutenant there were moments and this was one of them when he would have wished for the return of samuel rogers for all his drunkenness and bullying temperament rogers would have understood what was to be done but rogers had been blown to the devil with six score others when the zaandam exploded alongside the antigone off orfordness and poor fraser had inherited the first luffs uneasy berth a quiet competent scot fraser was an obsessively worrying type a man who let anxiety get the better of his spirit which was thereby damped and warped drinkwater had once overheard mount referring to him in conversation with james quilhampton if yon scot mount mimicked in false north british dialect ever occasioned to fall in the sea hed drown then seeing quilhamptons puzzled look he added plainly he possesses no buoyancy drinkwater regarded fraser his expression softening he was a prey to anxiety himself he was being unjustly hard on a conscientious officer its high summer hereabouts mr fraser though it has a damned uncivil way of showing it but i want the men worked dye hear worked sir and damned hard not a single task that aint necessary ill have no gratuitous hazing but i want every manjack of em to know that they dont refuse to go aloft on my ship drinkwater drew breath his anger at his predicament concentrated on the helpless fraser aye aye sir but the first lieutenant hesitated well mr fraser whats the trouble well sir such tasks weve sent down the foretopmast tasks are you suggesting your imagination cannot supply tasks good god man was there ever a want of tasks on a manowar it was clear that frasers imagination fell somewhat short of drinkwaters expectation the captain sighed resignedly as the frigate lurched and trembled a sea smashed against her weather bow and the spray whipped aft stinging their faces turn up all watches mr fraser i want the people worked until they drop i dont care that it blows a gale nor that the ships doing a dido or that every manjack of em hates my lights by sunset but we had one brush with an enemy off the orkneys that i dont want repeated and that ship we sighted this morning be he don or devil bore two decks of guns if we have to fight her in our present condition mr fraser ill not answer for the consequences dyou comprehend my meaning and i mean the officers to turnout too the officers sir frasers jaw dropped a little further anxiety about the unstable state of the crew and the captains reaction to their behaviour this morning was worming his belly drinkwater pressed relentlessly on now as to tasks mr fraser you may rattle down the lower shrouds slush the new topmast and reeve a new heelrope i dont doubt an inspection of the gundeck will reveal a few of the gunlashings working and the same goes for the boat gripes lets have the well sounded hourly and kept dry as a parsons throat have the gunner detail a party to make up more cartridges the quartergunners to reknap the flints in the upper deck gunlocks and overhaul the shot lockers turn a party to on scaling the worstcorroded balls and send some men to change all the shot in the garlands get an officer aloft with a midshipman and a pencil to carry out an examination of all the spars for further shakes and let me have their findings in writing fraser caught the reproach in drinkwaters eyes and coloured at his own negligence he had taken so much of patricians gear from the dockyard on trust since she had been so recently refitted after being cut down to a razee yes sir very well you can carry out an inventory of the tradesmens stores and have a party assist the cooper to stum some casks ready for watering and if that aint enough mr fraser do not neglect the fact that we lost two good topsails this morning in short sir i want you to radoub the ship aye sir and the officers are to take an active part mr fraser no driving the men i want em led sir led by officers so that when the time comes theyll follow without hesitation the time sir fraser essayed curiously catching a moment of mellowing by the captain aye mr fraser the time which may catch a ship at a disadvantage and deliver her to the devil in an instant or a don sir you comprehend my meaning very well see to it at once pipe all hands mr hill and i will tend the deck drinkwater remained on deck the whole of that day they set more sail and began to claw back the lost miles to windward at apparent noon both he and hill were gratified by twenty minutes of sunshine during which they obtained a perfect meridian altitude and fixed their latitude fiftysix degrees fiftyseven minutes south mr hill fiftyfive minutes sir close enough then let us split the difference and lay that off on the chart both men reboxed their instruments hills old quadrant in its triangular box drinkwaters hadley sextant in a rectangular case fitted out with green baize and a selection of telescopes shades and adjusting tools which gave it the appearance of a surgeons knifebox drinkwater caught the look of satisfaction in hills eyes as he handed over the closed case to midshipman belchambers i never claimed hadleys sextant a better instrument than my old quadrant mr hill hill smiled back no sir but they say the best tunes are played on old fiddles they made their way below pocketing their tablets and pencils to allow them to grasp the ropes of the companion ways they leaned over the chart and hill manipulated the parallel rules striking the pencil line from west to east on the parallel of fiftysix degrees fiftysix minutes southerly latitude well clear of the horn and the diego ramirez islands drinkwater indicated a group of islands some sixty miles southwest of cape horn they fell silent both pondering the unspoken question their longitude were they yet west of the horn able to lay the ships head to the north of west and pass up into the pacific or were they still east of the meridian of the cape or diego ramirez that longitude of sixtyeight thirtyseven west perhaps we will be able to obtain a lunar observation later observed hill the sky shows signs of clearing yes agreed drinkwater we might also obtain our longitude by chronometer though i know your general prejudice against the contrivance hill looked sidelong at the gimballed clockface in its lashed box cook had proved its usefulness thirty years ago but hill preferred the complex computations of a lunar observation to the simpler solution of the hourangle problem which he thought smacked too much of necromancy drinkwater smiled wryly and changed the subject as he rolled up the chart i hope to water at juan fernandez by midjanuary mr hill aye aye sir well have enough casks by then hill referred to the stumming then in progress in the orlop deck where sulphurous smoke emanated from the primitive cleaning process and the labourll do the men no harm quite so drinkwater put the chart and rules away preparing to return to the deck but hill stopped him taking advantage of the intimacy permitted a sailing master and the long familiarity the two men had known sir that ship the one we sighted this morning it has been worrying me that you thought my opinion in error i have the advantage of you mr hill drinkwater smiled again so that hill was reminded of the eager young acting lieutenant he had long ago known on the cutter kestrel im sorry sir i didnt intend to pry oh the contents of my orders are such that their secrecy applies principally to their comprehension the truth is that i dont believe that ship was a don he looked up at the old master hill was massaging his arm a wound acquired at camperdown his expression was rueful the truth is i think she was russian captain drinkwater stood at the weather hance regarding the long deck of the patrician wrapped in his boatcloak he ignored the frequent patterings of spray there was some abatement in the gale and the wind backed a touch enabling them to claw more westing against wind and the cape horn current that set against them at a couple of knots midshipman belchambers hovered near ready to dash below for sextant and chronometer should the sun appear again to windward patches of blue sky punctuated the low rolling cumulus and it was hard to comprehend the fact that this was the season of highsummer in the southern hemisphere there was little in the leaden aspect of the clouds nor the grey streaked and heaving mass of the ocean to suggest it along the deck and aloft men worked in groups and singly lieutenant quilhampton swung about the mainmast with midshipman frey and comley the boatswain was overhauling gear on the focsle and keeping a lively eye on a party of men in each set of weather shrouds who were rattling down the grim motionless presence of captain drinkwater intimidated them all for it had slowly permeated the collective consciousness of the hands that their peevish unwillingness to obey orders had not only been let off lightly but had endangered the ship to a degree drinkwater sensed this contrition partly because he also shared much of the mens embittered feelings for notwithstanding their task and the problems which beset it the voyage had not been a happy one from the moment they had run stanham to the foreyardarm it seemed providence had ceased to smile on them ordered north with a convoy to leith roads from the london river patrician had dragged her anchor in an easterly gale in the firth of forth drinkwater had been dining aboard another ship at the time in the company of an old friend and messmate from his days as a midshipman sir richard white had got into leith roads three days earlier after his seventyfourgun titan had been badly mauled in a gale off the naze of norway where sir richard had been engaged in a successful operation extirpating nests of danish privateers hiding in the fiords he had also enjoyed a considerable profit from the destruction of danish and norwegian trade having a broad pendant hoisted as commodore and two sloops and a cutter under his direction for prosecuting this lucrative little campaign sitting in his comfortably furnished cabin drinkwater was reminded that there was another royal navy to that which he himself belonged a service dedicated to the selfadvancement of its privileged members he did not blame sir richard for taking advantage of his position any more than he blamed him for inheriting a baronetcy it was now that the recollection of his old friends circumstances rankled as he wrestled with a disaffected crew a contrary gale and the remotest ocean in the world but he had enjoyed the conviviality of the distant evening sir richards officers were pleasant and made much of drinkwater he could imagine whites briefing prior to his arrival his guest was a friend a seaman of the old school a tarpaulin of considerable experience and so on and so forth all designed to provoke goodnatured but superior attitudes drinkwater was too old to worry much though when he thought about such things they still angered him at the time he had enjoyed whites company they had grumbled over the income tax and agreed on the excellence of the port they had deplored the standard of young officers and disagreed over the propriety of the new regulation that made masters and pursers equal in status to the commissioned officers and then the news had come that patrician was making signals of distress and drinkwater had had a rough and wet return to his ship in his gig to find chaos in place of an ordered anchor watch and the ship dragging from sheer neglect of the cable at the turn of the tide the contrast with the wellordered state of affairs aboard titan was inescapable in a fury he had ordered the ship under weigh only to recall that he had given lieutenant quilhampton shoreleave and been compelled to fetch a second anchor poor quilhampton drinkwater looked up at him in the maintop dictating some memorandum to frey they were as close to friendship as a commander and his second lieutenant could be for drinkwaters wife and quilhamptons mother enjoyed an intimacy and quilhampton had been drinkwaters earliest protege he felt a surge of anger against the admiralty the war and the whole bloody predicament of his ship at the thought of poor quilhampton the young man was wasting the best years of his life crossed in love by the implacable exigencies of the naval service drinkwater wished it was he and not fraser who was first lieutenant your steward enquires if you wish for some coffee captain eh oh thank you derrick drinkwater roused himself from his reverie and nodded to his clerk derricks face had lost neither its sadness nor its pallor in the months since his impressment by mr mylchrist and the cutters crew taken from the banks of the river colne as he walked from colchester to wivenhoe derrick had protested his refusal to take part in belligerent operations with such force and eloquence that the matter had eventually been brought to drinkwaters attention so too had the strange offender drinkwater remembered the mans first appearance in his cabin on that last forenoon at anchor at the nore some five days after they had hanged stanham take off your hat an outraged lieutenant mylchrist had ordered but the man had merely shaken his head and addressed drinkwater in a manner that brought further fury to the third lieutenants suffused face friend i cannot serve on thy ship for i abhor all war be silent damn you and call the captain sir when you address him thank you mr mylchrist that will do i think i know the temper of this man drinkwater turned to the solemn yet somehow dignified figure you are of the quaker persuasion are you not i am very well i cannot return you to the shore you are part of the ships company but i but i shall respect your convictions can you read and write good then you may be entered as my clerk attend to the matter mr mylchrist and so drinkwater had increased his personal staff by a clerk adding derrick to mullender his steward and tregembo his coxswain and finding the quiet resigned quaker an asset to the daytoday running of the ship if he had entertained any doubts as to the man infecting the ships company with his peculiar brand of dissenting cant he need not have worried the hands regarded derrick with a goodnatured contempt the kind of attitude they reserved for the moonstruck and the shambling halfidiotic luetic that kept the heads clean thank you derrick tell mullender i shall come below very well captain and i have the pursers accounts faircopied and ready for your signature drinkwater took another look round the deck and as derrick stood aside he went below for a warming mug of coffee deuced if i understand the man lieutenant mylchrist tossed off the pot of shrub and stared with distaste at the suet pudding the wardroom steward laid before him his eyes met those of his messmates staring from faces that were tired from unaccustomed exertion hes a damned slavedriver though why he had to drive us stuff your gape with that pudding johnnie theres a good fellow said mount with a note of asperity in his voice ah fraser here sit down steward bring the first lieutenant a bottle thank you mount well theres one consolation and what might that be enquired the chastened mylchrist well all sleep like logs tonight except those of us with a watch to keep muttered mylchrist you make sure you keep it cully not like that episode in leith road where you neglected the basic all right all right theres no need to go over that again maybe not you see yourself as a victim today but the plain facts are that youll be a worse victim if you dont take the captains point mount stared round the table he was with the exception of hill the oldest officer in patricians wardroom something of a dutchuncle to the lieutenants well what exactly is the captains point asked mylchrist sourly that this ship is a bloody shambles and has no right to be shes no different from the other ships ive served aboard bloody channel fleet two days from home and a couple of cruises in the med for gods sake johnnie dont show how wet you are goddamn it man midshipman wickham was in the arctic freezing his balls off before youd heard a shot in anger now look here mount dont you dare patronise me gentlemen gentlemen be silent fraser snapped and an uneasy truce settled on the table mounts right so is the captain its no your place to strut so branky johnnie the men say shes a donsie ship poppycock fraser the ships not unlucky for that i take to be your meaning the trouble is were out of sorts frayed like worn ropes mount smiled reassuringly at fraser and that business off the orkney upset us all captain drinkwater most of all said quilhampton speaking for the first time i think he feels the shame of that more keenly than the rest of us quilhampton rose and reached for his hat and greygoe i must relieve hill he left the wardroom and a contemplative silence in which they each relived the shame of the action with the danish privateer they had chased her for four hours sighting her at dawn hull down to leeward ten miles to the east of the pentland skerries the dane had run but once it was clear the heavy frigate could outsail her in the strong westerly wind she had tacked and stood boldly towards the patrician unbeknown to the captain on the quarterdeck above the two lieutenants on the gundeck had relaxed assuming the capture to be a mere formality once the intelligence of the privateers turn had been passed to them despite the shot from a bowchaser the dane had not slackened her pace but run to leeward of the patrician and the sudden broadside that lieutenant mylchrists battery had been ordered to fire had been ragged and ineffectual only succeeding in puncturing the privateers sails once to windward the danish commander sailed his nimble vessel like a wizard though drinkwater turned in his wake the dane beat upwind with an impressive agility whenever the patrician closed the range to cannon shot the dane tacked keeping a press of canvas aloft so that the momentary disadvantage he suffered while he gathered way on the new tack was compensated for by the attention the patrician had to pay to going about with two hours to sunset the privateer had slipped into sanday sound taking advantage of the weather tide that sluiced through the rocks islets and orcadian islands with which her commander was more familiar than either drinkwater or hill in the end as darkness closed over the patrician and caution forced her to haul off the land the danish privateer had escaped it was not hill but drinkwater himself who turned the deck over to quilhampton well james you have the ship isolated by the howl of the wind drinkwater unwound with uncharacteristic informality he fixed the younger man with a perceptive stare sir said quilhampton puzzled you have not spoken of it james the matter upon which you solicited my advice in leith road drinkwater prompted the matter of matrimony damn it oh no sir no but as you said tis likely to be a damnably long voyage quilhamptons answer was evasive and he avoided the captains eyes searching the horizon with an expression of despair he wondered if it were an accident caused by the violent motion of the ship as drinkwater went below or whether the slight pressure against his shoulder had been a gesture of commiseration chapter three manhunt february the islands of juan fernandez bear no resemblance to my impression of crusoes refuge drinkwater wrote in his journal then laid down his pen leaned back in his chair and stared rapturously out of the stern windows the sashes were lifted and the gentle breeze that wafted into the cabin bore the sweet scent of a lush vegetation dominated by the sandalwood trees he closed his eyes and drew the air in through his nostrils a calm contentment filling him for the first time in weeks his cabin bore a civilised air being upon an even keel drinkwater turned back to his journal rejected the idea of an attempt to rival defoe and continued writing we sighted the peak of el yunque on the rd instant a fair landfall but occupied by the spaniards and unwilling to advertise our presence upon the pacific coasts of america took departure for fartherout island thirty leagues to the westward where we found anchorage in nine fathoms with a sandy bottom wood and water in plenty an abundance of pig and goats there are seals and seaelephants and several species of hummingbird the men have been exercised at their leisure a circumstance which gives me great heart after our recent difficulties he laid his pen down again and rose stretching they lay at anchor within half a mile of the beach and he could see the launch drawn up on the sand the two boatkeepers paddling like children in the shallows the warmth of a sun almost overhead lay over the anchorage like a benediction filling the ship with a languorous air lotuseating he murmured leaning his hands on the sill of the window he looked up at the rugged volcanic summit of the island rising precipitously from foothills that were covered in rich vegetation unlike the main island of the archipelago masafuera fartherout island did not possess the anvilpeak of el yunque but it was impressively beautiful to men whose eyes had been starved of the sight of green leaves an occasional shot echoed up the ravines evidence of mounts hunting party flushing the wild pig from the undergrowth the thought of dining that evening on roast pork brought the juices to drinkwaters mouth in anticipation and further enhanced his feeling of contentment they could take a short break here give the men a run ashore replenish their wood and water dine all hands in the very lap of luxury and even perhaps if they could find someone among the crew conversant with the process make some goats milk cheese he returned to his table picked up a pen and began to write again the breeze ruffled his shirt and through the skylight the sunshine beat down warming the old ache in his mangled shoulder the mood of the people is much improved since our arrival their faces wear smiles this day and i am sanguine that the outbreaks of sporadic drunkenness of pettytheft and brawling that accompanied our passage of the atlantic will cease now that we are brought into better climes and the men become resigned to their task he looked up and saw the launch coming off its waist full of filled barricoes of sweet water through the skylight he heard orders being given to the watch on deck in preparation for hoisting the casks into the hold if they worked well today and tomorrow he would give each watch a days leave of absence and they could scramble about the island like children on holiday by noon they had reached the treeline quilhampton in the lead gave a great whoop like a red indian for it was to be the halting point of the expedition drinkwater was panting with the unaccustomed exertion watching frey and belchambers scamper about the increasing number of rocky outcrops that made their appearance as the valley had narrowed and risen as behoved the intelligence of naval officers it had been considered necessary to make some purpose of the day not for them the wild and aimless wandering of the men whose liberty infected them like quarts of unwatered rum far below they could hear the shouts and laughter of their unconfined spirits as they chased about the ferny undergrowth besides if the men were to give vent to their pentup emotions it was incumbent upon the officers to make way for them so it had been quilhampton who had decided the walk ashore should become an expedition and drinkwater who had suggested they traced one of the streams upwards to its source accompanied by the second lieutenant the two midshipmen mr lallo the surgeon and derrick the quaker clerk they had set off after breaking their fasts and parading divisions those left aboard had worn glum expressions despite promises of their turn tomorrow such was the liberating infection of the island upon those destined to run amok today the officers began their expedition at the watering place where the stream ran sluggishly out over a bed of pebbles and sand spreading itself into a tiny delta and carving miniature cliffs and escarpments through the foreshore but it soon narrowed its bed deeper and its current swifter passing beneath a cover of sandalwood trees which already showed evidence of the axe marks of man the oleaginous qualities of this species pronounced lallo patting one of the dark red treeboles with a proprietorial hand produce an oil which may i believe be substituted for copaiba oil as well as forming an admixture for indian attars what the deuce is an attar lallo enquired quilhampton perfume perfume that fragrance so often necessary to the fair sex in warm weather to render them desirable to men i should have thought you would have known that mr q given your strong desire to become a benedick quilhampton flushed scarlet and lallo cast a mischievous glance at drinkwater is that not so sir i fear you embarrass mr q mr lallo but perhaps you would tell me to what use you would put such an oil well as for copaiba it is a specific in certain complaints of the urinary tract it occurs to me that the sandal wood tree might provide us with oleaginous matter with similar properties very well we can gather some chips on our return but our young friends here are anxious to continue i suspect they are too young for complaints of the urinary tract very well sir adelante laughing they pressed on ever upwards the trees thinned to scrub the ferns that grew prolifically alongside the stream now sprouted from rocks and mosses and the water no longer dark under the trees sparkled and ran white leaping and boiling over rocks and into deep mysterious pools after an hour they came to a waterfall where the stream dropped almost thirty feet over a sheer lip of grey rock the silver trail roared downwards sending up a cloud of spray through which a rainbow curved on either side dense foliage grew pierced by the heavy heads of several exotic blooms sir look drinkwater turned to where mr midshipman belchambers a brighteyed and excited child pointed frey was beside him his pencil already racing over the sketchblock he was rarely without gods bones a humming bird drinkwater recognised the tiny bird from a print he had once seen in ackermanns the extravagant result of the printmaker capitalising on the public interest in such exotic subjects roused by captain cook the blurred whirring of the birds wings as it held its head motionless at the bell of a flower was a jewel of pure cinnamon for several minutes they stared in wonder at the creature until the lust for achievement drew them further upwards when they cleared the undergrowth and the scrub they emerged onto a steep rocky scree here the grass was sparse hanging in tussocks rooted in shallow hollows where rain and humus had collected to produce a soil from the volcanic core of the island they flung themselves down sprawling in the sunshine and broke open the sparse stock of provisions they had brought from the ship the view was stupendous below them the vegetation spread giving way to the water of the anchorage bluegreen from the sand and coral reflecting light upwards through it upon the limpid water the frigate sat like a toy her dark brown sides with the cream strake pierced by the open gunports through which fresh air dried out the mildew damp and rot of the horn her spread sails hung drying in loose festoons at the stern the white ensign lifted languidly reflecting the luxurious lethargy of the ship beyond the anchorage the ocean spread to the horizon utterly empty the pale blue of the sky dotted with an occasional cloud except to the northwest where a greater massing of cumulus marked the distant peak of el yunque dominating masatierra the nearer island mainland of the group dyou intend an attack on the spanish settlement sir asked quilhampton nodding at the distant indication of the island and munching on a slab of pursers cheese that was almost inedible no ah derrick come sit here with us man unless you wish to eschew the company of the ungodly they watched the quiet quaker awkward in the presence of the officers squat stiffly with them i knew one of your persuasion derrick when i was in the arctic dyou recall captain sawyers mr q the master of the faithful sir yes a fine seaman and one of natures gentlemen i am glad to hear you say so captain the quaker replied solemnly is it to be panama then sir persisted quilhampton ah the wardroom have sent you to find out my intentions eh mr q and i was giving you the credit for wishing to discover the source of this river well sir i have to admit that curiosity is getting a trifle out of hand quilhamptons voice rose at the end of the sentence so that he left it hanging like a question drinkwater looked round the circle of faces they were all looking at him expectantly the mood of the day was too good to spoil very well you shall take tablets down from the mountain gentlemen beggin your pardon derrick but you see what curious fellows i am set about with your lesemajestie will be overlooked mr lallo he grinned very well gentlemen i will confide in you and parade the hands at sunset so that your period of privilege is brief its a galleon sir the acapulco galleon like lord anson lallos lesemajestie was infectious midshipman belchambers was boltupright with excitement the party laughed indulgently as a matter of fact it aint mr belchambers matter of fact it aint panama either at least not directly initially we shall strike what the devils that lieutenant quilhampton was the first on his feet they stared down at the ship where the wind carried the disintegrating puff of white smoke gently to leeward they stood stockstill for an instant and then the second gun came reverberating up the ravine like the first and prompting them to sudden action instinctively drinkwater cast a glance round the horizon the sea was as empty as before the signal of recall was concerned with some internal matter they gathered up their odds and ends and began to make their way down the mountain fine bloody banyan day this turned out to be lieutenant mylchrist muttered between clenched teeth as lallo bent over his shoulder the light from the lamp held aloft by the elderly loblolly boy skeete caught the edge of the catling and skeete grinned revealing carious teeth and malodorous breath now mr mylchrist dyou care for my rum or the wardrooms brandy get on with it you damned windbag panted mylchrist waves of pain spreading from his shoulder where the bruised and roughedged wound showed the entry point of the musket ball you know it doesnt do to insult ones physician in such a dependent state mr mylchrist does it skeete damn the pair of you hold your tongue johnnie and let the surgeon get on with his work mount patted the young officers shoulder and he lay face down for the ball had entered his shoulder from the rear youre not the first gentleman to be the victim of a hunting accident remarked lallo now hold still mount bent to assist in holding mylchrist down anxiety and responsibility played on his face trouble is bones i dont think it was an accident mylchrist grunted and skeete drew the leather pad into his mouth as the catling began to probe the wound you dont asked lallo without pausing in his task no one of my marines reported his musket missing when we halted and not half an hour later mylchrist here was shot as far as i know there was no one near him that belonged to the hunting party does the captain know all this no not yet then i suggest you tell him your men to spread out mr mount they know the two men missing hogan and witherspoon sir very well lets get on with it drinkwater checked the priming in the pans of his two pistols loosened his sword and nodded to quilhampton the second lieutenant waved the cordon of picked seamen forward at intervals along their front petty officers and midshipmen were posted to avoid the searchers colluding with the deserters thanks to hogan and witherspoon this was likely to be the only walk ashore the remainder of the crew were going to have captain drinkwater was in a dark and vengeful mood they moved forward trampling the undergrowth and flushing out birds and small scampering things as they moved inland drinkwater looked back to where a party of the gunners mates carried some sulphur bombs enlargements of the alchemical concoctions old blue lights made up for stumming the casks drinkwater was fairly certain of where his quarry had gone to earth for he had seen movement on the open scree spied from his cabin through his glass he was confident it had been one of the deserters watching the ship for signs of retributive landing parties leaving her to the right of the spot overhanging crags opened fissures in the vertical faces of sections of the mountainside and some of these looked large enough to be caves it was drinkwaters party that reached this area and he called up the gunners lets have a portfire to those sulphur bombs lively now there was a sputtering of fuse and then an ochreous discharge of acrid smoke hoy it then laddie coughed one of the gunners mates and a pungent missile was hurled into the first cave that seemed to offer sanctuary drinkwater moved to the next and bawled his ultimatum into the impenetrable darkness give yourselves up at once come now hogan and witherspoon youll be left otherwise no sound came out of the cave beyond a disturbed flapping and the emergence of a pair of fluttering bats drinkwater nodded to the gunners and a second sulphur bomb was pitched sir they turned and saw lieutenant quilhampton pointing theres yellow smoke coming from the hillside above must be a rock fall inside the party began scrambling up beside the cave on the bleak hillside a hole in its roof had formed a natural chimney funnelling the sulphur fumes clear it was an unwitting distraction for no fugitives ran from the smokefilled cave hey look again they turned this time to the right looking back downwards to where some twenty yards away two men were scrambling down into the cover of the scrub and trees drinkwater had guessed correctly the fugitives had holed up in a cave but one further along the ledge after them there was a general chase of excited men slithering scrambling and cursing as they went in pursuit drinkwater fired his pistol as a signal to mount and then forsook his dignity and joined the manhunt after ten minutes he recognised the steep valley of the stream they had followed that morning he could hear the roar of the waterfall somewhere not far below but apart from broken branches the fugitives had vanished the roar of the waterfall seemed to act as a magnet to the men they were already thirsty after their climb and there were now sprained ankles and torn skin to add to their moaning drinkwater was well aware their hearts were not in the chase but he could not afford to let hogan and witherspoon escape halt there stand easy you may drink mr frey yes sir take belchambers get word to mr mount to leave sergeant blixoe and his marines at the watering place he himself is to come up here aye aye sir drinkwater watched the two midshipmen scramble down the steep ravine slashing at the ferns with their dirks he entertained a moments apprehension for their safety they could be hit like mylchrist then he dismissed the thought he was almost certain the missing men were now behind him he looked across the pool the men were bent over scooping the water up into their faces there was about them an air of levity borne out by suppressed laughter and sly glances cast in his direction he watched two in particular drinkwater turned to quilhampton mr q i want you to spread the men out and continue down to the beach comb this valley and remuster by the boats weve wasted enough time as it is and it will be sunset in an hour aye aye sir quilhampton turned and began to shepherd the men down the mountain come on then lads drinkwater bent himself to drink from the stream the two men were watching him a covert look in their eyes he stared at them pointedly and with an obvious and eloquent reluctance they moved away after the others with a beating heart drinkwater remained behind mount found him sitting on a rock checking the locks of his pistols sir the marine lieutenant was gasping with the effort of his climb sit down mr mount take a drink slowly and listen to what i have to say mount sat and drank and listened looking sharply at drinkwater as the captain explained his suspicions his voice lost in the roar of the waterfall you understand mr mount perfectly sir if youll give me a moment mount checked his own flintlock a heavy horsepistol why mylchrist mr mount dyou know hes the youngest and most vulnerable officer sir mounts voice lacked its usual conviction does he ride the men when i am not there i mean i have not noticed so sir no and why hogan and witherspoon drinkwater recalled hogan a handsome irish giant whom he remembered now hearing utter mutinous remarks the night they sprang the foretopmast off cape horn and witherspoon by contrast a dark young man agile as a monkey and one of the patricians prime topmen noted for his daring aloft another suspicion came to drinkwater as he waited for mounts signal of readiness it was darker than the first and he cursed himself for not thinking of it sooner aware that it had been hovering just beyond his consciousness for some time ready stooping and moving from rock to rock mount crossed the stream on the further bank he looked back at drinkwater and nodded lifting their pistols both men advanced cautiously on opposite sides of the pool between them the silver cascade of water fell from above sluicing over the polished rock lip of the escarpment to fall into the hollow with a roar the smoking spray of its motion cut by the advancing shadow of the high western bank which terminated the glittering rainbow like a knife ten yards from the foot of the fall where the rocks were broken cemented by moss and tiny fernfronds and the cliff rose sheer above both men stopped i command you to come out drinkwater roared above the noise of the fall the spray was already soaking the two officers whose hands covered the pans of their cocked pistols drinkwaters demand produced no response in the kings name bollocks to your focking king mount and drinkwater exchanged glances come out hogan damn you otherwise youre a dead man drinkwaters eyes studied the overhang he could just see the opening in the rock which gave access to the hollow space behind the fall and have ye hang me capn drinkwater ill not die for your mad raddled king nor for your damned causes god damn you capn drinkwater god damn you to hell hold your tongue you fenian bastard mount roared from the far side of the fall moving precipitously forward so that drinkwater was forced to wave him back what about you witherspoon dyou wish to hang come lad show some sense dyou wish hogan to answer for you witherspoon aye sir i do witherspoons voice cracked into a squeak there was nothing more to be done drinkwater nodded and began to edge forward wondering how much hogan could see and knowing that at least looking from the darkness into the light the irishman had the undisputed advantage he also had a loaded musket the base of the waterfall streamed over a rock lip a great slab of cooled lava that had slipped sideways to form an architrave in the heap of rocks which formed the lower slope of the escarpment at either end it seemed supported and softer deposits had been washed out by the water so that beneath and behind it a great void opened up floored by more rock underfoot alongside lay the deep pool into which the fall tumbled ceaselessly its roaring noise buffeting the senses to make thinking difficult light entered the cave through the wide silver curtain of the waterfall cautiously drinkwater moved forward as he saw the cave opening up he realised access was obtainable only from his side mount could do nothing beyond cover drinkwater as long as the captain remained outside the fall but it was too late for such considerations the deserters knew of their presence drinkwater hoped they also thought the area was surrounded by mounts marines but if that were the case drinkwater himself was unlikely to be the person sent in to winkle them out his eyes were accustoming themselves to the shifting light the westering sun helped the rapid tropic sunset was upon them deep within the cave he saw a movement instinctively he brought the pistol up and pulled the trigger the gun kicked in his hand and he saw a scuffle of reaction deep within quickly he moved forward drawing the second pistol from his waistband and finding firmer footing within the cave suddenly he was confronted by hogan the man held a levelled musket its bayonet glittering wickedly in the strange unreal light drinkwater fired the second gun but despite having its frizzen on moisture had seeped from his shirt and been drawn into the powder by its hygroscopic qualities the hammer clicked impotently and hogan lunged his own gunlock must have been rendered equally useless for he was relying on cold steel drinkwater stepped backwards and reached for his sword the footing was slippery with slime both men recovered hogan was an immensely strong and powerful man and he had witherspoon somewhere in the darkness to aid him outside mount was shouting something but drinkwater paid him no attention his eyes were fixed on the irish giant somewhere behind hogan witherspoon was suspiciously silent drinkwater flicked his eyes into the darkness but could see nothing hogan shifted his feet and drinkwaters attention returned to the irishman dont be a fool hogan you cant get away with this youre alone capn thats enough for me sure oill fix me own way to die what about witherspoon hogan grinned it was clear he knew of drinkwaters fear of the other man or oill fix yours for you capn hogan lunged again his reach was long and drinkwater fell back slipped and swiped wildly with his sword he felt the blade crash against the bayonet and the strength of his opponent as hogan met the pressure drinkwaters mangled right arm was unequal to the contest he saw victory light hogans eyes and felt the resistance of rock against his back now you english bastard hogan drew back the bayonet to lunge his teeth bared in a snarl that bore all the hatred inherent in his heart desperately drinkwater flung himself sideways falling at his adversarys feet the wet slime of the rocky ledge fouling him he rolled madly aware that he was somehow in contact with hogans feet he kicked and suddenly found the edge of the cave a second later he felt the icy cold of water close over his head the sudden shock electrified him an instant later a great irresistible pressure bore down upon him punching and bruising him so that for a moment he thought he was being beaten by hogan until the roaring in his ears proclaimed the source of the pain was the waterfall itself then he was subject to an immense rolling motion and vast pressure darkness engulfed him as the force of the water thrust him down rolling him over yet again but this time in an involuntary way shoving his aching body so that his lungs began to scream at his brain to let them have air he was drowning such were the powerful reflexes tearing at the muscles of his chest that opposition to them was impossible blinding lights filled his head the roaring of the water became intolerable he could resist no longer he opened his mouth and dragged water into his lungs mount saw a figure suddenly rise bursting from the surface of the dark pool some five yards below the fall itself he levelled his gun but his finger froze so far out of the water was the man flung welled up as strongly as he had just been thrust down that mount saw instantly that it was the captain a few minutes later mount had dragged his gasping commander to the side of the pool drinkwater lay over a rock his body racked by helpless eructations as he spewed the water from himself after a few minutes as mount alternately stared from drinkwater to the ledge beside the waterfall on the far side of the pool drinkwaters body ceased its painful heaving he looked up pale and shivering a mucous trickle running down his chin his shirt was torn and mount saw the scars and twisted muscles that knotted his wounded shoulder instinctively he saw the captain incline his head to the right indicating the shock of the chill in those mangled muscles hogans got your musket his powders spoiled what about witherspoon didnt see him think i may have winged him with my first shot ill get support its getting dark no we must but he got no further a loud bellow a bullroar of defiance it seemed came from the waterfall both men looked round and mount scrambled to his feet from behind the silver cascade glowing now with a luminosity that it seemed to carry down from higher up the mountain where the last of the setting sunlight still caught the stream hogan emerged he bore the musket in one hand and in the other the limp figure of witherspoon it seemed to the still gasping drinkwater that the darkest of his suspicions had been correct the bullroar had not been of defiance but something infinitely more elemental it had been a howl of grief animal in its intensity the drooping body of witherspoon was undoubtedly that of a dead lover such was instantly obvious to mount too without hesitation the marine officer raised his big pistol sodomite he snarled and took aim in the almost complete gloom the two officers were quite hidden from hogan the irish giant had no thoughts now beyond the overwhelming sense of loss the desperate venture on which he and his lover had set out that morning had seemed worth the hazard patrician would not stay hogan read his commander for a man of resolution and nothing waited for hogan over the pacific horizon beyond the chance of death by wounding death by disease or death from one or another of the multiple foulnesses that haunted his britannic majestys fleet the island though offered a bold man everything he could have outwitted fate and lived like crusoe upon such a spot until he met death in gods time not king georges it would have worked but for lieutenant mylchrist his frame was racked by monstrous sobs as he dragged the dead body of his lover out of the cave it only seemed another paroxysm of grief when mounts ball shattered his skull and smashed his brains against the cliff behind him shaking from cold and shock drinkwater followed mount gingerly back across the stream once again he approached the entrance to the cave in the last of the daylight the two officers stood staring down at their victims gods bones muttered drinkwater crouching down before his legs gave under him his first shot had indeed hit witherspoon hit the breast and heart witherspoon must have died instantly so silently that even hogan himself had not realised until after drinkwaters escape the damage that single shot had done for witherspoons breast was exposed as hogan had desperately sought to stem the bleeding wound the shirt was torn back and the two officers stared down at the shapely breasts of a young woman chapter four the chase march im damned if i understand why were not cruising off the isthmus complained mount as he lounged back in his chair and awaited the roast pig whose tantalising aroma had been permeating the ship for much of the forenoon it is common knowledge even to their lordships that panama is the focus of spanish power i think you jump to conclusions mount replied fraser cooling himself with an improvised fan fashioned from a sheet of discarded cartridge paper the wardroom was insufferably hot even with a windsail ducting air from the deck and its occupants were as frayed as the end of the canvas pipe itself besides preoccupations with opportunities for prizemoney are an obstruction to duty dont preach to me fraser gentlemen gentlemen such querulous behaviour its too exhausting by far be so kind as to leave the preaching to me god save us from that fate said mount accepting the glass from king the negro messman and rolling his eyes in a deprecating fashion at fraser both officers looked at the temporiser in their midst the reverend jonathan henderson chaplain to his britannic majestys frigate patrician laid a thin knotted finger alongside his nose in a characteristic gesture much loved by the midshipmen for its imitable property it invariably presaged an aphorism which its originator considered of importance in his ministry i am sure they know what they are about and it will avail us nothing if we quarrel what else are we to do god damn it said mount sharply come mr mount no blasphemy if you please im a military man mr henderson and accustomed to speak my mind within the mess and ive been too long at sea to have much faith in the wisdom of their lordships if youre referring to my relatively short career short good god man youve not been at sea for a dogs watch what the devil dyou know about it come sir i was chaplain to the late admiral roddam admiral roddam he spent the american war swinging round his own bloody chicken bones and port bottles until they had to move the nore light to mark the shoal admiral roddam hey king refill my glass and deafen my ears to sacerdotal nonsense henderson looked furiously at the grinning negro and rounded on mount mr mount im a man of god but ill not gentlemen pray silence you raise your voices too loudly fraser straightened up from the rudder stock cover from which vantage point he had been trying to ignore the petty squabble there has been a deal too much argument since that business at juan fernandez there is usually a deal too much argument when empty vessels are banging about very well mr lallo snapped fraser at the surgeon who until that moment had occupied a corner of the table with his sickbook belay that lallo shrugged and pocketed his pencil tell us how mylchrist is hell live but his shoulderll be damned stiff for a good while like the captains aye like the captains but hes over the worst of the fever lallo nodded and a silence fell as they considered the events on the island in the days that had followed their departure from juan fernandez the echoes of the affair had petered out except when conversation aimlessly disturbed it among the people it had lit another portfire of discontent for twothirds of the ships company had not enjoyed the liberty of that first watchashore nevertheless the nature of the incident had had less lasting impact on the men than upon the officers the hands had preoccupations other than sentimental considerations over a pair of lovelorn deserters in the collective wisdom of the crew there was an easier acceptance of the vagaries of human nature their lives were publicly lived crude in their exposure and therefore the revelation of witherspoons sex came as less of a shock than the vague realisation that they had perhaps been made fools of among the officers the reaction had been different it was to them truly shocking that a woman even a woman of the lowest social order which it was manifestly obvious that witherspoon was not should be driven to the extremity of resorting to concealment on a manowar many and various were the theories advanced to explain her action none was provable and therefore none was satisfactory to some extent it was this inexplicable nature of the affair that made it most irritating unlike the people the living conditions of the officers were such that they could function as individuals the solitude of their tiny cabins enabled them to think in privacy and in privacy thoughts invaded unbidden of them all james quilhampton had been most deeply stirred it had been quilhampton who had climbed back up the dark valley and found mount and drinkwater and the dead bodies it had been quilhampton who had organised the burial party and stood beside the chaplain as he performed his first real duty since recovering from the seasickness induced by the doubling of cape horn the two lovers had been buried that night and the sky above the lanternlit burialparty had been studded by stars this involvement had revived thoughts of his own hopeless love affair left far behind on the shores of the firth of forth and longsince repudiated when the news that patrician was bound for the distant pacific had plunged him into extreme and private depression now he rose from his cot disturbed by the squabble in the adjacent wardroom and emerged from his cabin into the silence that had followed it you make as much noise as a dovercourt he muttered sleepily slumping down in his chair and staring at the tablecloth before him his nose wrinkling to the smell of roast pork you shouldnt be sleeping james my boy when you can be drinking said mount pushing an empty glass towards him and beckoning king fill mr qs glass king yes sah missah q oh very well have you shrub there king good man i was just saying james that its damned odd we arent attacking the dons on the isthmus oh for gods sake dont start that again hold on fraser its a perfectly logical military consideration isnt it james quilhampton shrugged hes still dreaming of the lovely catriona macewan jibed fraser grinning well hes precious little to complain of since he was the last of us to have a woman in his arms agreed mount except hogan said quilhampton ah you see he was thinking of the fair sex an inadvisable preoccupation in the middle of the pacific ocean what you should be considering is what the devil were doing so far north if i remember correctly mr q broke in lallo the captain was about to confide in us when the recall guns were fired on the desertion of those two lallo hesitated persons mr lallo offered henderson exactly mr henderson now tell us that confidence was interrupted but you are in the captains pocket enough to get furlough in edinburgh town whats this about russians ive no more influence over the captain than you mr lallo indeed ive a good deal less i dare say but their deliberations were cut short for faintly down the cotton shaft of the windsail came a cry sail sail ho two points on the larboard bow they forgot the roast pork and the glasses of shrub and sherry even the reverend mr henderson joined the rush for the quarterdeck ladder adding to the clatter of overturned chairs and the noise of cutlery as the dragged tablecloth sent it to the deck king stood shaking his head and rolling his eyes in a melancholy affectation only quilhampton remained impervious to the hail of the masthead lookout his only reaction was to bring his wooden hand down on the table in a savage blow bruising the pine board and giving vent to the intensity of his feelings for underneath his personal misery below the strange disturbance caused by the desertion on juan fernandez lay the knowledge that most oppressed him and of which he had been dreaming fitfully as he had dozed on his cot more than any other officer it was james quilhampton who best understood the smouldering mood of the men it had been quilhampton alone who had defused the incipient mutiny aboard the antigone the previous summer very little had happened to placate the men since drinkwaters bounty paid out of the captains own pocket had eased tension for a while but the money had been paid to the whores of sheerness and any good that drinkwaters largesse had achieved had long since evaporated somehow the affair at juan fernandez had crystallised a conviction that had come to him as he had held the tawnyhaired catriona in his arms on his departure from edinburgh the conviction that patrician was unlucky and that she would never return home captain drinkwater had been more relieved than otherwise at the discovery of witherspoons sex no captain particularly one engaged on a distant cruise in the pacific relished the discovery of sodomitical relationships within his crew any more than he relished the problem of desertion the fact that witherspoon was a woman made hogans action understandable and lent a measure of reason to the twin absenteeism that stemmed from passion not mutiny what drinkwater had dreaded when he learned of the failure of two hands to muster was a sudden unpredictable revolt among the men his orders were difficult enough to execute without the ferment that such a disorder would cause a disorder which might threaten not merely his command but his very life he was not untouched by the tragedy that had happened beneath the waterfall but he perceived again the workings of providence and when he had entered the initials dd against the two names in the ships muster book his sense of relief had been very real in the margin provided for remarks he had added killed while resisting arrest having first run it was a poor epitaph a poetaster might have conjured up a romantic verse at the tragedy a venal commander might have kept the two names on the ships books and drawn the pay himself or at least until he had repaid himself the cost of the sword he had lost in the pool beneath the waterfall but drinkwater felt only a further sadness that hogan and witherspoon had gone to join those damned souls who awaited judgement in some private limbo watched over by the guardian angels of the admiralty such at least had been the incongruous core of mr hendersons homily on the subject drinkwater had begun to doubt the wisdom of their lordships in soliciting the aid of the established church to subdue the convictions of men forced into his britannic majestys navy drinkwater considered such solecisms foolish ignorant diversions from the grim realities of the seaservice he was concluding his private remarks in his journal when he heard the cry from the masthead he has a wind by god by your leave mr hill a rest for my glass on that stanchion of course sir he has a wind so you said a devils wind too what dyou make of him i reserve my judgement sir eh oh you refer to that fellow we saw off the horn drinkwater caught the stranger in his image glass to whatever the sail belonged it was not a blackhulled twodecker by the spread of her masts and her stunsls id wager on her being a frigate and spanish yes yes id not dispute that sir spanish frigate sir drinkwater looked aloft in the mizen top mr frey looked down smiling broadly and drinkwater was aware that the deck was crammed with officers and men milling about awaiting news from the privileged few at posts of vantage or with glasses to their eyes he caught the ripple of eagerness that greeted the news saw the smiles and sensed despite everything the metamorphosis that transformed his ship at the sight of an enemy very well mr frey you may come down and hoist spanish colours clear for action and beat to quarters then he raised his glass again and studied the enemy hull up now crossing their bow from the west mr frey should know a don when he sees one mr hill given his time watching em at cadiz oh for a breeze would to god hers would carry down to us shes seen us throwing out a private signal hill looked at the masthead pendant and at the dogvanes they barely lifted in the light airs that slatted patricians canvas shall i hoist out the boats and tow sir asked fraser suddenly impatiently efficient no mr fraser thatll exhaust the men the marine drummer was beating the tattoo and the hands were scrambling about the ship below the bulkheads were coming down and aloft the chain slings were being passed while along the deck sand was being sprinkled and the guncaptains were overhauling their train tackles and their gunlocks above their heads fluttered a huge and unfamiliar ensign the yellow and gold of spain then drinkwater had a happy inspiration mr henderson the thin face of the chaplain turned towards him the fellow was showing a very unclerical interest in the enemy do you pray for a wind sir henderson frowned and drinkwater saw the men pause in their duties and look aft grinning but sir is that not blasphemy do you do as i say sir pray for a wind tis no more blasphemous than to pray for aid on any other occasion henderson looked doubtful and then began to mumble uncertainly oh most powerful and glorious lord god at whose command the winds blow dyou think it will work asked hill grinning like the midshipmen somewhere in the waist a man had begun to whistle and there came sounds of laughter i dont know but tis a powerful specific against dispirited men by the sound of it how goes the chase mr fraser to windward sir like a winged bird i had no notion you had anything of the poet in you no it has a homeric quality the warm wind the moon and a windward chase yes they had got their wind though whether it was attributable to the praying of the chaplain or the whistling that breached the naval regulations was a matter for goodnatured conjecture throughout the ship as the men settled down for a night sleeping at the guns patrician was a big ship a heavy frigate a razee cut down from a sixtyfourgun lineofbattleship but she spread her canvas widely extended her yards by studding sail booms and hoisted a skysail above her main royal when the occasion demanded turn midshipman belchambers turned the glass and the logparty watched the line reel out dragged by the logchip astern stop called the boy the line was nipped the peg jerked from the chip and the line hauled in nine knots sir very well like a winged bird indeed mr fraser drinkwater smiled in the darkness sensing the embarrassed flush he had brought to the first lieutenants cheeks but do we gain on our chase fraser turned mr belchambers my quadrant if you please aye aye sir the boy ran off how do you find our youngest addition drinkwater asked eager and agile as a monkey sir hmm but hes too young there seems no shortage of such boys with parents eager enough to send em to damnation while they are still children i doubt they can know what their offspring are condemned to endure your own son is not destined for the seaservice sir not if i can find him a fat living in a good country parish both men laughed as belchambers returned with frasers quadrant the first lieutenant hoisted himself up on the rail bracing himself against the main shrouds and took the angle subtended by the white shape ahead of them drinkwater watched the pale pyramid of canvas would be much more difficult to see within the confinement of the telescope and it would take fraser a moment or two to obtain a good reading drinkwater waited patiently patrician lay over to the breeze close hauled on the larboard tack above him the studding sails bellied out spreading the ships canvas and bending the booms the sky was clear of cloud studded with stars and the round orb of a full moon which laid a dancing path of silver light upon the water the breeze was strong enough to curl the sea into small breaking crests and these from time to time were feathered with phosphorescence fraser jumped down from the rail aye sir i can detect a slight enlargement o the angle subtended by the enemy good but its going to be a long chase and this moonlight will discourage him from trying to make a sharp turn tis a pity he rumbled us so early i expect he knew well enough what ships to expect hereabouts yes the dons are apt to regard the pacific ocean as their own they fell to an easy and companionable pacing of the deck it was astonishing the difference the chase made to the atmosphere on board all grumbling had gone men moved with a newfound confidence and bore themselves cheerfully even in the dark hours there was a liveliness in the responses of the helmsman a perkiness about those of the watch ordered to perform the many small tasks as the officers strove in succession to get the best out of the ship fraser sought to gain something from the captains obvious desire to chat sir i was wondering if you would be kind enough to confide in me as to our orders sir if er if anything should happen to me in the next few hours youd like to know how to act i know i know damn it mr fraser the truth of the matter is that i aint sure myself weve to damage the dons and their trade to be sure but our main purpose here is to prevent what their lordships are pleased to call incursion into the pacific by the russians the russians sir ah i see that surprises you well they have settlements in alaska though what possible influence that might have upon the course of the war is something of a mystery and we are making for alaska now sir in a manner of speaking it seemed the best place to begin exhibiting his majestys flag drinkwater felt frasers bewilderment perhaps he should have confided in the younger man earlier in the voyage but fraser had had his own problems and the life of a first lieutenant was drinkwater knew not an easy one you are too young to remember the spanish armament in ninetyone eh i remember it vaguely sir wasnt war with spain imminent yes the channel fleet were commissioned a lucky thing as it happened since as i recall we were at war with the french republic within a year let me refresh your mind when cooks seamen brought highquality furs from the polar seas off alaska and kamchatka and sold them in canton they attracted the notice of the honourable east india companys factors a former naval officer named mears a lieutenant i believe he was together with a merchant master named tippin took out two ships across the north pacific on a furhunting expedition tippin was cast up on kamchatka but mears wintered somewhere in the islands the following spring about eightyeight or eightynine i forget which he discovered nootka sound a fine fiord on the west coast of what is now known as vancouver island and he opened a fur trade between the indians indigent upon the coast and the companys factors at canton in ninety the spanish sent a naval force seized the four british ships anchored in the sound but left two belonging to the united states of america the british ships were plundered and their seamen sent on spanish orders to canton in the american bottoms once the haughty don had disposed of us he planted his flag and claimed the whole coast across the whole bight to china good lord at home we armed for war but eventually the dons climbed down the sanculottes obliged us by executing king louis and depriving his most catholic majesty of the support of his most christian ally their lordships sent george vancouver out to receive the surrender of the spanish commander a don quadra or some such and vancouver spent the next year or so surveying and now we go out to prevent some such measures being repeated by the russkies that would seem to be about the size of the thing mr fraser there was a brief silence between them broken only by the low moan of the wind the hiss of the sea rushing alongside the frigate the creak of her fabric and some chatter amidships where the watch congregated chaffing the dozing guncrews that ship we saw off the horn sir i believe you expressed the opinion she was a russian ah hills been gossiping again has he drinkwater chuckled goodnaturedly yes yes i believe her to have been bound for the pacific like ourselves if she was ordered out as soon as hostilities were declared between petersburg and london she would be expected to reach the extremity of america at the same time as ourselves she was a twodecker sir yes and if theres close cooperation between the dons and the russians drinkwater let the import of the sentence sink in by implication i begin to see your problem sir well mr fraser remarked drinkwater drily if im knocked up when we overhaul that fellow ahead of us itll be your problem the wind backed a point towards dawn midshipman wickham came below to where drinkwater lay on his cot fully dressed its increasing too sir mr quilhampton says going large weve the legs of him sir she reeled off twelve at the last cast of the log drinkwater yawned twelve eh very well mr wickham ill be up directly quilhampton was worried when drinkwater reached the quarterdeck a few moments later shes carrying too much canvas sir drinkwater gauged the strength of the wind and the feel of the ship beneath his bootsoles yes there was a tendency of the ship to lay down drowning her lee bow and building up a resisting wave there he looked ahead they were overhauling the spanish ship perceptibly it would be foolish to risk her escaping by carrying away spars aloft when they might delay the action an hour and break their fasts very well mr q rouse all hands and take in the stunsls pass the word to the cook to fire up the galley range and boil some skillygolee and the purser to order up spirits weve a brisk forenoon ahead of us drinkwater watched the ship burst into life it was damned odd what the appearance of an enemy did to a ships company gives em a sense of purpose i presume he muttered to himself breathing in the fresh air of the dawn and watching the red ball of the sun break the eastern horizon ahead of them dragging its lower limb like some huge jellyfish as though reluctant to leave its resting place and climb up into the lightening sky and then he remembered he had left his sword in the pool beneath the waterfall on masafuera chapter five the spanish prisoner march drinkwater hesitated in the space his cabin usually occupied the bulkheads were down the chairs and table had been removed together with his cot seachest books and the two lockers that turned the after end of patricians gundeck into a private refuge even the chequerpainted canvas that served for a carpet had been rolled away only the white paint on the ships side and the deckhead gleaming in the reflected light that came in from the gaping stern windows from the ships wake and sent patterns dancing across it served to remind its new occupants that it was the hallowed quarters of patricians captain for the purpose of the cabin now became apparent with the removal of the furniture the obtrusive pounder cannon stood revealed and even the lead sink that served drinkwaters steward in his pantry was filled with water in readiness to sponge those after guns wheres my coxn he asked of the waiting guncrews who eyed the unexpected intrusion with some wariness who lent it to you mr mylchrist zur ah yes thank you tregembo and my pistols your clerks taken em to the gunner zur for new flints i tried knapping the old uns but they was too far gone eres your swordbelt drinkwater grinned he could imagine the quakers distaste for his task he pulled the sword from its scabbard beneath the langets he read the makers name thurkle and skinner i must thank mr mylchrist have my pistols taken to the quarterdeck as soon as they are ready aye aye zur drinkwater passed through the berth deck to the orlop in the stygian gloom he found lallo with his loblolly boys laying out the catlings and curettes the saws and pincers of his grisly trade a tub waited to collect the refuse of battle the amputated legs and arms of its victims drinkwater suppressed a shudder at the thought of ending up on the rough table lallos mates had prepared for a moment he stood at the foot of the ladder accustoming himself to the mephitic air and watching the preparations of the surgeon lamplight barely sustained here in the bowels of the ship danced in pale yellow intensity upon the bright steel of the instruments and illuminated the white of lallos bowls and bandages the contrast between these inadequate preparations below for rescuing men from death and the bright anticipation of the gundeck above struck drinkwater with a sudden sharpness he threw off the thought and coughed to draw attention to himself ah sir lallo straightened up under the low beams you are ready mr lallo ready aye ready sir said lallo somewhat facetiously and drinkwater caught the foul gleam of skeetes caried grin how is mr mylchrist today from the far end of the space mylchrist lifted a pale face from the solitary hammock that swung just beneath the heavy beams much better sir thank you i wish i could assist sir you stay there mr mylchrist youve had a long fever and mr wickham is doing your duty at the guns you wouldnt deny him his chance of glory would you now mylchrist smiled weakly no sir i promise you yours before too long thank you sir and thank you for the loan of your sword the least i can do drinkwater smiled down at the wounded officer mylchrist had been very ill avoiding gangrene only by providence and the application of a leadacetate dressing whose efficacy drinkwater had learned from the surgeon of the bucentaure when held prisoner on villeneuves flagship the employment of your sword guarantees you a share in the days profits mr mylchrist mylchrist smiled his gratitude at the captains jest if they received prize or headmoney for their work in the coming hours the third lieutenants share for a fine spanish frigate would better his annual salary drinkwater returned to the quarterdeck to find derrick awaiting him the quaker held the two pistols as though they were infected and it was obvious he had tried to leave them in the charge of someone else the others were enjoying his discomfiture fraser was positively grinning and the first lieutenants levity had encouraged the midshipmen and the guncrews waiting at the pounders on the quarterdeck even the sober hill busy with his quadrant determining the rate they were overhauling the spanish ship seemed amused thank you derrick drinkwater took the two pistols checked the locks were primed and stuck them in his belt mr meggs loaded them for you captain drinkwater looked at the quaker in the months they had been together he had conceived a respect for the man derrick had refused to call him sir tactfully avoiding the familiar friend of his faith compromising with captain drinkwater did not object the man was diligent and efficient in his duties and only took advantage of his position in so much as he asked to borrow the occasional book from drinkwaters meagre library when he had borrowed brodricks history of the war in the netherlands drinkwater had raised an inquisitive eyebrow your interest in that subject surprises me derrick a physician studies disease captain in order to defeat it not because of his liking for it drinkwater acknowledged his own defeat and smiled wryly well sir he said in a low voice the moment has come you had better go below to the orlop the surgeon has no assistant only his two loblolly boys perhaps you might be able to help i would not have my courage doubted captain derrick flicked quick glances at the inhabitants of the quarterdeck but i thought my post was at your side drinkwater had never had the luxury of a clerk before and had given the matter little thought though he recollected derricks post in action was to assist as directed very well derrick but it is glory on the quarterdeck courage is a quality you will find at mr lallos side he turned and raised his voice very well mr fraser mr mount all ready sir ships company fed fires doused spirits issued and the men at their battlestations my men likewise sir added mount a little over a mile sir said hill looking up from his calculations drinkwater cast an embracing glance along the deck and aloft very well pass the word to make ready well try a ranging shot but there was no need a puff of smoke shredded to leeward of the spanish frigates stern and a plume of water rose close under patricians larboard bow the windwhipped spray pattered aft and wet them ole remarked mount dashing the stuff from his eyes we shall make a running fight of it then said drinkwater raising his glass for the next hours they endured shot from the spaniards stern chasers trying to gauge the weight of metal of the balls drinkwater held his hand to return fire meant luffing to bring a bowchaser to bear on their quarry to luff meant to lose ground the morning was already well advanced by the time they could read the enemys name across her stern santa monica drinkwater spent the time pacing up and down occupying the leeward side of the quarterdeck where he had a direct view of the spanish ship and felt no discomfort from the downdraught from the maintopsail in such a balmy climate from time to time he paused rested his glass against a hammock stanchion and studied the santa monica she was a relatively new ship built of the honduran mahogany that made spanish ships immensely strong and the envy of their worn opponents her spars too gleamed with the richness of new pine and drinkwater recalled vancouvers words about the slopes of the coasts around nootka sound abounding in pines spruces and firs of immense height and girth being entirely suitable for the masting of ships slowly their view of the enemy altered as they overhauled her they began to see the whole length of the santa monicas larboard side studying the spaniard drinkwater could see her gun barrels foreshortening with a greater rapidity than they overtook his opponent was preparing a disabling broadside as soon as all his larboard guns bore while drinkwater was hampered by his starboard broadside being on the leeward side of the ship even with full elevation the list of the deck was such that his cannon might have trouble hitting their target in addition there would be the problem of water pouring in through the gunports as patrician lay down under the fiercer gusts of a strong breeze that was fast working itself up into a gale yet drinkwater could not reduce the list by taking in sail without losing his chance if the spanish commander succeeded in his design of disabling patrician his escape was guaranteed if he was a man of unusual energy the consequences might be worse he could conceivably hold off and rake patrician for all drinkwaters superiority in weight of metal the vision of lallos instruments of agony and those empty limbtubs sprung morbidly into his minds eye with an effort of will he dismissed the thought he would have to think of some counterstroke and act upon it with a nicety of timing if he was to disarm the dons intention for a moment longer he studied the santa monica as her bearing opened upon their bow with an almost hypnotic slowness then he shut his telescope with a snap mr hill mr fraser a moment of your time if you please he was not a moment too soon so parallel were the courses of the two ships that the angle of bearing for both of them to fire upon the other with any chance of achieving maximum effect was coincident within a degree or two drinkwater had noticed an officer bent over an instrument by the spaniards larboard dogvane and made his preparations accordingly run out the guns when he had passed his orders he heard the rumble of patricians pounders as their forwardtrained muzzles poked from the heeling frigates side his heart was beating hammering in his chest as beside him fraser sighted along the barrel of one of the quarterdeck eighteens about two degrees to go sir drinkwater grunted there had been some movement on the santa monicas deck at the appearance of patricians guns would his opponent react for a long moment the question seemed to hang then he saw the officer by the dogvane bend again perhaps they too were waiting in suspense leaning over the two ships rushed along patrician ranging slowly up to windward of the spanish ship gradually overlapping her larboard quarter close enough to confuse the sea running between them above their decks the yards were braced hardup upon the leeward catharpings the sails strained against the strength of the wind driving the foaming hulls relentlessly through the water from the highcocked peaks of their spanker gaffs the opposing ensigns of their contending nations snapped viciously while beneath them the lines of men at their guns the groups crouching below the rails ready to haul on bowlines and braces the redcoated marines aiming their muskets from the barricades of the hammock nettings and the knots of officers on the quarterdecks and at their posts throughout the ships waited for the orders from the two captains that commanded the destinies of five hundred souls infernal machines drinkwater heard someone whisper halfadmiringly and smiled grimly when he realised it was derrick caught up in the stirring excitement of this insanity bearing coming on sir said fraser matteroffactly still bent over the dispart sight of the pounder drinkwater saw the spanish officer by the santa monicas larboard dogvane straighten up purposively without taking his glass from his eye he gave the order fire gunlocks snapped like the crackle of grass as a squall strikes then came the immense roar of artillery the trembling rise of the deck as the ship reacted to the recoil and the sudden burst of activity throughout patrician that followed his order on the gundeck below the heavy pounders belched flame and shot trundling inboard and snapping their tackles together as their crews swarmed round them sponging and reloading the monstrous things on quarterdeck and focsle the pounders and the brutal pounder carronades swept the deck with powder smoke and the enemy with a hail of iron and langridge up helm behind drinkwater hill was standing by the wheel shouting through his speaking trumpet while fraser released from his duty bent over the dispart sight was leaping across the deck whence drinkwater followed him smartly there my lads stamp and go patricians bow swung towards the santa monica as the spaniards hull disappeared momentarily behind the smoke of her own broadside the fog of her discharging guns would for a moment blind her officers to much of his manoeuvre above his head the braces were easing the yards and then there was a rending crash from forward drinkwater felt a slight tremble through the hull but patricians turn was unimpeded and then leaning from the larboard hance he could see the stern of the santa monica there was a rent in her spanker and her ensign was fluttering down its halliards having parted as patricians jibboom slashed across her deck her stern boat was a wreck and hung down from the davits by a single fall larbowlines drinkwaters voice was drowned in the thunder of the larboard guns fired by their captains as they bore double shotted and topped with canister they blasted into the starboard quarter of the spaniard as patrician sliced obliquely across the santa monicas stern as the smoke cleared drinkwater caught a glimpse of comley the boatswain wielding an axe on the knightheads where he fought to free patrician of the obstruction of her smashed jibboom hard on the wind again mr hill aye aye sir full an bye it is patrician turned back to larboard again she had given ground to the enemy and was now in her lee but her guns still bore and they were being worked like fury by their crews flame and smoke roared from her larboard ports as the cannon pointed high a quick glance aloft showed drinkwater that barely a shot of the enemys had told that their most serious damage had been sustained forward from their own manoeuvre in crossing the santa monicas stern to rake her drinkwater dismissed that raising his glass to assess the damage his ruse had effected the enemy were hoisting their shotaway ensign into the mizen rigging and holes were appearing in her sails but hardly a gun replied to patrician from santa monicas starboard broadside then as he watched he heard a cheer shifting his glass from the enemys starboard quarter where he could see the splintered remains of her gallery he caught the toppling maintopmast for almost a minute it stopped falling leaning at a drunken angle held by its rigging to the fore and mizen masts and then it broke free crashing downwards and bringing the mizen topgallant with it the patricians were whooping about their guns and the officers on the quarterdeck wore broad grins drinkwater could see they were rapidly shooting ahead of the spaniard stand by to tack ship but drinkwater had no need to range up to windward subjecting the santa monica to a further raking broadside from ahead as he watched he saw the red and gold lowered from the mizen rigging in token of submission she strikes sir the news was reported from a score of mouths and more wild cheering broke out from the exhilarated crew of the patrician all the pentup frustration of the past months all the illfeeling and resentment the hopelessness of pressed men the selfpity of dispirited lovers and the petty hatreds of men confined together for weeks on end seemed burst like an abscess by the violent catharsis of action his eyes met those of the sailing master i think our sailing was of sufficient superiority on this occasion mr hill drinkwater remarked repressing his sudden triumphant burst of exuberance for a spaniard sir replied hill cautiously and drinkwater felt the reproach in the older mans tone he nodded yes you are right for a spaniard they did not board the prize until the following morning for the wind threw up too rough a sea for them to launch a boat safely and when they were successful they discovered their triumph to be shortlived their first broadside had been fired from the starboard guns on a leeroll the iron shot had hulled the santa monica and damaged her so badly that by the following noon it was clear that her pumps were unable to stem the inrush of water she began to founder under the feet of her prize crew lieutenant quilhampton sent aboard the spanish frigate as prizemaster sent this news back to the patrician by midshipman frey reluctantly drinkwater ordered the prize abandoned and by that evening found himself host to two hundred unwilling and darkly threatening prisoners they consisted of spaniards missioneducated indians and a large proportion of mestizos a lean and hardbitten lot led by a tall gaunt officer who wore the epaulettes of a captain in the royal navy of spain i am captain nathaniel drinkwater señor and i compliment you on the gallantry of your defence i regret the loss of your ship he bowed formally and took his opponents offered sword he met the spaniards eyes and found in them more than resignation at the fortunes of war the deepset expression of anger and hatred seemed to burn out from the very soul of the man and drinkwater recognised in the lined and swarthy face the man who had bent over the santa monicas rail and whose order to fire drinkwater had preempted by a splitsecond don jorge meliton rubalcava the spanish commander broke off drinkwater had no idea whether rubalcava understood english from this bald announcement have i your word that you will not raise a revolt captain rubalcava drinkwater asked turning the swordhilt and offering it back to its owner rubalcava hesitated and swung to an accompanying officer whom drinkwater assumed to be his secondincommand but the other seemed only to be awaiting the completion of the formalities of surrender before declaring himself a greater man than rubalcava he was throwing papers overboard sir quilhampton volunteered a fellow of some consequence drinkwater was watching the two spaniards they seemed to be in some disagreement and rubalcavas anger was suppressed with difficulty his companion however turned to drinkwater with an unruffled expression and addressed him in strongly accented and broken english capitán don jorge he give you his parole and express for him the honour of you give his sword gracias the sentence was terminated by a low bow which drinkwater awkwardly returned you speak excellent english señor perhaps you could tell me whom i have the honour of addressing i don alejo joaquin arguello de salas aidedecamp to his excellence don josé henrique martin arguello de salas commandante for san francisco again there was an exchange of bows perhaps gentlemen drinkwater invited you would do me the honour of dining with me and my officers this evening gracias what is it you think to do capitán we can discuss that matter later gentlemen and now if you will excuse me i have much to attend to in seeing to the comfortable accommodation of your men there was a further mutual acknowledgement and drinkwater found himself favouring the simple directness of derricks mode of address above this extravagant overworked charade of elaborate bows he ordered the incredulous quaker to see the spanish officers quartered below and turned to mount to issue orders for the confinement of their seamen mount concealed his grin with difficulty the bobbing head and sweeping gestures of the quarterdeck had provoked an outburst of merriment along the deck as illconcealed as the hostility of captain rubalcava chapter six of wine and women march your allies they make for you good wine arguello raised his glass and held it so that the candles shone through the rich dark portuguese bual drinkwater had a few dozen bottles of the madeira his only really decent wine bought from the commander of an east indiaman which had been lying at the nore its broaching was the culmination of a satisfying meal the main course of which had consisted of the last pig from juan fernandez the unfortunate animal had lived on scraps in the manger forward of the ships breakwater and been slaughtered before they went into action gracias don alejo you have the same name as the commandante drinkwater phrased it as a question si e is my old brother the wine seemed to have relaxed don alejo though rubalcavas dark features continued to brood on his defeat despite its quality it had been a difficult meal and it was obvious that neither fraser nor quilhampton had enjoyed it out of courtesy they had drunk toasts to their respective sovereigns and to their own mutual gallantry there had been a stilted enquiry into the santa monicas losses that revealed some difference of opinion between the two spaniards and drinkwater was becoming suspicious about the spanish frigates task he was toying with various expedients as to how to pursue his enquiries when rubalcava spoke with a sudden low urgency to arguello don alejo nodded leaned forward to light a thin cigar from the candles and blew smoke at the deckhead capitán please i ask you question what you do with capitán rubalcava and his men eh for you too much prisoner a big risk si capitán a big risk of course don alejo i do not make war upon unfortunate and gallant opponents assure don rubalcava that i am at his service to deprive a brave officer of his ship is enough injury to inflict upon any man of spirit where does the good captain wish to be landed it took arguello a few moments to digest this noble speech moments in which fraser writhed in his chair and quilhampton fixed his commander with an odd penetrating stare filling the glass in front of him and hurrying the decanter round the table another low exchange took place between the two spanish officers it was clear that rubalcava had a point of view it was also clear that arguello disagreed with it his exchange with santa monicas captain again became sharp though once the naval officer had been suppressed and had relapsed into a tense and bitter silence arguello turned to his host with an air of unimpaired and courtly civility capitán rubalcava thank you for your much kind express of honour and receive it it is for me to ask you to take us to san francisco rubalcava drew in his breath in obvious opposition to this proposal and there was something tense about arguello now something eagerly expectant as though he wished drinkwater to answer enthusiastically in the affirmative drinkwater met his gaze as though reluctantly considering his request of course you will have truce i will myself see that you have water anything the gesture with the cigar was airily obliging drinkwater watched the heavy trail of blue smoke languidly lift in the hot air around the candles arguello was begging san francisco that was where arguello wished to go rubalcava had other ideas why and where had santa monica been bound when patrician intercepted her where were you from don alejo the philippines si capitán manila excellent for tobacco he held up the cigar and smoke dribbled from his mouth and where were you bound don jorge drinkwater flung the question directly at the spanish captain it was a phrase which any seaman would comprehend even in a foreign language and while drinkwater spoke with professional interest yet he sought to exploit the rift he had detected between the two men rubalcavas dark head came up and his eyes flashed at drinkwater with a ferocity that reminded drinkwater of an arab he had known once in the red sea rubalcava pronounced his destination with a kind of contempt as though he had thought no more of it before his capture than he did afterwards san francisco and the purpose of your voyage señor drinkwater thrust the question quickly he was entitled to ask it aviso drinkwater recalled the reported destruction of documents a despatch vessel with don alejo as your courier que don alejo rubalcavas voice tailed off as arguello broke in si capitán i was courier it is my duty i am for the commandante of san francisco his chief courier a hiss of dissimulation came from the subsiding rubalcava you speak excellent english don alejo please accept my compliments drinkwater coaxed i was prisoner some time taken off cadiz but i make exchange i live at waltham abbey how very interesting perhaps you wish to retire now gentlemen drinkwater rose and his silent officers sprang obediently to their feet mr quilhampton please be so good as to see our guests to their quarters before returning for your orders quilhampton hesitated perceived drinkwaters meaning and acknowledged the instruction as the spaniards withdrew from the cabin bowing drinkwater motioned fraser to stay they were about to leave the cabin when arguello halted and indicated the portrait of elizabeth replaced lovingly by tregembo on the reestablished bulkhead is this beautiful lady your wife captain yes drinkwater watched arguello address a remark to rubalcava and he stiffened sensing an insult but it was obvious that it referred to the disagreement that existed between the two men for rubalcavas expression bore no trace of that complicity of men sharing a coarse jest at anothers expense nevertheless drinkwater bridled at the odd reference to elizabeth don alejo he called sharply after the departing spaniard arguello turned in the doorway capitán it is not permitted to smoke beyond my quarters arguello shrugged dropped the stub of his cigar and with an elegantly booted toe ground the thing into the painted canvas on the deck fraser expelled a pentup breath as the door closed behind the prisoners another glass mr fraser youve earned it by your patience by god ive passed word to tregembo to sling you a hammock in here while arguello occupies your cabin mount has the business in hand yes sir mount wont let them move weve the dagoes battened well under hatches good we should be rid of them in drinkwater dragged a chart onto the table from the drawer beneath and cast a quick look at it three days if this wind holds there was a knock at the cabin door come in quilhampton rejoined them and drinkwater pushed the decanter towards him and reseated himself well gentlemen what did you make of that theres bad blood between them rubalcava doesnt want to go to san francisco thats clear enough good mr q i agree but he didnt want to go to san francisco before they fell in with us which argues a longer animosity than has been caused by our unexpected appearance in the pacific perhaps they just didna get along too well sir said fraser drinkwater nodded and refilled his glass but from his latitude and course we can suppose their landfall at least was san francisco or the coast thereabouts now it is one thing to assume that they were not friends but let us suppose you are a spanish officer bearing despatches from the authorities in the philippine islands where do you suppose you would be taking them to the principal naval base in the americas said fraser yes i think so and that is not san francisco that is acapulco for which he had a fair wind correct mr q now to continue the hypothesis suppose a british frigate appears out of the blue what would you do mr fraser if i was running yes as he was well i suppose i would see it as paramount to inform my superiors from what you told me earlier about the armament of ninetyone they seem to resent intruders in the pacific exactly and to do that you would lay a course for acapulco or panama but not san francisco a ruminative silence fell on the three officers which drinkwater broke so gentlemen we have don alejo arguello determined for some reason to get to san francisco at all costs rather than inform his principals at acapulco that a british frigate is loose in the pacific but sir though i dinna disagree with your argument his principal is at san francisco he said he was aide to the commandante there who is also his old brother they laughed at the spaniards awkward phrase well perhaps that argues some collusion who knows drinkwater yawned its all pure supposition he added dismissively i think its time we turned in i suggest you both keep loaded pistols handy ive no mind to lose the ship while i sleep it was an uneasy three days every morning and evening the spaniards were brought on deck in batches guarded by the marines and allowed to air themselves in the sunshine the santa monicas officers were herded in sullen little groups and quartered in odd spaces curiously the presence of the spanish prisoners improved the morale of patricians people the sight of others more unfortunate than themselves over whom they could enjoy a sense of triumph seemed a tonic to their spirits they did not worry overmuch about the loss of prizemoney asserting so drinkwater heard that since the proportional loss fell most heavily on the officers it was a greater hardship to them there might have been a mutinous component in this doginthemanger attitude but if there was it was accepted as being part of the black humour of jack and to be overlooked certainly it amused rather than alarmed drinkwater who as he expressed himself to fraser had been too much knocked about in the seaservice to do more than acknowledge the rough justice of the mens opinion the officers themselves had little time to dwell on their illluck for the presence of two hundred prisoners left them no time for brooding fraser and quilhampton shared drinkwaters cabin a circumstance which exasperated them all despite the curtain that tregembo had hung about the captains cotspace for what men most desire aboard ship is real privacy no one on board was sorry when the masthead lookout raised the cry of land and an hour later the blue trace of treeclad hills surmounted by a necklace of cloud lay on the eastern horizon drinkwater was pacing the long quarterdeck reluctant host to arguello who walked beside him maintaining a difficult conversation capitán rubalcava and myself we were much surprise to see your ship capitán drinkwater arguello had been at obvious pains to improve his fluency in english during his captivity you come to make war upon his most catholic majestys dominions you did not expect a british ship in the north pacific don alejo arguello shrugged the gesture though noncommittal was eloquently negative i was five hundred miles from any of his most catholic majestys dominions don alejo drinkwater stopped pacing and turned to the spaniard watching for his response again there came the shrug if i wished i might have devastated the trade of peru panama it was drinkwaters turn to shrug and wave his arm to the south as though the whole pacific seaboard of america lay at his mercy so capitán you come to the pacific you do not attack our trade ships you keep from the land so we do not know you have come i ask myself why eh i think you come to make bigger trouble i see capitán vancouver come i am with quadra when we made to leave nootka now you come back arguellos face was a mixture of dislike frustration and eager inquiry it seemed a good fiction to encourage nothing as positive came with his orders as usual governmental parsimony prevented the effort of colonising all he had to do was to prevent others from accomplishing it yet such a firmly implanted suspicion in spanish minds might work to his advantage he smiled tightlipped and read the gratification in don alejos eyes you may find capitán more difficult than you think perhaps drinkwater said dismissively but tell me about your voyage don alejo what was the purpose of your voyage he lowered his voice with the air of a conspirator and saw don alejos glance shift to the figure of rubalcava leaning disconsolately against the rail gazing ahead at the approaching shoreline i see that captain rubalcava does not wish to come to san francisco he caught the quick shifting glance of surprise that alejo shot him glaze with dissimulation then don alejo raised his hands in an urbane gesture of helplessness as the french say capitán cherchez la femme a woman ah i see between you i see the highflown theories of grand strategy propounded in his cabin a few nights earlier dissolved in the face of earthier causes don alejo looked puzzled and then laughed an unfeigned amusement that made drinkwater slightly uncomfortable and rubalcava look up from the rail no no capitán not between us capitán rubalcava does not want to come to san francisco because of the hija of don josé my brother hija si er i do not know how you say in english er a flash of intuition crossed drinkwaters mind he recalled the jibe don alejo had made at rubalcava indicating the portrait of elizabeth on his cabin bulkhead arguello had been taunting the spanish captain rubalcava was clearly being put in his place your brother has a daughter si daughter rubalcava wishes to marry the doña ana maria conchita it is impossible impossible the lady is already promised sí capitán and capitán rubalcava is not highborn drinkwater looked across the deck at the lounging spanish officer rubalcava has much hate in his heart much hate and you have destroyed his ship capitán in acapulco don alejo ended his explanation there the words tailing off into that expressive hispanic shrug of immense possibilities and drinkwater understood in acapulco were the means of rubalcavas revenge chapter seven san francisco march under her huge topsails patrician ghosted inwards between the two great headlands that guarded the entrance of san francisco bay half a league apart the high treeclad steeps of bonita and lobos points rose sheer from the sea on either side of the frigate as the onshore breeze wafted her eastwards the blue water chuckled beneath her round bow and trailed astern small seabirds dipped in her wake screaming and fighting for the minute creatures her passage disturbed a contrast to the rigidly ordered silence upon her decks at her foremasthead the british ship flew a white flag of truce but her guns were cleared for action all but the saluting battery shotted slow matches burned in the tubs in case the locks should fail and every man stood at his post tense for the slightest sign of hostility from the spanish ashore theyre buggers for redhot shot me lads look theres a battery below those trees see and theres two manowar brigs at anchor lick those bastards wi one hand up our arses jemmy shut your fuckin mouths the whisper of comment risen like the beginnings of a breeze in dried grass died away below under an even stricter watch the spanish prisoners were confined until the proposed terms of the truce were ratified by the spanish authorities and they could be released among them the silence was expectant for no one ashore could know they were mewed up on board and the authorities might suspect the bold approach of the british cruiser was no more than an elaborate ruse to decimate the merchant shipping loading the hides and tallow hemp and wheat upon which the fortunes of the settlement depended drinkwater stood at the starboard hance fraser and hill close beside him the three of them listened to the leadsman waiting to find the bottom and watching the spanish lieutenant deputed to pilot them into soundings and the sand of an anchorage as the frigate moved ponderously into the vast embrace of the bay señor lecuna the spanish lieutenant was the only one of the prisoners on deck both don alejo and rubalcava being confined below until the ship had exchanged courtesies with the fort and established the nature of her reception fog sir said hill sniffing the air like a hound it descended upon them like conjurors magic suddenly blotting out the surrounding landscape and instantly replacing the warm sunshine with a dripping saturated atmosphere that darkened the decks and chilled the skin pasarán siga el rumbo said lecuna siga el rumbo vigile el compás compass rumbo ah rumb line hold your course mr hill snapped drinkwater in sudden comprehension si sí hold course lecuna nodded aye aye sir for ten long minutes patrician held on through the fog her ropes dripping and the condensation collecting upon the guns look to your primings warned fraser and prudent guncaptains turned to the matchtubs and whirled or blew on the sputtering saltpetre coils above them the sun reappeared swirling through the nacreous vapour caiga a estribor er starboard capitán starboard helm mr hill if you please amplified drinkwater watching lecunas hand the leadsman called out that he had found the bottom shoaling fast as patrician crept into the anchorage si bueno arrie las escandalosas he pointed aloft cut his hands outwards in the universal gesture of completion and then waved them downwards topsl halliards mr fraser stand by forrard on the focsle the grey shapes of the carpenters party stood ready to let the anchor go the seabed had levelled out and drinkwater wondered how close lecuna would anchor them to the guns of the fort and then with the same magical effect and as suddenly as it had come the fog lifted rolling away to shroud the great northern bight of the bay produced by some local anomaly of temperature variation patrician found herself within the entrance to the southern arm of the huge inlet a group of islands were visible one a colony to the extraordinary pelican while the bay forked reaching deep inland to the north and the south san francisco lay on the slopes and hills of the southern headland point lobos to starboard less than longcannon shot away rose the first of its green bluffs a spur of that point lobos surmounted by the white walls of the commandantes residence and the colours of castile beneath the languidly flaunting red and gold the ramparts of a fort beetled upon her muzzles of heavy artillery trained on her decks from their embrasures patrician was turning as she emerged from the fogbank her topsails bellying aback against their tops slowing the ship and imparting a sluggish sternway to her as she gathered way astern the anchor was let go the topsails lowered and the hands piped aloft to stow them with the cable running through the hawse the saluting battery opened fire patrician brought up to her anchor as the last echoes of the final gunshot echoed round the bay putting off from a small boat jetty beneath the embrasures of the fort was a smart barge decorated with scarlet and gold fancywork at her stern flew a miniature spanish ensign and at her bow stood an officer with a white flag drinkwater closed his glass with a snap and nodded his thanks to lieutenant lecuna pass word to bring up don alejo and captain rubalcava the next hour was going to be difficult it had long been a contention of drinkwaters that contact with the shore was the bane of a seaofficers professional life and today had offered him no reason to change his mind now as he stood on the wide paved terrace of the commandantes residence in the company of midshipman frey awaiting the summons to meet the governor he tried to relax below them the bluff was already casting its shadow across the southern arm of san francisco bay the last rays of the sun disappearing over the pacific behind him beyond the entrance to the harbour skeins of brown and white pelicans flew in to roost brilliantly lit for the last of the sunshine illuminated the harbour in a wide swathe from the entrance he watched the ships in the anchorage preparing for the ceremony of sunset paying particular attention to his own patrician and the pair of spanish brigsofwar below him further away some dozen merchantmen lay off the town their lower yards cockbilled as they worked cargo out of lighters alongside drinkwater could see the stars and stripes of the united states and the diagonal cross of russian colours but the big black russian lineofbattleship he had seen off cape horn was not in evidence he cursed his overanxiety aware that he had been toomuch worked upon by the cares of the day and what a day it had been a day of constant arguments first the spanish officer who had boarded them on arrival had argued with drinkwater over his blatant disregard for spanish sovereignty by entering the port with his guns run out demanding to know in the name of king carlos what the devil he was doing in spanish waters drinkwater had countered these intemperate demands and expostulations by coolly awaiting the arrival of don alejo arguello and captain rubalcava captain de soto the boarding officer having made formal apologies for the peremptory mode of his address at the appearance of these gentlemen then fell to arguing with them insisting that he was acting on the commandantes strictest instructions and exploding with rage at the news that the santa monica had been destroyed de sotos anger released a storm of fury from rubalcava which was incomprehensible to the watching britons but which drained the colour from de sotos face and sent his right hand flying to his swordhilt don alejos temporising interruption calmed things down but it was clear that rubalcava was a deeply embittered man and the source of his disaffection stemmed from more than a matrimonial disappointment there was an air of alienation about rubalcava that seemed to drinkwaters perceptive eye to go beyond the odium associated with the loss of a ship perhaps it was just the fruit of an active rivalry between officers on a colonial station perhaps de soto expected command of the santa monica or had always rated himself higher than rubalcava perhaps drinkwater thought his mind running wild as the two spaniards postured before the calming influence of don alejo it was de soto who had won the affection and hand of the commandantes daughter he gave up the vain speculation with the recollection that don alejo had indicated rubalcava was of low birth how much that meant in the spanish colonies drinkwater could only guess he had heard that the results of miscegenation were less frowned upon by the passionate spaniards than the british in india and that it was possible for able halfcastes to rise in government service perhaps rubalcava was one such man though in his appearance he seemed to fit the quixotic image of the hispanic man of action when this purely domestic contention had finally died down drinkwater had found himself drawn into further argument following repudiation of his terms the wood and water promised by don alejo were not available said de soto upon that the commandante don josé henrique martin arguello de salas was adamant the lie of the land persuaded drinkwater that both were readily available elsewhere except that the point had become a matter of honour de sotos insistence compromised don alejo despite the mandate of the commandante and drinkwater sensed the spanish hidalgos loss of face before his juniors he decided to intervene don alejo he interrupted i am willing to forgo the wood and water don alejos face brightened capitán you are a man of honour the indispensable formula of bow and counterbow threatened to reassert itself and drinkwater cut it short all i ask don alejo is a written undertaking that captain rubalcava his officers and the seamen taken out of his most catholic majestys ship santa monica will not bear arms against the forces and possessions of his britannic majesty for the duration of the present war que the vehemence of rubalcavas interjection suggested he understood the gist of drinkwaters demand rubalcava had been watching drinkwater closely knowing him for a wily opponent and now asked what the heretic commander demanded under the very guns of spain otherwise went on drinkwater unperturbed we will have to discuss the terms of ransom you are my prisoners don alejo i have treated you as men of honour after you struck your countrys colours in the face of superior force you bear your swords and i offer you your freedom all i ask is your parole not to serve again in the present war it is nothing he shrugged aware that the gesture was catching and feigned to dismiss further argument nevertheless it broke out with renewed violence but in spanish and detached from drinkwater in the end don alejo agreed but it was clear that rubalcava did not intend to adhere to whatever the others committed him de soto had departed to confer with the commandante and the prisoners had resigned themselves to wait drinkwater had not agreed to don alejos accompanying de soto the muzzles of those spanish guns were too damned close de soto returned an hour later he was much changed an affable effusive and courtly man who requested the honour of captain drinkwaters presence at the commandantes table that evening an hour later they had begun to disembark the prisoners they were still landing them as drinkwater and frey looked down into the dark cusp of the bay where like a giant waterbeetle patricians longboat made its way to the quays of the town you are spared that tedious task mr frey he nodded down at the labouring boat yes sir spruce in his new coat its white collar patches bright in the twilight frey grinned back from the unaccustomed throttling of his formal stock he had heard something about meeting a lady tonight the occupants of the gunroom thought a great deal about meeting ladies drinkwater moved his right shoulder beneath the heavy material of his own fulldress coat glad of its weight in the evening chill a touch of mist trailed across the dark foliage of the trees below them and the sudden concussion of the sunset gun made him start it was echoed smartly by patrician and the two brigs as their colours fluttered down night fell on the great bay the lights of the ships twinkling across the smooth water two more beetles crept out from patricians side and began to circle her darkening bulk languidly and that duty too mr frey drinkwater nodded and both watched the two cutters begin to row the nights guard round and round the frigate the wait was beginning to tell on drinkwaters patience and he sighed impatiently he was tired exhausted by three days of vigilance and todays largely irrelevant exertions he had wanted only to disencumber himself of the damned prisoners not to fence endless words to be caught up in the parishpump politics of a colonial outpost he detested such futile activities longed for the fresh air of the open sea he straightened his back eased his shoulder and drew in a long breath of the damp aromatic evening air ah capitán please forgive his excellency will receive you don alejo joaquin arguello waved his arm for drinkwater and frey to follow lieutenant james quilhampton nodded a curt farewell to lieutenant cesar lecuna of the santa monica upon these two officers had fallen the duty of cooperation during the landing of the prisoners he looked briefly at the signed receipt adios vaya con dios lecuna turned to his own men adelante quilhampton turned to walk back along the quay to the waiting longboat almost bumping into midshipman belchambers who ran up at full tilt sir sir the men are running what god damn why didnt you stop em quilhampton clapped a hand to his hat and began to run it was the hour of corso the promenade the draggletailed society of san francisco was airing its social pretensions amid such a crowd many of whom gathered to hiss and barrack the english sailors he knew his seamen would melt like snow on a hearthstone we couldnt stop em sir not without firing into this crowd no of course not quilhampton replied sourly to the marine corporal whose three men looked down sheepishly the spaniards had not liked the presence of the armed marines on their soil and quilhampton had been obliged to admit they were appointed to the boats for his own protection and to prevent his men deserting when that news had been communicated to captain rubalcava it had brought the first smile to the spanish commanders face doubtless a few dollars had been spread amongst the boats crew now only four men remained on board studying the bottom boards under quilhamptons withering glare did these lubbers try and run too he asked and the question went unanswered behind him he felt a stir of hostility among the crowd of idlers some unfriendly shouts followed get in the boat he snapped at the marines and take an oar each it was going to be a damnably long pull back to the ship with so few oarsmen but soon the night would shroud their humiliation he followed belchambers and the marines into the longboat took his place aft and tucked the tiller underneath his arm toss oars bear off forrard the crowd surged to the edge of the quay abuse rising like a wave behind them someone spat provoking a burst of expectoration and fistshaking a stone plopped alongside a gobbet of spittle struck quilhamptons neck pull you buggers put your bloody backs into it the heavy boat moved with ponderous slowness quilhampton endured further humiliation but dared not turn and face his tormentors pull as he sat hunched and swearing over the tiller his mind ranged over the wisdom of remaining in the harbour an hour longer it had seemed to him as they had glided into the bay that the patricians presence within the dark embrace of those great headlands touched off some primitive suspicion in his mind intuition told him that despite her massed cannon despite her state of readiness and the precautionary guardboats pulling round the ship she lay in mortal danger he could not explain this theory the terms of the truce seemed watertight and it was unlikely that the spanish authorities would break their word but these new desertions combined with his suspicion of the connivance of rubalcava triggered off his nervous conviction that the ship was illfated and he doomed with it it was a far more serious matter than the desertion of the two lovers at masafuera and he had yet to explain it to captain drinkwater drinkwater exchanged bows with the commandante don josé henrique martin arguello de salas his excellency was a tall heavily handsome man with a thickset figure that was rapidly running to seed in contrast to his brother he seemed of a more indolent character like don alejo he spoke a little english and he had a formally easy manner which in the circumstances put drinkwater on his guard he disliked being manipulated and don josé seemed an expert in the matter ah capitán don alejo speak of his misfortune to meet you you are come to make trouble for us no i have come to do my duty your excellency and what is your duty capitán a servant appeared bearing a tray of glasses drinkwater took one and sipped from it before replying meeting the commandantes inquisitorial stare with hts own a most excellent sherry señor i command a cruiser your excellency he said slowly feigning a greater interest in the wine it is the duty of a cruiser to wreck the enemys trade we ave ships of other nations ere in san francisco you have ships of nations with whom great britain is at war excellency nations who until recently were our allies and received payments from our treasury you are a man of honour your excellency and understand such treachery is intolerable the russian ships don josé asked frowning clearly having difficulty with drinkwaters english that is correct yes and the ships of the united states capitán would you fire on the flag of the united states great britain is not at war with the united states excellency drinkwater said noting the quick glance between don josé and his brother but of course he added we should find it necessary to search even neutral vessels for contraband cargoes he smiled as courteously as he could in the knowledge that they were contemplating such a ruse i would not like to imagine my reactions if i discovered that for example a spanish ship was sailing under false american colours i am sure you take my meaning the cloud hanging over don josés brow lifted as don alejo hissed a few words of explanation at his elder brother don josé nodded and met drinkwaters smile with one of equal falsity drinkwater looked about him is captain rubalcava to join us this evening your excellency drinkwater asked he was a gallant enemy no put in don alejo sharply don jorge will not be joining us further enquiry or explanation was cut short by the majordomos announcement the gentlemen turned towards a heavy door and drinkwater and frey exchanged glances then imitated the spaniards low bows they were aware of the rustle of skirts and the subtle waft of perfume filling the candlelit room as he straightened up drinkwater heard the faint rasp of sharply indrawn breath from midshipman frey his face was flushed with a sudden wave of longsuppressed concupiscence and drinkwater smiled for the object of his sudden lust was overwhelmingly beautiful may i present the lady doña ana maria conchita don alejo recited the young womans names and titles but drinkwater distilled the information that she was his niece and don josés daughter whilst the long absence from the society of women would have made memorable an hour spent in the company of any young woman with good teeth and a bosom doña ana marias presence promised an evening of pleasing enchantment tall like her father she wore the wide skirt and tight bodice of spanish fashion her carriage was regal and her bare shoulders rose above the swirl of a shawl which was drawn together below her breasts about her neck a necklace of chinese jade reflected the candlelight rising and falling with her breathing but there was far more to her beauty than mere sexual allure for her face was as intelligent as it was lovely her eyes were of such an umbral brown that they appeared bronze in the light from the candles her flawless cream skin was unpowdered and her lips were soft wide and red without the artifice of carmine above her straight nose and wide forehead long black hair was oiled like jet drawn back in the severe mode of her class and beneath the sweptback waves at the side of her head jade earrings depended from the lobes of her ears suddenly rubalcavas embitterment made shattering sense drinkwater relinquished her hand and turned to his companion señorita i have the honour to present mr midshipman frey it was clear that frey was devastated by the lady fighting an overwhelming desire fuelled by the gross appetites of the starved and ready to die for her in the next moment if she had asked it of him his hand shook as he bent over hers and he straightened up with an idiot look of rapture she could not fail to be aware of the turmoil she was causing and drinkwater turned to don josé both he and don alejo were clearly studying the effect doña ana maria was having on the two british officers was there something premeditated about this attention my uncle she said in an english that contained an elusively familiar inflection tells me you have come to san francisco with many cannon capitán she had turned those wonderful eyes on him again i have come on an act of humanity señorita to repatriate the gallant captain don jorge rubalcava and his men whom the fortune of war made my prisoners there was no trace of reaction to the name of her former suitor the tiny reactive muscles about the eyes that could reveal the quickening impulses of the brain remained unmoved presumably rubalcava meant nothing to her you speak excellent english señorita please accept my compliments thank you capitán i learn it from my duenna doña helena she indicated an elderly woman who wore a mantilla whom drinkwater had taken for doña ana marias mother and the commandantes wife if his senses had not been so mesmerised he would have recognised the folly of such a supposition it was inconceivable that he should have entertained it even for an instant doña helena stared at him from a wizened face with a pair of fiercely blue eyes your servant maam drinkwater bowed aware of the ferocity of her scrutiny aye honoured ahm sure captain there was venom in the reply a sharp hatred bred in the bone and born of popish origins and the mystery of doña anas acquired accent was cleared up in her native scotland doña helena would have been called mistress helen though it was uncertain when she had last seen her native land only the sombre figure of the priest remained to be introduced he had come in with the women an emaciated young franciscan in a heavy wool habit his crucifix and rosary chinked gently as he moved and his presence adumbrated the room there was clearly no doña josé the commandante it seemed was a widower the franciscans introduction as fra alfonso terminated the preprandial formalities and drinkwater found himself leading the beautiful doña ana maria in to dinner drinkwater willingly surrendered to the charms of the young woman during the meal as he knew he was intended to do his host don josé was on his left and seemed content to allow his daughter to practise her nearfluent english upon the british captain there were a few initial questions about drinkwaters career which he avoided exploiting paying his host the compliment of reporting on the gallant conduct of the spanish fleet in the momentous action off cap trafalgar during which he had been a prisoner aboard the french flagship bucentaure see you speak with the marquis de solana capitán at cadiz yes your excellency i was received by him several times concerning the matter of british prizecrews cast up on the coast after the great gale that followed the battle the meal passed delightfully though midshipman frey had a less happy time of it seated next to the scottish companion doña helena yet he would not have traded his place for all the gold in eldorado for he could not take his eyes off the beautiful doña ana maria opposite aware of freys sheeps eyes drinkwater began to feel sorry for the young woman realising she was a victim of her own extraordinary beauty it was not difficult to see how rubalcavas proud spirit had been so enslaved something of an even darker alchemy was brewing in the unholy eyes of the silent franciscan you have children capitán the timbre of her voice was low and mellifluous yes señorita i have two a son and a daughter ahhh that is they say the choice of kings he watched her face as she added i i would like children it was an impropriety an intimacy a mark of the isolation her beauty caused her made in a low voice to a complete stranger i understand you are to be married soon señorita he replied quietly yes she smiled and he sensed her excitement and the strength of her love for rubalcavas rival which was prompting these confidences confidences that were earning glances of disapproval from her duenna opposite as soon as nicolai arrives she ran on her dark eyes glowing he commands a great ship like yourself capitán nicolai drinkwater was suddenly alert and cast a quick glance to his left where don josé seemed to be speaking in a low voice to don alejo aye capn nicolai rezanov will be here soon tae clip your wings doña helenas blue eyes were chips of ice chilled by ancient enmities her outburst attracted the attention of the arguellos and turned them from their private conclave in the sudden silence drinkwater exploited the hiatus rezanov an unusual name for a spanish officer don josés face was a mask don alejo made a small gesture to a waiting footman the door was flung open and de soto marched into the room and bent to don josés ear the commandante looked sharply at drinkwater diablo he muttered then nodded and as de soto straightened up the commandante said capitán there has been much trouble in the town some men from your ship they run away there is a mêlée and a woman is killed chapter eight council of war march how many in the light from the candle that stood on the cabin table captain drinkwaters face was thrown into dramatic relief his head was cocked slightly revealing the damaged muscles of his wrecked shoulder and the single flame emphasised the intensity of his eyes he was pale with fury eight sir quilhampton had never seen drinkwater so angry and felt like a chastened midshipman beside him fraser fidgeted nervously eight eight gods bones man you had marines in that damned boat marines with bayonets for gods sake and you let eight men run yes sir quilhampton mumbled unhappily and do you know what they have done do you know what your eight precious libertyloving english jacks have done sir no sir they swilled aguardiente and ran wild in a whorehouse the upshot of their desertion is that they have been accused of causing the death of a woman and and drinkwater brought his clenched fist down on the tabletop so that the candle flame guttered they have entirely compromised me tied me hand and fist god damn them sir quilhampton frowned not understanding drinkwater let out a long breath good god james can you offer me nothing in extenuation only that there were many people on the quay and to shoot would have endangered the local people mr quilhampton was much abused by the crowds sir put in fraser much spat upon and the like drinkwater fell silent and then he asked what became of rubalcava he left in the first boat after you and frey had gone ashore sir drinkwater shook his head then moved round the table and lifted three glasses from the fiddles atop the locker pass that decanter mr fraser thank you he poured the bual into the glasses and handed each of the two officers a glass whats it like on deck still foggy sir and dead calm you can hear the guardboats no fear of a surprise mylchrists up there now reckons his fevers sharpened all his instincts replied fraser who had not long come below drinkwater grunted weve an hour or two no more well your health there was a pause and then drinkwater looked at quilhampton ease your mind james tis i who am the greater fool you sir yes i have played right into their damned hands i suspected something but could not lay it by the tail damned if i can now but ill wager the whores death was contrived contrived im sorry i dont follow it had come to him in his enforced idleness sitting in his barge as the oarsmen brought him back to the ship from the commandantes boat jetty below the battery there had been that vague feeling of something passing between the arguello brothers that sensation of their using doña ana to distract him whether she was a party to this he did not know but it seemed obvious that the news of the brawl had been engineered and it came to him in the boat that those eight seamen had been lured away on promises of safety promiscuous sex and money was there much contact between the people and the spaniards while they were here he asked flatly no sir said fraser no more than one would expect with them cooped up on board mount mentioned he caught two seamen and a marine bartering for tobacco quilhampton added did he indeed but there is nothing particularly significant in that sir said fraser except that ample opportunity existed for a sum of money to pass to disaffected men drinkwater said and god knows it takes little enough to turn the heads of these poor devils a gold dollar the promise of a whore and a drink and a pass through the town conviction was forming in his mind and theyre in an ugly mood sir simmering below the surface they fought well enough sir but the smell of land aye and women growled fraser and drinkwater felt guilt fuelling his anger and don alejo had gold sir a lot of gold why dyou say that mr q he was concealing something on himself when he was compelled to abandon the santa monica i thought it was a purse at the time then later when he was quartered in my cabin i went there by mistake came below and without thinking proceeded directly to my cabin i opened the door before i realised my stupidity don alejo was sitting smoking one of those damned cigars he was halfundressed lounging in my chair and on the cot lay his sword some papers and a leather purse the same one i had seen aboard the santa monica it was bulging sir to the extent of revealing its contents gold sir dollars or pistoles or something very like no sir gold nuggets the treasures of the manila galleon eh i think perhaps only a little a private speculation like the nabobs of the east india company hm how did he take the intrusion drinkwater asked he was not pleased i told him the stink of his cigar had attracted my attention and that smoking was forbidden below decks you should daydream more often of mistress macewan if it leads you into such adventures mr q very well then it only serves to confirm my suspicions that some of the men were suborned more may be preparing to desert at the first opportunity we shall have to proceed warily sir ahd be obliged fraser frowned yes mr fraser ill explain drinkwater motioned them to sit he was past mere tiredness the events of the last hours had stimulated him and his active brain was whirling with the problems that suddenly beset him he passed his hands over his face seeking a place to begin his explanation well gentlemen the main purpose of our cruise is to dislodge any attempt by the russians to establish territorial claims northward of the spanish domain of nueva espana since the tsar repudiated his alliance with us last summer it is believed that it is the intention of the russian court to settle southwards from alaska some reports brought into canada by voyageurs indicated russian incursions up the colombia river further north from here its all very vague but as welcome to us as the spanish claim to nootka sound was although they have a furtrading depot at sitka in alaska the tenuous claims of captain vancouver lie between sitka and here from whence if the evidence in the bay is anything to go by the russians obtain many necessary supplies i counted seven russian vessels in the anchorage sir a schooner three brigs a barque and a ship sir yes i saw them last night they will be expected on the alaskan coast soon and now we have arrived just at the wrong moment for them not only have we advertised our presence but we have destroyed one unit of the spanish squadron that might have protected their trade but its russian trade sir i mean are the dons that interested in protecting it asked fraser to whom the matter was still confused i presume they would not want it destroyed drinkwater replied but the russians sir if they are seeking territory will become a direct threat to the spaniards competing for the same length of coast fraser frowned yes eventually they might once our claims of land and our failure to maintain them are dealt with but for the meantime they are allies of expedience besides this could become a matter of national prestige i imagine the dons would like their revenge for the loss of nootka sound they only capitulated before because they lost the french monarchy as a support now they have tsar alexander i believe they are about to settle the coast between them with what force the destruction of the santa monica does not draw all their teeth mr fraser their main pacific base is at acapulco they will have ships at panama and from what i heard tonight there is a garrison at monterey i learnt something else tonight gentlemen and this is the reason why we have been compromised the murder if indeed there has been a murder is a prevarication a means to delay us the commandatore has agreed to meet me to discuss the return of our men after the murderer has been tried he has made protestations of not wishing to impugn the honour of our flag after our courtesy to our prisoners in the same breath he is talking of our breaking the terms of the truce of referring to monterey for instructions in short any damned obstruction that will delay us while we are enmeshed in some specious diplomatic tangle but sir they have no force to keep us here expostulated fraser we can tow out from their guns in a couple of hours and those toy brigs wouldnt knock the marines shakoes off you are correct in your specific but not your diagnosis we can tow out mr fraser but we may well meet a lineofbattleship coming in we can outmanoeuvre a spanish battleship sir said fraser almost flippantly she will be russian mr fraser we saw her off cape horn and by the certainty with which our friends ashore are behaving i believe her arrival imminent do we tow out sir quilhampton asked that inchoate sense of foreboding closing round him again he had found its first physical manifestation at masafuera and the second had dotted him with the spittle of hostile spaniards halfcastes and indians now every moment of delay increased its intensity yes make your preparations let us slip our cable and use the fog to make a virtue of necessity in an hour then they left him scuttling out to pass word to the watch and turn out those sleeping below and at the guns they would all be raggednerved and foultempered by the time they had laboured at the oars of the boats and dragged patricians inert mass clear of the bay he would have to be patient with them and watch for outbursts of disaffection in the meantime he would have to wait he could not sleep although he was haggard with exhaustion an hours sleep would make him feel worse than none at all he poured the last of the bual into his glass and went on an impulse to his seachest rummaging in the bottom he drew out a frayed roll of canvas spreading it on the table he looked down at it it was the portrait of a woman painted long ago by the french republican artist jacques louis david in addition to the frayed edges and cracked paintwork little circles of mould were forming on the canvas perverting the purity of the colours and there were three holes where the tines of a fork had once pierced it hortense santhonax stared back at him from cool grey eyes beneath the studied negligence of her pearlwound and piled auburn hair her lovely face held a hint of a smile he remembered her years ago almost as long ago as the spanish outrage at nootka sound before she married edouard santhonax and espoused the bonapartist cause she had been a frightened emigree then hortense de montholon running from the vengeful howl of the pursuing mob to be rescued by an impoverished masters mate named nathaniel drinkwater see a kings cutter he had been half in love with her then before she turned her coat and married his enemy he had killed edouard santhonax less than a year previously killed him to preserve the secret he had brought out of russia he had widowed her in the line of duty or had he and why did he stare at her portrait now the bare shoulders and the soft breasts were barely concealed by the wisp of gauze artfully placed by the skilled hand of a seductress she was already rumoured to be the mistress of talleyrand a fading beauty he supposed it made no sense to be subject to so compelling an urge as had driven him to remove her portrait from the obscurity of his seachest except that she was providence an ikon presentient as his dream and an impulse to be obeyed in those rare moments of hiatus when his tired mind was in revolt an ikon an apt simile he was unable to shake off that old superstition of his destiny she had become the embodiment of the spirit of france inhabiting the subconscious recesses of his imagination and marrying the man whose fate had become inextricably bound up with his own the dice had fallen his way last it had not always been thus as his wrecked shoulder testified but he was not yet free of santhonaxs ghost the secret from russia still haunted him even here in the pacific witchcraft he muttered and let the margin of the canvas go it coiled itself like a spring and he looked up to see the faithful pale oval of elizabeths portrait staring at him from its frame witchcraft he repeated and hiding the canvas again he drew on his cloak and went on deck in some strange way he felt relieved by the power the portrait of hortense possessed there was a reassuring quality of normality about it a familiar neurosis he had not been too much overcome by the beauty of ana maria chapter nine the leak april if you wish to say something tregembo for gods sake say it and stop fiddling with those damned pistols drinkwater snapped irritably mullenders duster and tregembos fidgeting had driven him on deck where a sleeting rain had turned him below again patrician bucked to the onset of the rainbearing squall and gusts of cold damp air rattled in through the sashes of the stern windows youll be needing em fore long zur if i aint mistaken tregembo growled the pistols would to god i needed em instanter that damned convoy should have appeared by now i didnt mean for that zur eh drinkwater frowned looking at his coxswain with sudden attention what the devil did you mean then tregembo laid the pistol down in its box and waited until mullender had gone into the pantry his old face lined and scarred as it was bore every indication of concern zur the door to the tiny pantry stood open behind him drinkwater crossed the cabin and closed it well the people zur you know theyre disaffected tis common enough upon a long commission an they mean no harm to you zur but spit it out tregembo im in no mood for puzzlements for gods sake tregembo those men deserted drinkwater sat and stared gloomily at the old cornishman there are stories of women zur the boats crews saw women ashore an there are grog shops aplenty those merchantseamen were three sheets to the wind theym saying they be powerful reasons for making a man run zur drinkwater nodded i know all this tregembo why tell me now because it wont be single men zur next time itll be a boats crew zur an the word as i hear it is to hell with the officers there was a peremptory knock at the cabin door instantly tregembo turned away picked up the pistol case shut it and slid it into its stowage in the locker come it was fraser he was followed by the elderly mr marsden a wizened and wrinkled man skirted with a leather apron which hid bandy legs but revealed a powerful torso muscular arms and hands of immense size the sudden irruption of the first lieutenant and the carpenter into drinkwaters cabin indicated something serious had happened begging your pardon sir but mr marsden has just made an urgent report to me concerning water in the wells drinkwater looked sharply at the carpenter well mr marsden three feet sir in two hours and making fast when were the wells last pumped at the change of the watch yes sir an nothink much in em bar what youd expect something adrift below then marsden nodded seems likely sir any idea what no sir no shot holes not that i can see sir sides we engaged that spaniard wi the larboard broadside aye and now were on the larboard tack mr fraser put the ship about on the instant mr marsden pump the wells dry lets see if the other tack makes any difference he rose perversely relieved in the need for action potentially disastrous though the news was for the ship suddenly to make so much water could be due to any one of a hundred reasons none of them easy to determine let alone overcome come gentlemen let us be about our business grabbing hat and cloak drinkwater hustled fraser and the carpenter out of his cabin and followed them on deck alone in the cabin tregembo watched the surge of the smooth wake as it rose bubbling green from patricians transom a longtailed bosunbird slid across his field of view quartering the wake for prey dont you forget what i told ee he muttered after drinkwater on deck the watch were running to their stations to tack ship drinkwater took no part in the manoeuvre instead he fished in the tailpocket of his coat for his glass then levelled it to the eastward banks of slatecoloured clouds rolled to leeward dragging dull curtains of rain behind them blotting out sections of the faint blue line of the coastal mountains of california from one such shroud the low line of punta de los reyes was emerging patrician had spent nine days keeping station off the point round which any convoy from san francisco must pass on its way to the alaskan settlements of the tsar they had kept well to seaward of the long low arm of sanddunes and marram grass lurking out of sight to avoid either of those two manofwar brigs that might be sent to see if the coast was clear even allowing a week for the tardiest merchant ship to complete her lading it would be reasonable drinkwater argued to himself for them to have intercepted some trading vessels moving north by now patrician jibbed up into the wind and the foreyards were swung on the word of command unless drinkwater mused those merchantmen were waiting for something more puissant than a pair of brigs something like a russian lineofbattleship not for the first time drinkwater cursed the brevity of his aptlystyled briefing from the admiralty again he felt that sense of abandonment by lord dungarth the very man from whom he would have expected the most comprehensive elucidation of the state of affairs in the pacific he knew his orders originated from british spies in the russian service agents whose access to the most secret intentions of the tsar had been preserved at a prodigious cost as drinkwater had good reason to know supposing he reasoned he had been utterly mistaken in that glimpse of another manofwar off cape horn suppose that brief spectral image had magnified itself in his imagination and the vessel had been at worst a spaniard he knew that the russianamerican company under whose auspices russian ships traded down the coast from alaska had armed vessels at their disposal he knew too that at least one frigate had been built on the pacific coast of north america for the purpose of reinforcing russian claims upon the shores of what drake cook and now the admiralty were pleased to call new albion patrician forged ahead gathering increasing way on the new tack the hands were busy coiling the braces on the pins and on the focsle the weather foretack was hauled down to the bowing bumpkin shafts of sunlight fanned down through the clouds dappling the surface of the sea with brilliant patches of dancing water off on the quarter a school of dolphins abandoned the chase of a shoal of bonito and gambolled in their tumbling wake neither the brightening weather nor the appearance of the cetaceans lightened drinkwaters gloom all his ponderous considerations were of little consequence now marsdens report postponed them indefinitely the leak and its cause superseded all other matters and it did not help his temper to realise that the trap he had baited by towing out of san francisco bay would now be useless his nearest dockyard was in the west indies with the horn to double to get there he had only one course of action open to him hobsons choice of a careenage well as marsden came aft drinkwater stopped at the after end of the starboard gangway his cloak flapping round him in the wind his hands clasped behind his back the carpenters face was still clouded by concern shes still makin water sir perhaps a little less but tis bad enough sir damn very well mr marsden very well ill be below myself shortly mr fraser aye sir steer eastnoreast and fetch me the coast directly below the waterline the hull was a vast stygian cavern of noise he followed marsden and his two mates with their lanterns guttering in the stale mephitic air trying to shut out the natural noises of the creaking and groaning space to hear those unnatural sounds the better it was a hopeless task one that he was less qualified than marsden to execute yet one which demanded his attention how far below the waterline was this leak any remedial action he took depended upon some rough location to careen patrician properly would render her utterly defenceless should she be taken by surprise for all her guns and stores would have to come out of her and be safely landed drinkwater had himself led an attack on a french frigate in such a supine state and carried her safely out to sea from her bolthole on the red sea coast of arabia to be served himself in similar fashion dishedup to an enemy without the chance of defending himself sent worms of apprehension crawling about his belly but he had to know the worst and he stumbled along the carpenters walk a narrow space maintained free of stores just inside the ships skin by which access was provided to plug shotholes and maintain the watertight integrity of the ship mind sir this grating be a bit loose yes thank you in the yellow pools of lamplight he could see the ships inner skin discoloured with the traces of mould the thick air was heavy with the multiple smells of this great warehouse of the cruisers wants here powder and shot were stored in magazines and lockers locked storerooms housed spirits and flour fish and dried peas tier upon tier of barrels stowed bung up and bilgefree held the potable sweetwater casks of dubious age contained the saltpork and cheese provided by a munificent victualling board the oats and dried fruit the woodstore and oilroom all fitted below the waterline above abaft or forward of the hold proper the platformed section of the orlop along which they worked their way showed no ingress of water amid the creaks and groans of the ships timbers the slosh of bilgewater and the hiss of the sea beyond the inner and outer wales and the massive futtocks they strained their ears for sound of a roar a spurt even a trickle of incoming water but all they could make out above the working of the ship was the squeal of disturbed rats drinkwater escaped to the upper deck scanning the horizon and again finding the sea bereft of any sign of a ship a mile to leeward a whale fluked slapping the water with its gigantic tail before sliding into the depths of the ocean somehow that brief appearance of leviathan only served to emphasise the emptiness of the scene slowly patrician approached the coast the yellow line of punta de los reyes spread across the horizon ahead the clouds hanging over the coastal mountains fused into mist and falling rain drinkwater crossed the deck to where fraser his odd sandy features wearing a comic expression that bespoke his anxiety waited to hear what drinkwater had to say with as much patience as he could muster hae ye any luck sir little enough mr fraser no i couldna find anything either i thought it might be the hoodends drinkwater considered the suggestion the hoodends were where the butt ends of the strakes or planks met the timbering of the stem here the constant working of the sea round the bow could disturb the fastenings and loosen the planks leaking about the stem was very difficult to determine at sea and was increased by the ship continuing to make headway thats an informed guess mr fraser whatever the cause we cannot ignore the matter i intend to get the ship into sheltered water and lighten her we may have to careen which will mean the devil of a lot of labour whatever expedient we are driven to well require a boat guard if there is a russian battleship in the offing we had better lie low god help us if we are caught amen to that sir for heavens sake itll be like being caught in a whorehouse on judgement day begging your pardon mr henderson i appreciate the strength of your metaphor mr mylchrist and deduce therefrom that we can expect an exceedingly great wrath to descend upon us should the event come to pass well we cant ignore the matter three feet in the well aint a lot but it came in damned quick and i think something fell out a trenail perhaps said quilhampton leaning on the wardroom table his head in his hands thats the only logical explanation dyou think were up against logic james what the hell else dyou think were up against quilhampton jerked up mylchrist shrugged i didnt get my wound from an enemy no no more you did mylchrists gloomy implication chimed in uncannily with quilhamptons superstitious foreboding a nail from the hull another in our bloody coffins oh for gods sake johnnie gentlemen perhaps a prayer is apt while we wait for the first lieutenant what are you going to pray for mr henderson asked mylchrist sourly three hundred pairs of feet enabled to walk upon the water mr mylchrist i am outraged if god abandons us in our extremity your blasphemy will give him cause enough happily his mercy is infinite and able to accommodate a miscreant as wretched as you ah i forgot the quality of mercy remarked mylchrist sarcastically the recollection comes as a great relief to me henderson drew from his nose the spectacles he kept in almost permanent residence there a habit which intimated he was never far removed from the devout perusal of holy scriptures such a deliberate and portentous gesture augured ill for the bantering inhabitants of the wardroom as they lounged about waiting for their orders from the first lieutenant johnnie what exactly did you mean just now quilhampton interjected a preoccupied look on his lean face about what about the leak did you mean to imply someone may have had a hand in the matter well yes of course gentlemen i have your orders pray pay attention you may require to make notes were in for the devil of a hard time frasers burr ended the conversation as the worried scotsman hurried into the wardroom and waved aside the negro messman and his coffee pot nae time for that king nae time at all it was not ground of his own choosing a light mist trailing in the wake of a rain shower was clearing as they closed the coast patrician stood shore wards under a single jib and her three topsails a cable bent to her sheet anchor and a leadsman chanting from the forechains balanced on the rail braced against the mizen shrouds drinkwater scanned the littoral ahead he sought an anchorage beyond the flats that extended northwards from punta de los reyes a long comparatively lowlying spit of land extended for fifteen miles northward of the headland behind which his charts suggested lay an inlet running deep into the countryside he had little real knowledge of its suitability but the preoccupation of a worried mind convinced him that to delay to seek a more ideal spot would be foolish ahead of him the mist had resolved itself into a low cloud of spray that hung over the pounding white of breakers where the long pacific swells toppled and thundered on the sands of the californian foreshore behind the beach low sanddunes ran to the southward and somewhere beyond the horizon terminated at punta de los reyes at intervals along this sandpit higher eminences rose and at the distal point a low but prominent hill marked the termination of the land the white of breakers pounded on the low bar around which drinkwater hoped to work patrician and seek an anchorage beyond the spit in the safety of the long lagoon of tomales bay the wind had fallen light a gentle onshore breeze that ruffled the sea the promise of sunshine earlier in the day had failed and cloud had closed off the heavens and given the seas surface a leaden colour as it lifted itself to the easy motion of the incoming swells noooo bottom the leadsmans chant had become monotonous though they were within a league of the shore and then sharply insistent by the mark twenty the breakers were suddenly nearer drawing out on the starboard bow the gentle pitch of the ship was steepening as she reacted to the shortening of the heaving wavelength compounded of the rise of the seabed and the backswell beating seawards from the rampart of the land by the mark thirteen worms of anxiety were crawling in drinkwaters belly hill came across the deck and stood below him without words they shared their apprehension tomales point was opening all the time a guanostained rock had detached itself from the land as it changed its appearance with their close approach bird rock sir hill remarked though drinkwater knew the comment was an expression of caution not topographical interest he felt a swell gather itself under patricians stern lifting it and thrusting the ship forward so that her bow dipped sharply the sudden elevation and clearer view ahead alarmed both captain and sailing master they were in shoal soundings now the leadsman chanting the deeps of nine and eight fathoms behind the smoking barrier of the long sandpit the narrow placid opening of the lagoon stretched away to the southwards on its far shore the lowlying land rose gradually hazing into the distance and the raincovered mountains but across the entrance to tomales bay lay the whitened fury of the thwarted pacific roaring and thundering upon the sandbar that blocked their intended refuge then the swell rolled under them the stern dropped and the bow reared up the long bowsprit stabbing almost vertically drinkwater felt himself jerked by the mastwhip shaking the mizen shrouds ahead of them the smooth back of the swell culminated in a great arch of water soon to disintegrate in hundreds of tons of roiling water as one more breaker on the coast it entirely blotted out their view but both drinkwater and hill had seen enough stand by the braces drinkwater roared leaping from the rail down helm larboard tack hands aloft let fall the courses andtgarnsls lively there afterguard leggo spanker brails haul aft the spanker come mr mylchrist move those lubbers smartly there focsle sir comley stood foursquare facing aftexpectantly hoist your jibs sir hill had moved across the deck to stand by the binnacle he shot glances at the compass then aloft at the masthead pendant and at the larboard dogvane full and bye mr hill patrician began to swing with an infuriating slowness bringing the swell onto her beam and rolling to leeward as her bowsprit pointed round to the north it seemed to trace the curved shore of bodega bay drinkwater anxiously watched the thundering breakers get closer the air was full of the roar of them the air damp with the spray of their destruction upon the sandbar beamon patrician lifted on a mighty crest the huge oily swell passed beneath her and she rolled violently into the following trough the sails slatted impotently slapping back against the masts with a rattle of blocks and slap of buntlines the wind dropped and for several minutes drinkwater considered the necessity of anchoring to avoid grounding in such an inhospitable spot but the ship carried her way and the wind filled her sails sufficiently for her to maintain steerage crabbing awkwardly to leeward patrician clawed slowly to the north and westwards rounding bodega head the far end of the bay with a cables length of deep water to leeward as the headland dropped astern relief was plain on everyones face a damned close thing sir said hill shaking his head yes replied drinkwater curtly stand the leadsman down now well tack ship and haul to thesuthard in an hour drinkwater saw marsden approaching him his hat in his hand yes mr marsden i presume you have bad news troubles never come singly yes sir well drinkwater could hear the slow solemn clank of the pumps sluicing water from below and out through the gundeck ports how much water is she making the devil it is its an auger sir theres an auger missin from my shop are you sure aye sir an both my mates agree sir gone missin recent like anyone else know about this well my mates sir thats all at present but he looked round helplessly news such as the theft of a drillbit from the carpenters shop following so hard on the discovery of a leak could lead to only one conclusion the leak was a deliberate act of sabotage very well mr marsden tell your men to hold their tongues drinkwater was pale with anger and marsden happy to quit the quarterdeck under the captains baleful glare chapter ten the labouring gentlemen april drakes bay gentlemen drinkwater laid the point of the brass dividers on the chart a facsimile of george vancouvers survey supplied by an unusually obliging admiralty whose largesse had been prompted by the desire to see him and his frigate gone from home waters captain drinkwater was under no circumstances to have been permitted to plead any of the customary excuses for delay the folio of copies of vancouvers and cooks charts had arrived by special messenger with a smooth but pointed letter from mr barrow every consideration is being extended to facilitate the speedy departure of hm frigate under your command drinkwater shook off the obsessive recollection to concentrate upon the task in hand as his officers clustered round the spur of punta de los reyes jutted into the pacific doubling back to the eastward in a distal point behind which reentrant lagoons sanddunes and an occasional hill formed the border of a bay within which shelter from the prevailing winds and the pacific groundswell might be sought here more than two centuries before driven as drinkwater now was by necessity francis drake had refitted his stormbattered ship drinkwater had rejected the place earlier because there was a danger of its being exposed to view from the southeast a mere thirty miles from the hostile spaniards at san francisco now it offered them their only accessible refuge ideal gentlemen he said with more confidence than he felt let us hope the ghosts of drake and his people look kindly upon us for we have much to do why didnt he go into san francisco sir asked quilhampton pointing at the great arrns of the harbour as it wound inland amid sheltering hills because mr q he sailed right past it without discovering the entrance now this is what i intend we should do he paused to get their attention they straightened up from the chart coughing and shuffling fraser and quilhampton had notebooks ready immediately upon coming to an anchor we will hoist out all the boats and lower the cutters i want mr q to land mount and a detachment of marines with seven days rations to occupy this hill drinkwater pointed to a neatly hachured cone depicting a summit some two miles inland from the eastern side of the bay you will establish a signal station mr mount we will give you a boatmast and a few flags and mr belchambers with a couple of seamen i want a daily runner to meet a boat with your report understood perfectly sir nodded mount good usual signals for enemy in sight any approaching ship is an enemy i understand sir very well when you have landed the marines mr q i want you ashore here on the point with an hourglass and a tidepole we know the moon is waxing and the tides with it but i want to know the maximum rise and fall as soon as possible aye aye sir good now mr fraser and you mr hill the greatest burden of the task falls on you we will send down our topmasts and bridge the boats i want the spare spars used for that then i want two anchors laid out astern we will shoe these for i want no risk of them coming home your pipe mr comley the boatswain straightened up from the rail and a piercing whistle rolled over the smooth waters of the anchorage above the heads of the men in the cutter all activity aboard patrician ceased the deck parties getting the topmasts down and the spare spars over the side into the longboat launch and barge the details beginning to shift stores in the hold the running messengers the labouring landsmen and toiling cooks all stood stockstill pending the pipe to carry on under the larboard bow the cutter bobbed bowsed in to the ships side by a boatrope in shirtsleeves captain drinkwater and mr marsden leaned inelegantly over the side each with a musket ramrod placed against the ships side they put the other ends to their ears the operation had been repeated several times and the men having been exhorted to work as they had never done before were heartily fed up with the periodic whistled injunctions to stop and keep silent the cutters crew strove to hold the boat as motionless as possible the bowman bracing his boathook against the downward thrust of the larboard bumpkin an oarsman stilling the rumble of a rolling loom got it sir marsdens eyes gleamed with triumph and drinkwater withdrew his ramrod shuffled further forward while the boat lurched dangerously and crouched next to marsden his ramrod replaced against patricians spirketting alongside that of the carpenters drinkwater put his ear to the small expanded bell that was designed to tamp the charge and ball in the breech of a brown bess the dull formless sound that was part the resonating of the ship part the blood in his ear was dramatically displaced it was low and indistinct but instantly recognisable as the sound of water running through a constriction his eyes met those of marsden and he nodded very well mr marsden mark it marsden looked at the hull reached out and scored a mark with a lump of chalk the problem still remained to discover how far below the waterline the sea was gaining ingress not far by the clarity of the noise less than a fathom drinkwater fervently hoped so he nodded at marsden again well marsden was looking up at the hull above them the curved headrails swept from the focsle to the massive stem timbers and patricians gilded and painted figurehead bright splashes of colour and limned streaks of gilt were encrusted with salt and the chips and chafing of ropes while overhead stretched the gratings that formed the shitting place for the crew suddenly the carpenter turned to drinkwater comprehension widening his eyes the shotlocker sir the forrard shotlocker by god marsden youre right drinkwater turned and the boat lurched again haul her back to the ladder there and be quick about it neither drinkwater nor marsden could contain their impatience as the boat was hauled aft along the ships side noting the sudden flurry of activity below him comley leaned over the side permission to carry on sir yes mr comley carry on and get two lanterns ready again the pipe whistled over the placid water of the bay but now it was not the imperious single note of the still now the note hopped down a tone and men swung to work again cursing and bantering according to temperament and the liberty that the leading hand or petty officer midshipman mate or lieutenant allowed them the cutter ground alongside the longboat and launch which were being lashed into one huge raft purlined with the spare spars to form a platform for heavy gear and guns drinkwater and marsden scrambled out of the cutter thank you mr frey drinkwater called to the midshipman in command you had better return to assist the first lieutenant to get that second anchor laid out astern without waiting for a reply and waving aside a pretended and halfcocked formal welcome drinkwater ran below with marsden waddling in hot pursuit it had been his strict instruction to his officers and one which he himself saw no reason to disobey that the urgency of the work overrode everything else and that they would borrow the phrase of the english navigator who had first charted the careenage for the gentlemen should labour with the mariners with the activity and eagerness of a man half his age drinkwater sped below every moment that his ship lay defenceless in the bay cost him agonies of worry now with almost certain knowledge of the location of the leak he was at once nervously eager and apprehensive to see it for himself if marsden was right the leak might not be so very difficult to get at if it was an act of deliberate sabotage some ease of access could be assumed on the other hand anyone contemplating such a deed would run in fear of a discovery that could hang the perpetrator here you men he hailed a working party hauling cable aft for bending on the spare anchors belay that and come below the shotlocker marsden referred to was right forward a deep narrow inward funnelling space immediately abaft the massive timbers of the stem this otherwise useless space was one of several voids about the ship in which iron shot was stowed in the case of the two shotlockers at the very extremities of the ship they served a double purpose and indeed so wet and corroded did the shot in them become that it required extensive scaling and was rarely used for action instead while it formed a reserve its chief purpose was to provide manageable concentrations of weight at the ships ends by which with facility her trim might be altered two or three men might in such a remote corner of the frigate shift the contents of the locker and get at the skin of the ship undetected drinkwater conceded the lead of the impromptu procession to marsden who had grabbed a lantern dropping from the orlop into the hold they worked their way forward now the ship lay tranquilly at anchor drinkwater fancied he heard the haunting trickle of water long before they reached the hatch to the forward shotlocker but there was no doubt halfanhour later when the seamen he had commandeered sweated below the faint flame of a lantern he held above their labouring heads the pungent smell of disturbed and powdery rust cut through the thick stench of bilge as the shot was handed up and rolled like reluctant footballs aft clear of the small square hatchcoaming gradually the grunting men worked themselves lower until one swore and suddenly they could see the dark gleam of running water in the lamplight look marsden hissed drinkwater could see for himself a partially rotten section of the ships inner skin had been removed the lighter colour of exposed wood showed clearly ten minutes later marsden and one of his mates had swapped places with the gasping seamen and levered off the broken inner planking the jet of water that squirted inwards from the outer hit them like a firehose they were lucky lucky in the mist that lay offshore shrouding their activities from all but the eyes of a few curious indians and a drunken mestizo that rode legs swinging on the swaying back of a decayed burro lucky in the location of the leak deliberate though it was for by discharging only eight guns and shifting stores and cannon aft they raised it above the waterline where it could be properly repaired and they were lucky that the wind held light that no disturbing swells rolled around punta de los reyes to dislocate their tender situation but luck was something realised in retrospect or perceived solely by degrees nothing at the time could mitigate the excoriating anxiety that churned the pit of drinkwaters stomach and sent him about the deck to direct encourage and chivvy periodically he cast an eye at mounts distant flagpole once the signal for an enemy in sight lifted limply above the post and marine runner and midshipman met at the appointed rendezvous to learn that the ship was passing to the south and appeared not to have seen the patrician skulking with lowered masts in the bight of drakes bay but it was not simply the dread of being caught defenceless with his guard down and the frigate in a state of disorder as he had once caught edouard santhonax in the sharm of al mukhra that worried him see brig of war worse was the underlying anxiety of the cause of their predicament that deliberate act of sabotage about which there was no doubt he had inspected the hole and it had been drilled with an auger bit and possibly plugged until an apt moment arrived with a coast and refuge to leeward to compel drinkwater to make for the land there was only one explanation for such a calculated act whoever planned it intended to desert the country about them was empty a desperate man could lose himself in an hour or two of liberty in the direction of the distant mountains the wooded foothills suggested fastflowing streams game and freedom if a few desperate souls succeeded in such a venture it was almost certain that more would follow that a trickle of stragglers might become a flood he feared he would be left with a dismantled warship and lack the means of refitting or working her let alone fighting her such thoughts chased themselves about his weary brain robbing him of sleep until when he finally capitulated to exhaustion they inhabited his dreams assuming nightmarish qualities in which laughing drunken seamen taunted him as they caroused with darkeyed spanish and indian beauties or stalked him through the dense woods as he had once been stalked through the pinebarrens of south carolina see an eye of the fleet he would wake shuddering and sweating steadying his nerves with a glass and sitting gloomily in his chair ticking off the precautions he had taken to prevent desertion mount had been instructed to watch for a signal from the ship so that his marines might cut off any men running from the beach the officers had been instructed in the matter and the one boat not needed as a platform or for some purpose concerning the refit such as holding stores rowed a constant nightguard about them there had been one farcical alarm when the marine sentry on the focsle had fired at an innocent turtle mistaking it for a swimmer and there had been an inevitable slackening in vigilance as the days passed uneventfully but there were irishmen and papists aboard who were less hostile to the thought of spanish rule vestigial as it was and there was a dissenting faction epitomised by the quaker derrick with his innocent and simplistic cant about the evils of war lastly there was drinkwater himself by no means unsympathetic to the aspirations of men driven by the protraction of this interminable war such sympathy ran contrary to his duty and his sense of the latter had been powerfully reinforced by the wanton act of sabotage stripping from his consideration the plight of the unfortunate in the uncompromising light of day he bore the unaltered burden of command to bring them safe home again having first executed his orders another heave there bullies waayoh and belay fetch another tackle mr comley and reeve a bullrope through the chesstree sheave and take it to the jeer capstan well get a better lead stand easy a moment there amidships quilhampton wiped his face smearing his shirt sleeve and feeling the fabric rasp on his unshaven cheek this was only the third gun to be heaved back into position though they had been labouring since four oclock in the morning they had eight more to drag forward from the after end of the gundeck pounders each weighing two and a half tons and each with an inert brutishness that provoked cursing from the tired men another eight of the damnable things had been hoisted off their carriages and laid on the impromptu decking of the raft they had lifted the bulkheads and deprived the captain and officers of their privacy rolling guns aft and moving every possible weight towards the stern in order to lighten the bow the after ends of both the gundeck and the berthdeck were cluttered and on either side of her waist amidships patrician looked like a merchantman loading from lighters ready there very well standto quilhampton concentrated again waving up three men with handspikes and shouting to set the tackles tight slowly the heavy carriage was manoeuvred along the deck swung through a right angle and its wheels were trundled into the familiar grooves of its station patrician had started life as a small lineofbattleship bearing sixtyfour guns according to the establishment of the day but ten years after her building when war with france broke out she was razeeed cut down by the removal of her upper gundeck and converted into a heavy frigate her main armament consisted of two dozen of the pounders quilhampton was engaged in replacing in their ports such cannon could be found on the middle gundeck of firstrates monstrously awkward things whose movement even in the tranquillity of a sheltered anchorage had constantly to be controlled by ropes and tackles a trice more on that bullrope there handsomely handsomely belay thats well there come up men relaxed a collective sigh of relief swept the gundeck and quilhampton gave them a moments breather before bawling next one lads they had started most of their fresh water casks into the bilge and then pumped out the contents to lighten the ship and lessen her draught that first day quilhampton had spent hours watching the tide make sluggishly upwards marking the pole he had driven into the beach it had risen little more than a fathom insufficient to persuade captain drinkwater to beach the ship besides thought quilhampton looking round him as the tackles were overhauled and hooked into the carriage ring bolts of number nine gun the leak had been reasonably accessible and a heavy stern cant had brought it above the waterline they had been lucky damned lucky how do you do mr q the unintended rhyme of frasers enquiry provoked a ripple of laughter laughter that the spent officers left unchecked it was at least a symptom of good nature well enough mr fraser tomorrow should see the guns back and at least well have our teeth again aye then weve only to rerig ship spars and boats and dig fifty tons o ballast out o yon beach fill wi fresh water rattle down and weigh three anchors an well be as fit as fightingcocks to combat the world again fraser moved off to inspect the parties in the orlop and the hold preoccupied and almost as worried a man as his commander set tight there pass word to the jeer capstan right heave well drinkwater looked up from the charts strewn about the table fraser noted they were of vancouver island and the strait of juan de fuca he tried to draw encouragement from drinkwaters optimism quilhampton estimates the main batteries back in position tomorrow sir he has only the guns overside to hoist inboard now good and the hold restowed but wanting ballast and water yes i know if we ration well have sufficient for a week or ten days by then we shall fetch a bay to the northwards there are a hundred watering places on this coast what about here sir too brackish i fancy drinkwater tried to encourage fraser with a smile aware that he could produce nothing more than a wan grimace and aloft he prompted two days sir to be certain yes but i didnt like the temper of tonights sunset we may not have too long no sir weve been lucky damned lucky drinkwater woke aware that he was being shaken violently sir sir wake up what what is it mr belchambers it is you aint it yes sir mr quilhampton presents his respects sir eh oh whats the time just before dawn sir the cabin was still dark and drinkwater felt a surge of irritation the news of the previous evening that the end of their predicament was in sight had somewhat relieved his mind and the sleep he had fallen into had been profound what the devil are you calling me for its a ship sir a ship coming into the bay chapter eleven rezanov april what kind of ship mr belchambers large how rigged he was awake now his heart pumping painfully every shred of anxiety turned over in the previous days now fully justified this was the russian ship advised of their whereabouts and now enabled to catch them halfarmed and trapped in the bay nicolai rezanov had paid court to the lovely doña ana maria languished awhile to recruit his people and relax from the cares of his voyage then he must have received reports from the local indians and spanish spies that could not have failed to spot the strange ship or the unfamiliar red coats of mounts marines at drakes bay even by the slowest burro news must have reached don josé arguello of their whereabouts even perhaps their unpreparedness a sudden violently bilious spasm of hatred towards the anonymous saboteurs jerked him upright from his cot by god they were going to pay for their treachery now a ship sir thats all i am able to say except that mr quilhampton is passing word to call the men sir quietly very well ill be up directly pass the word for my coxswain aye aye sir the midshipman scuttled away as drinkwater reached for his trousers beyond the curtain he could hear the sounds of the ship stirring the muted groans of tired men dragged early from their hammocks where in gods name were his sword and pistols where away drinkwater hissed staring into the grey dawn light mist trailed away over the water luminous from an imminent dawn which already lightened the eastern sky right astern sir see where the masts are outlined against the sky yes i have her now the final fog of sleep dispersed he could see the upper masts of a ship how far was she distant from them how diminished by perspective others were creeping aft fraser and hill joined them ive ordered a spring passed forrard sir said fraser we can get the starboard broadside to bear yes drinkwater acknowledged flatly simultaneously pleased that fraser had demonstrated his initiative and irritated that he had not thought of the thing himself what dyou make of her he asked hill who peered intently through his glass daylight grew by the minute and drinkwater thought they were hidden as yet against the land and the retreating night if the intruder was meditating surprise she had better loose it upon them quickly well i dont think it is the russian sir at least not that twodecker we sighted off the horn then what the devil is it drinkwater snapped testily abusing his rank and giving vent to his highkeyed state want me to take a boat and see sir too big a risk but thank you no let us wait for daylight and spend the time getting her under our guns a few minutes later fraser reported the capstans manned the cable from one of the two stern anchors had been led forward and a spring taken to the midships capstan so that by heaving and slacking on the trio of anchors patrician was turned through almost a rightangle set within a web of heavy hemp hawsers her starboard broadside run out and her men at their quarters in utter silence they waited for daylight to disclose their target details emerged slowly remarked upon as they were noticed her shiprig her tall masts and the opinion that she was a spaniard were followed by other intelligence as to the paintwork and the run of her hull until the disclosure of a mere six gunports confirmed she was only a merchant ship the mood changed instantly instead of apprehension there was cursing that only a single boat remained to seize her though they might knock her clean out of the water with a single broadside from the eager guns they must have seen us by now said drinkwater puzzled at the lack of reaction from the strange vessel as though this thought had taken wing it was followed by a hail ahoy there what ship is that the question was repeated in bastard spanish but the accent was unmistakable the newcomer was a citizen of the united states of america a fact confirmed by the hoisting of her bespangled gridiron ensign a yankee by god remarked hill grinning drinkwater seeing them hoisting out a boat and unwilling to reveal the chaotic state of his ship snapped get the cutter alongside ill pay him a visit well now captain sit you down and take a glass im damned if i expected to find the british navy hereabouts you wouldnt be thinking of pressing my men i might not take kindly to that captain jackson grant replaced the short clay pipe between his teeth and fixed drinkwater with a grim stare i would not drink with you and then steal your men captain there are those of your party that would captain you have my word upon the matter grant laughed you think that settles the thing eh he removed his pipe and drinkwater saw that the man possessed eyes of different colours the left was dark the iris brown while the right was a paler blue the oddity gave his features which were otherwise heavily handsome a curious disbelieving appearance you can rest assured captain grant that your men are quite safe drinkwater recalled the hostile looks that had been thrown in his direction as he had come aboard here grant passed a glass aguardiente captain grant drawledburning water made by the spanish from local grapes not to be compared with the cognacs of france but tolerably agreeable to rough provincial palates your health captain drinkwater suppressed the shudder that travelled upwards from his stomach in reaction to the fiery spirit grants tone was bantering hinting at hostility a hostility that was for the moment overlaid with curiosity they were of an age drinkwater put the next question you fought for your independence captain grant grinned showing yellow teeth sure i served under commodore whipple and in privateers made a deal of money from my service too british money and you yes under rodney and ashore in the carolinas and against privateers my first command was as prizemaster little schooner called the algonquin of rhode island see an eye of the fleet we caught her slipping into the irish sea to stop the liverpool merchants resting at night god damn josiah kings ship i do not recall the name of her commander grants curious eyes narrowed to slits you can have been no more than a boy nor you captain grants hostility began to melt and he grinned his face relaxing goddam it no we were both just boys he leaned forward and refilled drinkwaters glass the shared memories and the raw brandy loosened their mutual suspicions both men relaxed exchanging stories of that now distant war so what do you do in drakes bay captain with your masts struck and the look of a surprised wench about your ship refitting captain a spot of trouble with a leak and you a spot of trade he held up the glass closed his brown eye and focused the blue one on the pale amber fluidfirewater sells well hereabouts i cant sell it in san francisco but mestizos and indiansll be here once they hear capn jacks anchored i see said drinkwater wryly raising one eyebrow and for what do you sell the aguardiente grant grinned again showing his wolfish teeth california banknotes captain dried hides cant you smell em drinkwater sniffed the air the faint taint of putrefaction came to him yes and you get the aguardiente from where grant shrugged monterey san francisco san diego the damned franciscans proscribe the trade there but i find he laughed the customers come to me from whom do you buy the stuff then if the franciscans have a hold on the country oh there are plenty of suppliers captain dont forget i come from civilisation i can supply bows buttons lace and furbelows from paris faster than the dons can ship their dull and dolorous fashions from madrid grants smile was knowing does don josé arguello trade with you grant shot drinkwater a shrewd look and his tone was suddenly guarded oh no captain don josé is an hidalgo commandante of this vast and idle province spanish governors are forbidden to trade on their own or their provinces accounts grant tossed off his glass and refilled it why do you ask curiosity drinkwater paused it came back to him that there had been that atmosphere of hidden secrets about the commandante and his entourage his brother then don alejo youre very shrewd captain drinkwater as well as being improperly named grant refilled drinkwaters glass you have heard of the lovely doña ana maria arguello de la salas eh i have heard something of her and also of a russianhe let the sentence trail off and sipped the glass a feeling of contented wellbeing permeated him his limbs felt weightless his energies concentrating on thinking of gauging this american and divining how much truth he was speaking oh yeah i heard the damned russkies had fallen out with good old king george well he couldnt look after his own could he eh drinkwater sat quietly refusing to be drawn raising his good shoulder in a careless shrug sure now i know why youre here an the damned russkies don alejo encourages them and he trades who wouldnt a man must take something back to castile better than button scurvy or mange from this desert of nueva espana youve heard of rezanov captain eh a little perhaps i understand he stands high in the favour of the lady you mentioned arguellos daughter sure she dotes on him and the match is encouraged by those spanish apes grant was suddenly serious shes a beautiful woman captain perhaps the most beautiful woman certainly shes the most beautiful woman jackson grant has ever seen yes sir you havent seen her by god she got eyes like sloes shoulders like marble and a breast a man could do murder for drinkwater stirred uncomfortably but grant was oblivious in the fury of his passion his weird eyes gleamed with an intensity that spoke of the coastal rivalries fired by the unfortunate beauty of doña ana maria why a man would pass over a score of these damned flatnosed indians even a brace of the bestlooking ladinos from panama with wanton arses and coconuts for topsl yards for an hour in that ladys company for all that she only strummed a guitar and wore the habit of a nun he wiped the back of his hand across his mouth poured another peg of brandy into his glass tossed it back and refilled it again and rezanov drinkwater prompted ah rezanov nicolai petrovich comte de rezanov grant lisped the name with an aping of a french accent his eyes glaring with dislike then his face cleared and he laughed a cruel laugh you have not been in the pacific long captain i consider you should not have come at all you damned british have no right here but neither have the damned russkies grants voice was slurred his mind shifted briefly to his anglophobia and then slid back to a more personal hatred he waved his hand towards the stern windows the pale streak of the beach rising to dunes and duncoloured hills could be seen beyond the anchorage nueva espana new albion new muscovy come captain its not yours nor spains nor the fucking tsars one day itll be ours a state of the union californio mark my words captain and jackson grantll be a founding fucking father again he held up the glass of aguardiente and glared through it with one bright blue eye oh rezanov had his ideas big ideas he came out with an expedition under captain kruzenstern accredited ambassador to the mikado at yedo but the little yellow men kept him kicking his heels at nagasaki before kicking his arse out of their waters grant chuckled kruzenstern went on his way and left rezanov in the juno to inspect the factories forts and posts of the russianamerican company now what dyou think the russianamerican company was eh nothing but a damned front for the bloody tsar to get his claws on this part of the world they trap the seaotter and shoot the grizzly bear but they cant get the bloody furs to canton faster than jackson grant and the poor bastards live in squalor in alasky and the kuriles you should see them at sitka why itd make your lower deck scum look like lords rezanov thought he could kill all these ills damned odd lot these russians rezanov thought he was a prophet guess thats why the doña ana fell for his line of speaking her being influenced by the papist church well he came prospecting down the coast sitka nootka the colombia river bodega bay and san francisco and doña ana maria and her father el commandante and he secured an alliance to trade grant shrugged sure something of the sort i guess they say he bettered that franciscan corpse that passes for a confessor don alejo at least had gold from him tartar gold and thats fact and from doña ana maria a promise of marriage grant stared gloomily into his glass the brown eye lugubrious and rezanov returned to the north yeah i last saw him at sitka i heard later hed set off for russia to confirm a treaty with the tsar get it ratified or whatever the hell they do with these things he got his own back on the yellow men too grant laughed sent men and ships and took the island of sakhalin from them to please his master i guess reckon a tsars signature must be worth an island or two eh captain and when is he expected to return this rezanov grant frowned the drink clouding his powers of thought he seemed to be trying to recall a lost fact then as he remembered he smiled never captain you see rezanovs been dead a year just heard the news in sitka he died like a dog in krasnoiarsk left the field plum clear for jackson grant grant chuckled and drinkwater considered the import of this news apart from altering the life of doña ana he did not see that it was of much effect to him there was still that russian battleship captain grant have you seen anything of a russian manowar on the coast sure the junos at sitka or was when i left bound so word had it for the colombia river but the junos been in the pacific for some time hasnt she what about a bigger ship a twodecked lineofbattleship with a black hull have you seen such a vessel grant shook his head no and where are you bound from here san francisco to tell doña ana her lover is dead grant frowned through his drunkenness they dont know they were expecting him what how the hell do you know that grant attempted to rise but fell back i was there a fortnight ago shit captain he broke off to think rubbing his hand across his mouth again and then pouring out more brandy how the hell did you get into there and out again without the bloody inquisition catching you youre at war with the spaniards aint ya under a flag of truce captain i was a cartel returning spanish prisoners we took the frigate santa monica dios and rubalcava did you take him a prisoner or did you kill the bastard i took him prisoner i imagine hes pleading his suit with doña ana at this moment grant looked up fixing drinkwater with his odd eyes the one dark and agonised like a whipped curs the other flinty with hatred drinkwater was surprised at the depth of the wound he had inflicted alls fair they say in love and war grants mouth hung open when suddenly the sound of distant shots came through the open stern windows drinkwater rose and peered in the direction of the patrician even at this distance he could see the smoke of powder hovering over the deck and the desperately rowed boat was making for the shore full of men he grasped the situation in an instant his men were deserting gods bones he hissed through clenched teeth picking up his hat and making for the door your servant captain grant and good luck and the words alls fair in love and war tormented him with their accuracy all the way back to the patrician in the cutter chapter twelve drakes bay april how many he asked aware that he had asked the question before last time the answer had shocked him now it appalled him fortyeight sir he looked down the list that fraser handed him and then at the remnants of patricians company assembled in the waist with mount absent the bayonets of blixoes marines seemed a thin defence against a rising of the rest fortyeight men lost in a single act of mutinous desertion and the remainder were in a black mood how many of them would have run given the opportunity seduced by overlong a proximity to the shore yet deprived of even the feel of warm sand under their feet and he was halfdrunk and the day not far advanced we were heaving her round sir as you said ready to bring her out of the bay and someone cut the after cable she swung to the wind and the sterns touching the bottom thank you mr fraser he looked round the deck and coughed to clear his throat very well lads if theres another man who wishes to go ill not stand in his way but i warn you ill hang anyone anyone i catch those of you that remain need fear nothing we shall haul the ship off and complete rigging her we are better off without unwilling shipmates now lets to work drinkwater turned away sick with despair aware of the brandy on his breath and guiltridden by his absence at a crucial moment ahm sorry sir i couldna gie chase we had just cast loose the barge frae the raft an you had the only other boat frasers accent was exaggerated by stress wearily drinkwater acknowledged his plight its not your fault mr fraser not entirely we must worry about mount i hope to god he does not run foul of those men have they arms two or three were marines sir aye theyve a gun or two between them get a signal of recall up to mount and then let us haul her into deeper water suddenly the danger from surprise attack by russian battleships seemed a foolishly mythological preoccupation patrician herself appeared to carry her own illluck drinkwater stared down at the rag tied round the hawser it had definitely crawled aft an inch or two by a stroke of misfortune the ship had grounded close to high water and now she was reluctant twelve hours later to come off above them a full moon hung in the velvet sky and from time to time the ship lifted and then bumped on the bottom as a low swell rolled in from a distant gale somewhere in the vast pacific again my lads he could hear the creak of the capstan the grunts of the straining men and the slither of their bare and sweaty feet on the planking the rag moved aft another inch a feeling of hope leapt in drinkwaters breast again lads again they caught his tone and the grunts came again he heard lieutenant quilhamptons exhortations thank heavens they had shoed the anchors augmented the palms of the flukes with facing pieces of hardwood so that they held better and allowed the anchors to bite and not drag home to the ship before they had hauled her into deep water the rag jerked again and then began to move steadily the ship lifted to a swell the rag surged aft there was a dipping in the rope and the men cheered they could feel the tension on the messenger and the nippers ease someone had fallen over and a ribald laugh came to him the swell crashed onto the beach and the ship shook with great violence as the entire length of her keel struck the bottom heave again heave away she was off now he could feel it through the deck the next swell passed under her and though he waited for it she did not strike in the low trough that followed halfanhour later they had her safe in deeper water stand the men down now mr fraser six hours below then turn em out again i want this ship in fighting trim by this time tomorrow they had not finished by the following night for the long presaged gale burst upon them in the late afternoon the lurid sunset of the previous evening green as verdigris had held its illpromise by a deceptively mild morning but gradually cloud had obscured the sun and a damp misty wind had rolled in from the pacific urgently they had hoisted in the boats and had recovered all but the damaged barge abandoned by the deserters on the distant beach even the masts and spars were ready to go aloft again as the wind freshened they watched grant get his ship underway there was a flamboyant style to the american commander he loosened his sail and threw his foreyards aback making a sternboard until he brought the wind broad onto his starboard bow drinkwater watched in admiration aware that grant was cockingasnook at the british navy demonstrating the supreme ability of both himself and his men men that drinkwater would fain have had aboard patrician at that moment despite his promises to the american grant hauled his foreyards with a nicety that would have delighted even that old punctilio earl st vincent and stood out to sea heading southeastwards for the better shelter of san francisco bay as drinkwater watched in his glass the last thing he saw was the american vessels name abigail starbuck gold letters fading in the grey mist above which conspicuous at the taffrail stood a single figure drinkwater could almost imagine grant winking that pale and sinister iceblue eye do you trust him to hold his tongue sir asked hill who had also been watching the departure of the american ship or will he gossip our predicament through every bagnio in san francisco i mind someone telling me the word yankee is cherokee indian for one who is untrustworthy in captain jackson grants case i would certainly judge him to be opportunistic drinkwater wondered if grant might make use of what he knew to gain access to don josé and through him to doña ana maria but that mr hill is just the opinion of a bigoted englishman with a deal of things on his mind aye the men or lack of em gods bones hill i wish to god id not gone gamming with that damned yankee drinkwaters tone was suddenly ferocious youll not go chasing after them sir drinkwater turned to the old sailing master he shook his head damn it no well lose the whole festering lot of them once they get ashore grant spent yesterday selling rotgut spirits to the indians and i daresay our fellows will soon hear about that these men will go to the devil if they have half a chance no ill not go chasing after them but damn it hill weve hardly men left to fight grant said there was at least a frigate at sitka but no twodecker hills tone was tolerantly reasonable like a parent leading a wilful child to a desired conclusion you still dont think that ship we saw off the horn was a russian do you hill shrugged almost noncommittally no sir im more inclined to think it was a don and is presently sitting off panama and even if it was a russian what in the world makes you think its hovering over the horizon like nemesis you think i am obsessive eh youve had a deal of doings with russia sir hill said circumspectly i know that drinkwater looked at hill they shared past clandestine doings on behalf of lord dungarths secret department and drinkwater saw concern in the older mans eyes but here in the pacific surely its unlikely unlikely whats unlikely that the russians are anxious to dominate the pacific or that im off my head about a ship i saw off the horn damn it hill what the deuce dyou think were out here for but to lick the blasted russians before they take advantage of the decaying power of spain what better time for em with spain a nominal ally but the whole damned world knowing that the dons are under the corsicans tyranny and rotten at the core dyou think if the russians land there that whoremonger godoy in madrid is going to lift a finger why hes too busy lifting the skirts of the queen of spain drinkwaters diatribe descended to crudity for lack of better argument though he saw hill could not dismantle it and was reluctantly conceding his viewpoint he could not explain to the master that he was haunted by fears of a less logical kind hill had not had that prescient dream off cape horn hill had not been touched by the strangeness of the incident on masafuera nor by the undercurrents of something sinister between the arguello brothers nor the beauty of doña ana maria nor the jealous lusts she excited nor the ghost of nicolai rezanov some intuition born perhaps of the bluedevils of the isolation of command of too introspective a nature or too vivid an imagination but some powerful instinct told him with a certainty he could not explain that they were in danger its source was as yet conjectural but its reality was as obvious to him as the smell of distant blood to a famished shark the gale lasted two days patrician escaped the worst of it behind the low shelter of punta de los reyes though she snubbed at her cable and rolled in the swells that cartwheeled into drakes bay they got her topmasts hoisted despite it and set up her rigging to the upper hounds a lighter mood settled on the ship as they prepared to face the second night of dismal and howling blackness were better off without them said mylchrist as the wardroom officers relaxed after the days labours and discussed the matter of the deserters good god johnnie you aint going to give us a speech about we happy few and summoning up the blood are you for gods sake were in the pacific not on the stage quilhampton slumped in his chair and toyed dejectedly with a biscuit james is right you know were in a damned parlous condition observed mount seriously he too sat downcast at the table his fingers fiddling with the stem of a wine glass rolling it and fitting it over the numerous winerings that marked the tablecloth he had taken the defection of his two marines badly and was angry that his detachment to the observation post had occurred at all in mounts opinion the desertions would not have taken place had he been directly in control of the sentries and now theres a gale and a delay hill came into the wardroom peeling off his tarpaulin and shaking his head water flew from his soaked hair as though from a dog a delay thatll ensure the dagoes know of our whereabouts give me some shrub for gods sake that rain makes a man chilly have a biscuit quilhampton pushed the barrel towards the master who occupied a vacant chair wheres the first luff wandering about worried sick och an away mocked mylchrist but no one paid this puerility any attention and what does the captain think hill you had his ear all morning hill looked at mount aware that the marine officer held drinkwater to blame for his absence from the ship at a crucial time you know damned well what the captain thinks hes as concerned as the rest of us and this russian nonsense hed do better thinking the americans have their greedy eyes on this coast we aint at war with the americans drawled mylchrist eager to reestablish his credibility after his rebuff doubtless we soon will be said quilhampton britannia contra mundum now whos bleating about we happy few mylchrist crowed i think gentlemen its time for sleep hill tossed off his pot and rose god grant were out of this pestilential spot tomorrow morning amen to that below his pacing figure the ship slept exhausted with the seemingly endless exertions of the day only the anchorwatch were about huddled in corners and beneath the boats to avoid the drizzle that hardened from time to time into heavy showers of torrential rain the night was black the wind tugging at the ship and moaning in the lower rigging rising periodically to a higher cadence as it shifted a point and freshened but it always fell away again never sustaining a promise of abandoned violence though every time it rose drinkwaters heart beat faster in anticipation of fresh disaster in such a state of mind sleep was impossible so he walked his quarterdeck in the timehonoured tradition between the mainmast and the carved taffrail for no better reason than it seemed the only way to pass the time of anxiety and to be on hand if the worst of his fears came to pass he was halfdead with fatigue his brain had lost the power of coherent thought yet was too active to permit sleep in an unending kaleidoscope it reviewed a tumbling series of images of monstrous black ships in the mighty combers of the horn of yawning caverns of water that threatened to suck him down into the bowels of hell of the laughing mockery of the whitelady of his nightmare who inexplicably and with a paralysing abruptness changed into the dark and lovely vision of doña ana maria and even as he sank fantastically upon her white and ample breasts he found the scimitar smile of rubalcava and the triumphant eyes of the arguello brothers above these images the imperious shadow of hortense santhonax manipulated the wires of a marionette in all this waking walking nightmare he paced the deck his senses all but dead to anything beyond the fury of his hallucinating brain his cloak wrapped round him his eyes stark staring into the windy blackness of the night until at last he slept slumped against a quarterdeck carronade lieutenant quilhampton jumped into the shallows and splashed ashore followed by sergeant blixoe four marines and the bowman of the cutter as the boat was dragged onto the beach and blixoe wandered off following the scuff marks of the deserters footprints in the sand quilhampton strode along the beach to the stove barge he was joined by marsden the carpenter both of them stood for a moment looking at the split and holed planks in the side of the boat the results of a few moments work with a boarding axe tomahawk opined marsden laying the finger of a horny hand upon the splintered wood i can patch it to get her back on board he patted the gunwhale of the boat very well ill need a hand quilhampton called the cutters crew over to assist and they lifted her gunwhale and braced her at a practical angle with footstretchers and bottom boards so that marsden could plug the hole with a greased canvas patch covered with a lead tingle while the work progressed quilhampton followed blixoe up the beach the marine sergeant had orders not to proceed out of sight of the ship and quilhampton followed him to the highest sanddune in their vicinity buggerall sir said blixoe turning as quilhampton came up with him did you really expect em to be in sight blixoe quilhampton grinned despite himself for the marine was itching to fire his musket and dispel the obloquy the returned mount had heaped upon him no scalps for you sergeant im afraid one opes sir one opes blixoe replied grimly still searching the desolate locality like a hound sniffing the wind what about there he pointed beyond the dunes stretched the fingers of an inlet spreading northwards cut off from the ocean by a long isthmus which culminated behind them in punta de los reyes an indian village a miserable collection of adobe dwellings overhung by the wispy smoke of cooking fires lay some miles to the northwards quilhampton shook his head no do you ensure none of the fellows that came ashore with us run blixoe turned and they looked down at the huddle of men round the barge the rest of blixoes men stood about their stocks loosed in the sunshine that burned warm after the passing of the rain and wind their loaded muskets at the port the bayonets gleaming wickedly no bloody fear of that sir they looked at the ship silhouetted black against the suns lambent reflection which danced upon the surface of the sea and was diffused by the watery mist that still lay a league offshore already the topgallant masts were aloft and they could see the foretopgallant yard being hoisted its length slowly squaring against the line of the mast as the lifts were adjusted and its parrel was resecured not long now quilhampton remarked a sense of relief pervading him their luck had held so far a few more hours nightfall perhaps tomorrow morning at the latest they would feel the deeps of the ocean beneath their keel no sir weve been lucky yes damned lucky they say that leak sir ventured blixoe taking advantage of lieutenant quilhamptons mellow mood well that it were caused deliberate like quilhampton looked sharply at the sergeant but the man was in profile his bucket hat pulled down over his eyes as he stared at the patrician anchored in her pool of sunshine and what do you say mr blixoe unperturbed the marine shrugged his white woollen epaulettes how should i know sir ill lay a guinea youve a theory of your own though blixoe pulled the corners of his mouth down i reckon weve all got theories sir trouble is the truth aint much to do with theories is it blixoe turned and faced quilhampton truth is sir that the men are at the end of their tethers we lost a good prize and we know theres rich pickins off the bloody dagoes theres men as knows the papists ways stuffin their churches with gold and word has it that there is a church somewhere about this coast where theyve the bones of some saint all laid out in a casket of jewelled gold and what theyre wondering is why begging your pardon sir the captain aint batterin down these bloody spanish churches sir by way of an act of war like thats the truth of it sir blixoe paused then added if youll pardon me for speaking freely yes of course come they seem to have finished down there they could see the barge being dragged into the water men were scrambling into her ready to pass her painter to the cutter quilhampton looked again at the ship the foretopgallant yard was across and then he froze the heat went out of the sun and his heart suddenly thudded in his chest look pointing with one hand he restrained blixoe with the other the marine paused and shaded his eyes against the glare they were insubstantial at first mere phantoms in the haze but then their outlines hardened the sharp squared edges of topsails the low hulls of menofwar standing into the bay there could be no doubt as to the purpose of their approach come on slithering in the sand quilhampton began an awkward descent fire those bloody muskets lads blixoe called to his platoon and a ragged volley of alarm sounded flatly across drakes bay chapter thirteen rubalcavas revenge aprilmay gods bones drinkwater swung round and stared at the beach as the sound of the volley echoed across the bay he expected to see men running but on the contrary they stood stockstill around the boats every attitude suggesting they were as surprised as himself at the shots then he saw the tiny white figure of quilhampton in his shirtsleeves running ungainly through the soft sand his arms waving wildly and with the four marines stumbling after him what the devil deck there they swung to the hail from the foremast where topmen sat astride the newly sent up topgallant yard to seaward sir drinkwater and the officers idle on the quarterdeck spun round following the mans urgently outstretched arm bloody hell its those spanish brigs jesus the two brigs had broken through the vaporous tendrils of the mist and were suddenly recognised as the vessels they had seen last anchored under the shadow of point lobos beneath the commandantes residence they were standing into drakes bay their yards braced and on slightly diverging courses endon drinkwater did not need glasses to see the bristling lines of cannon piercing their sides beat to quarters man the capstan they had a spring upon their anchor cable it lay slack in the water and if they were quick might give them a moments advantage wheres my coxswain here zur sword and pistols upon the instant gentlemen arm yourselves they will rush us the deck of the patrician presented a spectacle of disorder topmen descended from the foremast by the backstays sliding down handoverhand officers and men ran bumping into one another as they scurried to their posts man the larboard broadside drinkwater saw fraser his sword drawn his shirttail untucked from some strenuous endeavour at the base of the foremast run below to command the battery in quilhamptons absence amidships hill stood ready by the capstan pushing spare waisters into place about the splayed bars and then tregembo was awkwardly hitching his swordbelt about his waist and derrick was silently offering him his pistols he stuck one in his waistband and fisted the other a thought struck him and he held it out to the solemn quaker here defend thyself if no one else derrick shook his head and drinkwater his mind pressed dismissed the man for a highminded fool guns are bearing sir squeaked belchambers alongside him sent by fraser are they loaded damn it mr fraser says to tell you theyre loaded sir as best they can be mixed shot and langridge then run em out the boy skittered off and drinkwater took one last look about the deck it was a chaos of flungdown handspikes of uncoiled ropes and stoppered sails rolled in grey sausages of resistant canvas spars halfsecured and almost ready for hoisting lay at drunken angles like pitchforks left against a haycart but the men at the quarterdeck guns were kneeling ready though their breasts heaved from their late exertions and the dishevelled marines in unprofessional oddities of dress leaned upon the hammock nettings their bayonets gleaming and their muskets levelled they had not been utterly surprised and as yet the spanish had not a single gun that could bear below his feet he felt the pounders nimble out through their ports the brigs were close now perhaps two cables away and he could hear an angry buzz that came from a dense cluster of men about their twin focsles they were dark with boarders heaped like swarming bees you lads there drinkwater called to the quarterdeck guncaptains mark their boarders he raised his voice mark their boarders focsle a wave of comprehension came from midshipman wickham forward if those three carronades did their business their spreading langridge would tear a bloody and ragged hole through that cluster of men as the noise from the brigs grew louder it seemed a grimmer silence settled upon the patrician drinkwater pierced it he would have to loose his cannon soon or risk his enemies stretching ahead and astern of him out of the lines of bearing of his guns stand by for boarders fire the thunder of the cannon erupted in orange flames and the white obscurity of reeking powder smoke the deck vibrated with the recoil of the heavy trucks and as the smoke cleared he could see the guncrews leaping about their pieces as they reloaded but it was already too late so close were the brigs that the most elevated gun had sent its shot no higher than manheight above their rails their masts and topsails shivering now as they checked way to drive alongside loomed above the shredding smoke and drinkwater could see the white circles and interlacing and expanding ripples that showed more than half his shot had plunged harmlessly between and far beyond the spaniards but there were bloody gaps in the clusters of men about the beakheads of the enemy and there were dots in the water some inert and some waving where men died and shrove their souls in agony he could hear the screams and a weird ululating cry as some unfortunate man spewed shock and horror and the dreadful pain of a mortal wound into the air it was a moment of the briefest pause below a fastreloaded gun roared again followed by another and another and then drinkwater turned the first brig crashed into the bowsprit locking her own in a tangle of splitting wood and torn wreckage he could see the smoke and stab of small arms and a few bold men beginning to scramble across the interlocked spars as the enemy brig thus entangled fell slowly off the wind and alongside the british frigate aft the second brig loomed close alongside there was a sickening crash as her cathead struck the patricians quarter and the impact of the collision sent a second mighty tremble through the ship a grappling iron struck the rail and its line was belayed to be cut through by a marine but another followed and another and the marine fell back clutching his throat shot through at close range by a pistol ball get your men on deck fraser drinkwater roared below and swung round his sword drawn joining the hedge of bayonets and boarding pikes and cutlasses as the gunners abandoned their now useless pieces and fought to defend themselves the spaniards poured over the rails jumping like reckless monkeys from one ship to another and drinkwater knew that the dons had emptied every stew and calaboose every tavern and every vessel with men who had a mind to cut the bloody british intruders down to size and god there were enough of them if every waterfront idler and every drunken mestizo in san francisco had come it did not explain the torrent of men that poured cutting slashing and stabbing their way across his quarterdeck he recognised the uniform of a provincial spanish regiment an officer leading a party of the brigs seamen together with a ragged rabble of volunteers a mixed ragbag of races halfdrunk and verminous from the desperate look of them but as he fought for his life he recognised something else something that his heightened consciousness had halfexpected there were men from the santa monica men in clear breach of their parole and at their head howling with the triumphant bellow of a conquistadore was don jorge meliton rubalcava by the time quilhampton reached the boats the brigs were alongside patrician he splashed through the shallows and fell into the stern of the cutter leave the barge he ordered panting with exertion oars come on come on he chivvied give way together shoving the tiller across the boat he swung the cutters bow round towards the noise and smoke of desperate battle drinkwater was slithering in gore his right forearm was cut and blood trickled from the graze of a pistol ball across his skull he hacked and stabbed with his sword and the clubbed pistol in his left hand was sticky with gore he was aware of beating off a savage attack of flinging back the first impetuous rush of the spaniards he was aware too that midshipman wickham had reported from the focsle that they had succeeded in staving off the inrush of boarders forward slewed on their slides the heavy carronades had cut swathes of death through the enemy and dampened the ardour of their attack but lieutenant mylchrist had been carried below dangerously wounded and wickham feared another rush from the regrouping spaniards drinkwater asked where the first lieutenant was but lost wickhams reply as he parried a pike thrust and cut savagely at a swarthy cheek seeing the bright start of blood and the pain in the glaring eyes of a man mount bayonets here he bawled and threw himself back into the fight as the spaniards renewed their attack upon the heavily outnumbered british fraser never got out of the gundeck from a boat towing alongside or by sliding down the bumpkins of the after brig men squeezed through a loose gunport as fraser obeyed drinkwaters order to reinforce the upper deck with his guncrews this small intrusion quickly became a torrent as two then three ports were opened dark lithe men with short stabbing knives clenched in their teeth and wet from a partial ducking alongside hauled themselves inboard to confront the gunners the guncrews were tired after days of exertion and the recent labour of hauling out their weapons and it seemed this influx of men was endless a wildly diabolical manifestation rising from hell itself they were small wiry halfcaste fellows who wriggled between the guns and seemed utterly at home in the shadows of the gundeck as happy as the nocturnal pickpockets scavengers footpads pimps and thieves they were they slipped easily inside the long guards of defenders with rammers and pikes hamstringing and hobbling men who fell howling only to be disembowelled and eviscerated by the gleaming knives that flashed dully in the semidarkness his hanger flickering desperately lieutenant fraser was fighting for his very life mr lallo motioned to skeete and the loblolly boy dragged the twitching body of lieutenant mylchrist to one side already the pledget they had just secured was darkening with blood next lallo wiped a reeking hand across his brow and took a pull at the rum bottle he kept propped against a futtock derrick the captains quaker clerk heaved the next victim onto the canvas spread on the seachests it was one of the topmen a big burly man whose legs were curiously drawn up in the foetal position his eyes were staring wildly and his lips were rimed with dried spittle the swaying lantern hooked above the operating table threw dreadful shadows across his features so that his face seemed to be working in convulsive spasms skeete forced fingers into the mans mouth prised open his jaw and with the vicious ease of practice thrust a damp pad of leather into the topmans gape the jaws snapped like those of a predator legs down lallo ordered and skeete jerked his head at derrick the quaker swallowed hard and took the leg opposite to skeete while lallo forced down the mans shoulders ahhhh lallo slopped rum into the open mouth and deftly replaced the leather pad as the man went slack not on the wound for christs sake lallo shouted as derrick beholding the complete horror of the injury gagged uncontrollably lallo slopped rum on his hands wiped them on his apron and bent over the ghastly ruin of the mans abdomen the fetid air of the orlop was filled with the stench of blood urine rum and vomit and resonated with the groans and whimpers of the wounded hes lucky remarked lallo to the professionally interested skeete no rupture of the guts his finger traced the blue outline of a section of intestine almost caressed the crinkled mass of a protruding curve of bowel and pointed to the smooth darkness of an excrescent organ aye skeete agreed with his superior needle and sutures skeete lallo began tucking the misplaced viscera back into the hollow of the body he might have been stuffing a cushion youll have to help he remarked looking up at derrick who had come forward again his forehead pale as wax in the yellow guttering of the lamplight you should be used to quaking he jested provoking a snigger from skeete as he produced the prepared needle they drew the two sides of the topmans belly together and with a swift and deft precision the surgeon looped a line of sutures down the white flesh missed his weddingtackle eh skeete he remarked finishing the stitches with a flourish by a mile sir grinned skeete next said lallo midshipman frey was on the quarterdeck he was already wounded in the shoulder and feeling lightheaded he felt a terrible blow in his guts a blow that drove the wind from his body and he felt himself flung back crashing against a gun carriage and slumping down hitting his head on the bulwark for a long time he lay inert the noise of battle seemingly miles above him while he fought for his breath in an interminable indrawn gasp that seemed like an enormous and unsuccessful paroxysm that would go on until he lost consciousness but he did not lose consciousness entirely he seemed dimly aware of many things if he did not succeed in inflating his lungs he would die but the light was bright in his eyes and he remembered the sunshine diffused by the golden mist the upper spars that he had been engaged in hoisting seemed drawn with a perfect precision against the sky he had thought of attempting to paint that effect of the light later and he thought of the resolution again now only filled with a sadness that he might never be able to try it if he did not draw his breath soon his hand would have lost its cunning for ever and then the reflex triumphed and air was drawn painfully into his lungs agony radiated outwards like a bombburst from his chest stabbing him with fires of redhot iron and it seemed easier to die than to endure there were other things troubling him now the sunlight flickered before his eyes as the dark and sinister shadows of men interposed themselves he found he resented this and began to try and call them to tell them to stop standing in the light that he wanted the warmth of the sun to die by he could see clearly now shoes and bare feet and a marines boots all dancing in a mad figure he would have to shout louder to make them hear and then they would stop drinkwater saw frey fall and cut his way through between a spanish officer and a marine swinging the sword across the neck of the seaman whose pike butt had been driven into the midshipmans guts the exposure of himself was foolish for in his concern he halfturned to see if the lad was alive and received another nick on the forearm for his trouble but it was the merest pinprick the point of a weapon a long lunge and he saw the triangular blade withdrawn following it with his eyes until he found its owner rubalcava you treacherous bastard drinkwater attempted to bind the grinning spaniards blade but a man fell across in front of him stone dead and he saw it was a marine and suddenly he was ringed with steel standing astride the howling heaving body of midshipman frey with a dozen enemies surrounding him he gasped for breath and read triumph in rubalcavas eyes he saw the spaniard lower his sword point and stride across the deck he brandished the long blade in a single sideswipe severing the halliards of the ensign the wind tugged the huge st georges cross and the bright union in its upper canton slowly it fluttered downwards to lie across patricians shattered rail the noise of fighting ebbed away to be replaced by the silence of defeat quilhampton willing the oarsmen to reach the ship as soon as possible was watching events ahead of him in a lather of impatience he did not recall until they were halfway back to the patrician that he had come ashore unarmed relying upon sergeant blixoes party to maintain discipline his chief concern had been to recover the damaged barge now he was running fulltilt into action with nothing more than a tiller in his hand it was at the moment that this dawned on him that he saw the ensign lowered to the rail in token of submission aghast he stood in the boat staring dumbfoundedly ahead seeing him thus the oarsmen faltered trailing their oars and looking round they were in the shadow of the ship and every where swarmed the alien figures of the enemy fuckin ell theyve taken the fuckin ship oh shit put the helm over sir lets get the ell out of ere for chrissakes before those bastards see us come on you lot backwater starboard and pull like fuck on those larboard oars quilhampton came to his senses as the boat turned the jerk of the fleeing oarsmen set him heavily in the stern sheets he did not interfere with their retreat his premonition had been right they had lost the ship to the enemy part two flood tide le trident de neptune est le sceptre du monde lemierre chapter fourteen débâcle may drinkwater woke in the dawn disturbed by the throbbing of his wounds and the spiritual nadir of defeat his cell was a bare room with a small barred window a crude table chair and palliasse the details of which were just visible in the gloom the hopelessness that had dominated his thoughts in the night was displaced by the physical discomfort of his body and this demanded his attention he was still tired from lack of sleep but the edge had gone from his exhaustion and his brain began to seek priorities in the instinctive business of survival they had brought him stumbling up what had seemed like thousands of steps before throwing him into this small room he had no inkling of where he was beyond a vague realisation that rubalcava had brought his prize into san francisco bay fatigue despair and loss of blood had deprived him of rational thought in the aftermath of surrender and it was only just returning to him in the chill of this desolate dawn slowly he dragged himself to his feet and stumbled to the chair peeling off his coat and laying bare the bloody mess of his forearm his head ached and he had another wound on his thigh as well as numerous bruises and a shivering reaction to his plight they had left him a plate of bread and a jug of wine after a mouthful he began to feel a little better on the table lay the ships logbook and his journal he remembered taking them from his rifled cabin they had also left him tinder and a candle end he fished in his pocket his dollond glass was still there together with a small penknife he drew out the latter and prised out its tiny blade elizabeth had given it to him for a moment he sat regarding it mistily fighting off an impulse to weep he had a second draught of the raw wine and while the shaking of his hands subsided he fought to strike flint on steel and catch a light to the candle it took him several minutes but he felt much better as he made himself work pulling off his shirt he removed the tails and tore them into squares using the wine to clean the superficial headwounds scouring them each until some subtle change in their hurt told him no purulent matter adhered to the tissue feeling bolder he set to work on his thigh like those on his forearm the cut was raised hot and inflamed gritting his teeth he pulled the wound open releasing a glair flood of matter and shuddering with the pain of the thing when he had mastered himself he heated the knife blade he knew he should perform curettage that much he had learned from m masson the surgeon of admiral villeneuves flagship the bucentaure only thus could all the morbid flesh killed by the weapon be removed his own surgeon lallo did not believe the theory poohpoohing it for gallic nonsense and regarding drinkwater suspected his own enthusiasm to be verging on the treasonable the knife sizzled on his flesh sending up a disgusting stink as he watched his own body burn only when the pain became unbearable did he stop sweat pouring off him as his muscles contracted into a rigor of agony he poured wine across the gaping redness and bound his leg with a piece of shirt then he turned his attention to his arm when he had finished he felt a curious shift in the nature of his pain the insistent throbbing had eased replaced by the sharp almost exhilarating tingling of butchered nerveends the former had throbbed with the rigadoon of death the latter the invigoration of life daylight had come by the time he had finished carefully he edged the table nearer the tiny window and gritting his teeth he clambered up on it he found he could see out quite easily he knew instantly where he was and the halfacknowledged familiarity of the ascent of the previous evening came back to him between his prison and the distant mountains to the east the bay of san francisco harbour lay awash with mist the summits of the trio of islands yerba buena treasure island and alcatraz the island of pelicans rose like mountain tops above this low cloud so too did the masts of ships the halfrigged topgallants of patrician and close on either side the lower trucks of the spanish brigs it seemed to him extraordinary that he did not even know their names but this realisation was submerged in a greater horror from the jutting peak of patricians spanker gaff the damp folds of bunting lifted lazily in the beginnings of a breeze there were two flags the one flaunting above the other the red and gold of castile superior to the white ensign such a publicly visible token of his abject plight took his spirit to new depths he could not bear to look and in shifting his gaze saw other masts those of the merchant ships anchored off the town and wondered if the treacherous grants abigail starbuck lay amongst them but his eyes were drawn ineluctably back to his ship emerging steadily from the evaporating mist raising the dollond glass he focused it upon the battered rail and relived that terrible hour james quilhampton woke to the barking of a dog and was instantly on his feet rigid with damp and cold he and his men had spent a miserable night beside the cutter they had watched in utter dismay as the victorious spaniards had carried patrician out of the bay the shame of the british defeat seemed emphasised by the superior size of the captured ship but quilhampton had been granted little time for such fancy philosophising his party consisted of himself blixoe and his three privates marsden the carpenter and a boats crew of eight seamen who had been sent to recover the barge their situation was desperate they had no food or water and the mood of the men was by no means stable it did not take quilhampton long to realise that several of the cutters men were ripe for desertion and that his hold on the leadership of the little band was tenuous without a sword he felt naked and without his coat his wooden arm its articulation and belting exposed to the gaze of the curious made him feel doubly vulnerable they had escaped from the action unobserved rowed the cutter deep into the reentrant lagoon behind the bay and bivouacked after a fashion in the lee of the boat blixoe had shot two ducks and they had roasted the carcasses over a miserable fire hidden from observers in a small valley between the dunes after that they had slept blixoe and his marines on their guns when quilhampton awoke to the yelp of the dog the first thing he noticed was that the man approaching them did not seem alarmed at their presence this realisation put him on his guard and he called the others awake the newcomer sat astride a plodding donkey his large horny feet hanging almost to the ground he wore a dirty cotton suit his face grimy and unshaven beneath a battered widebrimmed hat he had a long knife at his belt carried a gun and quilhampton noticed across his curious wooden saddlebow a wineskin was slung trying to look casual quilhampton stood and wished the newcomer good morning the man reined in his burro and grinned letting fly a torrent of incomprehensible words and jerking his jutting chin from time to time in the direction of the open sea he appeared to end his address on an interrogative note quilhampton shrugged the stranger made the universal gesture of eating and then pointed in the direction of the village they had seen from the summit of the dunes the previous afternoon hes tellin us we can get food at the village sir muttered blixoe yes quilhampton nodded vigorously the stranger grinned and rubbed his right forefinger tip against the ball of his thumb quilhampton shook his head no he tried to remember scraps of spanish he had learned as a prisoner at cadiz three years earlier but his memory failed him as the strangers eyes became less friendly the man jerked the head of the burro round suddenly suspicious quilhampton had a sudden inspiration hey amigo agua he pointed at his mouth the mongrel was crouched as though guarding his masters retreat from these ragamuffin strangers growling defiance but the newcomer was not in a charitable mood he hefted his gun and kicked the donkey forward giving a short bark the dog turned and followed he had a wineskin said blixoe raising his musket no the powder in the pan flashed and the shot knocked the hat from the mestizos head his long legs kicked the donkey wildly and the overburdened beast broke into an awkward gallop hold your fire two more of the marines followed their sergeants lead the wineskin jolted or flung sacrificially from its perch plummeted to the ground while man donkey and dog disappeared whence they had come a howl of triumph went up and the seamen and marines began running forward realising what was happening quilhampton began to run too he reached the wineskin just as a seaman picked it up give it to me lacey he held out his hands the seaman looked around seeking support among his mates bollocks said someone behind quilhampton and lacey tore the plug from the neck of the leather bag and squirted the dark fluid expertly into his open mouth the act was a signal the men clustered forward and grabbed at the thing wine spilled about them and some reached eager mouths though none were satisfied quilhampton blixoe and marsden stood back from this unruly melee then something inside quilhampton snapped he strode forward swung his wooden arm and scattered the drinkers catching the wineskin as someone dropped it sernt blixoe get some order into these men you too mr marsden pull yourselves together and remember youre manowar men not scum he raged at them and they shamefacedly responded though one or two remained truculent blixoe got his men to shepherd them into a rough line now then thats better let me remind you im in command and i shall decide whats to be done well what is to be done sir sneered a man named hughes thats for me to decide quilhampton faltered what was to be done there would be food in the village and the inhabitants were nominally at least enemies the marines had their muskets and bayonets the seamen their knives marsden also had his tools only he himself was unarmed well i think the first thing to do is to secure some victuals in the village im sure we can persuade our friend to give a quantity of bread as well as the wine it was a feeble joke but it brought a laugh to unite them they turned and began to follow the tracks of the burro through the sand the royal navy had invaded california drinkwater stood as the bolts of his cell were withdrawn bread wine and fruit were brought in and he was reminded of imprisonment in cadiz in the days before the great battle off cape trafalgar he recognised his guard too for while the tray bearing his breakfast was carried by a halfbreed de soto stood in the doorway his face was expressionless and drinkwater met his gaze suddenly feeling his spirit must not submit you are dishonoured sir he snapped suddenly captain rubalcava has broke his parole a flicker of anger kindled in the officers eye as the last word suggested the gist of drinkwaters outburst he uttered a word to the mestizo who swung a bucket into the cell and retreated pulling the door behind himself with a crash of bolts but drinkwater felt a renewal of hope beyond the confines of the stone corridor he had heard a laugh a loud happy laugh and he knew instantly the very curve of the throat from which it had come he was in a cell below the commandants residence a bridewell for special guests of his excellency too precious to be mewed up in the common calabozo of san francisco well captain please sit down captain jackson grant speaking fluent and colloquial spanish motioned rubalcava to a seat he grinned at the dark and vicious face of the spaniard you have come to pay me eh grant laughed rubalcava nodded yes i have come to pay you you are short of men i have come to pay you in men the devil no i gave you intelligence of the british you said you were short of men capitán grant sure i said i was short of men i am short of men but im damned if i want men for what i told you i can get my own men in the first cathouse ashore grant shouted angrily you will take men capitán grant because that is what you are being paid damn you rubalcava i dont need men i can sail this hooker from here to baltimore with a mate and a cook rubalcavas mouth curved in a sneer you have a great reputation for bragging capitán you will take men as i give them the hell i will grant was on his feet rubalcava merely lifted his elegantly booted feet and put the red heels on grants table i want gold rubalcava gold we have not yet found el dorado capitán in the meantime you will settle for men otherwise shit man there is gold in california what the devil do you mean otherwise otherwise capitán grant we shall have to inform the authorities that you have been selling aguardiente to the natives the hell you will i bought the fucking stuff from the authorities i think you are mistaken capitán at least the authorities know nothing about the matter grant expelled a long frustrated breath you will regret getting the better of me rubalcava damn your insolence rubalcava smiled again perhaps capitán anyway i have six men for you all prime seamen just as you require six good god man you have a whole frigates crew imprisoned you could have let me have more than six for you to sell to the russians no no capitdn these are honourable prisonersofwar besides we need them to work cargo in the merchant ships rubalcava paused catching the americans eye or to dig for gold in the hills capitán eh grant laughed goodnaturedly oh sure captain rubalcava sure it is thirsty work discussing business capitán grant grant blew out a breath and reached for two glasses and a bottle of aguardiente he slopped a finger of the brandy into each glass and handed one to the spaniard to what do we drink then eh to the late nicolai rezanov eh capitdn grant and with his free hand rubalcava piously crossed himself requiescat in pace lieutenant quilhampton waved blixoes flanking party forward waiting with the main body in a slight hollow in the sand he watched blixoe and two of his marines edge forward approaching the strangely silent village the smoke of cooking fires rose into the air and the clucking of hens could be heard but the bark of a dog or the squeal of a child was suspiciously absent there was a sudden shout and sand spurted up around blixoes party a haze of smoke hung over the wall of a ramshackle hut and quilhampton could see the rough timber had been loopholed for small arms blixoe began to wriggle back in retreat there was a second volley and then a whoop ragged indians and halfcastes the tiny population of fishermen ran out of the hut and launched an impetuous charge across the beaten sand towards them they waved a few muskets and staves and pikes and they outnumbered the cutters crew quilhampton turned to his men but they were already in full flight he made a violent movement of his good hand to blixoe who needed no second bidding and twenty minutes later they had tumbled into the cutter and were pulling as hard as they could from the desultory shots and the shouted insults of the natives when they had opened the range they hung over their oarlooms and those of them that could laughed at the comic humiliation of their predicament others sat and pondered what was to be done it is gods will friends we shall have to make the best of it it is not the first time we have been torn from our places by the rough circumstances of existence for chrissakes you witless fool do you not know that a yankee packet is hell compared to old drinkwaters barky old drinkwater dont have a fucking barky sam so lets take derricks advice and make the best of it they say these yankees pay well and sail like witches and their women is handsome their land rich and we shall find the streets of baltimore paved with gold yes i heard the same kind of crap from a recruiting lieutenant somewheres well my lads so youve volunteered for service under the old stars and stripes the flag of liberty free trade and sailors rights and glad we are to welcome you all aboard the old abigail starbuck captain grant came on deck to review his new recruits clucking his tongue and pronouncing himself satisfied he delivered them to his chief mate it was towards evening when the bolts of drinkwaters cell were drawn back again don alejo arguello entered the tiny room and swept a bow at his prisoner capitán i am so sorry that you have been the misfortunate victim of the bad luck of war the misfortunes of war have little to do with it don alejo i had your words that captain rubalcava would not serve again capitán don alejo protested his tone exaggeratedly reasonable don jorge he is an officer of of energy of spirit he was on board with me one of the four fregatas that your navy attacked without declaration of war four years ago do not talk of civilisation capitán drinkwater drinkwater remembered the incident their lordships had despatched a force of four frigates to intercept a squadron of spanish cruisers homeward from montevideo with specie worth over a million pounds sterling their force had been so equal that the spanish commander rearadmiral don joseph bustamente had been compelled to fight to defend the honour of his flag a superior force would have achieved the same result which was to provoke madrid to declare war and have avoided the loss of many lives and the explosion of the spanish frigate mercedes governments could forget such things easier than the men whose lives they marked you understand capitán doña ana maria said you were simpatico where are my men don alejo and my officers is the surgeon allowed to attend the wounded capitán i forgot you are wounded i will have to send for i am all right don alejo snapped drinkwater it is my men i ask after my dear capitán don alejo shed some of his easy humour and his tone hardened we are civilised people they are being looked after and your officers they are in the charge of military officers come i will bring you ink and a pen and send you some meat we shall look after you good night and he was gone leaving drinkwater alone with his thoughts belay that sheet and settle down now pay attention we have only about ten leagues to sail to san francisco when we get there we can find out what has become of the ship and our shipmates then i will decide what to do whatever happens we will have to slip into the harbour unobserved either at night or in a fog i am relying on your loyalty thats all im hungry aye and thirsty you can belay that lubberly talk were all hungry and thirsty but tomorrow we will find water at least i bloody hope so for your sake lieutenant quilhampton ignored the sneer the boat rose and fell on the long pacific swells that were the aftermath of the recent gale and other more distant disturbances under its single lugsail the cutter made a good speed and the tiller kicked under his arm the day was leaching a golden glow across the western horizon behind them as they steered southeast and the first stars were visible against a clear rainwashed sky it was curious he mused how the merest chance could comfort a man and how insubstantial a foundation was required for hope but the disastrous loss of the ship seemed to satisfy some arcane and superstitious foreboding that had haunted him for so long that its fulfilment had come as something of a relief and so retrospectively ridiculous had the days events seemed that their escape was like an entracte this instant was reality this kick of the tiller this dying of the day and the chuckle of water along the boats strakes he sensed a curious and inappropriate contentment as of one having turned a momentous corner the episode on the beach had been one of desperation he was now engaged on something of purpose the boats course was his best chance of seeing catriona macewan once again and as his men dozed james quilhampton hummed gently to himself and beat time with his wooden hand upon the gunwhale of the cutter chapter fifteen prisoner mayjune time hangs heavily upon a lonely man who has suffered a great misfortune his troubles dominate his thoughts and disturb his attempts at sleep he relives the hours of his disaster in a knowingly fruitless attempt to reverse time he attempts to shift blame and then to acknowledge his own responsibility his mind deploys logic and then rejects it in favour of vague superstitious emotions which play on the very vulnerability of his isolation culpability seems his alone he has dared too much and providence has cut him down to size such solitary pits for the soul are dug by circumstance for every commander of ships in this drinkwater was no exception although logic told him the chain of bad luck began when the leak forced him to seek the shelter of a careenage superstition sought an earlier explanation the hanging at the nore the loss of the danish privateer the sighting of the strange ship off the horn the incident at masafuera even the worthless capture of the santa monica seemed but another malevolent step in a fantastic conspiracy by fate such fears dominant in the small hours could have been dispelled by a turn on the quarterdeck at dawn while the watch swabbed down and the smell of coffee blew about the ship the bluedevils was a misanthropy endemic among seaofficers but against which there were known specifics some men played instruments some invited company some diverted their minds by reading writing sketching some drank all relied upon the routines of the naval day to ameliorate their obsessive preoccupations some carried the dissolution of their lives within their characters some gave way to jealous fits some to violent abuses of their powers some bickered with their officers some immersed themselves in trivial matters and disturbed the tranquillity of their ships most ultimately coped because demands were put upon them that compelled them to submit to influences beyond their own passions cooped day after day in solitary confinement allowed no exercise beyond the tiny cell drinkwater went unrescued by routine or any demand upon his expertise with which to patch his spirit he was left alone with the wild fears of his imagination logic told him that he was guilty of misjudgement and incompetence and every view from his tiny window reinforced this opinion as he looked down upon his captured ship superstition told him he had been abandoned to his fate that dark unworldly spirits had been released by his actions from beyond the grave edouard santhonax laughed a great hollow laugh that brought him bolt upright from sleep and his old enemy melted into the gentle uncomprehending pity of his own wifes face how would elizabeth feel when she heard what would lord dungarth conclude what would john barrow think of him what will they say in england he whispered to himself they had become too used to victory but that was no good that was merely another excuse discontent had caused the leak and for that he alone was responsible for several days his mind revolved along this morbid orbit he sought consolation in the writing of his journal but after the harrowing experience of recording the events in the log he could put nothing in his private papers that did not reek of selfpity he began to dismiss in his mind all mitigating factors his own culpability began to assume its own stature and grow in his thoughts so that it threatened to unhinge him but in the end long experience of a solitary existence saved him the learnt disciplines of combating the bluedevils came to his rescue at first he stood upon the table and scanned the anchorage avoiding the sad sight of patrician he watched the merchant ships half a dozen of which he could just see the comings and goings of their boats the laboriously swept lighters that crabbed out to them like giant waterbeetles with the hides and tallow and assorted exports of the colony he could see among them the abigail starbuck a tallsparred handsome vessel as were all the latest american ships once he thought he saw jackson grant and once quite ridiculously the figure of the quaker derrick upon her deck it was that sighting that brought him to the recognition of his selfdeception it was clearly a ridiculous fancy he would have to take hold of himself although he had not mitigated his selfblame from that moment it ceased to be a passive response to his predicament and began to spur his resolution to transcend his plight he began to write in his journal and in doing so called up incidents of the previous days that were not directly connected with the loss of the patrician i realised the place of my imprisonment when i heard the laugh of doña ana maria he stopped writing as a thought struck him if grant had betrayed him to the spanish why had not grant told don josé of the death of rezanov and if he had why had the news not been communicated to the russians betrothed that laughter had been full of unalloyed joy the expectant irrepressible joy of someone expecting the arrival of a lover drinkwater recalled how her eyes had glowed as she had spoken of the russian he shook his head the time for such abstruse preoccupations was over he wrote on dismissing the matter for it made no sense to him and had no bearing on his fate he was woken next morning by the concussion of guns for an instant hope leapt into his heart but the noise answered somewhere to seaward resolved itself into an exchange of salutes he clambered up onto his table for a long time he could see nothing and then into his field of view and bringing up to an anchor slightly to seaward of the patrician was the heavy black hull of a russian lineofbattleship james quilhampton had seen her the previous day from the rocks of a small and insignificant headland a few miles north of the entrance to san francisco in the little cove behind him the cutter lay drawn up on the beach while from the wooded slope that rose behind the strip of sand came the dull sound of an axe occasionally the snap of a musket betrayed blixoes hunting party they had crept into the cove to hide and recruit their strength while quilhampton decided what to do sweet water streamed out of the dense woods and they slaked their thirst and rinsed the salt from their clothes and bodies that night they bivouacked in the fragrant undergrowth and loafed the following morning away waiting for the night in the late afternoon they had sighted the big ship coming down from the northward from the little promontory quilhampton saw she was a twodecked manofwar blackhulled and flying the dark diagonal ensign of russia it seemed the final bar on the stronghold of the enemy setting awry his carefully made plan ordering the men to spend another day in idleness he languished in indecision but game and water were plentiful and the fresh meat emboldened him when the next evening blixoe came to him for orders he had decided to throw everything to hazard very well he said as they lay back round the fire licking their fingers clean of the juice of venison this is what i intend that we do and if any man will not gamble on the outcome he is free to take his chance quilhampton wanted none but willing spirits with him his fears were vindicated he had no doubt this was the ship they had seen off cape horn and now she arrived like nemesis through his glass he saw the twinkle of gold braid upon her quarterdeck saw her entry manned and the spanish officer board her he could hear the faint piping shriek of the calls given in the british style by officers who had trained with the royal navy drinkwater remembered admiral hanikovs fleet in the north sea in the summer of and wondered whether this ship had come direct from kronstadt or had been detached from seniavins adriatic squadron he saw too the procession of boats leave the side of the russian ship and half an hour later heard the sound of voices speaking french pass below his window russian officers ascending the path that wound upwards to the residence from the boat jetty and the battery below surely now the news of the death of rezanov would be made known to doña ana maria to his recovering mind the preoccupation offered a point of focus beyond his own unhappiness capitán i have the honour to present prince vladimir rakitin of his imperial majestys ship suvorov drinkwater gave a short and deliberately frigid bow although he was curious about the russian his incarceration had made him angry and he fixed his eyes on don josé don josé i protest at the dishonour you have done to me where are my officers why have you not permitted a surgeon to visit me or allowed me to exercise what have you done with my people i had always thought the spanish a civilised nation i am mortified to find myself so recently a guest at your table treated with every courtesy due an honourable enemy employed on a mission of humanity suddenly deprived of the courteous formalities of war you are sir guilty of having condoned the breaking of the terms of exchange by captain rubalcava and his men drinkwater felt invigorated by the cathartic effects of this outburst he felt washed clean of the selfpity that had nearly drowned him in his confinement now there were other causes to fight exposures to make before this newly arrived ally of the spanish authorities he turned towards the russian officer i am sure that his imperial majestys navy would not have treated the courtesies of war with such disdain he bowed with an exaggerated politeness to the russian officer both don josé and his brother were angry they understood the gist of his wordy accusation although they wore smiles and made gestures of incomprehension for a moment drinkwater expected to be conducted peremptorily back to his cell but it seemed that he had been brought here for other reasons capitán said don alejo don jorge rubalcava is a zealous officer you see i know the word from reading your newspapers it is perhaps that he has been again the ritual of shrugging much revenge to you but well you are our enemy england is don alejo waved towards the doorway and across the terrace upon which drinkwater had waited the summons to meet the commandante all those days ago the gesture was redolent of vast insurpassable distances and you tell us you come to make war for russia don alejo smiled and looked in the direction of rakitin yes captain you are come to make war on our posts in north america eh drinkwater turned the russian was a man of middle height with a powerful physique deepset eyes overhung by shaggy brows and a coarse sabrewound upon his chin his tightbuttoned blue tunic with its double row of gilt buttons was closed to his chin and heavy bullion epaulettes fringed his shoulders he wore white breeches and heavy topboots his plumed hat was tucked beneath his arm and he was attended by a tall lieutenant and a pair of midshipmen who lounged languidly with the air of bored courtiers their eyes only casually registering drinkwaters presence as though at some minor entertainment offered by a country cousin to visiting townsfolk i have my orders captain yes rakitin turned and with a formally whitegloved hand patted a small pile of documents on the table beside him drinkwater flushed scarlet he had failed to secure his secret instructions now they had fallen into the enemys hands suddenly it did not seem relevant that they were imprecise and vague he had let his orders and instructions his code and signal books fall into the hands of the enemy a void opened in his stomach and he made an effort to control himself don alejo was smiling at him drinkwater drew himself up and affected to ignore the supercilious spaniard you speak excellent english captain rakitin perhaps i can say that i have found no defence on earth effective against dishonourable men the barb went home don alejos smile vanished but drinkwater found little comfort in rakitins reply i learnt to speak english in your navy captain drinkwater the russian answered in a chilling bass where i also learned that british officers do not do these things rakitin paused to let the meaning of his words sink in watching with satisfaction the colour drain from the englishmans face but you have no further use for them now you are a prisoner you have failed rakitin turned away dismissively drinkwater felt as though he had been struck shaking violently from a hopeless anger he was led out of the room he scarcely saw his surroundings as he stumbled beside his escort across a courtyard to the steps which led to his cell below the stables a dark shape swam mistily into his vision and then the viragoface of doña helena was thrust into his she wore an expression of triumph her tiny eyes blue chips of vindictiveness so god has delivered his enemies into our hands her vulturine swoop had halted drinkwater he pulled himself upright suddenly recovering himself before this haggard crone he mustered all the dignity of which he was capable and remembering the old womans office said please convey to doña ana maria my sincere condolences upon her tragic loss and as he swept her aside he felt a small satisfaction that the words had come as a surprise and caught her at a disadvantage drinkwater had been imprisoned before in the hectic days before the great battle off cape trafalgar on his way in a small coasting vessel to command one of nelsons battleships he had been captured and thrown into a filthy gaol in the spanish town of tarifa from there he had been taken to cadiz transferred to the custody of the french and interrogated by admiral villeneuve commanderinchief of the combined fleets of france and spain see during this period there had been a suffocating sense of frustration at the illluck of falling captive and angry railing against fate in which selfrecrimination was absent but he had been within the orbit of great events events which were gathering a momentum in which his circumstances might be rapidly altered now however the hopelessness of his situation was absolute there was no likelihood of sudden advantage he could expect no support no intervention no miraculous rescue his ship was taken his mission exposed his people scattered beyond recall he was utterly ruined having so conspicuously failed in his duty in his heart he knew that providence had deserted him and that there was only one course of action open to an honourable man for hours after his humiliating interview with the commandante don alejo and prince rakitin he paced his cell from time to time his fingers sought the pocketed shape of his penknife resolved at last he tore a page from his journal and began to write his report to the admiralty was a model of brevity recording the essential facts without mentioning the disloyalty of his men the cause of the leak or the overwhelming numbers of the enemy neither did he mention the breaking of their parole by rubalcava and his men nor the inhuman treatment he had been subjected to for fear of don josés destroying the despatch when it was discovered afterwards as he wrote the superscription he knew it only necessary to record the end of patrician and his own career he sealed the folded paper with a blob of candlewax tore out another sheet and dipping his pen wrote my dearest elizabeth then his nerve failed him and he sat staring into the empty air fighting back the waves of sick despair that threatened to engulf him he found he could not conjure the image of his wifes face in his imagination it seemed their enforced estrangement lay like a great barrier between them perhaps he thought his death would be the easier to bear as for his children he threw aside the thought and drew the penknife from his pocket opening the blade and staring at the dull shine of it he had no idea how long he sat in this cataleptic state daylight faded and the cell was in darkness when he heard the lock grind in a cautious tripping of its levers he was instantly alert to the possibility of treachery to take his own life as the only recourse open to him was one thing to be foully murdered by his captors was another not to be submitted to without a struggle he gripped the tiny knife and rose to his feet beyond the door he heard a whisper to his astonishment it was a womans voice capitán please you give your word of honour you will not make to run away i must speak with you he knew the voice instantly recalled her spectacular beauty and felt his heart hammer painfully in his breast her tone was insistent foolhardy si señorita i understand you have my word how had she obtained the keys was she being used and was he about to die in circumstances that had been contrived to compromise not only his professional but his personal honour his fist crumpled the unwritten letter to his wife then the bolts drew and the door swung suddenly inwards she came inside a wild perfumed swirl of dark brocade to lean on the door swiftly closed behind her capitán her voice was uncertain in the darkness of the cell he could see the paleness of her skin and the heaving of her breast as he crossed to the table to strike a flint and steel slipping the penknife into his pocket pardon señorita i was not expecting a guest the sarcasm did him good driving the gloom from his mind the tinder caught and he lit the candle stump the flame rose brilliant and he turned towards her holding it in front of him she drew in her breath sharply and he realised his appearance was unprepossessing he rubbed his bearded cheek a razor is not permitted the incongruity of the remark almost made him laugh considering what he was about to attempt with his penknife blade and then he saw the state she was in the candlelight danced in eyes that were full of tears and the heaving of her breast was not due to the excitement of her strange tryst with an enemy officer or the animal stench of his quarters señorita what is it what is the matter capitán what is it that you mean by your words to doña helena it is not true tell me it is not true he frowned then drew out the chair for her she shook her head the candle caught the tears flung from her eyes the dark shadow of a wave of hair fell across her forehead too hurriedly put up señorita prince vladimir arrived today but nicolai is not with him i ask where is nicolai and rakitin says nothing she spat the russians name as though flinging it from her with contempt but i know his ship has come from the north he must know about nicolai she was weeping now he wanted to comfort her but dare not move he knew now that he had seen rakitins ship off the horn and that in the interval the russian had been north to the tsars settlements on the coast of alaska what does your father tell you he asked gently she shook her head trying to speak through her grief nothing don alejo promises nicolai will come on the juno as before she threw up her head but i do not believe don alejo she said in a voice which conveyed the impression that she did not trust her uncle and then you say that thing to doña helena there was a pause and then she added in a lower voice a voice that spoke of confidentiality and trust she would not believe you drinkwater sighed the honour was one he could have done without at such a moment señorita i do not know that i can tell you the truth i can only tell you what i have myself been told he paused and motioned her again to the chair this time she moved slowly from the door and sank onto it there was the faintest breath of air through the cell reminding drinkwater that the door was open for a moment he was a prey to emotions as savage as those which tore at the young woman i was told that nicolai rezanov was dead he said flatly the finality of the word seemed to staunch the flow of tears truth was drinkwater thought as he held her gaze always easier to face than uncertainty i may have been misinformed told wrong i hope señorita that i have been a ghost of a smile crossed her face and her fingers rested lightly upon his hand who told you capitán an american captain jackson grant he saw her pupils contract and her nostrils flare with anger and he sensed her resolution a sudden hope sprang into his mind i know he is not to be trusted did he not come here to see your father and betray me perhaps she frowned yes yes he was here i heard he knew where your ship was then he is not to be trusted drinkwater said hopefully he is a man who seeks for himself one perhaps who would be in nicolai rezanovs place he added in a lower voice she flashed him a look of imperious suspicion then her expression softened and you capitán she asked raising her fingers from his hand where do you wish to be are you to be trusted i can only tell you what i have been told señorita i would not cause you distress i have nothing all i know is that you expected rezanov and he has not come rakitin is silent but jackson told me he died in krasnoiarsk yes that was the place he was a good man capitán can you comprehend that yes grant said that but she seemed not to hear him a good man perhaps a saint not like rakitin again the utterance of the russians name disgusted her it appeared that rakitin had joined the list of doña ana marias wouldbe and unwanted suitors she let out a long shuddering sigh and in my heart i know he is dead she crossed herself and drinkwater put his hand gently upon her shoulder the warmth of her flesh seemed to sear him she looked up at him for a long moment so that the temptation to bend and kiss her flared across his brain and then she rose and the moment was gone gracias capitán you have been you have your own misfortune i shall pray for you drinkwater recalled the papal attitudes to suicide you do me too much honour señorita pray for my wife and children she paused in the act of turning for the door in the gloom of the cell her dark dress and the black pile of her hair merged into the shadows so that the single light of the candle threw her face into a spectral detachment which seemed to diminish from his vision as in a dream and he stood long after her departure with its lovely image imprinted on his retina unaware of the grind of the bolts or the tumbling of the lock whom the gods wish to destroy he quoted softly to himselfthey first make mad chapter sixteen the despatch vessel junejuly he did not go mad the appearance or perhaps the disappearance of doña ana maria saved him from himself he no longer paced like a lion confined in the tower menagerie but stood stockstill held in that cataleptic state familiar to commanders of ships whose duty requires their presence on deck long after the exhausted body is capable of sustaining it they stand as drinkwater stood now immobilised faculties reduced to the barely necessary like a submerged whale eyes open yet in a strange detachment all but lost to exterior circumstances so that they endure cold and sleeplessness unaware of cramps or the passage of time though instantly ready to respond to sudden emergency in this condition the mind behaves oddly ranging over vast plains of consideration soaring above mountains of fantasy and pausing beside dark lakes of doubt dispensing with the formality of language and encompassing thoughts and images beyond the powers of expression drinkwaters thoughts came and went slipped in and out of rationality leapt deep chasms of pure reason and became part of an infinite consciousness beyond himself in this enchantment drinkwater slipped the bonds of honour and reaffirmed his faith in providence all thoughts of suicide left him and it seemed he felt as he had once before felt when lost in a small boat in the fog of the greenland sea a haunting intimacy with elizabeth and his family he remained in this state for many hours even when the candle stump expired with an upward and pungent twist of smoke he did no more than acknowledge the onset of total blackness without it moving him in this trance the night passed and grey dawn filtered in through the barred window of his cell before he came to himself shuddering with the cold and the pain of movement as he returned to full consciousness but it was more than dawn that had woken him his seamans instincts had been stirred by distant noises in the fading night the splash of an anchor a few shouts and later the noise of impatient boots upon the steps that ran up from the boat landing somewhere below his cellwindow they echoed in the corridor beyond his barred door and he heard the guard accosted and then the sounds faded he dragged the chair to the window and strained to peer below the harbour was still the gentle ruffling of the slight breeze had kept the usual morning fog away enabling the newcomer to work into the anchorage close under the residence she was a schooner an aviso a spanish despatchvessel with tall raked masts and the look of speed about her from where had she come monterey san diego panama and what news did she bring that was so urgent that her commander must bring her in so early and wake the commandantes household did it concern him was he perhaps to be taken south or disposed of in some spanish oubliette inexplicably he felt his longstilled pulse begin to race the noises died away and there followed a silence so full of suspense that it set him to a frustrated and angry pacing in which his mind now boiled with possibilities for an hour he was a prey to such mental toil that the soothing effects of his catalepsy had evaporated by the time the sun had risen and the blood noise rushed through his ears so that he almost missed the sounds of departure feet running hastily upon the path below he reoccupied his spypost and saw the avisos boat pull out from the jetty and watched it go not to the schooner but to the suvorov later it returned and he heard the low sinister bass of rakitin grumbling at the commandantes summons and the ungodly hour then a little later still the hasty retreat of the russians boots and silence the turning of the lock and shooting of bolts startled him when it came he halfexpected release so strung were his nerves but it was only the grimy sleepsodden orderly who brought him bread thin wine and an empty slop pail as he had done on so many many previous mornings the familiarity of the ritual backed by the drawn sword of an officer outside cast drinkwaters spirit into depression but he could not eat and jumped upon the chair yet again when the thin reedy piping of the bosuns calls preceded the stampandgo of a hundred feet in the heartwrenching procedure of departure rakitin had learned much from the royal navy watching from a distance drinkwater might have been looking at a british manofwar getting under weigh and in his mind he could hear the orders passed as the topmen went aloft and the topsails were cast loose in the buntlines their clews hauled out on the high steeved bowsprit of the suvorov men scrambled casting loose the robands that secured the jibs on the focsle men leaned outboard fishing with the cattackle for the anchor ring as it broke surface under the round black bow of the russian seventyfour and then he suddenly realised with a pang that sent an actual stab of pain through his guts his own patrician was also getting under weigh there were fewer men and it was clumsily done but within the hour she was slipping out of his view following in the wake of the suvorov the last he saw of her as she swung to round point lobos was her white st georges ensign only it was no longer subordinate to the red and gold of spain now above it flaunted the diagonal cross of russia lieutenant james quilhampton had intended making the entrance to san francisco bay in the last hours of the night the appearance of a light northerly breeze augured well and they had begun from their refuge in good time to be within the harbour by dawn intending to holeup on one of the islands and reconnoitre the shipping during the coming day but they were turned back by the arrival of a fast schooner whose commander beat up under the headland of bonita point before wearing for the anchorage below the battery near point lobos this obstacle had cost them time but caution dictated a retreat and the patricians boat was put reluctantly about for the sanctuary of the hidden bay quilhampton fumed at the delay he had made his preparations with great care although his resources were limited he knew that much depended on success everything in fact not least his very life and his future he wished he had not sent that final letter to catriona to have someone however distant to whose image a man might cling in such desperate moments in his life seemed to him a most desirable thing but it would not have been fair to catriona and god alone knew she had been illtreated by neglect for too long already i am stripped to the most indigent circumstances he muttered to himself as he cooled his heels on the little curve of sand within the cove stripped to the very last resort of the naked the phrase pleased him oddly it comforted him to come facetoface with absolute desperation he held his life cheap now and that meant he could undertake any enterprise smiling grimly to himself he looked up swinging his eyes to rake the small arc of the horizon visible between the two rocky headlands that concealed their hideaway what he saw destroyed his resolution two ships stood out to sea heading north their crews making sail as they lay over on the starboard tack the leading vessel was the big black russian twodecker the other he was certain was the patrician quilhampton frowned what the devil did it mean should he go on into san francisco or follow the two ships he swore venomously if drinkwater and his people were aboard the patrician it was out of the question for quilhampton with a handful of men in an open boat to give chase he was utterly without resources the mood of his men was not encouraging in short the mere consideration of such an enterprise was as foolhardy as it was impractical but was the alternative any better the plentiful game and easy living of the last few days had prompted muttering from the men if they had the opportunity of spirits and access to women his control over them would be broken utterly and any approach to san francisco however made risked that and what could he do if he got there with captain drinkwater and some of patricians men they might have attempted something but with the ship and presumably drinkwater himself carried off under russian escort what was the point of running his head into a noose sighing he looked up beyond the headlands of the cove the seahorizon was empty a sudden panicky fluttering formed in the pit of his gut and he felt a desperate surge of selfpity for a moment the horizon misted and then he forced a wave of anger to overlay the hideous sensation reluctantly he turned away from the sea and made his way up the tiny valley behind the cove there really was no alternative open to him he would have to give himself up to the spanish authorities that way he might survive the mutinous knives of his men some time after the departure of patrician drinkwater fell into a profound sleep his exhausted body seeking its revenge upon his shattered spirit he woke ten hours later cramped and racked with pain in the mangled muscles of his mauled shoulder but oddly alert and with his mind calmer than it had been for many days there was no reason for this feeling beyond a halfremembered fragment of chill philosophy he could not recall its source epictetus perhaps or marcus aurelius the only classical reading he had ever found aboard a manofwar but the text soothed him nothing the ancient averred happens to any man which he is not formed by nature to bear the pegs upon which men hang their reason are oddly illogical but drinkwater put behind him all thoughts of suicide from that moment and sat quietly in the gathering darkness of the approaching night in such a mood a man might escape or be shot he heard the footfalls on the stone flags of the corridor there were several of them and they approached purposefully there was nothing furtive about the way the lock was sprung or the bolts withdrawn by the time the door was flung open and de soto entered the cell with a lantern drinkwaters heart was pounding de soto jerked his head imperiously and drinkwater rose adelante de soto stood aside and indicated drinkwater should step outside apprehensively he did as he was bidden the cool nightfresh air wafting along the corridor sweet in his nostrils the officer was accompanied by two soldiers bearing muskets with bayonets fixed they began to walk drinkwater with them to where the corridor turned and joined the entrance gate through which the men from the boats had passed but he was not taken to be shot they crossed the courtyard and entered the commandantes quarters where once it seemed so long ago he had dined in honour and now was brought in ignominy he had hoped for an interview with don josé but it was before don alejo that he found himself from various shreds of evidence from their first encounter on the santa monica to the innuendoes of don alejos niece drinkwater had conceived a dislike of the spaniard he was as slippery as an eel interested solely in his own intrigues whatever they were if drinkwater had been hoping for some relaxation in his regimen he was to be disappointed don alejos remarks were obscure and not reassuring ah capitán drinkwater i see you are in good health buenas don alejo smiled like a cat ignoring the stink of his prisoner the unshaven face the filthy neck linen we have been waiting for instructions from panama what the hell have you done with my ship capitán please she is not your ship she fell a prize to the valour of spain where the hell has she gone under escort to a place of safety don alejos eyes narrowed how do you know about your ship drinkwater evaded the question he did not want his tiny window stopped up i am not a fool you have also received news don alejo this i know that an aviso arrived this morning ah but no news about you capitán i regret don alejo i demand that at the very least you accommodate me in quarters befitting my rank that you oblige me by placing me under parole that you allow me to shave to see my officers and men capitán you are not in your quarterdeck please the spaniards voice was harsh cruel it is not possible if i ever have the opportunity to lay even with you don alejo the spaniard had been sitting on the corner of a heavy oak table one booted leg swinging his manner disinterested now he came to his feet face to face with his prisoner do not threaten me capitán you have nothing to make me fear you have no men no guns nothing he jerked his head at the guards and snarled something incomprehensible drinkwater was marched out still wondering why he had been summoned they were crossing the courtyard when they met doña ana maria and her duenna seeing him she smiled sadly a happy day capitán for you he frowned was she mocking him for me señorita how so de sotos forbearance snapped and he disregarded the speakers rank and connections shouting the girl to silence and propelling drinkwater suddenly forward with a blow on his shoulder that sent a wave of agony through him he stumbled and all but fell the pain blotting out all sensibility until he found himself once more in his cell and heard the heavy final thud of bolts driving home it was only then that he tried to make some sense out of the interview and its inexplicable sequel easy lads easy the boat ghosted along only a whisper of water under her bow accompanied by the drip of water from the motionless oarblades the dark hull of an anchored ship loomed over them it was one of the anchored merchantmen and the noise of a squeezebox and some languidly drunken singing came to them lights shone from her stern cabin and a gale of laughter told where her master entertained the germ of an idea formed in lieutenant quilhamptons brain but this vessel was too big by far perhaps they would find something smaller more suitable further into the anchorage he did not have to surrender at least not yet the need for caution receded now they were in the anchorage there were other boats about ferrying libertymen to and from their ships it was a contrast to the naval anchorages he was familiar with where the fear of desertion made every ship row a guard and the passage of boats at night was strictly controlled he began to relax to cast about for a likely target a small ship like a schooner easily manageable by a handful of desperate men if he could strike quickly divert his mens minds away from the thought of stews and whores he might he just might sir the man at bow oar hissed in the darkness what listen sir he heard the voice immediately hold water he commanded and when the boat lay stopped he cocked his ear again getting his bearings the querulous voice was indisputably yankee well friend he was here but a minute ago perhaps he pisseth against a wall jesus i thought you motherfuckers were supposed to be seamen i aint a whit surprised the british are losing ships if theyre driven to manning em with canting quakers you tell him to lay aft when hes finished for chrissakes thou takest too much in vain the lords name friend a snigger of recognition came from the oarsmen half amused half admired at the quakers undaunted attitude if derrick was aboard the ship under whose stern they had stopped who else might there be or had derrick deserted alone prompted by those ridiculous pacifistic views of his the questions tumbled through quilhamptons mind and he leaned forward give way easy lads and keep deathly quiet he whispered and the oars dipped into the water again in the stern quilhampton pulled the tiller hard against his chest and swung the boats bow towards the abigail starbuck oars the men ceased rowing and the boat glided on a tinkling sound could be heard and peering ahead quilhampton caught the faint silver arc of urine falling from the height of a ships forechains as the boat slid under the bulk of the ships hull he saw against the slightly lighter darkness of the sky the shape of a man buttoning the flap of his trousers as the boat got closer and the man turned inboard his face was suddenly illuminated caught with one foot on the rail as he swung round he paused i heard him said a deepburred and familiar voice a right bloody bucko bastard of a yankee dandy quilhampton drew a breath if the man holding the lantern was not derrick or there were others within earshot they might be ruined but the moment was not to be lost and the occupants of the boat were all registering recognition and surprise so that their own silence could not be relied upon tregembo quilhampton hissed looking up quilhampton saw the man turn and peer down saw a second head and a lantern put the fucking light out said one of the oarsmen tregembo its me mr quilhampton by gar quick derrick ower we go afore that yankee sees us wait are there more of you aye but dont wait zur tregembo was already clambering over the side though derrick appeared to hesitate the cornishman his legs dangling from the chains seeking a foothold in the boat looked up come on damn ee you can pull an oar if you cant fight someone stood and reached up tregembo fell heavily among grunts from his shipmates and the boat rocked dangerously and then derrick was following and a minute later the longboat was pulling cautiously off into the darkness when sufficient distance had been put between them and the abigail starbuck quilhampton ordered them to cease rowing lay aft tregembo and report willingly zur tregembo struggled down the boat as the men pulled aside for him until his scarred grizzled and dependable features peered into quilhamptons face thank god you came zur id been meditating on swimming ashore once i knowed where theyd got the capn where is he tregembo d you know aye zur mister derrick e found out that was the yankee hellship abigail sommatorother and if her mate hadnt had a whore in his bunk wed not have had the liberty for a piss to remind us we were free men the captain tregembo hes a prisoner in the governors residence put in derrick i overheard the mate and captain grant discussing the matter when the patrician left harbour this morning i saw that quilhampton cut the quaker short do you know the way to this residence its above the boat jetty zur where we was anchored before very well standby give way together as the boat once more gathered way james quilhampton turned her in for the shore conjuring up from his memory the lie of the land above the landingjetty drinkwater shut the log and doused the candle as he heard the key turn cautiously in the lock it seemed an age before the bolts were drawn back by which time her appearance did not surprise him capitán here señorita you do not know the news they did not tell you not even my father i have not seen your father señorita ahhh she seemed relieved but what news is this ana maria the voice of doña helena rasped anxiously through the night and the hurried tap of her questing feet approached please capitdn you go now for our honour you must go it is not right but i do not understand you will be in trouble there is no need please capitán she beseeched him and he heard the prattle of the duennas voice suddenly louder rattling something to someone else in quick urgent spanish he heard the lugubrious tone of the franciscan father and then their shadows leapt large along the wall of the corridor vamos go quick she stood aside and the priest loomed in the doorway as doña helena screeched something for the briefest fraction of a second indecision held the four of them in a trance and then drinkwater acted the priest held up an imperious hand but drinkwater brushed him aside and made for the end of the corridor the guard was nowhere to be seen perhaps too long acquaintance with the english captain had made them careless perhaps doña ana maria had bribed them he neither knew nor troubled to think of it only an iron gate separated him from the terraced garden of oleanders and orange trees through which the path to the boatjetty led downwards it was unlocked flinging it open he began to run his muscles cracking under the unaccustomed strain of rapid descent quilhampton remembered the battery that lay between the boatjetty and the residence above it was not on the direct path but lay off to the right occupying a natural bastion an outcrop of rock behind which earthfalls had filled in a roughly level area which the hand of man had improved with stone flags so that it supported heavy cannon mounted behind embrasures of stone he knew it would be guarded and his approach to the jetty was conducted with caution he was astonished therefore when the noises of pursuit of shouting and brief glimpses of lights came from above and as the bowman jumped ashore with the boatpainter he considered immediate withdrawal but the knowledge that drinkwater himself was up there somewhere made him stay his hand he had quizzed both derrick and tregembo concerning the disappearance of the ship they both agreed she had been carried off under russian colours in full view of all the merchantmen anchored in the harbour but he was unable to shake them from their conviction that drinkwater had remained in san francisco a prisoner of the spanish authorities it occurred to quilhampton that both men had a personal interest in the fate of the captain and both were comparatively indifferent to that of the ship herself if their information was correct and he had judged their motives correctly then perhaps fortune might be persuaded to turn in their favour the noises coming from above certainly indicated that she was not running in the favour of their enemies a shot rang out perhaps from the battery and the string of lights and the noise of pursuit came lower down the hillside whoever was running was important enough to warrant a fullscale attempt at recapture sergeant blixoe your best shot to try and hit the leading lantern as soon as he can very good sir there was a stir of excitement in the boat and quilhampton said sing lads sing loud and clear sing spanish ladies sing damn you it was a faltering start and they had no clue as to quilhamptons crazy idea but something infectiously insane about his own cracked and tuneless voice made them join him farewell and adieu to you spanish ladies farewell and adieu to you ladies of spain they could afford to sing in english and indicate their presence to whoever was crashing through the bushes above them with musket balls singing into the night after him there were enough americans in port to justify a drunken outburst and no one on a clandestine mission would betray their presence with such impunity what would happen if they had to suddenly conceal themselves again did not occur to quilhampton he had staked all on a single throw arguing that only one man could be important enough to chase with such energy it simply never occurred to him otherwise beside him the kneeling marine fired the snap and flash of the musket punctuated the old seasong causing a missed beat but they picked it up again orders to sail for old england and we hope in a shorttime to see you again drinkwater heard the singing taking comfort from the sound of drunken seamen that indicated the probable presence of a boat below if there had been no boat he would have made for the town where the merchantmens boats lay but the sound of so ancient a seasong beckoned him and he tripped and stumbled as the first bullet whined past him it is difficult to hit a target downhill easier to fire upwards but the shot that he saw from below made him check his flight for a moment he was confused then he heard an anguished roar from above and his heart leapt with hope it was impossible but surely whoever fired that lone shot had been aiming at his pursuers he did not consider the matter an instant longer but plunged headlong downwards quilhampton saw the figure the second it broke cover from the undergrowth and challenged them who the hell are you the voice was recognisable the raw rasp of it familiar to men whom it had commanded for five years and more friends captain hurry mr q the same sir well met by heaven into the boat quick why this is patricians cutter they tumbled into the boat blixoe firing another shot at the spaniards who were but a few yards behind drinkwater the oarsmen needed no special bidding to effort they had swung the boat round and bent to their task with backbreaking energy that made the oarlooms bend and crack under the strain theres a longwaisted spanish avisoschooner hardby mr q drinkwater pointed into the night where two raked masts were just perceptible against the sky and i judge most of her people to be ashore aye aye sir knives and footstretchers lads were almost up to her are you reloaded mr blixoe weve two cartridges that aint spoiled sir cold steel then quilhampton turned to drinkwater ive no sword sir nor me james and then they bumped alongside the low hull of the schooner and were scrambling up her side finding toeholds on her gunsills and swinging their legs over the rail the anchor watch had been alerted by the shots ashore no more than two hundred yards away but they had made the error of going and reporting the matter the aviso had been left in the hands of a young midshipman newly out from spain and her crew were largely mestizos unused to real action on a great ocean that their employers were apt to consider their own exclusive preserve only the midshipman put up a fight to be skewered by blixoes bayonet for his gallantry within minutes the schooner had changed hands there were no boats at the jetty beyond a small dinghy with insufficient capacity for immediate pursuit but the precise circumstances of captain drinkwaters disappearance were somewhat confusing to the pursuers mixed as they were with treachery within the residence neither did the spanish immediately appreciate the danger their aviso lay in so that drinkwater and his companions were able to slip the cable of the schooner and make sail unmolested they felt the bow rise to the onshore swell from the mighty pacific as soon as they rounded point lobos the aviso heeled over as they belayed the halliards and drinkwater came aft to quilhampton at the helm how does she steer james like a witch answered quilhampton his eyes dancing in the light from the binnacle like a witch eh repeated drinkwater in a lower voice recalling another face lit from below by a poor glim how would she fare now he wondered and what was the fateful news that had caused her to liberate him it was then that it occurred to him that had they not killed the midshipman they might have discovered it too late now he muttered sadly yes quilhamptons voice agreed enthusiastically theyre much too late now to catch us drinkwater opened his mouth to explain thought better of it and grunted agreement dyou think we can find anything to eat aboard this hooker mr q chapter seventeen the virgin of fair weather july if the vicissitudes of the seaservice had thrown nathaniel drinkwater ignominiously out of one of the most powerful frigates in the royal navy then the inexplicable actions of a beautiful woman had restored him to a position of some influence he had hardly dared hope for such a sudden and apparently fortuitous reversal in his situation as had been precipitated by doña ana marias actions and consolidated by the appearance of james quilhampton and his forlorn hope the sudden easy taking of the schooner still struck him as an equally lucky link in the chain of events which had led him to liberty he had yet to learn that there was more of cause and effect and less of coincidence in these events than he then supposed but for the moment little could dull the relief and joy that filled him as he watched the dawn over the distant coast and shivered in the fresh westerly breeze that blew onshore and under the influence of which the narrow gutted schooner laid her seething course northwards drinkwater had to acknowledge that she was a smart fast and rakish craft her long low hull mounted twelve pounder carriage guns mere popguns that could serve to overawe native craft or a merchantman but amidships where traditionally she might have carried her boats she mounted a heavy carronade the spanish equivalent of a pounder he judged curiously rigged on a rotating slide somewhat in the manner of the mortars in the old bombvessel virago so that the gun might be brought to bear on a target on either side if due care were taken of the intervening rigging this powerful weapon gave drinkwater fresh cause for hope for with it he might yet achieve something worthwhile and there was only one task that demanded his relentless attention until it was accomplished the recapture of the patrician he looked aloft the two raked masts carried huge gaffrigged sails the after one was capable of bearing a maintopsail which he could set at full daylight when the watch changed for the time being he was content to act as officer of the watch as well as commander of his pathetically small crew still they seemed happy enough basking in their change of fortune and making free with the personal effects they had discovered on board properly drinkwater should have secured these but he was not kindly disposed towards the spanish of san francisco after the breaking of their parole the shameful way he had been held captive and the mature suspicion that don alejo and rubalcava at least were involved in some action which to them justified their dishonourable treatment of their prisoners besides the poor devils who had arrived with quilhampton had only the rags they stood up in and drinkwater was far too considerate of his mens welfare to let the conventions of protecting private property stand in the way of their wellbeing forward there a man named lacey stood up from where he had been huddling under the weather rail dodging spray sir ease the foresheets a little aye aye sir drinkwater eased the helm and the schooners head fell off the wind a point or two her long bowsprit pointing at a shallower angle to the line of the coast ease the mainsheet he said to the seaman who stood at the helm beside him he felt the pressure on the rudder ease as the sheaves squealed slightly with the strain on the heavy mainsheet shem a flyer sir said the man conversationally resuming his post at drinkwaters side and drinkwater agreed reflecting upon the alteration in their circumstances aboard the patrician the man would not have dared address his commander in such familiar tones here doing duty beside him it was the most natural thing in the world she certainly is potter and off the wind on a reach shell fly faster than the wind potter digested this intelligence with a frown but drinkwater did not expand upon this curiosity of natural law instead he sowed the seeds of his intentions now were well out of sight of the dons well close the coast again thatll be point reyes where we were cruising when we discovered that leak he pointed at the blue line of the californian shore ahhh potter nodded pleased to be taken into the captains confidence now what i think we should do potter is chase north and find out what those damned russians have done with our ship and shipmates drinkwater paused and looked sideways at the man an ableseaman and once rated captain of the foretop what dyou think of that eh few more mend be handy sir begging your pardon for saying so yes they would but weve got a fair wind a fast ship and at least one heavy cannon to play with and weve got something else potter surprise they fell silent again and then potter said sir that leak sir it were done apurpose drinkwater did not take his eyes off the horizon though he knew potter was eyeing him sidelong i know he said shortly then turned and smiled disarmingly at the seaman and id hang the scum that did it if i had proof potter but thats of no avail now do you cut along and call out the watch below its time you and i got some rest he took the helm and watched potter scuttle forward james quilhampton came on deck a few minutes later he was smiling broadly for it was a beautiful morning with clear visibility and a fresh breeze that made the blue seas turn white as they broke and from which a school of dolphins leapt and gambolled and ran in and out under the cutwater of the racing schooner morning sir morning james well set proper watches now you and tregembo marsden blixoe and one marine together with the four seamen ive just called to form the larboard watch ill head the starboard with the rest seventeen of us in all im going to locate the patrician if i can james and retake her we could do with a few more men for that sir remarked quilhampton drinkwater nodded yes potters just told me that but what we lack in men we might make up for with stealth and surprise not to mention that confounded great smasher amidships drinkwater grinned we are of one mind james here you are head in for the coast keep a sharp lookout for sails or masts ive no idea what those damned russians intend to do with the ship but i dont want to miss her for want of a pair of eyes very well sir im going below to get some sleep they coasted northwards for over a week without the sight of a single sail the year was well advanced and drinkwater supposed that merchant ships were either finishing their lading in alaskan waters and not yet ready to sail southwards or that russian ships loading provisions for the hardships of the northern winter had not yet departed from the spanish settlements of california then as they stood out to sea to round what the english navigators called cape disappointment but which on drinkwaters spanish chart bore no name at all they saw the masts of some ships hidden behind a low spit of land to the southward of the cape the mouth of the columbia river james hoist spanish colours and stand inshore well take a closer look it took them four hours to work their way up into the estuary of the river against a considerable current which fuelled by the melting snows of distant mountains to the eastward streamed out into the ocean with an impressive velocity but the schooner stood inshore and the low point to the southward opened slowly to starboard to reveal a shallow lagoon and a secondary headland from which the first grew in a long sandy spit this headland was covered with woods in which a clearing had been made and the stockade of a primitive fort erected above the fort flew the colours of tsar alexander i though neither of the two vessels at anchor were larger than brigs a russian settlement by heaven muttered drinkwater staring through his looted glass at the group of curious men drawn up by a pair of boats on the beach fetch us an anchor james close alongside the outer of those two brigs aye aye sir drinkwater watched quilhampton go forward his wooden arm hanging incongruously below the spanish uniform coat that was far too short for his long lean frame he grinned at the young man and caught the mood of high excitement that infected his men there were only a handful of them but they had had time to settle well and with the single exception of derrick were spoiling for a fight brail all quilhampton passed the agreed order quietly the jibs fell fluttering along the bowsprit with a rasp of their hanks on the stays and a man clambered leisurely out along the spar to restrain them with a roband or two while the main and foresails were brailed to the masts their gaffs standing spars against the current the schooner lost way and was brought to an anchor and a short scope of cable then they hauled the cutter alongside from its position towing astern with some show it was manned and a spanish boat ensign found and its staff stuck in the verdigrised brass ferrule in the cutters rudderstock wearing an oddly cockaded spanish bicorne drinkwater took his place in the stern a large lightcavalry sabre that he had found hanging on the schooners cabin bulkhead held between his knees a brace of primed cocked and loaded pistols lay on the stern sheets beside him while the oarsmen each had a cutlass from the schooners capacious armschest concealed beneath their thwarts they cleared the stern of the schooner and drinkwater looked up god bless my soul in a beautifully carved scroll worked beneath the cabin windows he read her name for the first time virgen de la bonanza several men caught the direction of his eye grinning at the first word which was comprehensible to them what the rest meant none of them knew drinkwaters face stiffened they were supposed to be masquerading as spaniards the group on the beach had grown by the time they reached it about a score of villainously bearded and greasily apparelled men stood idly watching them he took them all to be russians except perhaps one a late arrival wearing the buckskins and moccasins of a mountainman the likes of which he had once seen long ago in the loyalist militia in new york he was clearly something of a wonder to the others for they looked at him curiously drawing aside for him as he joined them drinkwater was close enough to observe these details for the next instant the boat grazed the sand and he rose to his feet drinkwater never had any thespian pretensions but his lack of familiarity with the spanish tongue had driven him to an almost risible extreme in an attempt to head off the slightest suspicion that he was anything other than spanish needs must when the devil drives he said to quilhampton when explaining his intentions and the mens laughter had been muted by the order that one of them was going to have to carry him piggyback ashore but it was at derricks suggestion that he bore the handkerchief a large ostentatious square of flowered silk that they guessed was a gift for the virgens captains paramour in panama the prominent manipulation of the kerchief alone ensured his disembarkation appeared alien enough and ironically he was glad of it himself when he caught the stench of the russians potter put him down with a relieved grunt and drinkwater the heavy sabre knocking his hip strode amongst the group of grim watchers and swept his hat from his head buenos días señors he bowed placed his hand on his breast and plunged on el capitán rubalcava del barco la virgen de la bonanza the name of his assumed identity and that of his ship sounded marvellously authentic and the latter allowed a spate of eloquence that he guessed disarmed any suspicions amid the dulleyed russians of the effect upon the frontiersman he was less sure he tried to recall the firstperson singular and managed only a squeal eee er dos san francisco he allowed himself to peterout and stare round at the men their eyes were blank with incomprehension no comprendez they stared back he turned to the mountainman he had blue eyes like the others but there was a narrowing of them a shred of suspicion in their cold appraisal drinkwater leaned forward with exaggerated latin effusiveness senor he asked directly no comprendez the man said slowly a spark of understanding formed in drinkwaters mind and he said quickly before the other revealed a perfect knowledge of spanish ahh señor muy amigo you spik english sí the man nodded drinkwater straightened took a step towards him and waved his handkerchief airily approaching the mountainman appearing to dismiss the assembled russians whose dull peasant wits watched this show as though it was a visitation by a dancing bear and they would presently be requested to reach for kopecks at which point they would scatter eet is good hey drinkwater plunged on narrowing his eyes and leaning forward again in a mannerism he had copied subconsciously from don alejo i come to find eenglish ship eenglishmen comprendez he bastardised the english words by elongation relapsing into the odd spanish word for punctuation with a speed he hoped continued to deceive the mountainman regarded him for some time a ruminative air about him as though he spoke little and when he did the words had to be dragged from him yeah comprendez i aint seed no ship but drinkwater drew back in disappointment with no news of patrician there was little point in risking his neck further but something about the mountainman held his attention he played the charade a step further aware that beyond the group and walking down from the direction of the stockade a uniformed officer and an escort of armed men were approaching eenglishmen señor you see que yeah i see twentytwo the man became aware of the approach of the officer and he jerked his head ask him the russians were falling back some of them removed their fur hats in the presence of the officer drinkwater turned to the newcomer he wore a uniform of brown cloth with red facings dark breeches tucked into high boots his tiewig was illkempt and oldfashioned and the hat he bore in his hands had seen better days drinkwater drew himself up and essayed a low bow flourishing his handkerchief and never taking his eyes off the face of the russian officer it was a cruel face pockmarked and thin with long deprivation yet with an imperious pair of eyes deep set on either side of a beak of a nose the voice when he spoke was thin and reedy the officer was clearly at the opposite end of the social class at whose other extremity captain prince vladimir rakitin occupied a place taking a deep breath and noticing that his boats crew had turned the boat round and were standing kneedeep in the water holding it ready for escape drinkwater began again buenas días señor ee er la capitán a look of understanding passed between the two of them and the unpleasant russian officer fixed his eyes upon drinkwater his glance was truly intimidating and masquerading as he was drinkwater felt unequal to the task of staring him down instead he bowed again niet no english here russia you go the officer turned on his heel leaving drinkwater halfrecovered from his bow now you go amigo said the mountainman his drawl lingering mockingly upon the spanish word so that a worm of alarm writhed in drinkwaters gut vamosl drinkwater turned and walked towards the boat potter bent his back and drinkwater waved him aside splashing through the shallows vaya con dios capitdn rubalcava called the mountainman and then added something which made the russians around him laugh they were lying of that im certain drinkwater said accepting the glass of wine that derrick handed him about the ship sir asked quilhampton no about men englishmen our men sir quilhampton frowned i dont quite follow theres the rub james neither do i he felt the wine uncoil its warmth in his belly relaxing him but i mean to find out that yankee knew something for he mentioned twentyodd men and ive already been played false by one american well reconnoitre that fort tonight any movement from it nothing new that cove is still spying on us from the platform over the gate and the brigs nothing they dont appear to be working cargo though theyve tackles rigged perhaps we interrupted them its possible what would they be loading furs perhaps jerked meat other staples indian corn say purchased with iron trinkets its a safe enough haven for refitting ships too they need labour for that skilled labour comprehension kindled in quilhamptons eyes you mean english seamen sir yes you mean men from the patrician sir yes but were miles away from drakes bay sir we got here james and those brigs looked handy enough craft good god quilhampton paused it looks as though the russians not only took our ship but might be holding our men lets get under weigh now and beat a retreat with our tails between our legs we can return in the cutter after dark chapter eighteen the raid in the rain july it began to rain as they left the schooner their last glimpse of her pitching in the swell hoveto in the darkness was swiftly eclipsed by a hissing curtain of drizzle which seemed to seal them in a hermetic world of sodden misery it was not cold until those sitting still felt the rain penetrate to their skin and envied the steady labours of the oarsmen the interminable night passage was accompanied by the steady splash of oars and the occasional staccato chatter of teeth but the rain killed the wind and flattened the sea to a greasy swell that at last thundered on the low sandspit ahead of them and signalled their proximity to the estuary drinkwater swung the tiller and skirted the breakers edging round the northern extremity of the spit until they knew by the feel of the boat that they were in the mouth of the river and could feel the bite of the seaward current oars the men ceased rowing and bent over their looms drinkwater ordered a tot passed to each man it was aguardiente spanish firewater but none the worse for that they would need all the courage it put into their bellies for their powder was soaked and whatever they might achieve would be by cold steel standby give way together they pressed on until they could see the dull leap of orange flames from behind the russian stockade they paused again and drinkwater gave his final instructions a few moments later the cutters stem grounded on the shore of the columbia river for the second time only on this occasion there was to be no masquerading leaving the boat keepers drinkwater led quilhampton and blixoe tregembo and a handful of seamen inland the rain still fell and they felt their feet sticking in the ooze which sucked tenaciously on the welltrodden path up from the landing place after a few yards they reached the tideline where low scrub grass and trees began drinkwater led them off to the left keeping between the river and the fort but working round behind it guided by the red glow of the fire within the stockade the seething hiss of the rain on the sea and mud became a low roar as they moved beneath the trees dripping in huge droplets upon them despite the discomfort it covered their approach and they were close enough to make out the dancing of flames through the interstices of the pinelog rampart motioning them to stop drinkwater edged forward alone to peer through one of these slender gaps by now his nightvision was acute he could see the upper outline of the stockade against the sky and except by the gate it appeared to be unpierced by guns although there was doubtless a walkway behind it to allow defenders to fire over the top for some yards clear of the fort the trees and brushwood had been cleared but the nature of the night allowed him to slip across this glacis undetected pressed against the resinous pine trunks he peered into the fort the interior of the post was roughly circular a number of buildings within it provided quarters and stores outside what he supposed to be the main barrack block a large fire was crackling the flames and sparks leaping skywards despite the efforts of the heavens to extinguish them he could see a few men lounging under the overhanging roof of this block and the blackening carcass of a deer being roasted on spits but from his vantage point he could see little else the garrison however seemed a small one and the governor doubtless lived in one of the log cabins for drinkwater could just make out a square of yellow light close to the gate as though a lamp burned behind a crude window cautiously he returned to the others whispering to quilhampton damned if i can see what were looking for oh what now sir well edge round the place they began to move forward again a pall of dejection falling on the miserable little column they became careless snapping twigs and letting branches fly back into the faces of the men behind them they lost touch with the stockade on their right moving into dense brushwood that tore at them aggravating their tempers and unsettling them drinkwater began to question the wisdom of proceeding further then he stopped so abruptly that quilhampton bumped into him not five yards ahead of them a tall figure had risen from the bracken hurriedly knotting the cords of his breeches drinkwater knew instantly it was the mountainman to what degree the mans preoccupation had prevented his hearing the approach of the party drinkwater could only guess such a voyageur at once a hunter tracker trapper and forest dweller must have possessed instincts keen as any stag but at that moment they had been somnolent intent on more fundamental physical needs their surprise was mutual and as they stared at each other in silence drinkwater could just see the gleam of the foreshortened rifle barrel another step and youre dead mister i thought you bastards might be back so the mountainman had not been taken in by the disguise of the morning and with that realisation drinkwater sought to temporise capitalising on that brief confidence of the forenoon ive come for those englishmen you spoke of the mountainman gave a short dry laugh you wont find em here where then why the hell should i tell you you told the russians said they knew about the matter the mountainman seemed to hesitate and drinkwater added im surprised you want the russians on your doorstep i sure as hell dont want you british we got rid of you back a while and i aim to keep it that way and the russians drinkwater persisted aint no trouble at all bring you vodka for furs and whatever indian women you can sell em i daresay said drinkwater whats that to you mister ive been expecting you ever since i found your damned men wanderin about the backcountry behind bodega bay so you knew we werent spanish ive been expecting the british alookin for their deserters mister you didnt even come close to convincin me you see i know rubalcava mister and youre on friendly terms with the russians too eh do i take it youve sold my deserters to that coldeyed bastard that commands here what makes you think im huggermugger with the damned russkie eh i aint particularly friendly with anybody especially the bloody british but but i cant shoot the lot of you so just turn about and walk back to your boat i doubt you can shoot anyone in this damned rain you aint heard of a chaumette breech mister or a goddamned ferguson rifle i could blow the shit out of you right now and pick off another of you before you got into those trees the click of the gunlock sounded ominously above the drip and patter of the rain if you dont want the british here why dont you tell me where those men are aint answering any more questions you get goin vamos capitán drinkwater turned and the men parted for him he looked back once the rain had eased a little and the cloud thinned the mountainman stood watching their retreat his long gun slung across his arm the noise of laughter muffled by his huge beard at the same instant the man threw back his head and loosed an iroquois warwhoop into the night the alarm stirred noises from the direction of the stockade and the crack of the mans rifle was swiftly followed by a cry and the crash of a man falling behind him sprawling full length back to the boat drinkwater hissed waving them all past him and stopping only mr quilhampton as the two of them bent over the felled seaman it was lacey and he was past help the mountainman had been as good as his word the ball had made a gaping hole in laceys neck missing the larynx but severing the carotid artery the wound was mortal and lacey was close to death his blood streaming over drinkwaters probing hands come james theres nothing to be done there was no sign of the mountainman but from the fort came the shouts of men answering an alarm somewhere to their right they could hear their own party crashing through the undergrowth accompanied by a stream of oaths and curses go on james not without you sir dont be a bloody fool between them lacey rattled out his life and fell limp drinkwater wiped his hands on laceys gory jacket poor devil he said wondering if the ball had been intended for himself come on then they both began to run in the rain and confusion they reached the boat unmolested but the russians were already pouring out of the fort towards the landing place by the time drinkwater reached the cutter with quilhampton most of his party had mustered but two were missing stumbling about near the fort wheres hughes called quilhampton fuck knows he was behind tregembo tregembo drinkwater spun round is he missing seems so sir gods bones drinkwater swore get that boat off into the water hold off the beach you take command james he raised his voice tregembo he roared tregembo he began to run back the way he had come somewhere to the right he could see the shapes of men running and then the flash and crack of a musket soon followed by a fusillade of shot as the approaching russians fired wildly into the night there was a harsh order screeched out and it stopped drinkwater recognised the voice of the governor and then clearly above the hiss of the rain he could hear the awful slither and snick of bayonets being fixed he caught up the sabre he had looted from the schooner and hefted it for balance tregembo he spat the rain from his mouth and almost retched on the sudden overpowering stench of pigs somewhere close by was a sty and he heard the ruminant grunts of its occupants change to a squealing two men and the dull gleam of steel were approaching and must have disturbed the swine tregembo how many shots had the mountainman fired was tregembo lying out there dying like lacey while he had run for his life the two men were nearer and he swung round to defend himself tregembo he roared in one last desperate attempt to locate his servant suddenly a third man was upon him risen it appeared from the very ground itself clap a stopper on the noise zur god damn you tregembo drinkwater slashed wildly at the first assailant and felt his sabre knock aside the bayonet thrust whirling the blade he caught the second man as he tried to work round drinkwaters rear driving both off for a second he began to fall back waving tregembo behind him why the devil didnt you answer me i fell among swine tregembo called as he moved towards the boat behind his commander then run man ran drinkwater saw an opportunity and slashed again slicing in above the thrusting bayonet as the russian infantryman lunged forward the mans face was a pale blur and drinkwater saw the dark splotch of blood against his cheek as the point of the sabre caught it and then he turned and began to run leaping the tussocks of grass and then slithering through soft sand and mud he tripped and fell full length in the shallows hard on tregembos heels the cornishman turned and helped him to his feet god what a damned farce they scrambled into the boat amid a confusion of limbs and bodies dominated by quilhamptons voice calling above the rain and the tumult wheres the captain has anyone seen captain drinkwater here im here mr q now get this festerin boat under way thank god aye aye sir out oars come on there for christs sake give way as the boat pulled out into the estuary a storm of small shot whined over their heads and all they could see were a few shapes splashing about in the shallow water in almost as much confusion as themselves lets sort this boat out drinkwaters own sense of dignity and his innate hatred of disorder surfaced in the rout be silent there lie ordered for the noise of swearing continued unabated and it suddenly dawned on him that it was no longer his own men who were responsible what the deuce drinkwater looked round thinking for an instant he was going out of his mind for the noise came out of the night ahead of them and the oaths were unmistakably english then he saw the looming bulk of one of the anchored brigs athwart whose hawse the current was sweeping them its the english prisoners sir shouted quilhampton in a moment of comprehension they must have heard us drinkwater considered the odds how many russians were aboard the brig but the current had committed him catch ahold then come lads quickly up and board her come on there lads those are your festerin shipmates aboard there prisoners of the russians a groundswell of anger stirred the occupants of the boat and she rocked dangerously as men reached out at the passing hull then the cutter jarred against the brig with a crash and they found themselves jammed under her forechains and were swarming up over her ample tumblehome driven by their recent defeat and now finding themselves among the familiar surroundings of a ship they swept the length of her deck within a minute at her stern the watch of a dozen men confused by the noises ashore suddenly attacked by desperate assailants and mindful that below decks a score of rebellious prisoners only awaited liberty before cutting their gaolers to pieces soon capitulated most jumped over the taffrail to save their lives by swimming ashore though three were taken prisoner drinkwater realised he was in possession of a russian brig at the same moment that he caught a glimpse of the unsecured cutter drifting away downstream what is it mr derrick there was an odd formality about those left aboard the virgen de la bonanza mr marsden the patricians carpenter but the most experienced seaman on board hurried to answer derricks summons the quakers innate dignity his literacy and his position as the captains secretary almost gave him the status of a gentleman while his tenacious hold on his faith had elevated him from a mere curiosity to something of a sage among the hands i believe it to be the cutter friend marsden and it appears to be empty marsden took up the offered glass and levelled it the dawn was heavy with the nights rain the sea a sluggish undulating plain of uniform grey no wind above the whisper of a breeze ruffled its surface as though the sea was suppressed beneath the sheer weight of the skys bequest every rope and spar every sail and block was sodden with water rain had run below through cracks and companionways scuttles and ports and though it was not actually falling at that moment more was threatened and the coming of day was only a lightening of the tone of the gloom their visible horizon was bounded by mist a murky perimeter into which the grey unoccupied shell of the cutter rocked not above six cables away borne seawards by the inexorable current of the columbia river fifteen minutes later the thing lay not thirty yards off and they could clearly see it was empty there were disorderly signs of hurried evacuation several of the oars were missing one stuck up its blade jammed in the thole pins another was broken the jagged loom indicating it had struck hard against something the remnants of rags hung down from the rowlocks where the night before they had muffled them oddly the painter lay neatly coiled in the bow damned if i understand the meaning o this muttered marsden i think we are alone friend left to our own resources said derrick his sonorous tone carrying the dreadful implication to marsden streuth whats to be done and the capn gone an all could we fetch san francisco marsden shrugged god knows i suppose we could aint my trade nor yours neither hell and damnation take it come friend such language availeth nothing derrick turned away from the rail and looked along the schooners deck their handful of a crew would be hardpressed to bring the schooner back to san francisco oh my fuckin oath moaned marsden and derrick turned the carpenter was staring to starboard where out of the mist the grey shape of a ship was emerging we be sunk good an proper now mister derrick thats one o them russian brigs we saw yesterday reckon they know all about us an whats happened to the capn shall we run then derrick suggested querulously is that a russkie asked one of the seamen coming up to the two men while behind him the remainder stood and stared despairingly to leeward marsden looked at first blixoe and then derrick he was not given to quick thinking run where to anywhere were faster than a brig can sail closer to the wind marsden looked at the quaker with something akin to respect i suppose running aint fighting he said rubbing his chin and considering the matter of course well run snapped the seaman shouting for them to start the headsail sheets and cast loose the lashings on the helm wait derrick was staring through the telescope id swear that was mr quilhampton on the knightheads seems a shame zur to burn a prize like that tregembo muttered watching quilhamptons firing party at work and the flames take hold of the brig she stank near as bad as you when you emerged out of that swinemidden remarked drinkwater i have never seen so slovenly maintained a ship you damned near had me finished with all that shouting said tregembo thats as maybe tregembo would you have had me abandon you by god susan would never have let me forget it they smiled at each other relieved both aware that they had enjoyed a lucky escape they withdrew from the stern window of the schooner drinkwater to pour himself a glass of the spanish commanders excellent oloroso tregembo to fuss the elegant little cabin into something more befitting a british naval captain the stink of smoke came in and drinkwater waited for quilhamptons party to get aboard a moment or two later quilhampton knocked on the door he entered grimy but smiling he held out a rolled chart a glass james youve earned it what d you have there the answer to the riddle sir yes thank you quilhampton took the glass from tregembo who gave him an oldfashioned sideways look how did they behave asked drinkwater unrolling the chart and staring at it the men sir yes like lambs all eagerness to please never seen a firing party so eager to destroy a prize couldnt do enough for me would have burnt the damn thing twice over if itd been a fit plea for mitigation drinkwater looked up from the chart and eyed the lieutenant speculatively you think it should be james weve little choice sir in any case they outnumber us and im not sure about the men that were with me it was only circumstances and selfpreservation that kept us together marsdens all right derricks a canting neutral and i suppose we can rely on old tregembo less of the old mr quilhampton zur if you please growled the cornishman quilhampton grinned and downed his glass winking at drinkwater lets hope they all appreciate which side their breads buttered on now said drinkwater finishing his own glass even so ill have to read em the riot act ill muster them then sir yes if you please and try not to look so damned pleased with yourself i think youll find something to smile about sir if you study that chart why i think it shows us where we may find patrician drinkwater looked down at the chart with its unfamiliar script and mixture of incomprehensible russian characters and french names favoured by more aristocratic hydrographers anyway went on quilhampton pausing by the cabin door im uncommon pleased to be given a fighting chance again yes agreed drinkwater it was quite a turn up for the books eh well fortune favours the brave sir quilhampton remarked sententiously i think replied drinkwater drily that last night fortune was merely inclined to favour the least incompetent quilhampton left with a chuckle but drinkwater exchanged a glance with tregembo ill let ee know if i hear anything zur have no fear o that very well tregembo drinkwater nodded only ive a notion to set eyes on my family again you aint the only one zur drinkwater poured himself a second glass of the oloroso and while he waited for the men to be mustered on deck he studied the chart the brigs russian master was an untidy navigator the erasure of her track was imperfectly carried out it was quite obvious that captain rakitin had a nearer rendezvous than sitka and studying the features of the inlet it was the very place he himself would have chosen to hide a prize delighted he tossed off the glass and composed his features he was going to have to scold the men but by all accounts they had quite a tale to tell quilhampton gathered the details noting them down on a page torn from the schooners logbook the men who had absconded from drakes bay had found the same village that quilhampton had been driven from and met the same reception from its inhabitants although a body of opinion sought revenge on the local peons wiser councils prevailed and the deserters moved further inland reducing the chances of being retaken by any parties sent out by drinkwater for a day or two they remained together until they reached the great sequoia woods where game water and freedom had split them into groups and they had lost their discipline for a few days they wandered happily about and then one party found an indian village their attempt to establish friendly relations with the native women met a hostile rebuttal another party roamed into a franciscan mission and were driven off by angry mestizos who had been told they were devils within a week the country was raised against them and several were killed or left to the mercies of the natives as the manhunt spread eventually twentytwo of them found themselves rounded up and turned over to a strange englishspeaking man in fringed buckskins whom the local people held in some awe to the british deserters he promised with complicit winks and other indications of racial superiority that if they played along he would accomplish their rescue there were prolonged parleys exchanges of some form of gifts or money and then they were led off on the promise of good behaviour by the mountainman whom they knew by the obvious alias of captain mack since the alternative was inevitable death at the hands of either indians halfcaste spanish or the tender ministrations of what they thought was the inquisition they shambled off in the wake of their rescuer after a march of three days captain mack led them down to the sea on the shores of bodega bay where to their astonishment they found soldiers who spoke a language they could not understand but was clearly not spanish it did not take them long to find out that they had unwittingly become the serfs of the russianamerican company and that they were to be shipped in one of the filthy brigs that lay in the bay to the companys more secure post on the columbia river captain mack had gone with them to strike his bargain with the commandant there and had been waiting to return to the mountain forests of california when drinkwater had arrived in the schooner as for the men they were to be employed refitting or serving in russian ships in the pacific the hands are mustered captain drinkwater came out of his reverie to find derrick confronting him eh oh thank you derrick i shall be up directly there was something piratical about the assembly amidships whether it was the lean dishevelled and indisciplined appearance of the men or whether the character of the schooner under its false colours or simply the crawling uncertainty that nagged at drinkwater that contributed to this impression he was not sure as they stared back at him despite his titular right to lead them his tenure of command had never rested on such insubstantial foundations among the men confronting him were almost certainly those who had attempted to sabotage the patrician very well he began silencing them and studying their faces for traces of guilt defiance insolence or contrition fate has literally cast us in the same boat he slapped the rail beside him and i intend to discover the whereabouts of the patrician and free our shipmates from the kind of bestial treatment some of you have just subjected yourselves to make no mistake about it there are worse forms of existence than service in the kings navy he paused to let the point sink in i can offer you little beyond hardship and the possibility of retaking our ship from the russians clearing our name as a company and destroying our enemies he paused again clambering up on the carriage of a pounder well what dyou say are you for or against do we keep that rag aloft he pointed up at the red and gold ensign of spain still at the main peak or are we going to take this little hooker into plymouth to be condemned as a prize to patrician there was a seconds hesitation and then they were yelling stupidly and throwing their arms in the air in acclamation drinkwater got down from the gun carriage very well mr q lay me a course of nornorwest happily their experiences as subjects of the tsar have taught them that there are degrees even of injustice chapter nineteen the trojan horse julyaugust drinkwater tapped the dividers on the chart and looked up gauging his prisoner vasili zhdanov one of the three men captured with the russian brig spoke english of a kind having been in attendance upon his onetime master when that worthy had served as an officer with the anglophile seniavin however zhdanov had been caught stealing and after a sound whipping had been sold to the russianamerican company so that he had found a kind of life as seaman in one of the companys trading brigs now the reek of him and particularly of his makhorka tobacco filled the cabin how do you know that the british ship patrician is here drinkwater pointed to the bay which lay far to the northward on the south coast of distant alaska there were a thousand anchorages amid the archipelagos of islands that extended northwards from the strait of juan de fuca not least that of nootka sound but this remote spot i see she come suvorov come replied zhdanov haltingly who is captain of suvorov barin vladimir rakitin how many guns zhdanov shrugged he was clearly not numerate do you wish to serve king george of great britain i fight with royal navy zhdanov said with some dignity but whether he referred to drinkwaters proposed change of allegiance or to his own past history he was unable to make clear drinkwater looked up at quilhampton split the three of them up try and make them understand they can join us and swear em in if they protest youll have to put em back in the bilboes aye aye sir quilhampton led the russian out drinkwater opened a stern window to clear the air the man reminded him of a strange cross between a feral animal like a bear and a child yet there was something impressive about him reminding drinkwater of those vast numbers of such men he had seen encamped about the lithuanian town of tilsit a year earlier like patient beasts they had awaited their fates with an equanimity that struck him as stoic zhdanov had responded to his own autocratic proposal with the simple obedience that made the tsars armies almost invincible he looked again at the chart there was logic in secreting a ship in such a place it was wellsurveyed compared with the adjacent coast a strange opening into the surrounding mountains like a fiord except that its entrance instead of being open was almost closed off by rocky promontories between them drinkwater guessed the tide would rip with considerable ferocity inside the fiord was deep a single steep islet rising in its middle beyond which there was a sudden abrupt bifurcation the bays arms swinging north and south and terminating in glaciers if vasili zhdanov was right somewhere within those enclosing pincers of promontories lay patrician drinkwater opened the dividers and stepped off the distance laying the steel points of the instrument against the latitude scale more than a thousand miles lay between their present position and the lone bay which nestled under the massive shoulder of mount elias and the great alaskan range he stared unseeing from the stern windows so much depended upon their success where were fraser and frey the punctilious mount or midshipman wickham were they prisoners aboard their own ship or had they been held at san francisco if providence granted success to this venture he would return thither and force those corrupt timeservers the arguello brothers to release his men and force some measure of expiation out of that dishonourable dog rubalcava he felt his pulse beat with the mere thought of revenge and a wave of anger swept over him as he recalled the humiliation he had suffered at the hands of prince vladimir rakitin if if only providence had turned her face upon him again he might yet do something to retrieve the ragged flag of honour no matter how assiduously one studied a chart the reality never quite conformed to the imagination assessment of the present landscape had not been helped by the unfamiliar topographical terms zaliu mys or bukhta rendered incomprehensible by the cyrillic script neither was drinkwaters familiarity with french sufficiently proficient to determine whether it was la perouse or the russian kruzenstern who had named the places on the chart what impressed him was the quality of the thing manufactured as it had been half a world away in the russian hydrographic office in st petersburg he raised the glass again and raked the shore seeking the narrow halfhidden entrance and avoiding the scenic seductions of the mountain range that seemed to beetle down upon the littoral it was stunningly magnificent this chain of mighty peaks shining with the sunlit glitter of permanent ice like the nunataks of greenland and then he saw her the black tracery sharp in the crisp cool air which sharpened every image with more intensity than the most cunningly wrought lens he knew instantly that the ship anchored beyond the low headland was indeed patrician he shut his glass with a snap hoist spanish colours if you please and call all hands to their stations he had assumed the worst and formed his ruse accordingly patrician he theorised would be well manned by the enemy despite his inclination to believe the contrary due to her remote location her own people would have been removed in san francisco so there would be no spontaneous rising to assist art and cunning must therefore be his chief weapons he sent below for the spanish uniforms and saw to his sidearms long before the approach to the entrance when he was ready he turned the virgen de la bonanza to the northeast and ascending to the foretop spied out the narrow strait between the guardian headlands from that elevation he saw at once why the entrance was so difficult to locate from the deck the island which he knew lay within the bay lay directly upon the line of sight when peering through the gap so appearing to form one continuous coastline turning he called down to quilhampton by the helm the course was altered and the bowsprit below him swung towards the narrows the schooner heeled turning to larboard and bringing the wind fine on that bow and drinkwater surveying the entrance from his perch felt the fine thrum of wind through the stays and the halliards that ran past him the water ran suspiciously smooth in the gut with darker corrugations rippling out from either side corrugations which tore off into whorls and rips of gyrating turbulence where unseen rocks or sudden treacherous shifts of current manipulated the violent motion of an ebbing tide deck there sir quilhampton looked aloft i want a steady hand on the helm theres a deal of broken water ahead aye aye zur drinkwater smiled as tregembo took the helm and then turned his attention to the narrows again their progress was becoming slower as they felt the increasing opposition of the tide the schooner crabbed sideways under its influence unable to point closer to the wind drinkwater bestowed a quick glance at the anchored ship she was alone alone beneath those great slabs of mountains which lifted into the heavens behind her their snow caps sliding into scree and talus tussocked grass and low stunted trees which on the lower ground that fringed the fiord changed to a dark impenetrable mantle of firs and she was most certainly the patrician steady there he felt the schooner lurch and looked below to see tregembo anticipate the tiderips attempt to throw the vessels head into the wind the sea was slick with the speed of the tide almost uninfluenced by the effect of the breeze as it rushed out into the ocean beyond the confines of the bay those dark corrugations resolved themselves into standing waves foaming with energy as the mass of water forced itself out of the bay so that the schooner slowed stood still and began to slip astern the heads of curious seals impervious to the viciously running ebb popped out of the grey water to stare like curious earless dogs their pinched nostrils flaring and closing in exaggerated expressions of outrage at the intrusion for an hour they hung suspended in this fashion until almost suddenly the tide slacked relented and the power of the wind in their sails drove them forwards again the low roar of the rush of water eased the corrugations the rips and eddies diminished and slowly disappeared for a while the strait was one continuous glossy surface of still water and then they were through brought by this curious diminishing climax into sudden proximity with their quarry and now said drinkwater regaining the deck we must play at a trojan horse after scylla and charybdis twill be little enough sir remarked quilhampton with unbecoming cheerfulness belay the classical allusions mr q snapped drinkwater suddenly irritated belay the loudmouthed english and lower the boat then you may carry out your instructions and fire that salute the bunting of the spanish ensign tickled drinkwaters ear as he was rowed across the dark waters of the inlet towards the patrician the schooners boat hoisted normally under her stern was smaller than the cutter they had lost in the columbia river but he hoped his approach was impressive enough and he was aware from a flash of reflected light that he was being scrutinised through a glass by one of the halfdozen men he could see on his own quarterdeck behind him came the dull thud of the pounder echoing back after a delay to mix its repetition with the sound of the next signalgun so that the air seemed to reverberate with the concussion of hundreds of guns as the echoes chased one another into the distance in prolonged diminuendo no answering salute came from the focsle of the patrician no answering dip of her diagonally crossed ensign he stood up showing off the spanish uniform with its plethora of lace and holding out the bundle of papers that purported to be despatches he noted a flurry of activity at the entry with a sigh of mixed relief and satisfaction how far is the schooner potter he asked the man pulling strokeoar shes just tacked sir replied potter staring astern past drinkwater an coming up nicely theyre tricing up the foot of the foresl now sir and the outer jibs just ashivering bout long pistol shot an closing sir very well drinkwater could smell the rum on the mans breath as he made his oar bite the water off to starboard an unconcerned tern hovered briefly then plunged into the water and emerged a second later with a glistening fish in its daggerlike beak were closing fast lads be ready he paused judged his moment and in a low voice ordered the oars tossed and stowed beside him tregembo put the tiller over amid a clatter of oars coming inboard the bowman stood up and hooked onto patricians chains drinkwater looked up a face stared down at him and then he began to climb not daring to look around and ascertain the whereabouts of quilhampton and the schooner at the last moment he remembered to speak bastardfrench considering that it was not unreasonable for a spanish officer to use that language when addressing a frenchspeaking ally the fact that he spoke it barbarously was some comfort stepping onto the deck he swept off his hat and bowed bonjour senores he managed looking up with relief into the face of an officer he had never seen before ou est votre capitaine sil vous plait tiens cest le capitaine anglais drinkwater jerked round to his left stood one of the midshipmen he had last seen in don josés residence at san francisco hands flew to swords and he knew that his ruse had failed utterly he flung the paper bundle at the young mans face and drew the cavalry sabre before either of the russian officers had reacted fully letting out a bullroar of alarm he swiped the heavy curved blade upwards in a vicious cut that sent the senior officer a lieutenant by his epaulettes reeling backwards his hands to his face his dropped sword clattering on the deck come on you bastards drinkwater bellowed into the split seconds hiatus his quick reaction had brought him board would they come those disloyal quondam deserters or would they leave him to die like a dog hacked down by the ring of steel that was forming about him what would quilhampton do carry out the plan of getting foul of the patricians stern in a histrionic display of incompetence which was to have cut drinkwaters inept french explanation and turned it into a farce of invective levelled by him at quilhampton under whose cover the virgen de la bonanza was to have been run alongside the frigate during this ludicrous performance his men were supposed to have come aboard armed seamen with pikes from the arms racks around the masts and marines with bayonets men with spikes and rammers and gunworms were closing keeping their distance until they might all rush in and kill him board you bastards he shouted again his voice cracking with tension his eyes moving from one to another of his enemies seeking which was the natural leader whose muscles would first tense for the kill and bring down nemesis upon his reckless head it seemed he waited an age and then a shuffling of the midshipmans feet told him what he wanted to know he thrust left pronating his wrist and driving his arm forward so that the mangled muscles cracked with the speed of his lunge the pointe of his sabre struck the young man on the breastbone cracked it and sent him backwards gasping for breath in an agony of surprise as he halfturned he sensed reaction to his right a movement forward to threaten his unprotected back he cut savagely reversing the swing of his body the heavy weapon singing through the air and cutting with a sickening crunch into the upper arm of a bold seaman whose cannonworm dropped from nerveless hands and who let out a howl of pain and surprise and then he lost the initiative and was fighting a dozen assailants for his very life frey i think you are an infatuated fool that must be the twentieth portrait of la belladonna you have done quipped wickham looking down at the watercolour and they do not improve besides they are a waste of the dip he reached out with dampened fingers to pinch out the miserable flame that lit the thick air of the cold gunroom and received a sharp tap on the knuckles from freys brush go to the devil wickham i purchased that dip out of my own funds wickham sat and put his head in his hands staring across the grubby table at frey what dyou suppose they intend to do with us i dont know replied frey without looking up thats why i paint so that i do not have to think about such things he put the brush in the pot of water and stared down at the face of doña ana maria then in a sudden savage movement his hand screwed up the piece of paper and crumpled it up wickham sat back with a start shame it wasnt that bad no perhaps not but was she really handsome quite the most beautiful woman i have ever seen frey waxed suddenly lyrical how many women have you seen frey youve been aboard here since what was that asked frey sharply sitting upright one of the men cursing those bastard russians for being too free with their knouts i expect said wickham in a bored tone no listen it came again an agonised bellow of command and there was something vaguely familiar about the voice freys eyes opened wide it cant be cant be what the shout came again and then there were the screams and bellows of a fight somewhere above them both midshipmen stood their sentry a slovenly russian marine stirred uneasily hefting his neglected musket his thumb poised on its hammer there was a sudden buzz throughout the ship as other men confined in irons or about their imposed duties realised something momentous was happening on deck for too many days now they had rotted in a regime of inactivity required only occasionally to turn out and pump the bilges or tend the cable for the most part they had languished in almost total darkness separated from their officers uncertain of their future toying with rumours that when the suvorov returned many of them would be drafted into her or into other russian ships or settlements for prince rakitin such a draft of healthy labour seemed like a blessing from heaven sufficient to restore the fortunes of the russianamerican company after the loss of rezanov frey stood cautiously not wishing to alarm the sentry he had learned enough about their gaolers to realise that the man would display no initiative did not dare to and would remain at his post until someone came down and relieved or shot him what the devil is going on frey asked in an agony of uncertainty damned if i know then there was an outburst of the most horrible noise a howling ululation that reminded the two youths of stories of iroquois massacres they had heard old men tell from the seven years war it was much closer than the upper deck and provoking responses even nearer as the captive british seamen joined in with whoops and shouts of their own the two midshipmen could hear shouts of joyful recognition the clank of chains and the thudthud of axes the sharp clink as they struck iron links more shouts and then to compound the confusion patrician lurched as something large and heavy struck her come on wickham freys hand scooped the waterpot from the table and hurled it in the face of their sentry momentarily blind the man squeezed the trigger of his musket and the confined space reverberated with the crack of the shot the ball buried itself in the deckhead and the russian stabbed out with his bayonet but the thing was unwieldy in the small space and the two midshipmen dodged nimbly past him out on the gundeck the scene was like a painting of the last judgement russians lay dead or writhing in agony like the damned on their way to hellfire a handful of piratical british seamen led by captain drinkwaters coxswain tregembo were turning up the hatchways like avenging angels and out of the hold poured a starveling rabble of pale and ragged bodies corpses newreleased from their tombs some dragging irons some halffree of them so that they held the loose links and went howling after their captors swinging the deadly knuckledusters in a whirlwind of vengeful pursuit tregembo by all thats holy frey stood for an instant taking in the scene then ran to a stillwrithing russian tore the cutlass from his dying grasp and hurried on deck lieutenant quilhampton lost his cheerfulness the instant captain drinkwater left in the schooners boat all his attention had to be paid to splitsecond timing to bring the virgen de la bonanza up under patricians stern to fail in an attempt to tack and fall alongside the frigate in a display of hispanic incompetence that if he was a yard or two short would condemn captain drinkwater to an untimely death his throat was dry and his heart thudded painfully as he sought to concentrate gauging the relative angle of approach his speed and the set of a tide that was already flooding in through the narrows behind him a point to larboard if you please he forced himself to say feigning complete mastery of himself and seeing drinkwater ascend the patricians side by the manropes what would happen if quilhampton failed and drinkwater died for himself he knew that he could never return and press his suit for the hand of catriona macewan somehow such a course of action would be altogether dishonourable knowing that he had failed the one man who had ever shown him kindness and what of drinkwater quilhampton knew of his distant devotion to his family for all the estrangement imposed by the naval service and this particular commission did drinkwater expect him to fail would drinkwater rather die in this remote and staggeringly beautiful corner of the world attempting to recapture his own ship rather than live with the knowledge of having lost her if so the responsibility he bore was even heavier the bonds of true friendship imposing a greater burden than he felt he had skill to meet and then he felt the tide flooding in with increasing strength patrician was already lying head to it his own course crabbed across another point to larboard perhaps larboard a point larboard a point more sir there was warning in the helmsmans voice quilhampton looked up the luff of the mainsail was just lifting shes ashiver sir marsden said from amidships quilhampton did not answer he was watching the schooners bowsprit watching it cross the empty sky until down helm the virgen de la bonanza turned slowly into the wind midships he stole a quick look along the deck apart from the halfadozen men at the sheets the remainder armed to the teeth lay in the shadow of the starboard rail or crouched under the carelessly thrown down tarpaulin amidships the virgen de la bonanza lost way the quarter of the patrician loomed over them they could see marks of neglect about the frigate odds and ends of rope scuffed paintwork a terrible bellow of range came from the deck above with mounting anxiety quilhampton suddenly knew he had now to concentrate more than ever before such a howl had not been planned something was wrong very wrong he could abandon all pretence up helm shift the headsl sheets he checked the swing steady there lads not yet not yet the schooner began to swing backwards he looked over the side the boat bobbing under the main chains of the patrician was already empty he saw the last pair of heels disappear in through an open gunport with relief drinkwater had at least the support of tregembo and his boats crew a moment later the boat was crushed between the schooner and the frigate as the two hulls jarred together now there was an earsplitting roar from amidships the big carronade trained forward at maximum elevation and stuffed with langridge ripped through the rigging of the forechains and in the wake of that iron storm quilhampton loosed his boarders drinkwater parried the first wave of the attack there was a curious life in the cavalry sabre centrifugal force kept it swinging in a wide and dangerous swathe though it tore mercilessly at the wrecked muscles of his wounded right shoulder how long he could keep such a defence going he did not know but he knew that he would have been a dead man already had he been armed only with his old hanger he had fired two of the three pistols he had carried and foolishly thrown them down intending to draw the third but he could not free it from his belt and it ground into his belly as he twisted and dodged his assailants he did not escape unscathed he was cut twice about the face and received a deep wound upon his extended forearm a ball galled his left shoulder and a pike thrust from the rear took him ignominiously in the fleshy part of the right buttock he began to feel his strength ebb aware that one last rally from his opponents would result in his deathwound for he could fight no more his vision was blurring though his mind retained that coolness that had saved him before and fought off the weakness of his reactions for as long as possible a man loomed in front of him he swung the sabre and missed tensing his exposed stomach he waited for the searing pain of the pike thrust fuck me its the capn the pikehead whistled past his face as the wielder put it up suddenly all opposition melted away there were friendly faces round him men he had known once long ago long ago when he had commanded the patrician but it was not valhalla he woke to nor had it been the faces of the dead he had seen some intelligence beyond mere consciousness had allowed him to faint at last recognising his part in the fight need no longer be sustained his men had followed him wiping out the stain of their desertion somewhere far above him voices were discussing him impertinent voices that spoke as though he was nothing more than a bloodhorse whose health was uncertain will he pull through mr lallo of course mr q tis only a drop of blood hes lost hell save me the trouble of prescribing a remedy theres nothing serious though that cut in his glutens maximus will embarrass him his what arse mr q hell not sit for a week without it reminding him of its presence quilhampton laughed ill go and see about some food go and find him a bottle of port nothing reconstitutes the blood better than a fortified wine theres some excellent oloroso aboard the virgen what a damnably blasphemous name go and get some then youre a pair of impertinent dogs drinkwater muttered fully conscious there mr q i told you recovery would be complete welcome aboard sir thank you mr lallo how many men do we muster chapter twenty dos de mayo august i believe they call you captain mack drinkwater said his wounded buttock still troubled him and he preferred to stand his back to the sternwindows a grim imperturbable silhouette regarding his prisoner macks eyes were defiant truculent he nodded but held his tongue i understood you did your hunting further south amid the barrens of california they aint barrens said mack shortly with a halfsmile that was at once menacing and secretive perhaps not replied drinkwater dismissively he had learned the term in the american war and its precise meaning was unimportant now you are a citizen of the united states of america are you not i suppose i am you suppose in so far as im under any mans jurisdiction i reckon to be born free mister i respect it in others i expect it from them meaning you could have shot to kill me when we disturbed you at your office sure i can hit a running moose you didnt respect the freedom of my men you turned them over to the russians hell capn thats bullshit you didnt respect their freedom either an thats supposing they was free in the first place instead of run from this here ship drinkwater smiled but you didnt turn em over to the russkies for love of old england sure as hell i didnt then why they was trespassin capn so were you on spanish territory did you sell em what the hell would i want with roubles capn the mountainman answered contemptuously i presume you require powder and shot drinkwater replied coolly and gold is always gold a spark of something flared in the mountainmans eyes hostility malice perhaps drinkwater could not be sure beyond knowing he had touched a nerve you are a solitary captain mack a man apart i do not pretend to understand your motives and my men would have you hang for your treachery i promised them nothing maybe not would you have me hand you over to the spanish authorities at san francisco patrician lifted to the swell and leaned gently over to the increasing breeze as on deck lieutenant fraser crowded on sail drinkwater smiled with grim satisfaction for a wave of nausea passed visibly over macks features you will do as you please i reckon he said with some difficulty drinkwater jerked his head at sergeant blixoe take him below sergeant he could afford clemency it was good to have them all back together fraser lallo mount quilhampton even the lugubrious chaplain jonathan henderson he looked astern through the cabin windows where under hill and frey the virgen de la bonanza danced in their wake perhaps best of all was to see little mr belchamberss cheerful smile for drinkwater did not think he could have brought himself to have written to explain the boys loss to his trusting parents it was true that there were still men missing men who had been pressed by the spaniards to labour on the wharves of san francisco but for the great majority the raid on the outpost on the columbia river had reunited them in spirit wiping out memories of discontent disloyalty and desertion it was less easy for drinkwater to forget the depths to which he had sunk of how near he had been to suicide less easy to forget the risks he had run in his desperation but the raid had had its effect paltry enough though it had been in terms of military glory they had landed by boat in the mist of early morning in a brief and bloody affair in which all the advantage had been with the assailants they had carried off all that they had not destroyed even tregembos swine setting fire to the fort with the same enthusiasm they had burnt the first brig drinkwater turned from the stern windows and glanced down at the chart on his table they would do the same to the russian outpost at bodega bay where the mysterious mountainman had first enslaved his own deserters his men would enjoy that and he could set free captain mack leave him to his damnable wilderness then he would return to san francisco his heartbeat quickened at the thought of confronting the arguello brothers how unexpected were the twists of fortune and how close he had come to ending his own life in the cell below the commandantes residence if it had not been for doña ana maria he forced his mind into safer channels his first consideration was the destruction of the second russian post at bodega bay lieutenant quilhampton jumped into the water of bodega bay and led the men ashore they splashed behind him mount leading the marines frey with his incendiary party they met only token resistance a couple of shots were fired at them out of bravado but the two grubby wretches immediately flung down their muskets and surrendered surprise had been total and the british party entered the now familiar stockade with its stink of urine grease and unwashed humanity to set about its destruction only when he saw the flicker of flames did drinkwater leave the ship in the boat in the sternsheets escorted by two of mounts marines sat captain mack wading ashore with the mountainmans long rifle drinkwater indicated that the marines were to follow him with their prisoner as they walked towards the blazing pine logs that exploded and split in great upwellings of sparks as the resin within them expanded and took fire they met quilhamptons party escorting a pathetic collection of bearded moujiks back to the boats wheres the commandant no one seems to be in command sir just this handful of peasants hes afucking indian women capn or lying deaddrunk under a redwood tree drawled captain mack very well let him go drinkwater motioned to the marines and they stood back he jerked his head at the mountainman vamos mack halfsmiled at the irony but held out his hand my gun capn you get out of my sight now when my boat pulls off the beach ill leave your rifle on that boulder you can get it then you dont trust me somebody once told me the cherokees called you people yankees because they didnt trust you ah but others called us english then mack grinned reluctantly acknowledging an equal and stalked away he did not look back and his buckskins were soon as one with the alternate light and shade that lay beneath the trees drinkwater turned back to the incendiary roar and crackle of the burning fort when there came a shout the snap of branches and a roar of anger drinkwater spun round mack was running back towards them pursued by a dark figure in an odd oldfashioned fulllength waistcoat the man had lost his wig and hat but he held out a pistol and as he took in the sight of the burning fort he fired it screaming some frightful accusation after mack the mountainman fell full length his spine broken by the ball and drinkwater ran up to him as he breathed his last behind drinkwater the marines brought down the wigless russian drinkwater bent over the dying mack thought id betrayed he got out through clenched teeth and drinkwater looked at the russian rolling beneath the bayonets of the marines it must have been the returning commandant misinterpreting the mayhem before him as his post blazed and mack walked insouciantly away from the scene drinkwater watched as life ebbed from the tumbled goliath shot so ignominiously by a debauched neerdowell and felt that sharp pang of regret that sense of universal loss that accompanied certain of the deaths he had witnessed he was about to stand when his eye fell upon something bright half a dozen huge nuggets of the purest gold had rolled out of the mountainmans leather pouch bury em both he called to the marines and scooping up the treasure he swept them into his pocket gold it threw off the reflections of the candle flames leaping and guttering as patrician worked her way off shore in the first hours of the night tomorrow she would appear off point lobos but tonight she would hide herself and her prize in the vastness of the pacific gold a kings ransom lay before him no wonder mack had scorned the idea of payment for passing patricians deserters to the russians and no wonder he had not wanted those same men wandering over wherever it was he found the stuff for that was the only implication that fitted his deed and his character he would not encourage the spaniards for their tentacles would spread inexorably northwards while the russians could supply him with those necessities he was compelled to get from civilisation powder shot steel needles flints drinkwater had no idea how many natural resources the wilderness contained but it contained gold and what the devil would such an unworldly man as captain mack do with such a treasure that was a mystery past his divining cleared for action sir very well mr fraser above their heads the white ensign snapped in the breeze from the north that had blown fresh throughout the night and was only now losing its strength as they came under the lee of the land from his post on the gundeck quilhampton tried to locate the little cove where he and the cutters crew had holed up and from where he had seen the patrician carried off into captivity suppose the suvorov was waiting for them under the protection of the spanish battery on point lobos what would be the outcome of the action they were about to fight he found he dare not contemplate defeat and felt the atmosphere aboard the ship imbued with such a feeling of renewal that defeat must be impossible no matter what the odds those two raids little enough in themselves had patched up morale made of them all a ships company again a ships company that had endured much there was talk of going home after the job was done after the spanish and the russians had been made to eat their own shit and the guncaptains kneeled with their lanyards taut in their fists in anticipation of this event thou art my battleaxe and weapons of war the reverend jonathan henderson had declaimed at divine service that morning for with thee i will break in pieces the nations and with thee i will destroy kingdoms he had railed and if no one understood the finer theological points of his subsequent deductions all made the blasphemous connection between jeremiahs imputed words and themselves stand ready sir mr belchambers squeaked at the companionway maximum elevation he went on repeating drinkwaters orders from the quarterdeck no sign of the russian ships target to be the battery starboard broadside quilhampton grinned the boy had the phrases arseaboutface but he was cool enough he stooped and peered through the adjacent gunport he saw the smoke suddenly mushroom from the end cannon wafting outwards in a great smokering but no fall of shot followed make ready belchamberss squeak came again make ready there starbowlines quilhampton roared with mounting excitement a second smokering mushroomed from the embrasures of point lobos theyre bloody well saluting us muttered quilhampton frowning hold your fire sir theres a flag of truce putting off from the shore a groan of disappointment ran along the gundeck capitán my brother don josé arguello de salas commandante of his most catholic majestys city of san francisco extends his most profound apologies for this most unfortunate mistake damn you don alejo where is your brother i demand to know more of this affair this socalled mistake which i know to be nothing short of a towering fabrication a a words failed to express drinkwaters angry sense of outrage so many halfguessedat truths had found their answers in the hour since the flagoftruce had first been seen but don alejo was not a man to concede a thing as drinkwater faltered the wily spaniard rammed home his counterstroke we are both guilty capitán you please you steal our schooner la virgen de la bonanza that is an outrageous allegation capitán please it is one of the confusions of this war if you had informed me as you were duty bound to do that she brought news of our new alliance i should not have been forced to capture her you don alejo acted outside all international law by selling yes sir selling his britannic majestys ship patrician to the russian power in the person of prince rakitin after you had heard that your country was once again an ally of mine such an action is the basest and most dishonourable that i have ever heard of a little mistake capitán drinkwater snapped don alejo a little what did your english papers say eh ah sí a quibble like when your ships come under your admiralty orders and attack bustamentes frigates and blow up the mercedes and send women to god before you have a declaration of war it is nothing nothing don alejo made a gesture of contemptuous dismissal but you traded don alejo sold my ship you have been trading with the russians ever since rezanov came eh your most catholic master does not approve of his servants trading in his monopolies it was for my country that i remove your ship you toomuch disturb trade now we are at peace and allies you have your ship back don alejo spoke in a lower key perhaps capitán drinkwater you should be a little obliged to me upon my soul why asked drinkwater aback when you first take me prisoner capitán don jorge rubalcava he want to tell you to go to monterey there you not escape there you lose your ship here in san francisco he shrugged a gesture full of implications and drinkwater understood that don alejo was beyond his comprehension in cunning whatever the venal sins of his brother don alejo would emerge on the winning side if he knew of the presence of gold in california as that shrewd observation of quilhamptons suggested don alejo was not the man to make the knowledge public had he in some subtle way suggested to doña ana maria that honour was at stake and so ensured drinkwaters escape through her action looking at him drinkwater thought the thing at least a possibility and don alejo had nothing to lose by it for drinkwater might have failed lost in some obscure and savage fracas on the coast he shuddered at the mere recollection of the night raid on the columbia river now capitán as to the matter of your men said the spaniard smoothly drinkwater frowned i shall expect them returned instantly as soon as don jorge takes possession of the aviso capitán don alejo smiled victoriously drinkwater opened his mouth to protest the injustice of losing their prize then he remembered the gold and felt the weight of those nuggets dragging down the tails of his fulldress coat when the time came he thought he could purchase comforts enough to compensate his men for the loss of their paltry share in the schooner perhaps they were better off for the matter might lie before a prizecourt for years and only the attorneys would benefit besides he had other matters to attend to there were despatches brought weeks earlier carried overland to panama with the news of the rising against the french then up the coast in la virgen de la bonanza don alejo swore he had intended to pass them to drinkwater on his release the very day drinkwater had succeeded in escaping and there was still the russian power to destroy don alejo was holding out a glass a toast to our new alliance capitán to dos de mayo the second day of may the day madrid rose against the french it is a pity good news travels so slow eh he knew he was not supposed to see her that she broke some imposition of her fathers or her uncles to contrive this clumsy meeting on the path she was as lovely as ever and yet there was something infinitely sad about the cast of her features despite her smile she held two books out to him they were his log and journal and he took them thanking her and tucking them under his arm with the bundle of despatches don alejo had at last given him he smiled back at her señorita i am indebted to you for ever for my freedom even he added the smile passing from his face for my very life he paused recalling how close he had come to the ultimate act of despair and her face reflected her own grief then he brightened and thank you for your kindness in retrieving my books it was nothing you knew about the changes in your countrys circumstances she nodded sí and disobeyed your father my father is sometimes deceived by don alejo drinkwater remembered her obvious dislike of don alejo he was engaged in some illegal traffic with the russians she shrugged all would have been well had nicolai lived it was fated otherwise señorita si que sera sera she murmured why did you release me she looked him full in the face then because you told the truth about nicolai it was a small thing for me it was not it has changed my life i am to go into a convent he remembered the franciscan it is the worlds loss señorita i prayed for your wife and family adios capitán adios señorita he bowed as she turned away drinkwater watched through his glass as hill brought la virgen de la bonanza to her anchor under point lobos that evening he watched don jorge rubalcava board her and wished he could shoot the treacherous dog with macks long rifle that now lay below in his cabin then he swung his glass to see if the rest of the bargain was being kept he watched the boat approach returning the ragged remnants of his men from the chain gang of servitude by the time hill and frey came back from the schooner patricians anchor was atrip i would not stay in this pestilential spot another moment he remarked to hill as the sailing master made his report the knot of officers within hearing nodded in general agreement only mr frey stood pensively staring astern she intends to become a nun mr frey he snapped an unwonted harshness in his voice chapter twentyone the night action september drinkwater stared at the empty bulkhead the paint was faintly discoloured where the portraits of elizabeth and the children used to hang before him on the table were scattered the contents of the despatch brought weeks ago by the aviso it had been a day of explanations not least that of the most perplexing of his worries one that had concerned him months earlier at the time of their departure from the nore some departmental inefficiency had delayed it and now it had been sent out after him to the west indies overland to panama by mule and shipped up the isthmus to be opened and scrutinised by don alejo arguello no doubt before finding its way to him it was months old so old in fact that its contents were rendered meaningless by the train of events except that they heartened him gave him some insight into his apparent abandonment by the head of the admiraltys secret department lord dungarth he read the relevant passage through again i write these notes for your better guidance my dear drinkwater for i find upon my return from government business elsewhere that barrow has sent you out insufficiently prepared seniavin declined to serve against us after his imperial master succumbed to the seductions of bonaparte having seen service with us at an earlier period in his career rakitin is a less honourable man untroubled by such scruples and wellknown to some of your fellow officers i would have you know these things before you reach the pacific for it reaches me that he is to command a ship of some force perhaps a seventyfour and capitalise upon the work done by rezanov drinkwater folded the letter so dungarth had been absent on government business elsewhere drinkwater was intrigued as to where that business might have been had his lordship been back to france he had made some vague allusions to hortense santhonax having become the mistress of talleyrand she had turned her coat before might she not do so again he thrust the ridiculous assumption aside that was altogether too fanciful what advantage could either hortense santhonax or the french foreign minister derive from betraying such an unassailably powerful man as the emperor napoleon it was a preposterous daydream he picked up another letter the superscription was familiar but he could not place it then he recollected the hand of his friend richard white drinkwater slit the seal anticipating his old shipmate must be writing to inform him he had hoisted a rearadmirals flag a deck below captain drinkwater lieutenant quilhampton was also reading a letter i am sure you meant no unkindness catriona had written but i assure you that if the necessity to which you were put was painful to you it was doubly so to me you had the benefit of long consideration i had only the most profound of shocks i have burned those letters you returned but sir circumstanced as i am i must risk all reputation and request you repent yourself of so rash an act god bless my soul he muttered what a surprise what a marvellous bloody surprise drinkwater read whites letter with a profound sense of horror following so soon upon the last he could scarce believe its contents and compared the dates but whites was written a full fortnight after lord dungarths and he had no reason to doubt its accuracy my main purpose in writing my dear nathaniel is to acquaint you of the event of thursday last when on a lonely stretch of the canterbury road near blackheath an incendiary device exploded beneath the coach of lord dungarth and his lordships life is feared for he ruffled through the remaining papers some routine communications from the navy office and an enquiry from the sick and hurt board for a later letter informing him of dungarths death but could find nothing a feeling of guilt stole over him he had condemned a friend without cause and now dungarth might be dead and there was not even a letter from elizabeth to console him he looked up at the bare patches on the forward bulkhead and shook off the omen is she gaining on us mr hill drinkwater looked astern at the big dark hull with the bow wave foaming under her forefoot and her pale patches of sails braced sharp up in pursuit of them there was no doubt of her identity she was the russian seventyfour suvorov gaining steadily sir reported the sailing master good said drinkwater expressing satisfaction he swung to the west where the day was leaching out of the sky and banks of inkily wet cumulus rolled menacingly against the fading light the pale green pallor of the unclouded portion of the sky promised a full gale by morning for the time being the wind was fresh and steady from the northwest itll be dark in an hour thatll be our time so you ease that weather foretack mr hill slow her down a little i dont want him to lose sight of us keep him thinking he has all the advantages aye aye sir mr fraser sir have you inspected all the preparations aye sir and your permission to pipe the men below for something to eat if you please most certainly and a tot for em i want devils tonight aye aye sir fraser touched the forecock of his hat and turned drinkwater went below himself leaving the deck to hill in his cabin mullender poured him a glass of rum and mixed it with water theres some cold pork sir sour cabbage and some figgy duff tregembos put a keen edge on your sabre sir and your pistols are in the case mullender indicated the plates and weapons laid in readiness along the sill of the stern windows where the settee cushions had been removed drinkwater had lost the privacy of his cabin bulkheads since patrician was cleared for action and only a curtain separated him from the gundeck beyond and i found the portraits sir theyre all right good where were they tossed in the hold drinkwater nodded and stared through the windows astern put but the candles mullender ill eat in the dark he did not want to lose his night vision and the extinguishing of even so feeble a light would indicate some form of preparation was being made aboard patrician drinkwater fervently hoped that prince vladimir rakitins opinion of him remained low it had wounded him at the time it had been expressed but drinkwater sought now to fling it in the russians face but he must not tempt providence she was a fickle deity much given to casting down men in the throes of overweening pride on deck again it was completely dark they were near the autumnal equinox and already an approaching winter was casting its cold shadow over the water of the north pacific they pitched easily over the great swells thumping into the occasional waves so that the spray streamed aft after every pale explosion on the weather bow very well mr hill pass word for all hands to stand to divisional officers to report when ready when he received word that the ship was ready for action and every man at his station he gave his next order shorten sail they were prepared for it the lieutenants midshipmen and mates took up the word and patrician lost the driving force of her main and foresails men ran aloft to secure the flogging canvas neither sail had been set to much advantage but not to have carried them would have alerted rakitin now with the onset of night drinkwater doubted the russian officers would be able to see the reduction in sail from the suvorov patrician would be a grey blur in the night and spanker and topsails would convey that impression just as well tack ship mr hill the master gave the routine orders with his usual quiet confidence patrician turned passing her bow through the wind so that the wind and the spray came over the larboard bow and she stood back to the northeast slightly across the suvorovs track but in an attempt to elude her heavy pursuers chase it was precisely drinkwater argued what rakitin would assume he would do in an attempt to escape it crossed drinkwaters mind to wonder what exactly had passed between rakitin and the arguellos by way of a purchase price for his ship he chuckled to himself in the darkness this time there would be no humiliation no superior sailing with which to reproach himself this time he felt in his bones his ships company had come through too much to let it go to the devil for want of a purpose ahhh he could just see the suvorov swinging to starboard having seen the patrician tack he raised his speaking trumpet let fall with a thunderous shudder bunt and clewgarnets were let go ropes whistled through the blocks and the great sails dropped from the yards their clews drawn up to chesstree and bumpkin as they were hauled taut drinkwater could almost feel patrician accelerate an illusion that was confirmed by the sudden change in relative bearing as the two ships closed in the darkness patrician rushing across the bow of the swinging russian as she jibbed in stays taking her wind as she sought to outwit her quarry hoist your lantern mr belchambers mr q starboard battery as they bear the noise of the wind and the tamed thunder of the sails gave way to something more urgent the rushing of the sea between the two hulls shouts of alarms from the russian and beneath their feet the sinister rumbling of the guns as they were run out through the ports they were on top of her now the range was pointblank and no sooner were they run out than the guncaptains jerked their lanyards on the focsle the heavy calibre carronades fired first and the smoke and concussion rolled aft with an awful and impressive rolling broadside that lit the night with the flames of its lethal explosions yellow tongues of fire that belched their iron vomit into the heart of the enemy above and behind drinkwater mr belchambers succeeded in hoisting the battle lantern that was to illuminate the ensign straining from the peak of the gaff it reached its station just as drinkwater looked up at the spanker brail up the spanker up helm shorten sail patrician turned again cocking her stern up into the wind shortening sail again to manoeuvre alongside her shattered victim the suvorov lay in irons her head yards aback and gathering sternway drinkwater had no time to assess the damage for they had yet to run the gauntlet of her starboard broadside where she mounted a greater weight of metal than her opponent for what we are about to receive someone muttered the old blasphemy but quilhamptons gunners were equal to the challenge as a row of orange flashes lit the side of the suvorov the bow guns of patrician reloaded and made swiftly ready by the furious exertions of their crews returned fire patrician shook from the onslaught of shot beside him hill reeled spinning round and crashing into him with a violent shock covering him with gore drinkwater grabbed him my god hill he called but the old man was already dead and drinkwater laid him on the deck somewhere close by someone was shrieking in agony it was a marine whose head had been pierced by langridge silence there roared lieutenant mount but the man was beyond the reach of discipline and blixoe discharged his musket into the mans back he too fell to the deck drinkwater recovered himself spun round and looked at his enemy the suvorov had broached he could see much of her foremast had gone and her focsle was a mass of shattered spars and canvas down helm braces there he brought patrician back towards his enemy and raked her stern from long pistol shot she was almost helpless firing hardly a gun in retaliation nothing but her sternchasers would bear now and their ports were too low to open in such a rising sea for two hours drinkwater worked his frigate back and forth ranging up under the suvorovs stern hammering her great black hull with impunity from his position of undisputed advantage a rising moon shone fitfully between curtains of scud and the vast ocean heaved beneath the two labouring ships the russians fought back with small arms and those quarter guns they could bring to bear but it was only later that drinkwater learned that their complement was much weakened by the length of their cruise and that rakitins eagerness to acquire pressed recruits from the british navy was to make good these deficiencies but russian tenacity was to no avail for suvorov wallowed unmanageable a supine victim of patricians hot guns whose captains had the range too well and whose pound balls crashed into her fabric with destructive precision for those two hours they played their fire into their quondam pursuer rescuing their reputation and the honour of their commander towards four bells in the first watch the pace of patricians fire slackened and drinkwater drew off heavingto under easy sail until daylight men lay exhausted at their guns and drinkwater dozed jammed against the mizen rigging wrapped in his cloak it was belchamberss excited squeal that woke him dawn was upon them and the wallowing hull of the russian lay less than a mile away a shred of smoke was drifting away on the wind for the predicted gale was upon them the sea rolling down from the northwest its surface streaked by spume and shredded to leeward in a mist of spray through which the dark shape of a frigatebird slipped on sweptback wings the suvorov had rolled all her masts overboard but a second defiant shot followed the first and the dark diagonal cross of the tsar still flew from the stump of her mainmast in the rough sea she was incapable of further manoeuvre and awaited only the coupdegrace drinkwater roused his ship and the men stood to their guns again there was a curiously intent look about them now as they stared over the heaving waste of the grey seas at the wallowing russian larboard battery make ready all along the deck the hands went up ready sir fire fully half their shot hit the sea sending up plumes of white which were instantly dissipated by the gale but clouds of splinters erupted in little explosions along the line of the russians hull ready sir fire they timed it better that time the concussion of the guns beat at drinkwaters brain as his eyes registered the destruction their iron was causing to their enemy he wondered if rakitin was still alive and found he no longer cared ready sir fire he raised his glass they were reducing the suvorov to a shambles as she rolled helplessly towards them he could see the havoc about her decks under the fallen wreckage of her masts and spars a fire had started a faint growing flicker that sent a rapidly thickening pall of smoke over the sea towards them shes struck sir belchambers pointed eagerly at the enemy ship the boy was right the tsars ensign was being hauled down cease fire there cease fire congratulations sir said fraser coming aft drinkwater shook his head pass my thanks to the ships company he said tersely fraser drew back and left drinkwater staring down at the body of hill he had executed the admiraltys instructions carried out his particular service to prevent a russian incursion south of the coast of alaska as he bent over the body of the old sailing master he felt the heavy nuggets in the tail pockets of his coat touch the deck it came to him that he might be a wealthy man and he wondered if the presence of gold in california was known to anyone in london he thought of lord dungarth and the infernal device reaching out his hand he touched hills face then stood and stared to windward mourning his friends authors note russian penetration of the pacific coast of north america extended as far south as fort ross on bodega bay the posts of the russianamerican company are assumed to have been founded in but nicolai rezanov attempted a lodgement in which apparently failed perhaps for the reasons here revealed conditions under the company were notoriously poor even by contemporary russian standards and indian raids were frequent had he lived rezanov would undoubtedly have achieved much needed reforms but his tragic death in march in the obscure siberian town of krasnoiarsk prevented this he had been on his way to obtain the tsars ratification of a treaty to trade with the spanish colonies which he had agreed in principle with don josé arguello commandante at san francisco prior to his landing at san francisco rezanov had headed an embassy to the japanese capital at yedo as part of kruzensterns circumnavigation this too ended in failure don alejo is my own invention for don josé seems to have been a man of honour unwilling to trade against the wishes of madrid although he had reached some form of accommodation with rezanov it seemed reasonable to assume his daughter had inherited her fathers highminded character and that she should be attracted to that of rezanov for she too existed famed for her extraordinary beauty she first met the russian in april they fell in love and announced their betrothal when she finally learnt of his untimely death the spanish beauty became a nun descriptions of russian merchant ships may be found in the pages of dana who met them in san francisco in the s shortly before the abandonment of the posts at bodega bay fort ross and the columbia river and some twentyodd years before the sale of alaska to the united states several countries laid a spurious claim to this wild and lovely coast in the early years of the last century and it is fascinating to speculate upon the turn of events had the presence of gold been known forty years earlier than it is generally thought to have been it is not inconceivable that its presence was known to a few who for reasons of their own wished it to remain secret
