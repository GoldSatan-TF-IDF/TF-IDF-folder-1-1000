legend is historical just as history is legendary alexandre grandazzi the foundation of rome a stop on the salt route bc as they rounded a bend in the path that ran beside the river lara recognized the silhouette of a fig tree atop a nearby hill the weather was hot and the days were long the fig tree was in full leaf but not yet bearing fruit soon lara spotted other landmarksan outcropping of limestone beside the path that had a silhouette like a mans face a marshy spot beside the river where the waterfowl were easily startled a tall tree that looked like a man with his arms upraised they were drawing near to the place where there was an island in the river the island was a good spot to make camp they would sleep on the island tonight lara had been back and forth along the river path many times in her short life her people had not created the pathit had always been there like the riverbut their deerskinshod feet and the wooden wheels of their handcarts kept the path well worn laras people were salt traders and their livelihood took them on a continual journey at the mouth of the river the little group of half a dozen intermingled families gathered salt from the great salt beds beside the sea they groomed and sifted the salt and loaded it into handcarts when the carts were full most of the group would stay behind taking shelter amid rocks and simple leantos while a band of fifteen or so of the heartier members set out on the path that ran alongside the river with their precious cargo of salt the travelers crossed the coastal lowlands and traveled toward the mountains but laras people never reached the mountaintops they traveled only as far as the foothills many people lived in the forests and grassy meadows of the foothills gathered in small villages in return for salt these people would give laras people dried meat animal skins cloth spun from wool clay pots needles and scraping tools carved from bone and little toys made of wood their bartering done lara and her people would travel back down the river path to the sea the cycle would begin again it had always been like this lara knew no other life she traveled back and forth up and down the river path no single place was home she liked the seaside where there was always fish to eat and the gentle lapping of the waves lulled her to sleep at night she was less fond of the foothills where the path grew steep the nights could be cold and views of great distances made her dizzy she felt uneasy in the villages and was often shy around strangers the path itself was where she felt most at home she loved the smell of the river on a hot day and the croaking of frogs at night vines grew amid the lush foliage along the river with berries that were good to eat even on the hottest day sundown brought a cool breeze off the water which sighed and sang amid the reeds and tall grasses of all the places along the path the area they were approaching with the island in the river was laras favorite the terrain along this stretch of the river was mostly flat but in the immediate vicinity of the island the land on the sunrise side was like a rumpled cloth with hills and ridges and valleys among laras people there was a wooden babys crib suitable for strapping to a cart that had been passed down for generations the island was shaped like that crib longer than it was wide and pointed at the upriver end where the flow had eroded both banks the island was like a crib and the group of hills on the sunrise side of the river were like old women mantled in heavy cloaks gathered to have a look at the baby in the cribthat was how laras father had once described the lay of the land larth spoke like that all the time conjuring images of giants and monsters in the landscape he could perceive the spirits called numina that dwelled in rocks and trees sometimes he could speak to them and hear what they had to say the river was his oldest friend and told him where the fishing would be best from whispers in the wind he could foretell the next days weather because of such skills larth was the leader of the group were close to the island arent we papa said lara how did you know the hills first we start to see the hills off to the right the hills grow bigger and just before we come to the island we can see the silhouette of that fig tree up there along the crest of that hill good girl said larth proud of his daughters memory and powers of observation he was a strong handsome man with flecks of gray in his black beard his wife had borne several children but all had died very young except lara the last whom his wife had died bearing lara was very precious to him like her mother she had golden hair now that she had reached the age of childbearing lara was beginning to display the fullness of a womans hips and breasts it was larths greatest wish that he might live to see his own grandchildren not every man lived that long but larth was hopeful he had been healthy all his life partly he believed because he had always been careful to show respect to the numina he encountered on his journeys respecting the numina was important the numen of the river could suck a man under and drown him the numen of a tree could trip a man with its roots or drop a rotten branch on his head rocks could give way underfoot chuckling with amusement at their own treachery even the sky with a roar of fury sometimes sent down fingers of fire that could roast a man like a rabbit on a spit or worse leave him alive but robbed of his senses larth had heard that the earth itself could open and swallow a man though he had never actually seen such a thing he nevertheless performed a ritual each morning asking the earths permission before he went striding across it theres something so special about this place said lara gazing at the sparkling river to her left and then at the rocky treespotted hills ahead and to her right how was it made who made it larth frowned the question made no sense to him a place was never made it simply was small features might change over time uprooted by a storm a tree might fall into the river a boulder might decide to tumble down the hillside the numina that animated all things went about reshaping the landscape from day to day but the essential things never changed and had always existed the river the hills the sky the sun the sea the salt beds at the mouth of the river he was trying to think of some way to express these thoughts to lara when a deer drinking at the river was startled by their approach the deer bolted up the brushy bank and onto the path instead of running to safety the creature stood and stared at them as clearly as if the animal had whispered aloud larth heard the words eat me the deer was offering herself larth turned to shout an order but the most skilled hunter of the group a youth called po was already in motion po ran forward raised the sharpened stick he always carried and hurled it whistling through the air between larth and lara a heartbeat later the spear struck the deers breast with such force that the creature was knocked to the ground unable to rise she thrashed her neck and flailed her long slender legs po ran past larth and lara when he reached the deer he pulled the spear free and stabbed the creature again the deer released a stifled noise like a gasp and stopped moving there was a cheer from the group instead of yet another dinner of fish from the river tonight there would be venison the distance from the riverbank to the island was not great but at this time of yearearly summerthe river was too high to wade across laras people had long ago made simple rafts of branches lashed together with leather thongs which they left on the riverbanks repairing and replacing them as needed when they last passed this way there had been three rafts all in good condition left on the east bank two of the rafts were still there but one was missing i see it therepulled up on the bank of the island almost hidden among those leaves said po whose eyes were sharp someone must have used it to cross over perhaps theyre still on the island said larth he did not begrudge others the use of the rafts and the island was large enough to share nonetheless the situation required caution he cupped his hands to his mouth and gave a shout it was not long before a man appeared on the bank of the island the man waved do we know him said larth squinting i dont think so said po hes youngmy age or younger id say he looks strong very strong said lara even from this distance the young strangers brawniness was impressive he wore a short tunic without sleeves and lara had never seen such arms on a man po who was small and wiry looked at lara sidelong and frowned im not sure i like the look of this stranger why not said lara hes smiling at us in fact the young man was smiling at lara and lara alone his name was tarketios much more than that larth could not tell for the stranger spoke a language which larth did not recognize in which each word seemed as long and convoluted as the mans name understanding the deer had been easier than understanding the strange noises uttered by this man and his two companions even so they seemed friendly and the three of them presented no threat to the more numerous salt traders tarketios and his two older companions were skilled metalworkers from a region some two hundred miles to the north where the hills were rich with iron copper and lead they had been on a trading journey to the south and were returning home just as the river path carried larths people from the seashore to the hills so another path perpendicular to the river traversed the long coastal plain because the island provided an easy place to ford the river it was here that the two paths intersected on this occasion the salt traders and the metal traders happened to arrive at the island on the same day now they met for the first time the two groups made separate camps at opposite ends of the island as a gesture of friendship speaking with his hands larth invited tarketios and the others to share the venison that night as the hosts and their guests feasted around the roasting fire tarketios tried to explain something of his craft firelight glittered in laras eyes as she watched tarketios point at the flames and mime the act of hammering firelight danced across the flexing muscles of his arms and shoulders when he smiled at her his grin was like a boast she had never seen teeth so white and so perfect po saw the looks the two exchanged and frowned laras father saw the same looks and smiled the meal was over the metal traders after many gestures of gratitude for the venison withdrew to their camp at the far side of the island before he disappeared into the shadows tarketios looked over his shoulder and gave lara a parting grin while the others settled down to sleep larth stayed awake a while longer as was his habit he liked to watch the fire like all other things fire possessed a numen that sometimes communicated with him showing him visions as the last of the embers faded into darkness larth fell asleep larth blinked the flames which had dwindled to almost nothing suddenly shot up again hot air rushed over his face his eyes were seared by white flames brighter than the sun amid the dazzling brightness he perceived a thing that levitated above the flames it was a masculine member disembodied but nonetheless rampant and upright it bore wings like a bird and hovered in midair though it seemed to be made of flesh it was impervious to the flames larth had seen the winged phallus before always in such circumstances when he stared at a fire and entered a dream state he had even given it a name or more precisely the thing had planted its name in his mind fascinus fascinus was not like the numina that animated trees stones or rivers those numina existed without names each was bound to the object in which it resided and there was little to differentiate one from another when such numina spoke they could not always be trusted sometimes they were friendly but at other times they were mischievous or even hostile fascinus was different it was unique it existed in and of itself without beginning or end clearly from its form it had something to do with life and the origin of life yet it seemed to come from a place beyond this world slipping for a few moments through a breach opened by the heat of the dancing flames an appearance by fascinus was always significant the winged phallus never appeared without giving larth an answer to a dilemma that had been troubling him or planting an important new thought in his mind the guidance given to him by fascinus had never led larth astray elsewhere in distant landsgreece israel egyptmen and women worshiped gods and goddesses those people made images of their gods told stories about them and worshiped them in temples larth had never met such people he had never even heard of the lands where they lived and he had never encountered or conceived of a god the very concept of a deity such as those other men worshiped was unknown to larth but the closest thing to a god in his imagination and experience was fascinus with a start he blinked again the flames had died in place of intolerable brightness there was only the darkness of a warm summer night lit by the faintest sliver of a moon the air on his face was no longer hot but fresh and cool fascinus had vanishedbut not without planting a thought in larths mind he hurried to the leafy bower beside the river where lara liked to sleep thinking to himself it must be made so because fascinus says it must he knelt beside her but there was no need to wake her she was already awake papa what is it go to him she did not need to ask for an explanation it was what she had been yearning to do lying restless and eager in the dark are you sure papa fascinus he did not finish the thought but she understood she had never seen fascinus but he had told her about it many times in the past fascinus had given guidance to her father now once again fascinus had made its will known the darkness did not deter her she knew every twist and turn of every path on the little island when she came to the metal traders camp she found tarketios lying in a leafy nook secluded from the others she recognized him by his brawny silhouette he was awake and waiting just as she had been lying awake waiting when her father came to her at her approach tarketios rose onto his elbows he spoke her name in a whisper there was a quiver of something like desperation in his voice his neediness made her smile she sighed and lowered herself beside him by the faint moonlight she saw that he wore an amulet of some sort suspended from a strap of leather around his neck nestled amid the hair on his chest the bit of shapeless metal seemed to capture and concentrate the faint moonlight casting back a radiance brighter than the moon itself his armsthe arms she had so admired earlierreached out and closed around her in a surprisingly gentle embrace his body was as warm and naked as her own but much bigger and much harder she wondered if fascinus was with them in the darkness for she seemed to feel the beating of wings between their legs as she was entered by the thing that gave origin to life the next morning when the others began to wake and stir larth saw that lara was back in the bower where she usually slept he wondered if she had disobeyed him then he saw by the look in her eyes and the smile on her face as she woke that she had not while the others broke camp and made ready to depart larth called po to his side the youth was uncharacteristically slow to respond and kept his eyes averted while larth spoke to him before we set out this morning po i want you return to the place where you killed the deer yesterday rake the earth and cover any traces of blood on the path if blood was spattered on leaves or loose stones throw them in the river this should have been done yesterday but the light was fading and there was much work to do skinning and roasting the deer do it now before we set out we cant leave blood on the trail why not said po larth was taken aback po had never used such a surly tone with him before blood will attract vermin and predators blood on the trail may offend the numina that reside along the river no matter that the deer freely offered herself but i neednt explain these things to you do as i tell you po stared at the ground larth was about to speak again more harshly when he was distracted by the arrival of the metal traders who had come to see them off tarketios stepped forward he made a great show of offering larth a gift it was an object made of iron small enough to hold in the palm of one hand with an opening at one end and a very sharp point at the other it was a spearpoint made of irona very useful thing for bringing down the next deer that should cross the river path tarketios made it clear that he expected nothing in return larths people possessed a few crudely fashioned knives and scraping tools made of iron but nothing as finely wrought as the spearpoint he was very impressed he showed it to po what do you think of that he said before po could answer larth reached for pos spear and took it from his grasp youre the best hunter among us you should have this well let tarketios show us how to fix the point to the shaft while po stood dumbly by larth handed the spear and the iron point to tarketios tarketios smiled at both men the sight of his perfect teeth made pos fingers twitch with a small hammer and nails tarketios set about fixing the point to the shaft larth watched him work fascinated and took no notice of the deep red blush that spread across pos face when the work was done tarketios handed the spear back to po the new point was heavier than po had realized the spear tilted forward in his hand and the iron point struck the ground with a thud the balance is different said larth laughing at the younger mans consternation youll have to learn how to aim and throw all over again but the new point should allow for a cleaner kill dont you think you wont need to throw as hard po hurriedly shifted his grip and held the spear firmly upright again grasping the shaft so tightly that his knuckles turned white a little later as the salt traders were getting ready to depart from the island on the rafts tarketios approached lara he led her to a secluded spot there were no words they could share to express what they were feeling for a while they simply touched and held each other then drew apart in the same instant each read the intention of the other to offer a parting gift the moment of shared understanding and the likeness of their intentions made them both laugh to tarketios lara offered the most precious thing she could a small clay vessel with a cork stopper filled with pure white salt tarketios accepted the gift then set it aside over his head he lifted the leather strap around his neck along with the amulet that hung from it it was strange because it had no discernible shape it appeared to be nothing more than small lump of unworked metal but it was a metal such as she had never seen before very heavy in the palm of her hand and of a most unusual color a pure yellow like the light of the sun the only work that had been done on the metal was a small piercing that allowed it to be hung from the leather necklace tarketios placed it over her head he uttered something naming the thing he had given her but the word was only a strange sound in her ear lara had no way of knowing how precious the little lump was it was the only metal that never tarnished but by the look in tarketioss eyes she could see that he treasured it and that by giving it he honored her although she did not yet know it already he had given her another gift a new life was quickening in her womb the sun was well up in the sky by the time the little band set out upriver from the island the hills to their right receded and the river made a sweeping bend around a low flat promontory the first landmark they came to was a little path that led to some hot springs near the river in cooler weather the springs were a favorite place to make camp but not at this season larth was settling into the rhythm of the walk when he suddenly remembered the task he had assigned to po before they set out he looked over his shoulder did you clean the blood from the path he said by the look on pos face he could see at once that his order had been ignored go back then and do it now he said exasperated we wont wait for you youll have to run to catch up with us without a word po stopped in his tracks he let the others pass him he watched as the band continued onward until the last straggler disappeared from sight the spear in his hand seemed to quiver he looked down and saw that his hands were trembling it was one thing to act on impulseto see a deer and instantly spring into action to cast his spear and then stab the creature until it was dead with hardly a thought until the deed was over to do what he was now contemplating was something altogether different po remained standing on the path for a long time finally he turned and headed back in the direction of the island running at a steady trot hefting the spear in his hand and judging its weight the terrain along the path steadily rose as the band proceeded upriver several times at places which afforded a view larth paused and asked lara whose eyes were better than his to look back the way they had come she saw no sign of po or of anyone else on the trail the sun began to sink and still po had not rejoined the group larth grew fearful he should not have sent the youth alone because po had disobeyed him anger had clouded his judgment but just as the group stopped to make camp for the night po appeared he strode toward them at a steady pace not rushed or out of breath instead he seemed calm and relaxed you took your time said larth what was the hurry a man cant get lost following the river path you did as i told you of course larths eyes had weakened but he retained a sharp sense of smell he looked at po more closely especially at his hair and his hands they were very cleanunusually so you have the smell of the hot springs on you for several heartbeats po did not answer yes i stopped to bathe in the springs you even washed this larth touched the youths woolen tunic it was freshly rinsed and still slightly damp i feltthe blood of the deer on me you said to cover all traces the numina along the trail po lowered his eyes i felt the need to wash myself larth nodded he said no more the place where they camped was near a high steep hill from past journeys when his eyes had been sharper larth knew that from the summit of the hill a man could see a great distance he found lara and told her to come with him where are we going papa to the top of the hill quickly while theres still daylight she followed puzzled by his urgency when they reached the top larth took a moment to catch his breath then pointed in the downriver direction the sinking sun was in their eyes it cast a red glow across the land and turned the winding river into a ribbon of flame even with his poor eyesight larth could discern the hilly region near the island though the island itself was hidden he pointed toward it there daughter where the island lies do you see anything she shrugged hills water trees something moving she narrowed her eyes and shielded her brow silhouetted against the red haze of the sunset she saw a multitude of tiny flecks of black above the island slowly circling and riding the wind as bits of cinder spin above a fire vultures she said i see many vultures later while the others slept larth remained awake as was his habit he watched the fire for a while then rose and walked stealthily to the place where po lay the youth was sleeping by himself away from the others as if he wanted to keep his distance from them his spear lay close beside him to take it larth had to be very careful not to wake him by the firelight he looked very closely at the iron point even in the hot springs it must have been impossible to scrub every bit of blood from the hammered metal in tiny jagged fissures traces of blood yet remained he returned to po and stood over him he pressed the spearpoint to the youths throat and gave him a kick po stirred gave a start then was instantly awake a bead of blood appeared around the spearpoint pressed to his neck he gasped and gripped the shaft with both hands but larth exerted all his strength to hold it steady speak in a whisper he said not wanting to wake the others remove your hands from the spear put your arms at your side thats better now tell me the truth all three of themor only tarketios for a long time po did not answer larth saw his eyes flash in the darkness and heard his ragged breathing though po lay very still larth could feel the quivering tension of the youths body transmitted through the shaft of the spear all of them po said at last larth felt a great coldness descend upon him until that moment he had not been sure of the truth their bodies in the river my oldest friend fouled with blood thought larth what would the numen of the river think of him and his people now theyll flow to the sea po said i left no trace no at least one of the bodies must have grounded on the riverbank how can you know that vultures larth could picture the sceneblood in the water a corpse amid the rushes the vultures circling overhead larth shook his head what a hunter the boy must be to stalk and kill three men and what a fool could the people afford to lose him could they afford to keep him it was in larths power to kill him here and now but he would have to justify his action to the others more than that he would have to justify the action to himself at last larth sighed i know everything you do po remember that he lifted the spearpoint from the youths throat he let the spear fall to the ground he turned away and went back to his place by the fire it might have been worse if the boy had been such a fool that he killed only tarketios then the other two would surely have come after him seeking vengeance they would have taken the news back to their people the knowledge that one of the salt traders had done such a thing would have spread the consequences and recriminations could have continued for a lifetime perhaps for generations as it was only the numina along the trail would know and the river and the vultures and larth he gazed at the fire and wished more fervently than he had ever wished before that fascinus would appear to him that night fascinus could put in his mind the proper thing to do but the fire died to darkness and fascinus did not appear it would never appear to him again that night except for the vultures whose gullets were stuffed with carrion the little island in the river was deserted as long as larth lived the salt traders never camped there again he told them that lemuresshades of the restless deadhad come to dwell upon the island because larth was known to possess a deep knowledge of such things the others accepted what he said without question as winter turned to spring lara gave birth to a son the birth was difficult and lara very nearly died but when her suffering was most acute for the first and only time in her life she had a vision of fascinus and a voice in her head assured her that she and her child would both survive all the while she clutched the lump of gold that hung from the necklace around her neck and the cool metal seemed to absorb her pain in her delirium the gold and fascinus became one and the same afterward she told her father that the numen of the winged phallus had come to dwell in the gold shortly after the birth in a simple ceremony near the salt beds beside the sea lara was wedded to po though he knew better po claimed the child as his own he did this because larth told him he must and he could see that larth was right po would never be as wise in the ways of the numina as was his fatherinlaw but even he could sense that his act of violence on the island demanded an act of contrition by accepting the son of the man he had killed po made restitution to the lemur of tarketios he also appeased any numina which had witnessed and been offended by the blood he had deliberately shed over the years laras memories of tarketios grew dim but the gold amulet he had given her which she now believed to house the numen of fascinus never lost its luster before she died she gave the amulet to her son her explanation of its origin was not true but was not a lie either for lara had come to believe less in her dim memories than in the fanciful stories she had invented to take their place the gold came from the fire she told her son the same fire above which your grandfather saw fascinus on the last night we camped on the island without fascinus my son you would never have been conceived without fascinus neither you nor i would have survived your birth fascinus inspired conception fascinus safeguarded birth it had another power as well fascinus could avert the evil eye lara knew this from experience because after her son was born she had heard other women whisper behind her back and had caught them looking at her strangely in truth they looked at her with curiosity and suspicion but she interpreted their gazes as envy the gazes of the envious as her father had taught her could cause illness misfortune even death but with fascinus hanging from her neck lara had felt safe confident that the dazzling luster of the gold could deflect even the most dangerous gaze as the amulet and the story of its origin were passed down to succeeding generations it was left to laras descendents to ponder the exact role played by fascinus in the continuation of the family line had the winged phallus itself emerged from the flames to impregnate lara had such an instance of intercourse between numina and humankind ever occurred before or since was it because a numen had fathered her child that the other women had been suspicious and envious of lara had fascinus made a gift of the gold knowing that lara would need it to protect herself and to safeguard his own offspring the gold amulet its true origin forgotten was passed down through the generations many years passed larths warning of restless lemures on the island in the river was forgotten and the salt traders once again camped there still the island and the surrounding area remained nothing more than a stopping place deer rabbits and wolves roamed the seven nearby hills frogs and dragonflies dwelled in the marshy lowlands between the hills birds passed overhead and saw below them no sign of human occupation elsewhere in the world men built great cities made war consecrated temples to gods sang of heroes and dreamed of empires in faraway egypt the dynasties of the pharaohs had already reigned for millennia the great pyramid of giza was more than years old the war of the greeks against troy was two hundred years in the past the taking of helen and the wrath of achilles had already passed into legend in israel king david had captured the old city of jerusalem and made it his capital and his son solomon was building the first temple to the god yahweh further to the east migrating aryans were founding the kingdoms of media and parsa forerunners of the great persian empire but the island in the river and the seven nearby hills remained unsettled by men and overlooked by the gods a place where nothing of particular importance had ever happened a demigod passes through bc it seemed to cacus that once upon a time he had been human cacus had been born in a village high in the mountains like the others in the village he possessed two arm and two hands and he walked upright on two feet clearly he had not been born an animal like the timid sheep or the wild wolves but a human being but cacus had always been different from the others they walked with an even gait cacus shambled because one of his legs was too short and oddly bent the others could stand tall and straight with their arms at their sides cacuss back was hunched and his arms mismatched his eyes were sharp but there seemed to be something wrong with his mouth he never learned to speak and could make only a garbled noise which sounded like cacus it was from this noise that he acquired his name his face was grossly misshapen another child once told him that a potter made his face out of clay then threw it down and stepped on it few people ever looked at him directly those who knew him looked away out of pity strangers drew back in fear his deformities should have marked him for death in the hour of his birth but his mother had contrived to spare him pleading that the infants prodigious sizehe was so big that she very nearly died in bearing himwas a promise of future strength she had been correct while still a child cacus grew to be bigger and stronger than even the biggest strongest man in the village when that happened the villagers who had pitied him began to fear him then came the hunger the winter was dry and cold the spring was dry and hot the summer was drier and hotter still streams dwindled to a trickle then to nothing crops withered and died the sheep could not be fed when it seemed that things could not become worse one night the mountain shook so severely that some of the huts collapsed not long after that black clouds came from the west they promised rain but sent down only lightning bolts a lightning strike started a fire that swept across the mountainside and destroyed the hut in which the grain was stored the villagers turned to the elders for advice had things ever gone so badly before what could be done one of the elders recalled a similar time from his childhood when the number of villagers had grown too large and a series of bad years led to hunger and desperation there was a ritual handed down from a time before his birth called the rite of sacred spring a pact was made with the great numina of the sky and the earth if the village could survive the winter then when spring came a group of children would be driven away from the village sent forth to survive in the world beyond as best they could it seemed a harsh remedy but times were harsh the elders advised that there must be a rite of sacred spring the villagers agreed the number of children to be sent away was decided by portent on a still day the elders climbed up to a stone promontory on the mountainside above the village there they set fire to a bundle of dry branches then stood back and waited until the rising smoke formed a column in the air so that the sky was separated into two regions one to either side of the smoke the elders watched the sky and counted the number of birds that flew from one region to the other crossing the line defined by the smoke by the time the branches burned to ashes and the column of smoke dispersed seven birds were seen to cross seven children had to be chosen the choosing was done by lottery it was important that everyone in the village could see that the numina of chance not the scheming of any parent dictated the outcome while everyone in the village watched the children stood in a line a pot full of small pebbles all white except for seven black ones was passed before them one by one the children reached inside and took a pebble when all of them were done together they opened their palms to show the stone they had chosen when it was seen which children had chosen the black pebbles there was much weeping but when cacuss claw of a hand opened to show a black pebble even his mother seemed relieved that winter was milder than the year before despite hunger and hardship no one in the village died it seemed that the rite of sacred spring had placated the numina and preserved the village when spring came and the first buds opened on the trees it was decided that the children must set out according to the ritual an animal would guide the children to their new home all the elders agreed on this but none of them could quite remember how this animal was to be chosen the eldest among them said that the animal would make itself known and sure enough the night before the children were to set out several of the elders had a dream in which they saw a vulture the next morning the seven children were taken from their homes the other children and all the women of the village were shut away from the huts their weeping could be heard all over the mountainside the elder with the keenest eyes climbed up to the promontory and watched at last he gave a shout and pointed to the southwest where he saw a vulture circling just above the horizon the men took up cudgels beating drums and shaking rattles the elders led them in a chant meant to summon their courage and harden their hearts the chant grew faster and faster louder and louder at last screaming and brandishing their cudgels they ran toward the seven children and drove them from the village the days after that had been very hard each morning the children searched the sky for a vulture if they saw one they headed toward it sometimes the vulture led them to carrion that was still fit to eat sometimes it led them to a carcass so foul that even the vulture would not touch it desperation taught them to hunt and fish and to sample every plant that might be edible even so on many days the children went hungry cacus was too clumsy to be of much use as a hunter and the others resented him because he needed more to eat but he was the strongest by far and when predators howled at night it was to cacus that the others looked for protection the first to die was a girl faint from hunger she fell from a high place and struck her head the children debated what they should do with her body it was not cacus who suggested the unthinkable but another boy the rest agreed and cacus did as the others did was that when he began to become something that was not human when he first ate human flesh little by little their wanderings took them to the lower lands to the south and west of the mountains here the land offered more game and the rivers more fish and the plants were more fit to eat still they were hungry the next child to die was a boy with an injured foot when the children came upon a bear and scattered in panic the boy lagged behind the bear caught him and mauled him badly then lumbered off when cacus came running back screaming and brandishing a branch the boy was already dead when the children ate that night it seemed only proper that cacus should have the largest portion summer passed and still they found no home one of the children died after eating a mushroom another died after several days of sickness and fever despite their hunger the survivors feared to eat the bodies of those who had died of poison or fever and so they buried them in shallow graves only cacus and two others remained that winter was unusually bitter and cold trees shivered naked in the wind the earth turned as hard as stone the animals vanished even the most skillful hunter would have found it impossible to survive without the desperate solution to which cacus resorted was that when the change occurred in cacuswhen he decided not to wait for a fall or a bear or some other chance event instead he did it himself he did what he had to do and for the most basic reason he needed to eat but he did not act rashly he did not kill them both at once first he killed the stronger one and let the weaker one live a little longer more than once that child his final companion tried to escape from him cacus waited as long as he could until his hunger was so great that no man could have endured it he waited because he knew as soon as the other child was gone that the only thing worse than hunger would follow loneliness spring came cacus was alone at night he could not sleep but lay awake listening to the sounds of the wilderness entering more and more into a world bereft of human reason he continued to wander eventually he encountered travelers and came upon villages but no humans would have anything to do with him they feared him and rightly so more than once he stole a child and ate it when that happened the humans pursued cacus a few times they came close to capturing him but always cacus escaped and left the hunters behind their bones picked clean surviving in the wild had taught him cunning and stealth physically no man was his match cacus had grown bigger and stronger than any man he had ever seen the wheel of the seasons passed again and again cacus survived the dry summers and the harsh winters always alone always wandering one day he saw a vulture cross the sky the season was early spring the green of the earth and the soft warmth of the air stirred in his mind a dim recollection of the beginning of his journey he set about following the vulture eventually he found himself on a path beside a river around a great bend in the river he saw ahead of him a region of hills and beyond one of the hills a plume of smoke he lost sight of the vulture but decided that the path he was following was as good as any other paths led to villages in villages there was food to be stolen this time he told himself he would stay hidden and go raiding only at night the longer he could go without being seen the longer it would be before the villagers ran him off suddenly cacus felt a great sadness once he had lived in a village himself the others had sometimes teased and taunted him but they had accepted him as one of their own despite the fact that he was so different then they had driven him off why because the earth and the sky themselves demanded it that was what his mother had told him before he left the village he had never harmed anyone yet the world and everything in it had become his enemy the sadness he felt swelled inside him and turned into rage he rounded a corner and saw ahead of him a young girl on the path she was carrying a basket of clothes heading to the river her hair was golden and around her neck suspended from a simple strip of leather was a small amulet made of gold that flashed in the sunlight the girl saw him and screamed she dropped her basket and ran away furious suddenly weeping he ran after her shouting his name cacus cacus he followed her only a short distance for up ahead he saw the first signs of a settlement wishing he could disappear he stepped off the path into the brush from the settlement he could hear the girl still screaming then the shouts of others as they ran to her side asking what she had seen what had the girl seen when she looked at him not a human like herself that was certain and not an animal either no animal except perhaps a snake inspired such revulsion and fear it was a monster she saw only a monster could wrench such a scream from the girls throat he had become a monster when had this happened it seemed to cacus that once upon a time he had been human the settlement by the river started as a trading post traffic along the river path and up and down the route used by the metal traders had increased to such an extent that there always seemed to be people coming and going through the region of the seven hills it was an enterprising descendent of po and lara who hit upon the idea of settling permanently at the crossroads and setting up a marketplace for the exchange of goods why should the salt traders transport their salt all the way to the mountains when they need bring it only as far as the trading post exchange it there for the goods they wanted then head back to the mouth of the river for more salt a place that had been a crossroads became a destination and for the handful of settlers at the trading post a home by acting as middlemen and providing accommodations for travelers the settlers thrived the settlement of twenty or so huts was located at the foot of a steep cliff where a broad flat meadow beside the river offered easy access to the path and provided plenty of space for setting up the market a seasonal stream called the spinon cut through the meadow and emptied into the river which men now called the tiber the huts were round with a single large room made of intertwined twigs and branches daubed with mud with peaked roofs made of rushes and reeds for a doorway sturdy upright poles in some cases elaborately carved supported a wooden lintel a flap of stitched animal skins provided a covering for the doorway the huts furnished with simple pallets for sitting or sleeping were intended strictly for shelter from the elements or for privacy all cooking and most social activities took place outside the marketplace on the other side of the spinon and nearer the river consisted of a few thatched sheds for storing salt pens for livestock and an open area where traders could park their wagons and carts and offer their goods for sale the livestock included oxen cattle swine sheep and goats on any given day the various commodities might include dyed wool fur rugs hats made of straw or felt bags made of leather clay vessels woven baskets combs and clasps made from tortoiseshell or amber bronze ornaments and buckles and axes and ploughshares made of iron there were pine nuts from the mountains crayfish from the river succulent frogs from the marshy lake pots of honey bowls of cheese pitchers of fresh milk and in season chestnuts berries grapes apples and figs some of the traders arrived at regular intervals and became old friends to the settlers and to each other but new faces were always appearing men from far away who had heard of the trading post and were eager to see for themselves the variety of goods to be found there the trading post was also a place to exchange news and gossip to hear stories from faraway places and to listen to traveling singers men who knew magic passed through offering their services some could cure the sick or make a barren woman fertile some could see the future some could commune with the numina that animated the nonhuman realm by far the most exotic visitors to the settlement were the traders who arrived by boat paddling upriver from the sea where they arrived on larger ships which they left moored at the mouth of the tiber those huge splendid shipssome of the settlers had once made a journey downriver to look at onecarried the traders up and down the coast and even so they claimed across the great sea these seafarers called themselves phoenicians they spoke many languages wore brightly colored clothes and finely wrought jewelry and brought with them extraordinary things to barter made in unimaginably distant lands including small images of men made of metal or clay at first misunderstanding the settlers thought that numina lived in the images just as numina lived inside trees and rocks though the idea that a numen would reside in even the most splendid manmade object seemed to many of them farfetched the phoenicians tried to explain that an idol did not house a numen but stood as a representation of something called a god but this concept was too abstract for the settlers to follow the latest descendent in the line of po and lara was a girl called potitia daughter of potitius growing up at the trading post potitia had been allowed from earliest childhood to roam the surrounding countryside for a long distance upriver and down she knew every steep embankment and muddy beach along the riverbank she had waded across the tiber when it was low and had swum across when it was high she had also explored the spinon which ran in front of the settlement following it up through a little valley flanked by steep hillsides to its source a marshy lake surrounded by hills the marsh teemed with living creaturesfrogs lizards dragonflies spiders snakes and all sort of birds it was exhilarating to see a flock of startled geese take flight from the reeds or to watch the swans make circles in the sky before landing on the water with effortless grace as she grew older potitias explorations had taken her farther and farther from the settlement one day venturing upriver she had discovered the hot springs greatly excited she had run all the way home to tell the others and was chagrined to learn that her father already knew about the springs where did the bubbling water come from potitius said it flowed up from a fiery place deep underground curious potitia had searched all around the hot springs for an entrance to the underworld but had never found one on one occasion the hot springs dried up but then returned alarmed that such a thing might happen again the settlers decided to build an altar at the springs and to make offerings to appease the fiery numina in the earth potitius had built the altar himself using oxen to drag a large stone to the spot then chiseling the stone into a shape that seemed suitable to him once a year an offering of salt was spread upon the altar then scattered over the hot springs so far they had not run dry again as her explorations took her outward from the village so they also took her upward the first of the seven hills which potitia conquered was the one directly behind her familys hut on the side that faced the settlement the hill presented a sheer cliff that was impossible for even the most determined child to climb but on the far side of the hill by trial and error potitia discovered a route that led all the way to the top the view was astounding circling the crest of the summit she could look down on the marshy lake on the settlement below and on the region of the hot springs which she now could see were situated at the edge of a large plain that lay in an elbow of the tiber gazing beyond these familiar places she realized that the world was much vaster than she had previously imagined the river stretched on in either direction for as far as she could see wherever she looked the impossibly distant horizon faded to a smudge of purple one by one potitia conquered all the seven hills most of them were bigger than the one closest to home but were easier to climb once you knew the best place to begin the ascent and which route to take each hill had something to distinguish it one was covered with a beech forest another was crowned with a ring of ancient oaks another was populated by osier trees and so on the hills had not yet been given individual names collectively for longer than anyone could remember men called them the seven hills more recently a visitor passing through had jokingly referred to the region as the ruma which was the same word men used to refer to a womans breasts or the teats of a cow and now as often as not ruma was the word people used for the hilly region to the settlers it seemed perfectly natural to liken the features of the earth to the parts of a body in a cliff directly across from the settlement beyond the meadow on the far side of the spinon potitia had discovered the cave situated in a cleft of the steep hill and concealed by scrubby bushes that clung tenaciously to the rocks the mouth of the cave was hard to discern from the ground directly below it might have been nothing more than a shadow cast by a lip of rock through trial and error potitia determined that it was impossible to climb down to the cave from above climbing up from the below would require considerable skill and daring her first few attempts over the course of a summer resulted in one nasty fall after another and repeated scoldings from her mother who disapproved of potitias scraped hands bloody knees and torn tunics eventually potitia discovered a way to reach the cave when she stepped inside for the first time she knew that all her efforts had been worthwhile to a childs eyes the space seemed enormous almost as big as her familys hut she sat upon an outcropping of rock that formed a natural bench and rested her arm on a ledge that provided a shelf the cave was like a house made of stone just waiting for her to claim it unlike the hot springs the cave was unknown to the others at the settlement potitia was the first human being ever to set foot in it the cave became her secret haven on hot summer days she escaped there to take a nap on wet winter days she sat inside comfortable and dry and listened to the rain as potitia grew older roaming the woods and exploring the ruma grew less important to her she became more interested in learning the skills her mother could teach her such as cooking and weaving baskets from the reeds that grew around the marsh her mother told her that she should begin to consider which of the boys in the settlement she might wish to marry by various signs potitias body had begun to manifest the advent of her womanhood to celebrate her maturity potitias father gave her a precious gift it was an amulet made of the yellow metal called gold for ten generations the lump of gold which tarketios had given to lara had been left in its natural state nothing had been fashioned from it for the metal seemed too soft to be properly worked it was a visiting phoenician who had shown potitias grandfather that gold could be alloyed with another precious metal called silver and for a great price the phoenician smith had crafted the resulting ingot into a shape specified by potitias grandfather by the highest phoenician standards the workmanship of the amulet was crude but to potitias eyes it was a thing of wonder made to be hung upon a leather necklace the little amulet was in the shape of a winged phallus her father called it fascinusbringer of fertility protector of women and infants in childbirth guardian against the evil eye although she had questioned her father on the subject and listened carefully to his answers potitia could not quite understand whether the amulet actually was fascinus or contained fascinus or only represented fascinus in the way that the idols of the phoenicians were said to represent their gods despite her lack of clear understanding potitia nonetheless felt very grownup when she wore the amulet she was no longer the girl with skinned knees and muddy feet the child who wandered carefree across the little world of the ruma even so she carried within her a childs sense of wonder and the sweet nostalgia of having grown up in a world where there was little to fear and much to discover until very recently that world had remained unchangeda place where strangers met in good company and where potitia might expect to raise her own children with little concern for their safety allowing them to wander at will as she had done but now all that had changed the world had become dark and dangerous families kept their children always in sight even grown men did not dare to wander alone across the ruma the coming of the monster cacus had changed everything it was potitia who had seen him first that day she headed down to the river to wash a basket of clothes at the sight of him she screamed dropped the basket and fled the creature ran after her making a hideous noise that made the hair rise on the back of potitias neck cacus cacus just when her energy flagged and he might have caught her the monster gave up the chase potitia reached the settlement unharmed she was convinced that fascinus and fascinus alone had saved her all the way back to the village she ran with one hand at her throat grasping the amulet tightly begging for fascinuss protection whispering aloud save me save me fascinus afterward trembling with relief she whispered again to the amulet giving it her thanks and pledging her devotion it was a prayer that potitia uttered in just such a manner as the phoenicians would have understood made not to a nameless numen that inhabited a thing or place but to a powerful superhuman entity that possessed the intelligence to understand her words she had not offered ritual propitiation to a numen but had prayed directly to a god in that moment although potitia acted with no idea of the significance of what she had done fascinus became the first native god to be worshiped in the land of the ruma for a long time no one but potitia had seen the monster and there were those in the settlement listening to her description of cacus who thought that she must have imagined the encounter on the path her family after all were known for their fanciful beliefs showing off the amulet they called fascinus and hinting that their line had sprung from the union of a numen and a womanas if such a thing were possible then little by little it became evident that some malicious creature was indeed among them bits of food went missing along with small objects that no one had cause to steal now and again objects of value were found brokena spinning wheel a clay pot a toy wagon made of woodas if some overgrown immensely strong child smashed them out of spite the troublemaker struck at night and left no trail cacus had grown skillful at covering his tracks the settlers were angry and frightened their fear of the monster was compounded by another that the traders who came to the market would learn about cacus and be frightened away if traders stopped coming the settlers would lose their livelihood and the settlement might vanish altogether one morning during the busiest cattle market of the year everyone in the settlement was awakened by a lowing among the cattle outside the pen a cow was found dead its body torn open and much of the flesh missing the cow could not have climbed over the fence and the gate remained shut what sort of man could possess the strength to lift a cow up and over the roughhewn fence and then to kill the beast and tear it open with his bare hands a thrill of panic ran through the settlement some of the cattletraders rounded up their herds and drove them homeward at once armed with knives and spears hunting in pairs the settlers combed the seven hills two of the hunters must have found the monster their bodies were eventually discovered on the hill of the osier trees broken and eviscerated much as the cows body had been it did not take long for word to spread up and down the trails that led to the ruma the monster that was stalking the trading post had an appetite for human flesh traders did not merely stop doing business at the settlement they made great detours to avoid passing anywhere near it with most of the traders gone and traffic so greatly reduced on the trails the monster grew even bolder an infant went missing her remains were found only a short distance from the settlement at the foot of the steep hill on the far side of the spinon one of the searchers looking up to avert his eyes from the horrible sight glimpsed a movement on the hillside above from behind a bramblecovered lip of stone a hideous face peered down for a moment then disappeared a moment later a shower of rocks rained down on the searchers who fled peering up at the hillside from a safe distance they discerned what appeared to be a cave its opening obscured by brambles none of them could see a way to scale the hillside even if it could be scaled none of them could imagine what would await them once they reached the mouth of the cave back at the settlement the searchers told what they had discovered to her horror potitia realized that the monster had taken up residence in her secret cave which was a secret no longer from his hole high up in the side of the hill cacus ventured out at night to terrorize the settlement during the day he stayed hidden in the cave more than once the settlers attempted to scale the hillside and attack him in his lair bellowing his name cacus dropped stones on them one settler fell and broke his neck another was struck in the eye and blinded another managed to draw closer to the mouth of the cave than anyone else but was killed instantly by a stone that struck his forehead instead of falling his limp body became caught on sharp rocks and brambles no one dared to climb up and retrieve it there it hung for several days and nights a horrifying rebuke to those who had sought to destroy the monster one morning the body was no longer there cacus had claimed it the mans bones picked clean appeared one by one at the foot of the hill as cacus tossed them out it was potitius who suggested that the hillside be set afire if the flames and smoke did not kill the monster outright they might at least drive him from his lair the brambles at the foot of the hill were set on fire the flames spread upward heading directly for the cave then a wind blew up from the tiber and drove the flame this way and that embers spiraled high in the air blew across the spinon and ignited the thatched roof of a hut the flames spread from hut to hut the settlers worked desperately to douse the flames with buckets of water from the river when the fire at last burned itself out the face of the hillside was scorched and black but the cave was untouched and the monster unharmed it was decided that a watch should be set upon the cave so that if the monster descended an alarm could be raised men and boys took turns throughout the day and night training their eyes upon what little could be seen of the mouth of the cave from below one of potitias cousins a burly hotheaded youth named pinarius boasted to her that he would put an end to cacus once and for all caught up in his enthusiasm potitia confessed to her cousin that she had climbed to the cave many times scarcely believing her pinarius nonetheless accepted her explanation of how it could be done on the afternoon that it was his turn to keep watch on the cave pinarius decided to act the day was hot and the air was heavy with sleep the rest of the settlers dozed except for potitia who knew of her cousins plan and gave him a kiss for luck before he began the climb from above there came a faint noise that they took to be the sound of the monster snoring perhaps it was the buzzing of flies drawn to the cave by blood and gore potitia remembered summer afternoons when she had dozed in the shadowy coolness of the cave she could picture the monster asleep in that familiar beloved place the image made her shiver yet it also pierced her with a sadness that she could not explain for the first time she wondered where the monster came from were there others of his kind surely a mother had given birth to him what fate had led him to the ruma to become the most wretched of all living things pinarius made the ascent quietly and quickly but as he drew close to the cave he reached for a handhold that would have taken him in the wrong direction watching from below potitia corrected his course with a loud whisper the sound that might have been the monsters snoring abruptly stopped potitia felt a shiver of dread pinarius reached the mouth of the cave he pulled himself onto the lip of stone gained his balance and grinned down at her he pulled out his knife and showed her the blade then disappeared into the cave the scream that followed was like nothing she had ever heard so loud that it woke every sleeper in the village a rending noise followed then silence a few moments later pinariuss head came flying from the hole in the hillside it landed with a thud in the grass just beyond potitia who fell to the ground in a faint dazed with the sun in her eyes and swooning from the heat she looked up and saw cacus standing on the lip of stone high above staring down at her his hulking misshapen body was covered with blood and gore the sound that came from his throatcacus cacushad a low urgent questioning quality as if he gazed at a thing which fascinated him from which he desired a reply cacus he uttered again cocking his head and staring down at her potitia scrambled to her feet running blindly she tripped over the head of pinarius she gave a shriek and staggered back to the settlement weeping the death of pinarius drove many of the settlers to the limit of their endurance his father also named pinarius argued that the time had come to abandon the settlement the monster had inflicted great suffering and against him they were powerless but more than this the arrival of the creature had unleashed a great evil in the land of the ruma the numina all around them had turned against the settlers the worst of the misfortunes had been the burning of the huts by treacherous winds and flames but there had been many other smaller misfortunes in recent days the settlers must move on argued the elder pinarius the only questions to be debated were when and to where and whether they should stay together or go their separate ways if we leave cousin what will keep the monster here asked potitius i think hell follow us hell stalk us on the trail our children will be his prey maybe acknowledged pinarius but in the open away from his cave we might at least have a chance to kill the thing potitius shook his head this creature is a far more skillful hunter than any of us wed have no chance against him in the wild one by one he would take us thats what hes doing now pinarius wept grieving for his son the argument was not settled but it seemed to potitia that it was only a matter of time until pinarius would prevail the ruma had become a place of sadness and despair still it broke her heart to think of leaving the hills of her childhood then the stranger arrived it was the lowing of oxen that woke potitia that morning there had been no oxen in the market for a long time at first she thought she must be dreaming of the old days before the coming of cacus but as she stirred and rose the sound of the oxen continued she hurried from the hut to see what was happening sure enough a small herd of oxen was standing in the slanting sunlight in the meadow on the far side of the spinon peacefully eating the grass that grew near the foot of the hill where cacus dwelled near the herd sitting on the ground and leaning against a tree trunk was the oxdriver his eyes were closed and his head was tilted to one side he appeared to be asleep even at a glance and at such a distance potitia was quite certain she had never seen him before for one thing he was much larger than any other man she had ever seen except cacus if cacus could be called a man unlike cacus he was not at all ugly or frightening to look at indeed he was quite the opposite she found herself crossing the steppingstones that traversed the spinon and walking toward him potitia what are you doing her father along with most of the other settlers had gathered near the empty cattle pen they were watching the stranger from a safe distance trying to decide whether he should be approached and who should do it potitia realized that they were afraid of the stranger but she did not share their fear as she stepped closer she saw that his mouth was slightly open and she heard him softly snoring his hair was long and black his beard was thick everything about him was oversized his strong rugged face was a match for his brawny shoulders and arms potitia decided that he was by far the most handsome man she had ever seen even though he looked slightly ridiculous sitting there snoring over his shoulders he wore a pelt of some sort tied across his chest by the animals forelegs the fur was a tawny gold and the paws were tipped with formidable claws potitia realized that it was the pelt of a lion and she regarded the stranger with even greater curiosity he must have sucked in a flying insect for suddenly he bolted forward instantly awake he made a face and spat convulsively the group gathered across the stream let out a collective gasp of alarm but potitia laughed to her the oxdriver looked more ridiculousand more appealingthan ever he picked a fly from his mouth gave a shrug then looked up at her and smiled potitia sighed you cant stay here he frowned your oxen arent safe here she explained his gaze was uncomprehending could it be that he had not heard of cacus he must have come from very far away she thought when he spoke her suspicion was confirmed she could not understand a word he said a dog that had been lying near the oxen rose to its feet and ambled toward them wagging its tail the oxdriver shook his head he wagged his finger at the dog and said something in a gently chiding tone clearly it was the dogs job to wake him if anyone approached the oxen while he was sleeping and the dog had not done its duty the oxdriver stood and stretched his massive arms above his head he was even taller than potitia had thought craning her neck to look up at him she felt very small like a child unconsciously she reached to her throat and touched the gold amulet the oxdriver gazed at fascinus for a moment then looked into her eyes his gaze stirred certain feelings in her and potitia knew that she was not a child any longer but a woman try as they might the settlers seemed unable to communicate to the stranger the peril he faced by staying in the meadow so near the cave of cacus they pointed they mimed they spoke in all the various dialects they had learned from traders the man did not understand im not sure he has all his wits said potitias father we shall wake tomorrow to find his dead body lying at the foot of the hill grumbled pinarius what terrible things to say i think youre both wrong said potitia she smiled at the oxdriver who smiled back pinarius exchanged a sidelong glance with his cousin and lowered his voice on many important things we disagree potitius but i think one thing is evident to us both your daughter is smitten by this stranger he is impressive said potitius looking the man up and down how do you think he came by that lions skin he wears if potitia finds him suitable pinarius shook his head and spat it shall come to grief mark my words the afternoon became sweltering as the midsummer sun beat down upon the ruma a warm breeze smelling of mud and decay rose from the marshes and followed the spinon down to the tiber the droning of cicadas filled the meadow where the oxen lay dozing in the shade as the settlers believed there were numina in places and objects so they also believed that numina informed certain phenomena such as sleep like other numina those of sleep could be friendly or unfriendly sleep could heal the weary and the sick and give comfort to the grieving sleep could also render even the strongest man utterly helpless that afternoon the numina of sleep descended upon the settlement like a hand upon the brow of an infant shutting the eyes of the settlers whether they wished to close them or not men fought to stay awake and lost the battle without even knowing it the oxen slept the dog slept the oxdriver also slept leaning back against the tree where potitia had first seen him potitia did not sleep she sat in the shade of an oak tree and studied the stranger wondering what the future might hold for her there was another who did not sleep with his long arms and immense strength cacus had found a way to climb down from the cave that even potitia did not know about brambles kept him hidden at almost every point as he descended if he exercised great stealth and did not cause a single leaf to tremble or a shard of stone to give way underfoot his movement down the face of the cliff was very nearly invisible even if the boy who had been set to watch the cave that day had not been dozing cacus probably would have descended unseen cacus was not aware of the coming of the stranger but he had heard the lowing of the oxen he had not eaten beastflesh in many days across the meadow he caught sight of the oxen he took no notice of the oxdriver or potitia both were nearby but both were very still and obscured by the dappled shade of the trees he chose the smallest of the oxen and made his way toward it not a single twig broke beneath his feet it was a remarkable thing that a creature so large and ungainly could move so quietly upon the earth nonetheless the ox sensed danger it swished its tail rose to its feet and uttered a low bleat the beast saw cacus took a step back then froze when he reached the ox cacus did not hesitate he clamped his fists together raised them in the air and landed a hammerlike blow upon the oxs forehead the ox snorted once shuddered and fell dead it struck the earth with a heavy thud the other oxen stirred and began to mill about the dogs ears twitched but he remained asleep potitia who had just nodded off gave a start she opened her eyes and saw that the monster was no more than ten paces away she sucked in a breath and would have screamed but her throat was suddenly so tight that no sound would come out she jumped to her feet her first thought was to wake to the oxdriver but to do that she would have to run past the monster she turned and ran in the other direction away from the settlement toward the cave cacuss eye was drawn by the movement he caught a glimpse of her amid the high grass and recognized her at once he ran after her his legs were mismatched but very long and powerful when it suited him he could run with incredible speed the flies that had been buzzing about the oxen followed after him in a swarm drawn by the odors of blood and rotting flesh that clung to him potitias foot struck an exposed root and she went flying perhaps it was as the elder pinarius said all the numina of the ruma had turned against them and even the roots of the trees were conspiring with the monster what a fool she had been to think that the arrival of the oxdriver was a sign of a better times to come as she tumbled against the hard sunbaked earth she reached up to touch fascinus at her neck and whispered a prayer that the monster might kill her swiftly but cacus had no intention of killing her the oxdriver slept dreaming of the faraway land of his childhood it was a dream of sunshine and warm meadows lowing oxen and singing cicadas then in an instant he was awake one of the oxen stood over him urgently pressing its cold wet snout against his cheek the stranger grunted with disgust wiped his face with the back of his hand and looked about at once he saw the cause of the oxs distress one of its companions was lying in the grass nearby utterly still and in a most unnatural position where was the dog he saw it curled up on the grass not far away the dog yawned briefly opened its eyes then shut them again and resettled itself more comfortably the oxdriver cursed and jumped to his feet he heard a muffled sound that might have been a womans scream and ran toward it what he saw first was a swarm of flies above a depression in the high grass then he caught a glimpse of bare hairy fleshthe hunched back of cacus moving up and down and this way and that the oxdriver moved forward more cautiously not sure what sort of man or beast he was approaching punctuating the gasps and groans and slavering noises was a curious guttural sound cacuscacuscacus then he heard a sound that chilled his bloodthe scream he had heard before from a woman in great distress the oxdriver gave a shout the hunched back suddenly ceased moving a face shockingly hideous rose above the high grass and peered at him the creature snarled gave a cry of indignationcacusthen rose to its full height that the creature was male became evident by the virile member displayed between its legs beneath the creature still hidden by the grass the woman let out a plaintive sob the oxdriver was not used to encountering anything that walked on two legs that was as big as himself this creature was bigger nor had he ever encountered a creature as loathsome to look at as cacus revulsion rose in his throat and an unaccustomed emotion washed over himthe cold prickle of fear the lion whose skin he wore he had killed with his bare hands but a lion seemed a minor menace compared to cacus the oxdriver braced himself and gave another shout challenging the creature to fight a moment later with a deafening roar cacus hurtled toward him the sheer mass of the creature struck the oxdriver with bruising force knocking him to the ground the stench of the creatures breath filled his nostrils the taste of the creatures foul sweat mingled on his tongue with the bitter flavor of dirt as they tumbled on the ground the flies that swarmed around the creature buzzed in the oxdrivers ears and flew into his nostrils and eyes tormenting and distracting him with the creature atop him crushing him the oxdriver frantically reached for anything that might serve as a weapon his hand closed on a fallen branch he swung it with all his might a shuddering impact ran through his arm as the branch broke against the creatures skull the piece that remained in his fist was jagged and sharp he stabbed it against the creatures flank a scream pierced his ears hot blood ran over his hand causing him to lose his grip on the weapon the creature bolted up and away from him the oxdriver staggered to his feet he watched the creature pull the shard of wood from his bleeding flesh and cast it aside for a moment he thought the creature might flee instead cacus hurtled toward him and knocked him to the ground the oxdriver managed to wriggle free and scamper back to his feet a short distance away amid the high grass he saw a stone the size of newborn ox and ran toward it he surprised even himself when he lifted the stone over his head he hurled it toward the pursuing cacus cacus managed to dodge the stone but only barely it grazed his shoulder and sent him reeling enraged he picked up an even larger stone and hurled it the oxdriver dove to one side the stone struck a towering oak tree and shattered the trunk the whole tree came crashing to the ground amid a din of creaking and cracking a host of shrieking birds took flight and then all was still the oxdriver struggled to catch his breath the creature was nowhere to be seen had he fled was he pinned beneath the branches of the tree for an instant the oxdriver let down his guardthen he caught a whiff of the creatures stench and heard the buzzing of flies he whirled about and in the next instant felt two hands grip his throat spots swam before his eyes the meadow grew dim as if night had suddenly fallen his head seemed to swell like a bloated wineskin until he felt sure it would burst his struggled to pry cacuss hands from his throat the creatures grip was unshakable the oxdriver sought desperately to gain a purchase with his fingertips and at last managed to grasp one of cacuss fingers and slowly bend it backward he heard the finger snap and was sickened by the noise but cacus held fast he broke another finger on the creatures other hand and another as a fourth finger snapped cacus gave an unearthly scream and relented his grip was broken before cacus could escape the oxdriver deftly slipped behind him and caught the creatures neck in the vise of his elbow with his other hand he gripped his wrist tightening the vise cacus struggled to draw a breath but could not nor could he wrench the arm away from his throat for his fingers were broken his hands useless mustering all his remaining strength the oxdriver wrenched the creatures head to one side and gave it a hard twist cacuss neck was broken he thrashed and convulsed the huge weight of his body slipped from the oxdrivers grasp he tumbled to the ground with his head cocked at an impossible angle and his limbs akimbo utterly exhausted the oxdriver dropped to his knees fighting back nausea and gasping for breath his vision was blurred flies buzzed in his ears the dog wide awake now suddenly arrived at a gallop barking ferociously and baring his fangs at the sight of the corpse he pounced atop the limp body of cacus stood stiffly upright perked his ears and alerted the people of the ruma with a long howl of triumph in feverish glimpses potitia had witnessed the entire struggle when the strangers challenge drew cacuss attention she had managed to scramble to her feet and to flee stumbling and staggering she repeatedly looked back it seemed to her that she saw not two men but two entities greater than human engaged in a fight to the death she felt the earth shake beneath their stamping feet she saw them lift stones that no mortal could lift she saw a great tree fall to the ground destroyed by their combat she saw cacus fall dead and the oxdriver drop to his knees in a daze she made her way to river no matter how vigorously she scrubbed her flesh rubbing until it was red and raw the stench of the monster clung to her when she staggered back to the settlement no one remarked on the smell indeed they took no notice of her learning of the monsters demise the ecstatic settlers had circled the oxdriver and were loudly praising him shyly touching him trying to lift him onto their shoulders and laughing when he proved to be too big and heavy no one realized what had happened to potitia except the oxdriver who shot her a look of mingled relief and remorse she herself said nothing about it not even to her father the body of cacus was dragged a great distance from the settlement repeatedly vultures tried to land upon it the people drove them off until the oxdriver made it clear that they should desist and allow the vultures to snatch whatever delicacies they could when the vultures flew off with cacuss eyes and tongue the oxdriver applauded them it seems the fellow has a high regard for vultures noted potitius and why not whenever he sees a vulture its probably because another of his enemies is dead satisfied that the vultures had been propitiated the people pelted the corpse of cacus with stones then set it aflame a wind from the southwest carried the foul smoke high into the air and away from the ruma the numina of fire and air were seen to be in accord with the people who could only hope with the monsters baleful influence removed that the other numina of the region would again show kindness and favor to them that night there was rejoicing in the settlement the ox that had been killed by cacus was butchered the flesh was roasted for a great feast in honor of the stranger who had delivered them his hunger was voracious he ate everything they set before him potitius felt moved to make a speech nothing so terrible as the coming of the monster has ever occurred in living memory nothing so wonderful has ever occurred as the monsters destruction we were on the verge of abandoning this place in despair here he looked sidelong at his cousin pinarius then we were saved by an occurrence which none of us possibly could have foreseenthe arrival of a stranger who was every bit a match for the monster this is a sign that we were meant to reside always in the land of the ruma whatever happens we must have faith that ours is a special destiny even in our darkest moments we must remember that we are guarded by friendly numina of great power wine had always been a rare and precious commodity in the settlement it had become even more so after the traders stopped coming still the store that remained mixed with water was enough to provide a serving to everyone at the feast with extra portionsunwatered and as much as he could drink which proved to be a great quantityfor the oxdriver encouraged by raucous laughter and shouting he repeatedly mimed his battle with cacus laughing and stumbling around the roasting pit until at last he lay down exhausted and fell into a deep sleep the settlers were drunk and stuffed with food many had not enjoyed a proper sleep since the coming of cacus and they happily followed the stranger into the land of dreams all sleptexcept potitia who feared that sleep would bring only nightmares she found a spot to herself away from the others and lay on a woolen mat beneath the stars the night was warm and lit by a bright moon on such a night when she was girl she might have climbed up to her cave and slept there safe and secluded that could never happen again the monster had ruined the cave and her memories of it forever potitia hugged herself and weptthen gave a start when she sensed the presence of another she smelled his breath heavy with wine his massive silhouette blocked the moon she shuddered but when he knelt and touched her gently she stopped sobbing he stroked her brow he kissed the tears that ran down her cheeks he loomed over her as cacus had loomed yet was different in every way the smell of his body was strong but pleasing to her cacus had been brutal and demanding but the oxdrivers touch was gentle and soothing cacus had caused her pain but the strangers touch brought only pleasure when he drew back fearful that his sheer bulk might overwhelm her she gripped him like a child might grip a parent and pulled him closer to her when the paroxysm of their first coupling passed for a time she lay quiet and felt utterly relaxed as if she floated on air then she suddenly began to tremble she shuddered and began to weep again he held her tightly he knew she had suffered an ordeal beyond his understanding and he strove awkwardly but with exquisite gentleness to comfort her but the cause of her weeping was beyond even potitias understanding she was remembering something she had been trying to forget at the moment of her utmost loathing and despairwhile cacus was inside her squeezing and crushing her from all sidesshe had looked into his eyes they were not the eyes of a beast but of a human like herself in that instant she had seen that cacus was full of more suffering and fear than she could imagine amid her loathing and disgust she felt something else pity it stabbed her like a knife now with all her defenses down she found herself weeping not because of what cacus had done to her but for cacus himself and the awfulness of his existence the next day when the hungover settlers awoke the stranger was gone so were his oxen and his dog pinarius said that someone should be sent after him to ask him to return potitius argued against this as the coming of the stranger had been unforeseen so it had been with his leaving and the people of the settlement should do nothing to interfere with the comings or goings of their deliverer word of cacuss demise spread one by one the traders began to come back to the settlement when they heard the tale of the oxdriver they put forward many notions about who he might have been and where he might have come from it was the phoenician seafarers the most widely traveled of all the traders who made the most compelling case they declared that the oxdriver was the strongman of their own legends the demigod named melkart a demigod they explained was the offspring of a god and a human the settlers were inclined to agree that the stranger had exhibited a strength beyond the merely mortal oh yes the hero who saved you was most certainly melkart the phoenician captain declared every phoenician knows of him a few have met him the fact that he wore a lions skin proves his identity the killing of a lion was one of melkarts most famous exploits he wears the skin as a trophy yes it was melkart who killed this monster of yours most assuredly you should set up an altar to him as you set up an altar to the numina who inhabit the hot springs surely melkart did more for you than ever those hot springs did you should make sacrifices to him you should pray for his continued protection but how did thisdemigodcome to be here so far from the lands where hes known asked potitius melkart is a great traveler hes known in many lands by many names the greeks call him heracles they say his father was the sky god they call zeus the settlers had only a vague notion of who the greeks might be but the name heracles was more pleasing to their ears than melkart though the captains pronunciation of the greek was a bit garbled they decided to call the oxdriver hercules as the phoenician captain had suggested an altar was erected to hercules very near the spot where potitia had first seen him sleeping since the phoenicians knew more about godworship than the settlers they were consulted about the best ways to show honor to hercules it was decided that dogs and flies must be kept away from his altar since during the battle his ally the dog had failed him and the flies had fought against him vultures he had favored so it was decided that the vulture would be sacred to his memory it was also decided that when an offering was made every part of the sacrificed animal should be eaten in the way that hercules himself had exhibited such a hearty and unbridled appetite thus although fascinus was the first native god and the first god to receive the prayers of a settler it was a deity already worshiped in other lands who received the first altar dedicated to a divinity in the land of the ruma potitia grew big with child her father had suspected that something beyond flirtation might have transpired between his daughter and the stranger and her pregnancy seemed to confirm his suspicion potitius was pleased according to family legend long ago an ancestress had experienced intercourse with a numen potitia was partly descended from fascinus whose amulet she wore had the demigod hercules seen this spark of the otherworldly in potitia was that why he had found her worthy to bear his child and would that child not be something new and special upon the earth containing the mingled essence of numen demigod and human in his veins potitius mused on such ideas and was pleased potitia fell prey to darker thoughts for she knew there was an equal chance that the child might have a different father cacus if the thing that came from her womb was a hideous monster everyone would know her shame would they kill the child at once and her as well was the thing stirring inside her a god or a monster she was torn by many emotions her father was puzzled and dismayed by her misery it was decided to celebrate the very first sacrifice to hercules not on the anniversary of his arrival as would later become the custom but on the day that cacus had first been seen in the springtime thus the first feast of hercules could expunge the bitter memory of cacuss arrival potitius and pinarius squabbled over who should assume the duty of slaying an ox roasting the meat and placing the offerings upon the stone altar before consuming them finally they decided to share the duty and perform the rites together the feast would be shared equally by their families but on the day chosen for the sacrifice pinarius was absent he had gone to visit relatives at a farm upriver and had not yet returned potitius decided to begin the ritual without him dogs were driven off and an oxtail whisk was used to banish flies the ox was sacrificed butchered and roasted and the offering placed upon the altar a prayer of supplication was chanted using phrases suggested by the phoenician captain potitius summoned the members of his extended family to share in the feast we must eat it all he told them not just the meat but also the organs and the entrailsthe heart kidneys liver lungs and spleenfor that was the example hercules set for us with his voracious appetite to eat these parts of the sacrificed beast is our privilege and we should begin with them here daughterto you i give a portion of the liver as potitia ate she remembered the first time she had seen cacus and the prayer she had uttered to fascinus she also remembered the terror she had felt when cacus attacked her and the gentleness of the man they now called hercules she was very near to giving birth and subject to powerful extremes of elation and despair she often laughed and wept at the same time potitius watching her seeing how pale and drawn she was wondered if his daughter had been too delicate a vessel to receive the seed of a demigod the feast was very nearly finished when pinarius arrived bringing his family with him youre late cousinvery late im afraid we proceeded without you said potitius a full belly and a portion of wine only slightly mixed with water had put him in good spirits im afraid weve already finished the entrails but there are some choice cuts of meat remaining for you pinarius angry at himself for missing the ceremony grew furious at this further indignity this is an outrage we agreed that i was to serve equally as a priest of the altar of hercules and that the eating of the entrails was a sacred dutyyet youve left none for me and my family you were late said potitius his good mood spoiled youll eat what the god left for you their squabbling grew louder and their words more belligerent relatives began to gather behind each man it seemed that the first sacrifice to hercules might turn into a brawl the argument was suddenly interrupted by a loud cry it came from potitia her labor had begun the delivery took place before the altar of hercules for potitia was in too much distress to be moved the labor was short but intense and there was something not right about it the baby was too big to come out the midwives were thrown into a panic along with her physical pain potitia was in an agony of suspense at last the baby emerged from her womb it was a manchild potitia reached for him the midwives placed him in her arms he was big very big yesbut not a monster all his limbs were intact and his proportions were no different from any other babys still potitia was uncertain she gazed into the babys eyes as she had gazed into the eyes of cacus and also into the eyes of the oxdriver she could not be sure the eyes that now gazed back at her might be the eyes of either man potitia did not care whoever his father might be the child was precious to her and precious to fascinus weak and exhausted but filled with joy potitia lifted the necklace bearing fascinus over her neck and placed it around the neck of her newborn baby the twins bc the day was an important one for potitiusthe most important day so far in his young life from infancy he had been a witness to the ritual later he became a participant in the feast now for the first time at the age of fourteen he was assisting his father in performing the annual rites of sacrifice at the altar of hercules while the assembled family members of the potitii and the pinarii watched potitiuss father stood before the altar and recited the tale of the gods visit telling how hercules appeared in the peoples time of greatest need and killed the monster cacus then just as suddenly disappeared meanwhile young potitius slowly circled the altar and waved the sacred whisk fashioned of an oxtail with a wooden handle to drive away any flies that might come near his distant cousin pinarius who was the same age and was also performing for the first time in the ritual circled the altar in a wider orbit walking in the opposite direction his job was to drive away any dog that might come near potitiuss father finished the story he turned to the father of pinarius who stood beside him for generations the two families had jointly tended to the altar and performed the ceremony trading duties from year to year this year it fell to the elder pinarius to recite the prayer for herculess protection an ox was slain and butchered while it was being roasted a portion of raw flesh was placed on the altar the priests and their sons searched the sky it was young potitius with a cry of excitement who first saw the vulture fly overhead and begin to circle above them the vulture was favored by hercules its appearance was a sign that the god was pleased by the offering and accepted it the priests and their families gathered to feast on the ox in every other matter relating to the ceremony the families shared precisely equal duties but following tradition the eating of the entrails remained a privilege accorded solely to the potitii it had become a tradition as well for the various pinarii to grumble goodnaturedly about thiswhere is our portion why are we given no entrailsto which their cousins would give the traditional reply no entrails for you you arrived late for the feast young potitius took all his duties very seriously he even attempted to banter with young pinarius about the entrails but received only a sullen look and a grunt in reply the two boys had never been friends after the feast his father took potitius aside im proud of you son you did well thank you father only one more ritual remains to complete the day potitius frowned i thought we were done father not quite i think you know son although we seldom talk about itno need to make the pinarii more jealous of us than they are alreadythat our ancestry can be traced back directly to hercules himself yes father you also know that the ancestors of the potitii include a god even more ancient than hercules he reached up to touch the amulet of fascinus which hung from a leather strap around his neck potitius could count on his fingers the times he had seen the amulet his father wore it only on very important occasions he gazed at it fascinated by the luster of the gold his father smiled when i was your age i took part for the first time in the rites of the altar of hercules doing just as you did today whisking the flies away when the feast was done my father took me aside he told me that i had done well on that day he said i was no longer a boy but had become a man do you know what he did then son potitius gravely shook his head no father what did he do in answer his father raised the leather strap over his head then solemnly placed it around potitiuss neck he smiled and ran his hand over his sons silky blond hair a gesture of affection to seal the last moment of his boyhood you are a man now my son i pass the amulet of fascinus to you potitius might now be a man but after the feast when the days duties were done and he was at last free to do whatever he pleased he reverted to behaving like a boy there were many hours of midsummer sunlight remaining he had promised to visit his two best friends after the feast and he was eager to join them since the days of cacus the little settlement by the tiber had continued to prosper and grow the market by the river saw a thriving traffic in salt fish and livestock these three commodities arrived separately but after being treated with salt the preserved fish and meat could be transported great distances or traded for other goods that flowed into the busy market the oldest and most prosperous families like the potitii and the pinarii continued to live in the original settlement near the spinon and the market grounds in huts not very different from those of preceding generations though the number of huts had increased greatly and they were now built much closer together numerous other smaller settlements some consisting of hardly more than a single family had sprung up across the ruma some in the valleys and some on the hilltops wellworn footpaths linked all the settlements together the word ruma itself as a reference to the region of the seven hills had changed subtly in pronunciation over the years and by repeated usage had acquired the status of a proper name so that people now called the area roma the name had a quaintness and a coziness about it conveying the sense of a hilly place that lovingly nurtured its inhabitants with more settlements and more people had come the tendency to formalize the names of various locales amid the seven hills often naming places for the trees which lived there thus the hill of oak trees came to be called querquetulanusoak hillwhile the hill of osiers was the viminal and the hill of beeches was the fagutal shepherds and swineherds now lived and tended their livestock atop the hill above the old cave of cacus that hill was called the palatine after the goddess whom the shepherds worshiped pales of gods once unknown in roma there now were many as the population of mortals had grown so had the number of deities and each of the little communities scattered across the seven hills acknowledged a local divinity to whom they paid homage some of these divinities retained the nameless nebulous character of the ancient numina but others had acquired names and welldefined attributes after the fashion of gods and goddesses among these deities the primacy of hercules was recognized by everyone in roma and thus his altar had come to be called the ara maxima or greatest of altars it was agreed that his father was the skygod known locally by the name jupiter the role of the potitii and the pinarii in tending to the ara maxima gave them great status among the people of roma potitius took pride in carrying on his familys traditions but now his duties done he was eager to join his two friends who lived on the palatine he quickly returned to his familys home a compound of interconnected huts where he threw off the finely woven woolen robe he had worn for the ceremony and put on an old tunic more suitable for rough play he kept the amulet of fascinus around his neck for he wanted to show it off to his friends potitius strode through the busy marketplace and crossed a wooden footbridge that spanned the muddy spinon he walked past the ara maxima where a few of his winebefuddled relatives still loitered at the scene of the feast he continued on to the foot of the palatine where he scaled a steep stairway hewn from the rocky hillside the stairway had been made long ago after the demise of the monster cacus to remove the threat of what had been an inaccessible cave the hillside was no longer unscalable thanks to the stairway and the cave itself an accursed place had been filled in with stones and dirt brambles and clinging bushes had grown over the spot so that little trace of the cave remainednothing more than a bare outline that could be discerned only by someone looking for it potitius knew the history of the stairs of cacus as people called the steep trail and his father had shown him exactly where the cave had been located whenever he passed it potitius uttered a prayer of thanksgiving to hercules but the stairs of cacus also served a purely practical function it was the shortest route to the top of the palatine at the top of the stairs grew a fig tree it was older than potitius and for a fig tree very large with branches that formed a wide canopy after scaling the steps potitius welcomed the cool shade offered by its dense foliage he paused to catch his breath then gave a cry when something struck his head the projectile was soft enough to cause no damage to his scalp but hard enough to sting potitius was struck again and then again from above potitius heard laughter rubbing his smarting head he looked up and saw his two friends sitting on a high branch grinning down at him remus began to laugh so hard that it appeared he might fall from his perch romulus hefted a green unripe fig in his hand stop it you two cried potitius he saw romulus cock his arm to hurl the fig potitius dodged but too late he yelped as the fig struck his forehead romulus was known for a sure aim and a strong arm stop it i said potitius jumped up and grabbed the end of the branch upon with the brothers were sitting using the full weight of his body he swung back and forth the soft wood yielded without breaking and the motion was violent enough to upset the twins from their perches with shrieks of laughter they both came tumbling down the two of them recovered at once tackled potitius and used their combined weight to pin him down all three were gasping barely able to breathe for laughing whats this said romulus he reached for the amulet of fascinus and held it up so that the leather necklace was pulled taut a shaft of sunlight piercing the fig leaves glinted off the gold his brother joined him in gazing at it potitius smiled its the image of the god we call fascinus my father gave it to me after the feast hes says that and where did your father acquire such a thing asked remus stole it from a phoenician trader dont be ridiculous fascinus is our family god my father received this amulet from his father who received it from his father and so on back to the beginning of time father says must be nice said romulus curtly no longer laughing but still holding the amulet and gazing at it potitius suddenly felt selfconscious as he sometimes did with his two friends potitius came from one of the oldest and most respected families in roma romulus and remus had been foundlings the swineherd who had raised them was a man of little account and the swineherds wife had a bad reputation potitiuss father disapproved of the twins and it was only behind his fathers back that potitius was able to associate with them potitius dearly loved them both but sometimes as now he acutely felt the difference between their status and his own and what does this fascinus do said romulus remus laughed i know what id do if my manhood had wings he flapped his arms then made a lewd gesture potitius was beginning to regret having worn the amulet it had been a mistake to think that the twins could understand what it meant to him fascinus protects us he said not from flying figs said remus or from boys who are stronger than you added romulus regaining his high spirits he released the amulet reached for potitiuss arm and twisted it behind his back you are not stronger than me protested potitius i can take either one of you as long as you come at me one at a time but why should we do that when there are two of us remus seized potitiuss other arm and gave it a twist potitius yowled in pain it was always thus with the twins they acted in concert as if they shared a single mind their harmony was one of the things that potitius who had no brothers admired most about them what did it matter if no one knew their lineage the infant twins had been discovered by the swineherd faustulus in the aftermath of a great flood the tiber often flooded but that flood had been by far the worst than anyone could remember the river had risen so high that it submerged the marketplace the marshly lake that fed the spinon became a little sea and the seven hills became seven islands after the water receded the swineherd faustulus had found among the flotsam two infants in a wooden cradle on the slope of the palatine many people who lived upriver had died in the flood since no one ever claimed the twins it was assumed that their parents must be dead faustulus who lived only a stones throw away from the fig tree in a squalid little hut surrounded by pigsties raised them as his sons faustuluss wife was named acca larentia an unkind joke told behind the twins backs claimed that they had been suckled by a shewolf as a small boy when potitius first heard this joketold with a leer and a wink by his cousin pinariushe thought it was literally true only later did he realize that shewolf was another term for a whore and thus an insult to acca larentia pinarius had also told him that the names given to the twins by faustulus were a rude play on wordsromulus and remus referring to the two ruma of acca larentia whom faustulus delighted in watching when she suckled both infants at once because her favorite place to suckle them was beneath the shade of the fig tree faustulus had named it the ruminalis or sucklingtree a vulgar dirty man hardly better than the pigs he raises that had been the pronouncement of potitiuss father about faustulus as for acca larentia the less said the better theyre hardly fit to be called parents the way they let those boys run wild romulus and remus are none the better for ita pair of wolves raised in a pigsty but even those who most disapproved of the twins could not deny that they were uncommonly handsome only romulus is better looking than remus went the local saying in which the names could as easily be reversed and only remus can compete with romulus went the response for the twins were by far the fastest and strongest of all the local boys and delighted in any opportunity to prove it to potitius it seemed that the twins were everything a boy could wish to begoodlooking athletic and unfettered by a fathers control even when they ganged up to inflict a bit of misery on him potitius found it exciting to be in their company in unison the twins released him potitius groaned and rubbed his shoulders to relieve the ache so said romulus looking at his brother should we tell him or not you said we should but im having second thoughts hes all high and mighty with his fancy amulet from his father he looks down on nobodies like us i do not protested potitius tell me what remus looked at him slyly were hatching a plot my brother and i were going to have some fun people will talk about nothing else for days afterward days years said romulus and you can join usif you dare said remus of course i dare to said potitius his shoulders ached so badly he could barely lift his arms but he was determined to show no pain what is this scheme youre hatching you know what people say about uswhat they call us behind our backs said romulus not sure how to respond potitius shrugged and tried not to wince at the pain they call us wolves romulus and remus are a pair of wolves they say suckled by a shewolf people are stupid said potitius people are frightened by wolves thats what they are said remus especially girls added his brother here look at this he reached for something at the base of the fig tree and drew it over his head it was a wolfs pelt fashioned so that the head of the wolf fit over his face and formed a mask leaving his mouth uncovered what do you think with his hands on his hips and the face of the wolf taking the place of his own romulus presented a fearsome image potitius gazed up at him speechless remus produced another pelt fitted it over his head and stood beside his brother romulus smirked pleased by the look of amazement on potitiuss face of course if its just remus and me everyone will know its us thats why there has to be a third wolf in the packto throw people off the scent a third wolf said potitius remus tossed something to him potitius gave a start but managed to catch it put it on remus said it was another wolfskin with trembling hands potitius fitted the head over his face a rank odor filled his nostrils looking through the eyeholes he felt strangely concealed from the world and curiously transformed romulus smiled you look very fierce potitius do i remus laughed but you sound like a little boy you must learn to growllike this he demonstrated romulus joined him after a moments hesitation potitius did his best to emulate them and you must learn to howl remus threw back his head the sound that came from his throat sent a shiver up potitiuss spine romulus joined him and the harmony produced by their baying was so uncanny that potitius was covered with gooseflesh but when he himself let out a howl the other two broke into laughter obviously this will take some practice said romulus youre not ready yet you must learn to howl like a wolf potitius you must learn to move like a wolf and to think like a wolf you must become a wolf and when that day arrives you must be sure to remove that amulet added his brother otherwise someone is bound to recognize it and report us to your father potitius shrugged the pain in his shoulders was gone i could always wear fascinus inside my tunic where no one would see your tunic romulus laughed wolves dont wear tunics butwhat will we be wearing romulus and remus looked at each other and laughed then threw back their heads and howled winter came before the twins felt that potitius had sufficiently mastered the ways of a wolf it would not do to carry out their scheme when the weather was cold and wet they waited until the weather turned warm again at last the perfect day arriveda clear mild day when everyone across the seven hills would be out and about very early that morning they went hunting the twins had been tracking a wolf for several days watching its movements to discover its lair shortly after sunrise they flushed it out and hunted it down it was romulus who killed the beast with his spear on a makeshift altara simple slab of rockthey skinned the wolf and bathed their hands in its blood they cut the skin into strips and tied these around their wrists ankles thighs and arms other strips they carried in their hands it seemed to potitius that he could feel the life force of the beast still emanating from the warm supple hide it no longer felt strange to potitius to run naked across the hills he had done it many times with romulus and remus though usually at night and away from the settlements what still felt strange was the mask of wolf hide that covered his face peering out the eyeholes knowing he was hidden imagining his ferocious appearanceall this gave him a feeling of power and a sense that his relationship to everything around him was changed as if the mask truly bestowed on him faculties that were other than human they ran over the hills and across the valleys from settlement to settlement howling and yelping and brandishing their straps whenever they encountered a young female they ran straight toward her competing to see who could reach her first and give her a smack with his strap they were the wolves and the girls might have been sheep like sheep most of them were out in groups going about their morning chores fetching water or carrying burdens some cried out in alarm at the sight of them others shrieked with laughter potitius had never done anything so exhilarating in all his life he became physically aroused many of the girls seemed more alarmed by the sight of his swaying sex than by the threat of his wolfhide strap although some of them seemed amused tittering behind their hands and averting their eyes romulus and remus seeing his excitation converged on him laughing and yelping they took aim at his sex with their wolfhide straps too bad you left that amulet at home today whispered romulus youve no phallus at your neck to protect the one between your legs stop trying to cover yourself said remus shaking with laughter a good strapping with one of these will make you more potent than ever youll have the power of the wolf between your legs at last the twins relented and the three of them returned to their pursuit of screaming girls as the twins had predicted the incident became the talk of all roma that evening potitiuss father gathered the immediate familypotitius his mother and sistersto discuss it three youths naked except for wolfskins concealing their cowardly faces running all over the seven hills terrifying everyone they metsuch behavior is an outrage did no one try to stop them said potitiuss mother a few elders dared to berate them for their behavior the scoundrels ran circles around the poor fellows howling like animals scaring them half to death a few of the younger men gave chase but the troublemakers outran them but what did they look like husband was there nothing to distinguish them i didnt see them myself did any of you potitius averted his eyes and said nothing he nervously bit his lip when one of his sisters who was a little younger than himself meekly spoke up i saw them father i was visiting a friend over on the viminal when they came tearing through the village howling and growling her fathers face stiffened did they molest you in any way she blushed no father except speak daughter each of them carried a thing in his hand i think it must have been a long narrow strip of wolf hide they snapped them in the air like little whips and they go on whenever they came to a girl or a young woman they struck her with it struck her yes father she blushed more furiously than ever on her bottom and did they strike you daughteron your bottom ii dont really remember father it was all so frightening i cant recall liar potitius wanted to say he remembered the moment quite clearly so he was sure did his sister it was remus who had slapped her bottom and far from being frightened she had run after them giggling and trying to give remuss naked bottom a slap in return despite his nervousness potitius had to force the grin from his face potitiuss father shook his head as i said an outrage whats even more outrageous is the fact that not everyone thinks as we do about this matter what do you mean father asked potitius i was just talking to the elder pinarius he seems to be amused by the incident he says its only the older people who find such behavior scandalous he says that all the young men envy these savage wolflings and all the young women admire them you dont envy them do you potitius me of course not father nervously potitius touched the amulet at his neck he had put on the necklace as soon as he returned home that evening wanting fascinus to be near him to be sure he was not exactly lying to his father a man could not envy himself and you daughteryou dont admire these troublemakers do you of course i dont father i despise them good others may praise these savages but in this family there are standards to be upheld the potitii set an example for all of roma so should the pinarii but i fear that our cousins may have forgotten their special standing among the people he shook his head the identities of two of these wolflings is only too obviousthose scoundrels romulus and remus but who was the third wolfling what innocent youth did the swineherds boys lure into playing this disgusting game with them he stared directly at potitius who turned pale do you think my sondo you think it might have been your cousin young pinarius potitius swallowed a lump in his throat no father im quite sure that it wasnt pinarius his father grunted and gave him a shrewd look very well enough of this matter i have something much more important to discuss it involves you my son yes father said potitius relieved at the change of subject the elder potitius cleared his throat as priests of hercules we play a very important role among the people our judgment in matters of the divine is greatly respected but there is much that we could still learn when it comes to reading the will of gods and numina tell me my son when a farmers well runs dry whom does he call upon to pacify the spiteful numen that blocked the spring when a fisherman wants to find a new fishing spot whom does he call to mark boundaries in the river and say a prayer to placate the water numina when a bolt of lightning kills an ox whom does the oxherd consult to determine whether the blasted flesh is cursed and should be consumed by fire upon an altar or blessed and should be eaten with rejoicing if they can afford it people call for an etruscan divinerwhat the etruscans call a haruspex exactly our good neighbors to the north the etruscans are very wise in the ways of divinationand etruscan haruspices make a very good living at it but divination is simply a skill like any other it can be taught and it can be learned there is a school of divination in the etruscan town of tarquinia i am assured that it is the finest of all such schools i have arranged for you to study there my son potitius was silent for a long moment but father i dont speak etruscan of course you do only enough to barter with etruscan traders in the market then you shall learn to speak etruscan fluently and then you shall learn all the etruscans can teach you about divination when your studies are done you will return to roma as a haruspex and you will become an important man among the people potitius felt torn between excitement and a fear of leaving family and friends how long will i be gone im told that your studies will take three years such a long time when do i leave father tomorrow so soon the sooner the better as todays incident of the wolflings demonstrated all too clearly there are bad influences among us i have every faith in your character my son nonetheless i think it would be best to remove you from those influences and the sooner the better but father you dont think i think that romulus and remus must be very persuasive young men i think their harmful influence might draw even the most upstanding youth into serious trouble it is my duty as your father to see that such a thing does not happen to you my son you will go to tarquinia you will obey your instructors in all matters you will master the etruscan arts of divination i suspect you have an aptitude for such things and the learning will come easily to you and you will think no more about romulus and remus the swineherds brats are good for only one thingmaking trouble they came from nothing and they shall amount to nothing bc about his love of learning and his natural aptitude for divination potitiuss father proved correct about the fate of twins he could not have been more mistaken potitius had been the first youth to fall under the spell of the twins but he was not the last the incident of the wolflings greatly elevated their standing among the restless young men of roma many of whom were eager to become their companions romulus and remus soon attracted a considerable following especially among those whom potitiuss father would have labeled disreputableyoung men of obscure family and little means who were not above stealing the occasional cow or shearing a sheep and bartering the wool without its owners knowledge they shall come to a bad end declared potitiuss father glad that his son was away in tarquinia pursuing his studies romulus and remus and their little gang think their activities are harmless that the men they rob are either too wealthy to care or too timid to strike back but sooner or later they will cross the wrong man and that will be the last we see of romulus and remus his prediction very nearly came true on the day that remus and a few companions venturing farther afield than usual fell into a skirmish with some shepherds in the vicinity of alba a town in a hilly region to the southeast of roma unlike the romans the albans had long ago been subjugated to the strongest man among them who called himself their king and wore an iron crown the current king of alba amulius had accumulated a great store of wealthprecious metals finely wrought jewelry exotic clay vessels and woven goods of the highest qualitywhich he kept inside a gated compound surrounded by high wooden pickets and guarded by mercenary warriors he lived not in a hut but in a great hall made of wood the cause of the skirmish was later a subject of much debate many assumed that remus and his men were trying to steal some sheep and the alban shepherds caught them remus would later declare that it was the shepherds who picked a fight with his men taunting them with insults to their manhood and slurs against the people of roma whatever the cause it was remus who got the worst of the skirmish some of his men were killed some were captured and a few managed to escape remus himself was taken prisoner bound with iron chains and led before king amulius remuss attitude was defiant the king who was not used to being crossed ordered remus to be hung from a rafter and set about torturing him using hot irons sharp blades and leather whips when word of remuss captivity reached his brother on the palatine romulus set about mustering all the young men of the seven hills calling on them not only to rescue remus but to defend the pride of roma even men of upstanding families who had never consorted with the twins joined the cause knowing the mercenaries of amulius would be well armed they gathered whatever weapons they could findshepherds crooks that might serve as staves butchering knives slingshots hunters bows and arrowsand set out before the walls of alba romulus demanded that the king release his brother and the other captives amulius flanked by his mercenaries on the parapet peered down at the motley band and refused is it ransom you want asked romulus amulius laughed what could the likes of you afford to pay a few motheaten sheepskins no when im done torturing your brother and his friends i shall cut off their heads and mount them on this picket wall as a warning to others of their ilk and if youre still in my kingdom when morning comes young fool your head will end up next to your brothers romulus and his men withdrew the height of the pickets which surrounded the kings compound at first daunted them as did the archers who guarded the wall there seemed no way to storm the compound without being struck down by a hail of arrows but that night under cover of darkness romulus managed to set fire to a poorly guarded section of the wall the fire spread quickly in the chaos that followed his men proved braver and more bloodthirsty than the mercenaries of amulius the kings guards were slaughtered striding into the great hall romulus seized amulius and demanded to see his brother the king shaking with fear took him to the room where remus hung in chains then produced a key and released him from his shackles too weak to stand remus sank to his knees while remus watched romulus knocked amulius to the ground kicked and beat him until he was senseless then cut his throat the kings crown a simple circle of iron went rolling across the floor spun on its edge and with a clatter came to rest on the floor before remus pick it up brother said romulus it belongs to us now but remus his naked body scarred by burns and cuts was too weak even to lift the iron crown weeping to see his brother in such a state romulus knelt before him picked up the crown and began to place it on remuss head then he hesitated he withdrew crown from his brothers brow this crown belongs to us both brother equally but only one can wear it at a time let me wear it first so that i can appear before those who fought with me today and show them that the crown of alba belongs to us now romulus put the iron crown on his own head then rose and strode out to declare victory to his men by seizing the treasure of alba romulus and remus made themselves wealthy men far wealthier than any other man in all of roma when remus had recovered sufficiently to travel they returned home in triumph surrounded by their loyal companions and followed by wagons loaded with booty not everyone in roma was pleased by their success the father of potitius met with the other elders and voiced his doubts if remus was captured by the shepherds of amulius while trying to steal their sheep then king amulius was in his rights to hold him captive pending a ransom in that case romuluss attack upon alba was unjustified his killing of the king was murder and his seizure of the treasure was theft are we to make brigands into heroes the elder pinarius disagreed was remus up to no good in alba it doesnt matter after he was taken prisoner amulius didnt demand a ransom or restitution instead he proceeded to torture remus and plainly stated his intention to kill him to save his brother romulus had no choice but to take up arms amulius was a fool and he died a fools death the wealth that romulus seized in alba is his by right the albans may not think so said the elder potitius such an incident may set off a blood feud that could last for generations and the twins may have offended the gods as well we should consult a haruspex to determine the will of the gods in this matter pardon me while i ask an etruscan if i can take a piss said pinarius his voice dripping with sarcasm as it happens cousin we have no need for an etruscan haruspex my son has completed his studies he should arrive home any day now potitius can perform the proper rites how fortunate for the boy that he was conveniently absent when the battle at alba took place and so avoided all danger said pinarius whose son had fought beside romulus those words are uncalled for pinarius and unworthy of a priest of hercules in fact the elder potitius was relieved that his son had not returned in time to be recruited by romulus but pinariuss insinuation of cowardice was unfair he took a breath to calm himself a divination must be taken to determine the will of the gods and if the divination goes against romulus what then asked pinarius no i think there must be some better way to make sure that all concerned even the albans can see that it was just and proper for romulus to seize the crown and the treasure of king amulius by the shrewd glint in his eyes potitius could see that the man had some scheme already in motion potitius arrived home from tarquinia the next day the family greeted him with much rejoicing and not a little curiosity for he was attired in the costume of an etruscan haruspex over a yellow tunic he wore a long pleated cloak fixed at his shoulder with a bronze clasp and on his head he wore a conical cap held in place by a strap under his chin his father noted with pride that he also wore the amulet of fascinus when he had given potitius the amulet he had told him that he was a man though in his heart he had not quite believed it but potitius had matured greatly in the years he had been away his confident bearing and his thoughtful way of speaking were those of a man not a boy his father told him about the siege at alba and the triumphant return of the twins rather than exhibiting excitement at the tale potitius seemed most concerned about the injuries that remus had suffered and this further display of maturity again pleased his father i know you were their friend my son despite my disapproval go and see them talk sense to them show them the will of the gods at the moment everyone in roma is singing their praises fools like pinarius will only encourage them to carry out more escapades they shall grow more and more reckless until they bring the wrath of some warlord down upon us all roma has no walls like those amulius built at alba our safety depends entirely upon the good will and selfinterest of those who come here to do business if the twins continue to shed blood and loot their victimsif they turn the local youths into a band of brigandssooner or later theyll bite the tail of a wolf bigger than themselves and the people of roma will pay a terrible price the next morning potitius went to visit his old friends despite their newfound wealth the twins were still living in the swineherds hut on the palatine waves of nostalgia swept over potitius as he scaled the stairs of cacus uttering a prayer of thanksgiving to hercules as he passed the site of the cave he reached the top and stepped under the fig tree the branches hung low with ripe fruit the shade was so dense that at first he did not see the three figures who sat in a circle near the trunk he heard a low whisper you see i told you he was back and haughtier than everlook at that fancy hat hes wearing as his eyes adjusted to the darkness potitius realized that it was neither of the twins who had been whispering it was his cousin pinarius romulus jumped up he had grown a thick beard and was brawnier than ever but his bright smile was the same he feigned wonderment at potitiuss exotic garments cocking an eyebrow and flicking his finger against the conical hat potitius likewise lifted an eyebrow and pointed at the crown on romuluss head they both broke into laughter remus rose slowly to his feet his smile was weak and he walked with a slight limp he opened his arms and embraced potitius pinarius hung back gazing at potitius with his arms crossed and a sardonic expression on his face good to have you back cousin did your studies go well extremely well once my teachers beat enough etruscan into my head so that i could follow their lessons good for your teachers around these parts the twins have been teaching us all a different sort of lessonhow to throw down a king and take his crown yes my father told me i thank hercules that youre still alive remus hercules may have helped but it was my brother who slit that bastard amuliuss throat romulus smiled yes we were just discussing that with pinarius pinarius looked warily at potitius perhaps i should go now and we can continue our discussion later no need for that potitius can join us said romulus are you sure thats a good idea his cousins gaze was so frosty that potitius turned to leave but remus reached for his arm stay potitius we need your advice the four of them sat in the shade of the fig tree romulus resumed the discussion this is the problem there are some who say that what we did in alba was wrong that killing amulius was murder and taking his treasure was theft never mind that such talk is stupid if people think ill of us its likely to cause us problems in the future nobody wants a blood feud with amuliuss kinsmen or more trouble between alba and roma dont mistake me ill fight any man who cares to fight us and ill kill any man who crosses us but it would all be easier if people could see that we were in the right if they dont already see it that way how can we convince them remus and i have been pondering the question for days getting nowhere and then bright and early this morning here comes pinarius with an idea thats so brilliant it lights up the sky isnt it brilliant remus perhaps his tone was less enthusiastic than his brothers remus and i arent thinkers were doers thats why a fellow like pinarius is such a valuable friend he fought like a lion at albaand hes got a head on his shoulders as well pinarius looked at potitius smugly potitius frowned romulus what are you talking about pinariuss plan or should i say the truth that pinarius has revealed to us which we shall reveal to the rest of the world shall i tell him the tale or shall you remus remus smiled weakly you tell him brother im afraid ill forget something very well do you remember the story of how faustulus found us it was the year of the great flood remus and i were set adrift in a wooden cradle that settled on the slope of the palatine right over there thats where faustulus found us because so many people were drowned everyone thought we were just two more orphans so why not let faustulus and his wife raise us as their own theyve always been good to us no one can deny that i call them father and mother and im proud to do so averting his face from the twins pinarius flashed a grin potitius knew he was thinking of the rude joke about the brothers being suckled by a shewolf but heres something that pinarius has discovered from asking a few questions down in alba romulus continued remember all this happened in the year of the great flood back then amulius wasnt king of alba his brother numitor was king but amulius bloodthirsty bastard that he always was killed his brother and took his crown now that was murder that was theft i think there must be no crime worse than thata man killing his own brother the only person who remained who might make trouble for amulius was his brothers daughter rhea silvia what if she had a son and what if that son someday decided to avenge his grandfather and take back the crown to keep that from happening amulius forced rhea silvia to become a priestess of vestavesta being the hearth goddess they worship in alba her priestesses are called vestals and they take a sacred vow to remain virgins upon penalty of death amulius must have thought he was being very clever he let his niece live and so avoided staining his hands with more blood but he found a way to keep her from bearing a possible rival and did so in a way that he could claim was pleasing to the goddess but something went wrong with amuliuss plan despite her vow despite being kept in seclusion in a grove sacred to the war god mavors rhea silvia became pregnant some people in alba say that amulius must have raped her since he was the only man to have access to her and any man whod murder his own brother wouldnt be above raping his own niece but other people in alba tell a more curious tale they think it must have been mavors who ravished rhea silvia since it was in his grove that she was kept secluded whoever the father was rhea silvia managed to hide her pregnancy until her labor began when amulius was informed he was furious rhea silvia gave birthbut very soon thereafter she was dead it may be that amulius murdered her it may be that she died in childbirth but now the tale becomes even more interesting because the people of alba say that rhea silvia gave birth to twins and you have to ask yourself whatever happened to those two boys the grandsons of the murdered king numitor potitius looked at him dubiously romulus what are you suggesting remember potitius all this happened in the year of the great floodthe very year that remus and i were found by faustulus and you think the newborn twins vanishedbut how did amulius dispose of them he could claim a right to kill rhea silvia you see because she had broken her vow of chastity but even amulius didnt want the blood of two innocent newborns on his hands according to the talk in alba he did what people usually do when they want to get rid of a deformed or unwanted newbornhe ordered a servant to take the twins to some remote spot and abandon them potitius nodded gravely no one is held responsible for killing babies exposed in the wild they die by the will of the gods but do they always die everyone has heard tales of exposed infants raised by wild animals or otherwise rescued because gods or numina saw fit to help them whos to say those two babies laid side by side in a wooden cradle on some remote hillside werent carried away by the great flood to a place far from alba where no one knew them where they were raised in quiet humble circumstances safe from amulius until the time the gods saw fit to guide them to their destiny potitius shook his head romulus this sort of talk is nonsense its mad of course it isbrilliantly mad i give all the credit to pinarius who uncovered the tale saw the obvious connection and came here today to lay the facts before us remus stirred he winced was he in pain or made uncomfortable by his brothers enthusiasm these are hardly facts romulus theyre wild speculations perhaps but isnt it just the sort of story that people like to believe do you believe it romulus said potitius his training as a haruspex had instilled in him a great respect for truthseeking finding the truth was often a difficult business a mans own eyes and ears were unreliable as were the tales of others and even in the best circumstances the will of the gods could be obscure and open to interpretation his friends glib way of toying with the truth made him uneasy as he could see it made remus uneasy perhaps i do believe it answered romulus can you tell me the name of the woman who gave birth to me and to remus potitius no then why not say it was rhea silvia butthat would make amulius your fatherthe man you killed for a crown perhaps or was it the war god mavors who fathered us dont scoff potitius you say youre descended from that god that hangs from your neck and you claim that the blood of hercules runs in your veins why shouldnt remus and i be the sons of mavors either way the story makes us out to be the grandsons and heirs of old king numitor when we got rid of amulius and took his treasury we were doing nothing more than avenging our grandfathers murder and reclaiming what was rightfully ours there was a long silence until remus finally spoke like potitius i have reservations about this idea but i must admit claiming a royal bloodline for ourselves might solve a great many problems for us not only now to pacify the people in alba but later on as well if people hereabouts waver in their loyalty to us or grow jealous of our good fortune romulus placed a hand on remuss shoulder and smiled my brother is the wisest of men and you pinarius are the most clever pinarius grinned back at him and how lucky we are on this day to welcome back our oldest and most loyal friend after so many years away he gazed at potitius with a look of such warmth and affection that potitiuss feelings of uneasiness vanished as morning mist on the tiber vanishes beneath the rising sun bc in the months that followed the twins continued to build on their success at alba scattered across the countryside within a few days ride of roma were numerous men who had accumulated enough wealth and power to rule over their neighbors surround themselves with warriors and call themselves kings one by one romulus and remus found reasons to challenge those men and one by one they defeated them in battle claimed their wealth and invited their warriors to join them at roma the twins were ferocious and fearless fighters as their victories mounted they acquired a reputation for invincibility men found it easy to credit that they were the offspring of mavors as their fame spread more men flocked to join them drawn by the chance for adventure and a share of the booty every day new strangers appeared in the marketplace asking for the twins these men were very different from the honest traders who had been visiting the market for generations or the hardworking laborers who passed through looking for seasonal employment in the butchering pens and meatsalting operations these newcomers were roughlooking men some carried weapons wore bronze helmets or mismatched pieces of armor and bore the scars of previous battles some arrived with nothing more than the rags they wore and many of these were shiftyeyed and secretive about their pasts a few were innocent and starryeyed adventurehungry youths smitten by tales of the twins and eager to serve under them what have they done to our roma moaned the elder potitius i can remember a time when you could circle the seven hills and not meet a single person you didnt know by name you knew your neighbor you knew his grandparents and who his cousins were and which of the gods were most sacred to his household every family among us had been here for generations now every time i leave the hut i feel ive stumbled into a gathering of castoffs and cattlethieves it was bad enough when these strangers began showing up among us straggling in uninvited now the twins have put out a call for such men to come to roma come join us they say it doesnt matter who you are or where youve been or what youre running from if youre fit to fight and willing to take an oath of loyalty then take up arms and go looting with us every cutthroat and bandit from the mountains to the sea can find a home in roma up on asylum hill and why not cutthroats and bandits are just the sort of men romulus and remus are looking for potitius who had his own hut now living near the twins on the palatine had come home merely to pay a brief visit but had found himself trapped by his fathers rantings his fathers reference to asylum hill was particularly stinging as the number of the twins followers had grown larger and larger room to lodge them had been found atop the high hill directly above the market it was a natural spot to lodge an army the two highest points at opposite ends of the hill afforded commanding views of the surrounding countryside and steep flanks on every side made the hill the most defensible location in roma the name which people had lately given to the hill asylum came from the altar which the twins had erected there dedicated to asylaeus the patron god of vagabonds fugitives and exiles who offered sanctuary to those who could find it nowhere else as a haruspex and because of his training as a priest of hercules potitius had presided at the consecration of the altar of asylaeus his fathers harsh words about the asylum and its inhabitants struck potitius as a personal rebuke but the elder potitius was only beginning his tirade and you my sonyou go on these raids with them you join in the looting i travel with romulus and remus as their haruspex father at river crossings i ask the numina for safe passage before each battle i take the auspices reading the entrails of birds to determine if the day is propitious for victory during storms i study the lightning for signs of the gods will these are the things i was trained to do during my schooling in tarquinia before you became a haruspex you were a priest of hercules my son first and foremost you are the keeper of the ara maxima i know that father but consider hercules was the son of a god and a hero to the people so are romulus and remus no the twins are nothing more than orphans raised by a pig farmer and his whore of a wife theyre more like cacus than like hercules father think my son hercules rescued the people and moved on asking for nothing cacus killed and stole without remorse which of those two do your beloved twins more closely resemble potitius gasped at the recklessness of his fathers words if he himself had ever harbored such thoughts he had banished them once he made the decision to stand by the twins and to bind his fortunes to theirs and now his father went on they plan to encircle a good portion of roma with a wall even higher and stronger than the pickets that surrounded the great house of amulius at alba but surely father a wall is a good thing roma will become a proper city if were attacked people can find safety inside the walls and why should anyone wish to attack the good honest people of romaexcept for the fact that the twins have wrought bloodshed and misery on others and brought home more loot than they have any need for there are two ways of making a way in the world my son one is the way that your ancestors pursuedtrading with others peacefully and fairly offering hospitality to strangers accumulating no more wealth then is needed to live comfortably and diligently seeking to offend neither men nor gods people must barter for the things they need roma provided a safe honest place to do so and thus it was to everyones advantage to leave roma unmolested and because we did not pile up riches we did not attract the envy of greedy violent men but there is another way of living the way of men like amulius and of romulus and remusto take by force that which other men have accumulated by hard work yes their way leads quickly to great wealthand just as surely to bloodshed and ruin it is all very well to bully and rob your neighbors then use the treasure youve stolen to pay strangers to help you bully and rob yet more neighbors but what will happen when those neighbors unite and come looking for vengeance or a stronger bully appears on the scene and comes looking to steal the twins treasure ah but if that happens you say there will be a wall to keep us safe what nonsense did the twins learn nothing from their victory over amulius did walls keep amulius safe did his mercenary warriors save him did all his treasure buy him even a single breath when romulus cut his throat potitius shook his head all you say would make perfect sense father except for one great difference between amulius and the twins amulius lost the favor of the gods fortune turned against him but the gods love romulus and remus you mean to say that you love them my son no father i speak not as their friend but as a priest and a haruspex the gods love the twins it is a manifest fact in every battle especially a battle to the death there must be a winner and a loser romulus and remus always win that could not happen unless the gods willed it to be so you speak with scorn of the path theyve chosen but i tell you that their path is blessed by the gods how else can you account for their success that is why i follow them and why i use all the skills i possess to shed light on the way ahead of them his father unable to refute these words fell silent the twins agreed that a wall should be built but they did not agree about its location romulus favored a wall that would encircle the palatine remus thought the wall should be built around the aventine further south day after day potitius listened to them argue your reasons are purely sentimental brother said remus we were raised here on the palatine therefore you wish to make it the center of roma but no one lives on the palatine except a few herders and their livestock why build a wall around a city of sheep or do you intend to drive away the herders and cover the palatine with buildings i say leave this hill wild and open as it was when we were boys and build up the city elsewhere south of the spinon is the natural place to expand close to the riverfront the marketplace the salt bins and the slaughtering yards are already pushing against the foot of the aventine that is the hill we should encircle with a wall upon which we should begin to build a proper city how perfectly reasonable you sound brother romulus laughed the two brothers along with potitius and pinarius were strolling across the palatine the sky was dazzling blue with white clouds heaped against the horizon the hill was covered with green grass and spangled with spring flowers but there was not a single grazing sheep to be seen the sheep had all been gathered into their pens which were adorned with juniper boughs and wreaths of laurel leaves this was the day of the palilia the festival of the goddess pales here and there streamers of smoke trailed into the sky each family had set up its own altar to pales and upon these raised stones they were burning various substances for purification handfuls of sulfur which emitted skyblue smoke followed by twigs of fragrant rosemary laurel and sabine juniper then an offering compounded of beanstalks mixed with the ashes of calves already burned sprinkled with horse blood with juniper branches the shepherds wafted the smoke across the penned animals the sacred smoke of pales would keep the herd healthy and fertile afterward the shepherds would feast on millet cakes and drink bowls of warm milk sprinkled with purple must perfectly reasonable romulus said again but this is not about reason brother its about creating a city fit for two kings you say i favor the palatine because im sentimental indeed i am how can you walk across this hill on the day of the palilia and not feel the specialness of this place there was a reason the gods left our cradle on the slope of the palatine truly this is the very heart of roma its around the palatine that we must build a wall to honor the home that nurtured us the gods will bless our enterprise ridiculous snapped remus with a harshness that startled them all if you cant listen to reason how do you expect to rule a city romulus strained to keep an even tone ive done a good enough job so far brother building an army and leading them in battle running a city will be a different matter are you such a fool you cant see that you dare to call me a fool remus i wasnt the fool who got himself captured by amulius and needed rescuing how dare you throw that in my face or do you enjoy reminding me of the hours i spent suffering needlessly because you wasted time here in roma unfair brother untrue and because you strangled amulius you wear the crown every day even though you promised it would be shared equally between us is that what this is about take it wear it romulus lifted the iron crown from his head cast it to the ground and stalked away pinarius ran after him when they were boys the twins had never argued now they seemed to argue all the time and their arguments grew more and more heated from childhood romulus had been the more headstrong and impulsive and remus had been the one to restrain his brother but the torture he had received at the hands of amulius had wrought changes in remus his body had never fully recovered he still walked with a slight limp more than that his even temper had deserted him he had become as quick to anger as his brother romulus had changed as well since alba he remained as highspirited as before but was more disciplined and purposeful and more selfassured and arrogant than ever at alba remus had suffered the tortures of amulius romulus had enjoyed the glow of triumph and the satisfaction of rescuing his brother one had been a victim and the other a hero this disparity had created a rift between them small at first but constantly growing potitius knew that the argument he had just witnessed was not about the wall but about something that had gone terribly wrong between the twins which neither could put a name to or knew how to set right the castoff crown had landed at potitiuss feet he stooped to lift it from the grass and was surprised at how heavy it was he offered it to remus who took it but did not place it on his head this matter of the wall must be settled once and for all said remus quietly staring at the crown what do you think potitius he saw the troubled look on his friends face and laughed ruefully no im not asking you to take sides im asking your advice as a haruspex how might we settle this matter by consulting the will of the gods as quick as a blink a shadow passed over them potitius looked up to see a vulture high above i think i know a way he said the contest was held the next day it was not potitius who called it a contest but the twins for clearly that was how they thought of it to potitius it was a very solemn rite calling upon all the wisdom he had learned in tarquinia the rite was conducted simultaneously upon each of the contesting hills romulus stood at a high spot on the palatine looking north beside him was pinarius in his role as a priest of hercules remus with potitius stood on the aventine looking south at each site an iron blade had been driven upright into the earth so that by its shadow the exact moment of midday could be determined a mark had been made in the ground a set distance from the blade to mark by the blades moving shadow the passing of a precise measure of time within that span of time each brother and his priest would watch the sky for vultures in flight the priests would keep count of each vulture that was sighted by scraping a furrow in the dirt with a spear why vultures potitius had explained his reasoning to the brothers the vulture is sacred to hercules who was always joyful at the sight of one among all creatures it is the least harmful it damages neither crops nor fruit trees nor cattle it never kills or hurts any living thing but preys only upon carrion and even then it will not prey upon other birds whereas eagles hawks and owls will attack and kill their own kind of all birds it is the most rarely seen and few men claim ever to have seen its young because of this the etruscans believe that vultures come from some other world therefore let it be the sighting of vultures that determines the will of heaven in situating the city of roma midday arrived upon the aventine remus raised his arm and pointed theres one potitius suppressed a smile his training as a haruspex had taught him to recognize every sort of bird at a great distance i believe that is a hawk remus remus squinted so it is they continued to watch the time seemed to pass very slowly i see one over there said potitius remus followed his gaze and nodded potitius pressed his spear to the ground and scraped a furrow and theres another cried remus potitius agreed and scraped a second furrow so it went until the shadow of the blade reached the mark that signaled the end of the contest there were six furrows in the ground to mark the six vultures seen by remus he smiled and clapped his hands and seemed pleased potitius agreed that it was a considerable number and boded well they descended from the aventine they were to meet romulus and pinarius at the footbridge over the spinon but after a long wait remus became impatient he headed for the stairs of cacus with potitius following him as remus ascended he tripped on some of the steps potitius noted that his friends limp was very bad that day they found romulus and pinarius sitting on a fallen tree not far from the spot where they had kept watch on the palatine the two of them were laughing and conversing obviously in high spirits we were to meet at the spinon said remus why are you still here romulus rose he smiled broadly why should the king of roma leave the very center of his kingdom i told you that the palatine is the heart of roma and today the gods have made it clear that they agree what are saying go see for yourself romulus pointed to the place where pinarius had marked furrows in the ground when potitius saw the number of furrows he drew a sharp breath impossible he whispered there were so many furrows that they could not be numbered at a glance remus counted them aloud ten eleven twelve twelve he turned to confront romulus are you saying that you saw twelve vultures brother indeed i did not sparrows not eagles not hawks vultures my brother the bird most sacred to hercules and most rare within the allotted measure of time i saw and counted twelve vultures in the sky remus opened his mouth to say something then shut it dumbfounded potitius stared at pinarius is this true cousin you verified the count with your own eyes you made each of these furrows in the earth you performed the ritual openly and honestly before the gods as befits a priest of hercules pinarius stared back at him coldly of course cousin all was done in a proper manner romulus saw twelve vultures and i made twelve marks how many vultures did remus see if pinarius was lying then romulus was lying as well deceiving his own brother and smiling as he did so potitius looked at remus his friends jaw quivered and he blinked rapidly since his torture by amulius remuss face was sometimes subject to a violent twitching but this was something else remus was fighting back tears shaking his head unable to speak he hurriedly walked away limping badly how many did remus see pinarius asked again six whispered potitius pinarius nodded then the will of the gods is clear do you not agree cousin when romulus later took him aside and asked for his counsel as a haruspex regarding the making of the city boundaries potitius resisted him he stopped short of accusing romulus of lying but romulus read his thought never admitting deceit he dismissed potitiuss doubts about the counting of the vultures there had been a disagreement the disagreement had to be settled somehow it had been settled and now they must all move on by subtle flattery romulus convinced potitius that his participation was essential to the establishment of the city there was a right way and a wrong way to do such a thing and surely for the sake of the people of roma and their descendents all should be done in accordance with the will of the godsand who but potitius could reliably divine their will romulus stated his earnest desire that remus should perform an equal share of the ritual and persuaded potitius to play peacemaker between them thanks to potitius when the day arrived to establish the pomeriumthe sacred boundary of the new cityall was done properly and both twins took part the ritual was performed in accordance with ancient traditions handed down from the etruscans at the place which potitius determined to be the exact center of the palatine and thus the center of the new city romulus and remus broke ground and dug a deep pit using a spade they passed back and forth all those who wished to be citizens came forward one by one and cast a handful of dirt into the pit saying here is a handful of dirt from and speaking the name of the place they came from those who had lived in roma for generations performed the ritual as well as those who were newcomers and the mixing of the soil symbolized the melding of the citizenry even the father of potitius despite his reservations about the twins took part in the ceremony casting into the pit a handful of dirt he had scooped from the ground before the threshold of his familys hut when the pit was filled a stone altar was placed in the soil potitius called upon the skygod jupiter father of hercules to look down upon the foundation of the city romulus and remus invited mavors and vesta to pay witnessthe war god rumored to be their father and the hearth goddess to whom their reputed mother rhea silvia had been consecrated ahead of time the twins had circled the palatine and decided upon the best course for an encircling network of fortifications now they descended to the foot of the hill where a bronze plough had been hitched to a yoke drawn by a white bull and a white cow taking turns the brothers ploughed a continuous furrow to mark the boundary of the new city while one plowed the other walked beside him and wore the iron crown romulus began the furrow remus took the last turn and joined the furrows end to its beginning the throng that had followed every step of their progress cheered laughed and wept with joy the brothers lifted their weary arms to heaven then turned to each other and embraced at that moment it seemed to potitius that the twins were truly beloved by the gods and that no power on earth could lay them low on that day in the month that would later be named aprilis in the year that would later be known as bc the city of roma was born the building of fortifications commenced at once compared to the great walls that had been built elsewhere in the world such as those of ancient troy it was a very modest project the plan was not to build a wall of stone blocks that would have been impossible as there were no quarries to supply the stone no skilled masons to shape and set the blocks and no one with the engineering skills to design such a wall instead the new city would be defended by a network of ditches earthen ramparts and wooden pickets in some places the steep slope of the hillside itself would supply an adequate defense as modest or even primitive as the project would have appeared to a greek tyrant or an egyptian temple builder the first fortifications of roma were an undertaking on a scale never previously attempted in the region of the seven hills for manpower romulus and remus called upon the dwellers on asylum hill who had gone raiding with them as well as the local youths with whom they had grown up few from either group had much experience at the tasks the twins set them frequent mistakes and a great deal of wasted effort led to much squabbling at the work site whenever something went wrong it was romulus rather than remus who gave way to fits of anger he shouted at the workers threatened them and sometimes even struck them the more the workers protested that they were blameless the more furious romulus would become while remus stood back and watched his brothers outbursts with barely veiled amusement it seemed to potitius at first that things were simply getting back to normal with romulus showing himself to be the more hottempered of the twins and remus the more easygoing but after this scene was repeated numerous timesa failure in the fortifications expressions of outrage from romulus the workers protesting their blamelessness and remus silently observing the incidentpotitius began to harbor an uneasy suspicion he was not alone pinarius was also present each day and there was little that escaped his notice one afternoon he drew potitius aside cousin this situation cannot go on i think you should have a word with remusunless of course youre the one whos putting him up to this what are you talking about pinarius so far ive said nothing to romulus about my suspicions i have no wish to make more trouble between the twins speak plainly said potitius very well there have been too many problems with the construction of these fortifications the men may not be skilled builders but theyre not stupid nor are they all such shirkers and cowards that none of them would take responsibility for an honest mistake yet mistakes keep happening with no one to take the blame romulus grows more vexed every day while remus can barely contain his laughter a bit of harmless mischief is one thing deliberate treachery is another are you saying that someone is sabotaging the construction perhaps its nothing more than a series of practical jokes the intention may be to infuriate romulus but the harm goes beyond that romulus is being made to look foolish his authority is being undermined the morale of the men is being damaged someone very clever is behind this is it you cousin of course not who then someone close to remussomeone who can speak to him freelyneeds to discuss this matter very seriously with him not i he thinks im romuluss man perhaps you should talk to him cousin and accuse him of treachery use whatever words you think best just make sure that remus understands that this situation must not continue but when potitius spoke to remusin a very careful and roundabout way accusing him of nothing but suggesting that someone was hampering the progress of the fortificationsremus shrugged off the idea who would do such a thing certainly no one that i can think of but have you considered good potitius that the whole project is cursed if theres a will at work to thwart construction might it not be a will other than human potitius shook his head everything was done to appease the numina and appeal to the gods for their blessing you yourself invoked mavors and vesta yes but was the original divination properly conducted potitius felt personally affronted the contest for sighting the vultures was soundly conceived i called upon every principle of divination i learned in tarquinia i find no fault with you potitius or with your skills as a haruspex but were the vultures properlyand honestlycounted if not then the selection of the palatine was based upon a falsehood and the city conceived by my brother romulus is an offense to the godswho have ways of making their will known potitius shook his head but if you believe this remus i didnt say i believe it i only suggest it as a possibility its at least as credible as your suggestion that someone is maliciously causing damage again i ask you potitius who would do such a thing who would wish to stir up so much trouble and have the daring and the guile to do so remus raised an eyebrow and gave him an indulgent smile to show that as far as he was concerned his friends idea had been put to rest but potitius more uneasy than ever found himself harboring a new suspicion he now was certain that remus had done nothing to hinder the construction no matter that he showed bitter amusement at his brothers vexation if there was a troublemaker among them a person who said one thing and meant another who seemed always to have his own ulterior motives was that person not his cousin pinarius of this new suspicion potitius said nothing he decided to watch and to wait and meanwhile to keep silent later he would wish that he had spoken out not only to remus but to romulus as well but perhaps nothing he might have done could have altered the course of events summer came and with it long sweltering days work on the fortifications proceeded but slowly and with repeated setbacks the men grew tired of so much hard work and restless they wanted to go raiding again it was on a particularly hot humid day when tempers were already short that the worst of all mishaps occurred the men were working along a section of the perimeter where the terrain was largely flat and therefore required considerable fortification first a picket wall was constructed in sections each section was made of sharpened stakes laid side by side then lashed together with leather thongs a narrow trench was dug into which the picket sections were set upright and secured together so that when the trench was filled with tightly packed earth the picket wall was steadfast but romulus was dissatisfied with the height of the completed wall many of the tree trunks and branches that had been used for the pickets were hardly taller than a man and once they had been buried in the trench they were shorter still if enough debrisor dead bodieswere to be piled before the wall an attacker with long legs and strong nerves might dare to leap over the pickets along that section romulus decided that another layer of defense was called for so he ordered the men to dig an outer trench kneedeep which would be lined with spikes digging was the job the men despised most especially in the hard sunbaked earth they dripped sweat grumbled under their breaths and spoke of how much sweeter it would be to mount a horse and go riding with the warm wind in their faces looking for booty and bloodshed and women suddenly first in a few places and then along the whole length of the ditch the bank of earth between the wall and the trench began to crumble the men had dug too close to the pickets the packed earth that anchored the wall gave way all at once the entire wall tumbled forward directly on top of the men digging the trench romulus was nearby discussing the next stretch of fortifications with remus potitius and pinarius at the sound of men screaming they all came running and witnessed a scene of despair the fallen wall was too heavy to be shifted the men trapped beneath it had to be dragged clear where that was impossible the rescuers set about disassembling the wall hacking with knives at the leather bindings and pulling the pickets away many of the men had been seriously injured with crushed fingers broken bones and cracked skulls they clutched their wounds and wailed in pain amid the chaos potitius saw that pinarius had drawn remus aside and was speaking in his ear potitius had never seen a look of such fury on remuss face what was pinarius saying to him potitius drew nearer and overheard pinarius who spoke in a hoarse whisper it was never my idea i swear to you romulus insisted and i was afraid to refuse him i knew it cried remus i suspected it but until now i never knew for sure the liar his knife in his hand he pushed pinarius aside and strode toward his brother romulus rose from assisting a wounded worker and saw him coming he blanched at the look on remuss face and jumped back remus did not attack him instead he pointed to the fallen wall with his knife there brother do you see what your scheming and your lies have accomplished are you happy now romulus stared back at him dumbfounded you complained that the wall wasnt high enough said remus look at it now any man could jump over it even a man with a limp he took a running start and bounded over the fallen wall then turned to taunt romulus further what good is a wall if it wont stand up and why wont it stand because the gods are having a joke on you brother youve angered them you can lie to me you can lie to everyone in roma but you cant deceive the gods theyre laughing at you brother just as im laughingatyou the gods are on my side shouted romulus youre the one whos been wrecking all my hard work how dare you commit treachery behind my back then blame it on the gods how dare you laugh at me romulus cried out in fury picked up an iron shovel and rushed at his brother the twins were too evenly matched for the fight to quickly go one way or the other since his torture remus had become the weaker but he wielded a superior weapon romuluss anger made him clumsy and he swung the shovel wildly opening himself to remuss knife the glancing cuts he received made him more furious than before but also more reckless and the pain sapped his strength a few times he managed to strike remus soundly with his shovel hitting him across the shoulders and hips hard enough to knock him down but remus quickly scrambled up regained his balance and deftly wielded his knife at last romulus struck a blow to remuss hand and the blade went flying through the air romulus raised the shovel and stood poised to strike the defenseless remus with all his strength as one those watching drew a sharp breath but instead of striking romulus cried out and cast the shovel aside he fell on remus reaching for his throat and the two tumbled to the ground potitius clutched his chest until that moment he had truly feared that one of the brothers might kill the other but now locked together and fighting with bare hands they would surely exhaust their fury and come to their senses he opened his palms to heaven and whispered a prayer to hercules as he mouthed the gods name he thought he heard it uttered aloud and turned to see that pinarius also stood with open palms whispering a prayer but for what outcome did pinarius pray the twins rolled on the ground the advantage shifted back and forth as they savagely pummeled each other choked each other and gouged at one anothers eyes that day it was remuss turn to wear the iron crown it was a tight fit it stayed on his head throughout the combat until romulus suddenly reached for it and wrenched it from his brothers brow remus gave a cry and tried to snatch it back each twin gripped the crown with both hands they twisted this way and that until they struggled to their knees each pulling with all his might at the circle of iron which seemed to be suspended motionless in the air between them their knuckles turned white blood oozed from their fingers staining the crown red remus lost his grip his arms flew up and he fell backward romulus likewise recoiled but scrambled back onto his knees before remus could rise again romulus raised the crown high in the air and brought it down with all his strength potitius who had never ceased his fervent whispered prayers heard the shattering of bone beneath the broken flesh the sound was as sharp and earsplitting as the snapping of a branch on a winter day the blow to remuss head was so powerful that it left a dent the size of a mans fist in his skull romulus was breathing hard trembling from exhaustion he stared at his brothers ruined face for a moment then staggered to his feet he fitted the bloody crown on his head he circled his brothers body stamping and shambling like a drunken man glaring at the circle of shocked faces around him he pointed down at remus there do you all see that is what happens to any man who dares to jump over my walls some in the crowd gasped some wept a few the most ruthless and bloodthirsty of the vagabonds who had come to roma to seek asylum grunted in savage approval in the background potitius heard the wailing of men still trapped beneath the fallen wall potitius saw great oily spots before his eyes and felt lightheaded the moment became unreal somehow the waking world had vanished and this nightmare had taken its place romulus came to an abrupt halt his shoulders slumped his gaze followed the line of his own arm down to his bloody pointing finger then down to the crushed face of his brother his chest began to rise and fall convulsively he threw back his head dropped to his knees and let out a wail such as no man present had ever heard before men covered their ears to shut it out hearing that wail it seemed to potitius that his heart ceased to beat and his blood turned to ice romulus collapsed upon his brothers corpse weeping uncontrollably potitius averted his face he found himself looking at pinarius who gazed unblinking at the spectacle of romuluss grief more than ever potitius knew that he must be in a nightmare for how could any man look upon the horror of what romulus had done and react as did pinarius with a faint smile remus was buried at the summit of the aventine at the site where he had searched the sky for vultures potitius oversaw the funeral rites romulus stood among the mourners he did not weep nor did he speak it was potitius who delivered the eulogy indeed romulus would never speak of his brother again nor after the funeral would he ever allow anyone else to speak the name of remus in his presence it was a curious fact noted by everyone that after the death of remus the series of setbacks stopped construction of the fortifications continued with no further mishaps and the grand project was quickly finished had remus been lying to potitius when he disclaimed responsibility for the mischief no potitius believed that someone else had been responsible and stopped after the death of remus so as to make it seem that remus had been the culprit that same person had worked to poison the mind of romulus against his brother and likewise had incited remus against romulus by telling him on the day of his death that the contest of vultures had been a sham but potitius had no way of proving these suspicions and without proof his ideas counted for nothing his influence with the king had waned after the death of remus romulus relied more than ever on the counsel of pinarius it was on the advice of pinarius that romulus as king of roma took on more and more of the religious duties of the cityduties which otherwise would have fallen to potitius potitius remained hereditary priest of hercules and keeper of the ara maxima and would be so for the rest of his life and from time to time king romulus still called upon his skills as a haruspex but more often it was the king not potitius who read the sky for signs of the gods favor and determined the will of heaven and why not romulus was himself was the son of a god bc romulus was only eighteen years old when he founded the city and became its king thirtysix years later he was still king of roma much had been accomplished in those years many battles had been fought most of these had been little more than seasonal raiding parties to take booty from neighbors and to establish romuluss dominance over other men who called themselves kings a more important series of battles recently had been waged against the nearby town of veii which tried to claim ownership of the salt beds at the mouth of the tiber and take control of the salt trade by force of arms romulus forced the veiians to give up their claims he established romas supremacy as a salt emporium beyond dispute and assured her continuing prosperity but veii had only been bested not conquered the city would continue to engage in warfare with roma for many generations to come altars to many gods and goddesses had been erected and temples had also been built the very first temple in roma was built by romulus atop asylum hill and dedicated to the king of the gods jupiter it was a small rectangular wooden buildingits longest side measured only fifteen pacesand its facade was quite plain with an unadorned pediment supported by two pillars it contained no statue only an altar but it housed the spoils of war which romulus had taken from other kings in honor of rhea silvia his mother he built a temple to the goddess vesta it was a round building with wicker walls and a thatched roof in shape it was not unlike the hut romulus had grown up in but much larger it contained a hearth in which burned a sacred flame tended by virgin priestesses in honor of mavors his father he erected an altar upon the broad plain enclosed by the arm of the tiber which provided a suitable training ground for his soldiers that area became known as the field of mavors as he had fortified the palatine so romulus eventually fortified asylum hill and also the aventine fulfilling the ambition of his brother the marshy lake which fed the spinon he drained and filled with rubble and hardpacked earth the resulting valley accessible to all the seven hills became a natural crossroads and meeting place men called it the forum for himself romulus built a royal dwelling bigger and grander than the hall of amulius in alba the hut in which he had grown up was consecrated as a sacred site to be preserved for posterity in its humble condition as a monument to the founders origins likewise the tree beneath which he had been suckled was made sacred and it was declared that a fig tree should always be located there and called the ruminalis or sucklingtree to reward his bravest warriors and most steadfast supporters he established an elite body called the senate to its one hundred members he granted special privileges and delegated special duties potitius was among the first senators so was pinarius romulus altered and added to the calendar of festivals the palilia had been celebrated every spring since a time beyond memory because of the holidays proximity to the groundbreaking ceremony for roma the palilia had also become the occasion to celebrate the birth of the city only old men in their fifties like potitius could remember a time when the palilia had been a festival unto itself with no connection to the founding of roma the running of the wolflings had also become an annual event which greatly amused potitius how his late father in his dotage had railed against this development each winter on the anniversary of the occasion when romulus remus and potitius had run naked around the seven hills the romans celebrated the lupercalia a festival in honor of lupercus god of flocks a goat was sacrificed the young sons of senators caroused naked but instead of adorning themselves with wolf skins and brandishing wolfhide straps they carried strips of hide from the sacrificed goat young women offered their wrists to be slapped believing that contact with the sacred fleece enhanced their fertility to be sure a great many babies were born nine months after the lupercalia the ritual which began as a celebration of predators now celebrated the flock as befitted a civilized people who lived within a protective enclosure under the rule of a king other traditions remained intact and unchanged throughout the kings long reign the feast of hercules was still performed at the ara maxima each year exactly as it had been for generations with the pinarii pretending to arrive late for the feast and the potitii claiming the exclusive privilege of eating of the entrails offered to the god for the fiftyfourth time in his lifeand though he did not know it the last timepotitius had taken part in the feast of hercules his eldest grandson for the first time had joined in the ritual waving the sacred oxtail whisk to keep flies away from the ara maxima the boy had done a good job potitius was proud of him and had been in a good mood all day despite the heat and despite the unavoidable annual unpleasantness of having to deal with his fellow priest and cousin pinarius now the feast was over potitius had retired to his hut on the palatine and was lying down for a nap valeria his wife of many years lay beside him her eyes closed she had eaten her fill at the feast and was also sleepy potitius gazed at his wife and felt a great swelling of love and tenderness her hair was almost as gray and her face as wrinkled as his own but he still found pleasure in looking at her she had been a loyal wife a wise and patient mother and a good partner if nothing else life had given him valeria or to give proper credit if nothing else romulus had given him valeria in a few days the people of roma would celebrate the great midsummer festival the consualia potitius could not think of valeria without thinking of the consualia he could not think of the consualia without thinking of valeria and remembering the very first consualiathough the festival would only later receive its namehad been celebrated by romulus early in his reign he had decreed a festival of athletic contests to be held in the long valley between the palatine and the aventinefoot races somersaulting demonstrations of daring on horseback and stonehurling competitions to join in friendly competition with the youths of roma romulus invited some of the citys neighborsmembers of a tribe called the sabines who had settled on the most northern of the seven hills the sabines called this hill the quirinal after their chief god quirinus the ostensible purpose of that first consualia had been athletic competitions but romulus had a surprise in store for the unsuspecting visitors potitius when he had been made aware of romuluss secret plan had strongly protested hospitality to visitors was a law decreed by the gods every priest in every land agreed a traveler with honest intentions must always be welcomed and it was the duty of his host to keep him safe what romulus was plottingencouraged potitius had no doubt by his counselor pinariuswent against every law of hospitality potitius tried to dissuade him but the king was adamant there are too many men in roma and not enough women and more men arrive every day he insisted the sabines on the quirinal have a surplus of young women ive made overtures to their leader titus tatius inviting him to send brides for my men but he refuses their mothers complain that the romans are too uncouth they want their daughters to marry other sabines even if it means they must leave the quirinal to go live with the tribes in the mountains this is nonsense my men deserve wives are they not good enough for the sabine women as for impiety i have prayed to the god consus for guidance on this matter the god of secret counsels yes and by various signs he has shown his favor romulus had carried out his design the sabine youths arrived to take part in the competitions the sabine elders and women came to watch it was easy to tell which of the women were unmarried for the matrons stayed in one group and the virgins in another all the sabines arrived unarmed as befitted invited guests the contests proceeded the sabine youths exerted themselves to the utmost exhausting themselves while the romans held back and saved their strength at a signal from romulus some of the romans seized the unmarried sabine women and carried them off into the fortified city while others took up arms the sabine men unarmed and exhausted were easily driven off that had not been the end of the matter titus tatius at first determined to take back the women called upon his relatives among the sabine tribes to help him but he could not muster enough manpower to seriously lay siege to roma many a skirmish and ambush followed meanwhile romulus encouraged his men to court the captive women and win them over without force many of the women eventually married their suitors willingly and gave birth to children even those who were unhappy in roma began to realize that they could not return to their homes on the quirinal for the other sabines would consider them compromised and unfit for marriage eventually titus tatius decided to make the best of a bad situation and to end the dispute by negotiation romulus made a settlement of goods to the families of the seized women and in return the sabines recognized the marriages and agreed to resume peaceful relations some hard feelings lingered but in the end the intermarriage of the two groups drew them closer together and romulus and titus tatius formed a longlasting alliance potitius had never stopped protesting the plan to seize the sabine womenuntil the moment he laid eyes on valeria she had been among the other sabine virgins being held against her will in the walled courtyard of the kings house looking frightened and miserable she had not been the most beautiful of the sabines but some quality about her attracted potitiuss gaze and he could not look away pinarius saw him staring and whispered in his ear do you want her cousin take heror else i will as the two men approached her valeria cowered at the predatory gleam in pinariuss eyes but when she saw potitius who looked as miserable as herself a very different emotion lit her face in that moment a bond was forged between them that was to last a lifetime of all the sabine women valeria had been the very first to marry one of the captors willingly their child had been the first to be born to a roman and a sabine romulus himself married one of the sabines hersilia their marriage was happy but barren potitius who had many children wondered if the gods had cursed romulus to remain childless because he had so flagrantly violated the sacred laws of hospitality to capture the sabine women if the king himself harbored such thoughts he never spoke them aloud romulus did however develop strong ideas about marriage and family life as king he made his ideas into law no marriage could ever be dissolved although a husband had the right to put his wife to death if she committed adultery or drank wine because drinking wine romulus believed led women to adultery over his children and their children a father wielded absolute control during his entire life he could hire them out to others as laborers imprison them beat them or even put them to death no son ever outgrew the legal authority of his father this was the law of the paterfamiliasthe supreme head of the householdand it was to remain absolute and unquestioned in roma for centuries to come these things potitius remembered and pondered thinking of valeria and the first consualia and the socalled rape of the sabine women if nothing else romulus had given him valeria beside him valeria slept potitius could tell because she was gently snoring studying her face remembering all their years together he decided that their marriage would have been a successful one with or without the stern laws of romulus just as their children would have grown up to be respectful and obedient whether or not the king had decreed the law of paterfamilias potitiuss own father had often disapproved of his decisions but would never have invoked a law to punish him or to break his will what did romuluswho had no sons or daughters who claimed to have no human fatherknow about raising children or respecting a father and yet the world that came after romulus would be different from the world that came before him because of the laws he imposed on the families of roma there was a rapping at the door to his hut moving quickly but carefully so as not to wake valeria potitius went to answer the door the afternoon sunlight dazzled his eyes and made a silhouette of his visitor and potitius did not recognize him until he spoke good afternoon cousin pinarius what are you doing here the feast is over i thought i wouldnt have to see your face again for at least a year unkind words cousin will you not invite me in what do we have to say to one another invite me in and find out potitius frowned but stepped aside to let pinarius enter he shut the door keep your voice low valeria is asleep from behind the wicker screen that hid their bed he could hear her quiet snoring i took a good look at her at the feast today said pinarius shes still a handsome woman if only i had moved a bit faster than you all those years ago why are you here pinarius lowered his voice even more a change is coming cousin some of us will survive it others will not speak plainly youve always had differences with the king over and over youve opposed him since the very beginning of his reign if i were to tell you that his reign will soon be over would you shed a tear nonsense romulus is as fit as a man half his age he still leads his warriors into battle and fights in the front rank hell live to be a hundred pinarius sighed and shook his head you really have no idea of whats going on do you cousin this was how pinarius always spoke to himin riddles with a mixture of pity and scorn but potitius realized that his cousin was serious and speaking of something very grave tell me then whats going on behind the kings back the senators grumble that the king has become too arrogant that hes reigned too long that he takes his power for granted and abuses it youve seen how he strides across the palatine in his scarlet tunic and purplebordered robe surrounded by his coterie of surly young warriors lictors he calls them using the etruscan word for a royal bodyguardyet another of his affectations the other day when he deigned to attend a meeting of the senate he sat on his plush throne and gazed down on us not even paying attention he laughed and joked with his lictors instead his ears perked up only when some wastrel a lazy swineherd appeared before him with a trumpedup complaint against a respectable man of property and how did romulus rule for the swineherd and against the senator while we were still gaping at that outrage he announced that he would divvy up a newly conquered parcel of prime farmland among his soldiers without consulting usor giving us a share whats next will the king start throwing his old comrades out of the senate and replacing us with swineherds and nobodies who arrived in roma yesterday potitius laughed romulus loves the common people and they love him and why not he was raised by a swineherd he may live in a palace but his heart is in the pigsty he loves his soldiers too and they love him he was born to be a troublemaker and a rabblerouser pity the poor senators whove grown too greedy and too fat to keep the kings love you complain that hes arrogant but what do you care if romulus parades about in a purple robe you care only about protecting your own privileges against newcomers and common folk who dont know their place pinarius thrust out his jaw maybe so cousin but things cannot go on as they are a day of reckoning approaches a day marked in the calendar of the heavens potitius grunted there have always been plots against romulusand romulus has always put a stop to them are you here to tell me that another plot is being hatched are you asking me to take part cousin you always see though me pinarius smiled to you i never tell the truthyet from you i have no secrets potitius shook his head ill have nothing to do with any plot to harm the king behind the screen valeria sighed and turned in her sleep ill hear no more of this you should go youre a fool potitius you always have been maybe so but i wont be a traitor as well then at least keep your distance from the king if you want to keep your head whats the etruscan saying when the scythe cuts the weed the grass is cropped as well youll know the time of reckoning has arrived when the light of the sun fails and day turns to night what are you talking about your etruscans taught you much about divination potitius but they taught you nothing about celestial phenomena that study was left to me years ago romulus charged me with finding wise men who could predict the movements of the sun and moon and stars so that we could better chart the seasons and fix the days of the festivals there are ways of knowing in advance when certain rare events will occur a day is coming when for a brief while the light of the sun will go out and the gods will withdraw their favor from the king romulus will leave this earth along with anyone who stands too close to him do you understand i understand that youre even madder than i thought youve been warned cousin ive done my best to save you but if you breathe a word of this to anyone the lovely valeria will become a widow before she needs to get out of my home cousin without another word pinarius departed after his visit from pinarius potitius suffered sleepless nights he had no doubt that his cousins knowledge of a plot against the king was genuine nor did he doubt that pinariuss parting threat was sincere should he warn romulus over and over in his mind potitius imagined doing so yet he could not find the will to act was it because he feared pinarius or was it because despite his protestations of loyalty his relations with the king had grown as strained as those of the other senators pinarius had left him with the impression that an attack on romulus was imminent only a few days later roma celebrated the festival of consualia with rituals and competitions to commemorate the first athletic games and the taking of the sabine women potitiuss duties as a haruspex required his attendance on the king and he spent the day of the consualia in an agony of suspense first a sacrifice was made to consus the god of secret deliberations to whom romulus had prayed when formulating his plan to seize the sabine women and to whom romulus had erected an altar after his success the altar of consus was kept buried during the rest of the year and uncovered only for the consualia when the king asked for the gods continued blessing for his covert schemes what more appropriate day could there be for an attack on romulus plotted in secret pinarius too attended the king and potitius watched him closely but pinarius showed no signs of strain or high emotion the sacrifice to consus was propitious the games were blessed with splendid weather and the day passed without incident more days came and went with no attack on romulus yet potitius felt no respite from the anxiety that spoiled his sleep he found himself watching the king and the senators with fresh eyes everything pinarius had said was true the king had grown arrogant and careless he blatantly favored young warriors and newcomers and just as blatantly showed contempt to his old comrades the senators concealed their anger in the kings presence but after he and his young lictors passed by hatred erupted on their faces and they fell to whispering among themselveswhispers that ceased the moment potitius drew close enough to hear bc summer passed to fall fall to winter and winter to spring another summer approached and still the senators did not act the reign of the king seemed as unshakable as ever had the conspirators changed their minds had the celestial phenomenon predicted by pinarius failed to occur or had his cousins overture to join the plot and potitiuss refusal been reason enough for its cancellation potitius had no way of knowing for the other senators barred him from their counsels he had forfeited any chance to warn the king by waiting too long how could he explain to romulus his procrastination in the face of such a threat potitius found himself friendless and alone he told himself that the plot against romulus like every previous plot had come to nothing nevertheless a feeling of impending doom settled over him he could not shake its grip long ago potitius had made a decision to break with an old family tradition instead of passing the amulet of fascinus to his son when the boy reached manhood he had kept the amulet for himself intending to wear it on special occasions until his death this was in keeping he reasoned with the law of paterfamilias decreed by romulus whereby potitius would remain supreme head of his household as long as he lived but now goaded by a premonition of dread potitius decided to pass the amulet to his eldest grandson at first he thought to honor tradition and do so at the next feast of hercules but his premonition grew so urgent that he called the family together a full month before the festival he wept to see them all in one place feeling certain that it was for the last time they wondered at his tears which he made no effort to explain he made a solemn ceremony of removing the talisman from his neck and placing it over the neck of his grandson once this was done potitius felt greatly relieved fascinus was the oldest god of his family even older than hercules and now that potitius had safely passed on the gods amulet the most ancient obligation laid down by his ancestors had been fulfilled the next day potitius was called upon to take the auspices at the dedication of the altar to vulcan god of the fiery regions underground the place was the goats marsh at the western end of the field of mavors where a streamlet that ran through the valley north of the quirinal terminated in a pit of hot bubbling quicksand over the years many a wandering goat had been lost in the treacherous pit hence its name and the notion that the site must be sacred to vulcan here the god claimed sacrifices whether men offered them or not romulus had decided to attach great pomp to the occasion he ordered all the senators and citizens of roma to attend throughout the morning people gathered on the field of mavors arriving from their homes scattered across the seven hills the warriors who had fought in the kings many campaigns wore the trophies they had captured in battlefinely wrought bronze armor helmets decorated with brightly dyed plumes of horsehair belts of tooled leather with iron clasps even the poorest citizens wore their best if only a tunic without a hole in it at the appointed hour the king and his retinue came striding though the crowd potitius wore his ceremonial yellow cloak and conical cap the king wore a new cloak upon which the dye was barely dry potitius could smell the distinctive scent of the red stain obtained from the madder plant the kings young lictors were outfitted in newly minted armor that shone brightly beneath the midday sun in a tradition borrowed from etruscan royalty the weapons they carried were bundles of rods and axesrods for scourging anyone who offended the king and axes for executing on the spot any man the king declared to be his enemy the new altar had been cut from blocks of limestone and erected on a high mound of earth it was decorated with elaborate carvings that depicted scenes of battle from the recent war against veii and romuluss triumphal procession on foot through the streets of roma the best etruscan artisans had been hired to carve the altar gazing at the results of their intricate workmanship potitius thought how simple and plain the unadorned ara maxima seemed in comparison nearby the goat intended for the sacrifice bleated plaintively as if aware of its fate romulus himself would perform the sacrifice slaying the goat with a ritual knife upon the altar potitiuss role was to examine the animal first to make sure that it was without defects he checked that the goats eyes were clear its orifices without discharge its coat unblemished its limbs whole its hooves sound potitius declared to romulus that the goat was suitable for sacrifice while the goat was being bound potitius glanced at the faces of the senators in the front ranks of the crowd his eyes connected with those of pinarius his cousin wore a strange expression his smiled but his eyes were grim with a prickle of apprehension potitius knew that the day of which pinarius had spoken had finally arrived and yet how could anyone dare to attack the king in such a place at such a time his lictors were all around the whole population of roma was assembled to pay witness and the occasion was sacred bound and bleating the goat was placed upon the altar romulus held up the sacrificial knife and turned to face the great multitude that had gathered on the field of mavors so many he murmured his voice was so low that only potitius was close enough to hear did you ever think when we were young that such a day as this would come that they would all stand before us and call us king that only gods would stand above us potitius heard the kings words but knew they were not intended for him it was to remus that romulus spoke in that instant potitius knew why he had never warned the king of the plot against himnot because he feared pinarius and not because of his own small grievances against the king in the deepest recesses of his heart he had never forgiven romulus for the murder of remus nor had romulus ever forgiven himself the murmur that rose from the crowd grew hushed in anticipation of the kings invocation to vulcan potitius gazed out at the sea of faces it seemed to him that there had been a gradual change in the light an increasing dimness that was most peculiar almost uncanny others had noticed the change as well a few in the crowd turned their faces up to the sun what they saw was bizarre and inexplicable a great portion of the sun had turned as black as coal as if a portion of its flame had gone out men pointed and shouted in alarm soon everyone was gazing at the sun its fire dwindled until it appeared to be a blackened ball of coal rimmed with flame people in the crowd gasped in wonder and awe then began to scream in of panic at the same time potitius felt a strong wind on his face the day had been almost cloudless now from the west vast heaps of black clouds tumbled across the already darkened sky the wind snatched the conical cap from potitiuss head he reached in vain to snatch it back and watched it go spinning though the air an invisible hand seemed to lift it over the altar crumple it then throw it down onto the glistening surface of the goats marsh the cap weighed very little yet the bubbling quicksand sucked it under in the blink of an eye potitius turned to face the crowd again by a spectral light which grew dimmer with each heartbeat he saw that the field of mavors had become a scene of chaos above the howling of the wind he heard screams of pain and fear people ran this way and that trampling and tripping over those who fell romuluss young lictors were as frightened as the rest instead of forming a cordon around the king they scattered like leaves a jagged bolt of lightning tore across the black sky and struck asylum hill the crack of thunder that followed split his ears and almost knocked him down the flash had completely blinded him so that when he stepped forward thinking to find the king potitius groped the empty air like a man without eyes raindrops as hard as jagged pebbles pelted his face he smelled the dye of the madder and knew that romulus was near his fingers touched another mans garments he gripped the wool and held it tightly another bolt of lightning tore the sky by its unearthly white light he saw before him not romulus but pinarius in one hand his cousin held a bloody sword in the other gripping it by a tuft of hair he held a severed head its face was turned away from him but upon the head potitius saw the iron crown of romulus when remus had died potitius had felt as if he were in a nightmare now despite the stark horror of the moment he felt acutely supremely clearheaded as if he were waking from a dream another bolt of lightning lit the scene he watched with curious detachment as pinarius drew back his sword potitius reached up reflexively to touch the amulet of fascinus at his neck but the talisman was not there he had given it to his grandson the day before the amulet at least was safe with a great shout pinarius swung the red blade toward his neck jupiter himself had sanctioned what he had done or so pinarius reasoned for although he had long ago predicted the eclipse and planned to take advantage of the awe and confusion it would inevitably inspire he could not have foreseen the magnificent storm that accompanied it lightning was the hand of jupiter thunder was his voice the god himself had lighted pinariuss way to the altar the god had roared with approval when pinarius severed the head from romuluss shoulders pinarius had warned his cousin not to stand too close to the king everyone else even romuluss lictors had fled from the scene and yet in the first moment after the deed was done there was potitius gripping his robes and staring at him the decision to kill him had been instantaneous and correct jupiter had roared approval with a deafening peal of thunder very quickly pinarius and his accomplices stripped the headless body of romulus then threw it into the goats marsh where it sank without a trace they did the same with the body of potitius even if the marsh should ever give up its secrets who could identify two naked bodies each without a head various of the senators departed with pieces of the clothing hidden under their robes vowing to burn these bits of incriminating evidence as soon as they reached their homes pinarius removed the crown from romuluss head and placed the circle of iron upon the altar where it could easily be found he had intended to dispose of the head of romulus himself but instead he handed it to one of his accomplices and ordered the man to bury it in a secret location the death of potitius presented him with a more pressing obligation the man had been a fool but he was also pinariuss relative and his fellow priest of hercules to dispose of his severed head was the least and the last favor that pinarius could perform for potitius the eclipse was passing the darkness lessened by small degrees but the storm raged on the field of mavors was abandoned but pinarius nonetheless kept the head concealed beneath his robes as he made his way toward asylum hill he hurried up the steep path newcomers still made camps before the altar of asylaeus but the storms fury had driven them all elsewhere pinarius proceeded to the temple of jupiter to give thanks to the god for blessing the events of the day pinarius would bury his cousins head in the shadow of jupiters temple he knelt in the mud and took a last look at his cousins face then using his bare hands he set about digging a deep hole in the soft wet earth coriolanus bc the twelveyearold boy sat crosslegged on the floor reciting his lessons his grandfather sat before him on a simple wooden folding chair with bronze hinges despite the fact that the chair had no back the old man sat rigidly erect setting an example for the boy now tell me titus upon what day did king romulus depart from this earth upon the nones of quinctilis two hundred and six years ago how old was he fiftyfive and where did this occur at the altar of vulcan that stands before the goats marsh at the western end of the field of mars ah yes but was it called the field of mars in those days the boy frowned then remembering what he had been taught his face brightened no grandfather in king romuluss day people called it the field of mavors because thats what they called mars in olden timesmavors and what do we learn from this example that words and names can change over timethey usually grow shorter and simplerbut that the gods are eternal the old man smiled very good now describe the ascension of king romulus there was an eclipse of the sun and also a great storm and the people fled in fear thats why the festival each year held on that day is called the populifugia the flight of the people but one man an ancestor of the pinarii remained his name was just pinarius back then most people only had one name not two as we do now pinarius witnessed the miracle that occurred the sky opened and a funnelshaped whirlwind came down it was the hand of jupiter and it lifted king romulus into the sky before he left the king removed his iron crown and placed it on the altar of vulcan for his successor thus king romulus became the only man in all history who never died he simply left the earth to go live as a god among the gods very good titus youve been studying hard havent you yes grandfather pleased with himself young titus potitius reached up and touched the amulet of fascinus that hung from a gold chain around his neck his father had given it to him at the last feast of hercules when titus had assisted for the first time as a priest at the altar now tell me who were the kings who followed romulus and what were their greatest achievements king romulus had no son so after he departed the senators met and debated who should succeed him this set a precedent that would be followed forever after that the succession of the kings is not hereditary instead a king is chosen to serve for life by the senate they chose numa pompilius a man of sabine blood who had never even set foot in roma this set another wise precedentthat the new king could be an outsider and should not come from the ranks of the senate else the senators might fight among themselves to seize the crown the reign of numa was long and peaceful he was very pious and he did much to organize the colleges of priests and the worship of the gods then came tullus hostilius he was as warlike as numa had been peaceable by destroying her rivals he made roma the chief city of all the latinspeaking people of italy tullus hostilius built the great assembly hall in the forum where the senate meets then came ancus marcius who was numas grandson he built the first bridge across the tiber he also founded the city of ostia at the mouth of the river to serve as a seaport for roma the fifth king was the first king tarquinius he was of greek blood but came from the etruscan city of tarquinia from which he took his name he was both a great warrior and a great builder he constructed the great underground sewer the cloaca maxima that follows the ancient course of the spinon and drains the forum he laid out the great horseracing track in the long valley between the palatine and the aventine which we call the circus maximus and built the first viewing stands and he drew up the plans and began the foundations for the greatest building ever conceived anywhere on earth the new temple of jupiter on the capitoline hill titus rose from the floor and strode to the window where the shutters were open to let in the warm breeze the house of the potitii was situated high on the palatine so that the window afforded a splendid view of the massive construction project on the neighboring capitoline hill surrounded by scaffolds swarming with artisans and laborers the new temple had begun to take shape it was of an etruscan design called araeostyle with a broad decorated pediment set atop widely spaced columns and a single grand entrance from the recessed porch titus gazed at the sight fascinated his grandfather ever the pedagogue prompted a digression was the hill always called the capitoline no since the days of king romulus it was called asylum hill but now people have started calling it the capitolinehead hill and why is that because of the amazing thing the diggers found when they started work on the new temple foundations back in the reign of the first king tarquinius they uncovered the head of man which appeared to be very ancient but was remarkably well preserved the priests called it a sign from the gods and a most excellent one portending that roma would become the head of the world titus frowned how could such a thing have happened grandfather who would have buried a head with no body on the capitoline and how was it preserved the old man cleared his throat there are mysteries which no man can explain which are nonetheless true for tradition tells us so if you doubt the veracity of the tale i can assure that i myself as a young man was privileged to see the head not long after it was found the mans features were somewhat decayed but one could see very clearly that his hair was blond mixed with gray as was his beard he sounds like you grandfather the old man raised an eyebrow im not as far gone as that now back to the list of the kings after the first tarquinius the first tarquinius was succeeded by servius tullius he had been a slave in the royal household but he rose to such prominence that when tarquinius died he was put forward by tarquiniuss widow to succeed him he greatly reinforced and extended the fortifications of the city until all the seven hills were enclosed by pickets walls embankments and trenches he also excavated the underground cell in the state prison at the foot of the capitoline which we call the tullianum where the enemies of the king are executed by strangulation he put these projects first so that work on the new temple came to a standstill and after servius tullius comes the present king the son of tarquinius also named tarquinius our king is famous for acquiring the sibylline books which are full of prophecies that guide the people in times of crisis and how did that come about titus smiled for this was one of his favorite stories the sibyl lives in a cave down in cumae on the coast the god apollo compelled her to write hundreds of strange verses on palm leaves she stitched together all the palm leaves into nine scrolls which she brought to roma and offered to sell to king tarquinius saying that if a man could interpret her verses rightly he could foretell the future tarquinius was tempted but he told her that the price was too steep whereupon she waved her hand and three of the scrolls burst into flames then she offered to sell him the remaining sixfor the original asking price of the nine tarquinius was angry and again refused whereupon the sibyl burned three more scrolls then named the same price once again king tarquinius thinking of all the knowledge that had already been lost gave in he paid the price she had asked for nine books and got only three the sibylline books are very sacred they must be consulted only in the direst emergency to house them tarquinius set about completing the great temple which his father began again titus gazed out the window for most of his life work on the temple had been progressing with the huge columns and massive pediment finally in place its final form was becoming more evident with each passing month even men who had traveled far beyond roma to the great cities of greece and egypt said they had never seen a building so grand no wonder they call him tarquinius the proud murmured titus the old man stiffened what did you say tarquinius the proudthats what ive heard men call the king what men where titus shrugged strangers shopkeepers people passing in the forum or on the street dont listen to them and dont repeat what they say but why not just do as i say titus bowed his head his grandfather was the eldest of the potitii the paterfamilias his will within the family was law and it was not tituss place ever to question him the old man sighed i will explain but only once when men use that word about the king they do not mean it as a compliment quite the opposite they mean that he is arrogant stubborn and vain so do not say such a thing aloud not even to me words can be dangerous especially words meant to wound a king titus nodded gravely then frowned one thing puzzles me grandfather you say the monarchy is not hereditary but the present king tarquiniuss father was also king yes but the crown did not pass directly from father to son i know servius tullius came between but didnt tarquinius kill him and thats how he became king the old man drew a quick breath but did not reply titus was old enough to be taught the list of kings and their principal achievements but not yet old enough to be taught about the political machinations that had brought each king to the throne and the scandals that had attended each reign to a young man who could not yet understand the importance of discretion one hesitated to speak ill even of kings long dead one certainly did not speak ill of a living king about tarquinius and the murders that had brought him to the throne and all the murders that had followed there was little to say that was fit for the boys ears ambitious to become a king like his father tarquinius had married one of the two daughters of his fathers successor servius tullius but when she proved to be more loyal to her father than to tarquinius he decided he preferred her more ruthless sister when tarquiniuss wife conveniently died as did the husband of his sisterinlaw and the two bereaved spouses married one another the word poison was whispered all over roma in short order tarquinius and his new wife murdered her father and tarquinius declared himself king dispensing with the formalities of election by the people and confirmation by the senate having seized the throne by force tarquinius ruled by fear previous kings had consulted the senate on important matters and called upon them to act as jurors tarquinius showed only contempt for the senate he claimed sole authority to judge capital cases and used that authority to punish innocent men with death or exile he confiscated his victims property to pay for his grand schemes including the new temple the senate had grown to include three hundred members but its numbers diminished as the king destroyed one after another of its wealthiest most prominent men his sons grew to be as arrogant as their father and there were rumors that tarquinius planned to name one of them as his heir abolishing outright the ancient rules of nonhereditary succession and election by the people the old man sighed and changed the subject fetch your stylus and wax tablet you shall practice your writing skills titus dutifully took the instruments from a special box in which they were kept the tablet was a framed piece of flat wood upon which a thick coating of wax had been laid down the stylus was a heavy iron rod with a sharpened tip of a circumference to comfortably fit a boys hand the wax had been written on only a few times then rubbed flat afterward for the next lesson write the name of the seven kings in order said his grandfather writing was a skill the romans had learned from the etruscans the etruscans had learned it from the people of magna graeciagreeks who in recent generations had colonized southern italy bringing with them the advantages of a culture more advanced and refined than those of the native italians writing especially had proven to be of great value records and lists could be kept royal proclamations and laws could be written down corrections and additions could be made to the calendar and messages could be sent from one place to another to master the skill required great diligence and it was best learned at an early age as a hereditary priest of hercules and as a member of the patrician classa descendent of one of romas founding familieswith the prospect of someday becoming a senator like his grandfather it was very much to young tituss advantage to learn to read and to write usually titus was very conscientious about forming letters but on this day he seemed unable to concentrate he kept making mistakes rubbing them clear then starting over repeatedly he looked toward the window his grandfather smiled to capture a boys imagination the making of letters in wax could not hope to compete with the construction of the new temple tituss fascination with the project was perhaps not a bad thing a knowledge of how such a building was made might serve him well someday he waited until titus had painstakingly written the s at the end of tarquinius then patted him on the head good enough he said your lessons are over for today you may go now titus looked up at him in surprise did i not tell you to go said his grandfather im a bit tired today being compared to that head discovered on the capitoline has made me feel my age smooth the wax put away your stylus and then be off and say hello to that fellow vulca for me the afternoon was warm and sunny with hours of daylight left titus ran all the way from his familys house on the palatine down to the forum then uphill again to the top of the capitoline he didnt stop until he reached the tarpeian rock the sheer summit from which traitors were hurled to their death the rock also provided a panoramic view of the city below his friend gnaeus marcius loved to play with miniature wooden soldiers pretending to be their commander titus preferred to gaze down at the city of roma as if its buildings were toys and to imagine rearranging them and constructing new ones roma had changed much since the days of romulus where once the seven hills had been covered by forests and pastures and the settlements had been small and scattered now there were buildings everywhere one looked built close together with dirt and gravel streets running between them some citizens still lived in thatched huts and kept animals in pens but many homes were now made of wood some rising to two stories and the houses of wealthy familiessuch as the potitiiwere grand affairs made of brick and stone with shuttered windows interior courtyards terraces and tile roofs the forum had become the civic center of roma with a paved street called the sacred way running through it it was the site of numerous temples and shrines and also of the senate house the marketplace beside the river was now called the forum bovarium from the word bovinus referring to its ancient and continuing role as a cattle market it had become the great emporium of central italy the original settlement at the foot of the capitoline including the ancestral hut of the potitii had long ago been cleared away and built over to make room for the expanding marketplace at the heart of the forum bovarium stood the ancient ara maxima where once a year titus and his family along with the pinarii celebrated the feast of hercules roma under the kings had prospered and grown now the grandest sign of the citys progress was rising on the summit of the capitoline turning his back on the panoramic view titus gazed up at the magnificent project which each day drew nearer to completion since his last visit to the site a new section of scaffolding had gone up along the front of the temple the workers on the top tier were applying plaster to the recessed surface of the pediment titus my friend i havent you seen for a while the speaker was a tall man with strands of gray in his beard about the age of tituss father there was plaster dust on his blue tunic he carried a stylus and a small wax tablet for making sketches vulca ive been very busy with my studies lately but my grandfather let me go early today excellent i have something very special to show you the man smiled and gestured for him to follow vulca was an etruscan famous all over italy as an architect and artist king tarquinius had employed him not only to oversee construction of the temple but to decorate it inside and out the building was made of common materialswood brick and plasterbut when vulca was done painting it would be dazzling yellow black and white for the walls and columns red for the capitals and the bases of the columns more red to trim the pediment and many shades of green and blue to highlight the small architectural details but the most impressive of vulcas creations would be the statues of the gods properly speaking the statues were not ornaments they would not decorate the temple but rather the temple would exist to house the sacred statues vulca had described his intentions to titus many times and had drawn sketches on his wax tablet to illustrate but titus had not yet seen them the terracotta statues were being made in great secrecy in a concealed workshop on the capitoline to which only vulca and his most skilled artisans had access titus was greatly surprised when the artist led him though a makeshift doorway into a walledoff area beside the temple and even more surprised when they rounded a corner and a statue of jupiter confronted them titus gasped the statue was of red terracotta not yet painted but the impression that the god was physically present was nonetheless overwhelming seated on a throne the bearded powerfully built father of gods looked down on him with a serene countenance jupiter was dressed in a toga much like the royal garment the king wore and in his right hand instead of a scepter he held a thunderbolt the toga will be painted purple with a border of gold foil vulca explained the thunderbolt will be gold as well the king balked when he learned the expense of the gold foil until i pointed out what a thunderbolt made from solid gold would cost him titus was awed magnificent he whispered i never imaginedi mean youve described to me what the statue would look like but in my imagination i could never reallyits soso much more his shook his head words failed him of course no one will ever see the god this close jupiter will be positioned on a suitably ornate pedestal at the back of the main chamber so as to gaze down on everyone who enters the other two will be placed in their own smaller chambers juno to the right and minerva to the left tearing his eyes from the jupiter titus saw the other two figures beyond these were not as far advanced the juno had not yet been given a head the minerva was little more than an armature that suggested the shape to come then his eyes fell on a sight even more fantastic than the jupiter his gasp of astonishment was so loud that vulca laughed the piece was huge and so complex that it boggled tituss imagination it was a largerthanlifesize statue of jupiter in a quadrigaa chariot pulled by four horses the standing jupiter holding his thunderbolt aloft was even more impressive than the jupiter enthroned the four horses each different were sculpted with remarkable detail from the flashing eyes and flaring nostrils to the muscular limbs and magnificent tails the chariot was made of wood and bronze like a real vehicle but of giant size with extravagant designs and decorations on every surface it all comes apart of course so that it can be reassembled atop the pediment explained vulca the horses will be painted whitefour magnificent snowwhite steeds worthy of the king of the gods the attachment of this sculpture to the pediment will be the final step in the construction once jupiter and the quadriga are firmly in place and fully painted the temple will be ready to be dedicated titus gaped vulca i cant believe youre showing me this who else has seen it only my workmen and the king of course since hes paying for it but why are you showing me vulca said something in etruscan then translated it into latin if the flea hangs around long enough sooner or later hell see the dogs balls when titus looked at him blankly vulca laughed thats a very old very vulgar etruscan saying young man of which your staid grandfather would doubtless disapprove how many times did i see you skulking about the work site before i called you over and asked your name and how many times have you been back since then and how many questions have you asked me about the tools and the materials and all the processes i dont think i can count that high i daresay theres not a man in all roma outside myself who knows this building better than you do titus potitius if i were to die tomorrow you could tell the workmen what remains to be done but you wont die vulca jupiter would never allow it nor would the king not until im done with his temple titus walked up to one of the horses and dared to touch it i never imagined they would be so big and so beautiful this will be the greatest temple ever built anywhere id like to think so said vulca abruptly titus gave a yelp he reached up to rub the spot where a pebble had struck his head he caught a glimpse of another stone descending on him from the sky and jumped aside from beyond the wall which hid the works in progress came the sound of boyish giggling vulca raised an eyebrow i believe that must be your two friends titus im afraid they are not invited to see the statues so if you want to join them youll have to step outside titus called one of the boys outside in a loud whisper what are you doing in there is that crazy old etruscan molesting you there was more giggling titus blushed vulca tousled the boys blond hair and smiled dont worry titus i long ago stopped taking offense at schoolboy taunts run along now and see what those two want from you reluctantly titus took his leave of vulca and made his way out of the enclosure from behind a stack of bricks his friends publius pinarius and gnaeus marcius staged a playful ambush one of them grabbing his arms while the other tickled him titus broke free the others chased him all the way to the tarpeian rock where they all came to an abrupt halt laughing hard and gasping for breath what was the etruscan showing you in there demanded gnaeus i think they were playing a game said publius the etruscan said ill show you my measuring rod if youll show me your fascinus he flicked his finger against the amulet at tituss neck not much of a game said gnaeus anyone can see tituss fascinus titus made a face and tucked the amulet inside his tunic out of sight you two arent worthy to look on the god anyway i am protested publius am i not your fellow priest of hercules and am i not as much a patrician as you last february did i not run beside you in the lupercalia whereas our friend gnaeus here gnaeus shot him an angry look publius had touched on a subject about which gnaeus was increasingly sensitive publius and titus were both of the patrician class descendents of the first senators whom romulus had called the fathers or patres of roma the patricians jealously guarded the ancient privileges of their class the rest of the citizenry rich and poor alike were simply the common people or plebeians plebeians could attain wealth through commerce and distinction on the battlefield they could even attain great powergnaeuss distant relative ancus marcius had become kingbut they could never claim the prestige which attached to the patricians to be sure gnaeuss mother was a patrician veturia came from a family almost as old as the potitii and the pinarii but his deceased father had been a plebeian and following the law of paterfamilias a son was assigned to the class of the father to titus and publius their friends plebeian status was of little consequence gnaeus was the best athlete the most skilled equestrian and the handsomest and smartest boy they knew but to gnaeus class mattered a great deal his father had died in battle when he was quite young and he identified more closely with his mother and her family veturia had raised him to be as proud as any patrician and it vexed him greatly that a patrician was the one thing he could never be perversely he had no sympathy with plebeians who argued that class distinctions should be erased gnaeus always took the patrician side and showed nothing but contempt for what he called upstart plebs gnaeus usually carried himself with aloof selfconfidence a trait which titus greatly admired his demeanor matched his haughty good looks but the irony of his class loyalty was the flaw in his armor publius who enjoyed getting a rise from him could not resist alluding now and then to gnaeuss plebeian status on this occasion gnaeus hardly blinked he fixed the other boy with a steely gaze very soon publius pinarius we three shall be of fighting age every roman fights it is the highest duty that roma demands of her citizens that they train every spring and go forth every summer in search of fresh booty but not every roman achieves the same degree of glory the poorer plebs with their rusty swords and ramshackle armor who must fight on foot because they cannot afford a horse have a hard time of it we can only pity them and expect little glory from their bloodshed but from men of property like ourselves who can afford the very best weapons and armor who have time to train and opportunity to master the fine art of horsemanship roma expects much more glory is what matters in this world only the greatest warrior attains the highest glory that is what i intend to become if only to make my mother proud of me the greatest warrior that roma has ever seen for now publius you can taunt me all you want because as yet were still only boys without glory but soon we will be men then the gods will see which of us can more proudly call himself a roman publius shook his head upstart pompous little pleb gnaeus turned and strode away his head held high titus reacted to gnaeuss speech much as he had when he beheld vulcas statue and gazing after his friend he muttered the same word magnificent publius looked at him sidelong and slapped the back of his head i think youre more in love with gnaeus than you are with your etruscan pederast publius had just learned this word greek in origin and enjoyed using it shut up publius that night tituss grandfather presided at a large family dinner which included tituss father and uncles and their families there were two guests as well a young cousin of king tarquinius named collatinus and his wife lucretia the women dined alongside the men but after the meal when a serving girl brought a pitcher of wine the women were offered no cups when collatinus made a toast to the health of the king the women merely observed he was a pleasantlooking young man with a cheerful disposition a bit loud and overbearing but not as arrogant as the sons of tarquinius his approachable manner was the chief reason the elder potitius had decided to cultivate a relationship with him thinking that collatinus might offer access to the king without the unpleasantness of dealing with the kings sons after the toast rather than taking only a sip collatinus drained his cup a most excellent wine he declared then smacked his lips and looked sidelong at his wife a pity you cant taste it my dear lucretia lowered her eyes and blushed in that moment the gaze of every man in the room was on her including that of titus who thought he had never seen another woman half as beautiful the blush only served to accentuate the perfection of her milky skin her hair was dark and lustrous and so long that it might never have been cut though she was modestly dressed in a longsleeved stola of dark blue wool the lines of the gown suggested a body of exquisite proportions as the blush subsided she smiled and looked up again tituss heart missed a beat when her green eyes briefly met his then lucretia looked at collatinus sometimes when you kiss me husband i receive a faint taste of wine from your lips that is enough for me collatinus grinned and reached for her hand lucretia lucretia what a woman you are he addressed the others it was a wise law of king romulus that forbade women to drink wine they say the greeks who live to the south let their women drink and it causes no end of strife there are even some here in roma who have grown lax and allow such a thing men of the very highest rank who should know better titus sensed that collatinus was referring to his royal cousins but no good can come of it and im glad to see that oldfashioned virtue and common sense is practiced by the potitii in keeping with your status as one of romas oldest families tituss grandfather nodded to acknowledge the compliment then suggested another toast to oldfashioned virtue collatinus drained his cup again titus being a boy was given wine mixed with water but collatinus drank his wine undiluted and was feeling its effects if virtue is to be toasted he said then a special toast should be drunk to the most virtuous among usmy wife lucretia there is no finer woman in all roma after the toast ill tell you a story to prove my point to lucretia to lucretia said titus she blushed and lowered her eyes again a few nights ago said collatinus i was at the house of my cousin sextus his two brothers were present as well so there we were all the kings sons and myself we were drinking perhaps a bit more than we should havethose tarquinius boys do everything in excessand a debate arose as to which of us had the most virtuous wife well i say a debate arose in fact perhaps it was i who brought up the subject and why not when a man is proud of a thing should he keep silent my wife lucretia i told them is the most virtuous of women no no they said their own wives were every bit as virtuous nonsense i said do you dare to make a wager on it the tarquinii cant resist a wager so one by one we paid a visit to our spouses we found sextuss wife off in her wing of the house playing a board game and gossiping with one of her servants not much virtue there off we went to the house of titus his wifeshe must be three times the size of lucretiawas lying on a dining couch eating one honey cake after another surrounded by a mountain of crumbs not much virtue in gluttony then we called on the wife of arruns i regret to tell you that we found her with some of her friends actually drinking wine when arruns pretended to be shocked she told him not to be silly and to pour her another cup clearly she does it all the time without the least fear of being punished it helps me sleep she said can you imagine then we called on lucretia the hour was growing late i assumed she might be asleep already but do you know what we found her doing she was sitting at her spinning wheel busily working while she sang a lullaby to our new baby who lay in his crib nearby i tell you there was never a prouder moment in my life not only did i win the wager but you should have seen the look on the faces of the tarquinius brothers when they saw lucretia shes always beautiful but sitting there at her wheel wearing a simple sleeveless white gown so as to leave her arms free with the glow of the lamplight on her face she took my breath away those tarquinius boys were so jealous you made me very proud my dear collatinus took his wifes hand and kissed it titus sighed imagining the sight of lucretia by lamplight with bare shoulders and arms but his grandfather frowned and shifted uneasily the old man quickly changed the subject and the talk turned to politics by cautious degrees the elder potitius sought to determine how candidly he could speak before collatinus as collatinus drank more wine it became evident that he was not overly fond of his cousin the king the aristocratic bent of his politics if not the specifics reminded titus of his haughty friend gnaeus marcius all this coddling of the plebs by the kingand not the better sort of plebs respectable people you or i might have to dinner but ordinary laborers and layabouts its not to my liking i can tell you said collatinus of course its very clever of the king to grind down the power of the senate even as he curries favor with the mob he prosecutes rich men confiscates their wealth then uses that wealth to build massive public works which gives employment to the rabble that monstrosity of a temple is the most obvious example he sends the bravest and boldest of the patricians into battle against romas neighbors the territory thats won is made into colonies where the landless plebs can settle the blood of romas finest warriors is spilled so that some beggar can be given his own turnip patch if hed become king the oldfashioned way by election then no one could complain they say the senators of old had to go down on their knees and beg king numa to take the job cousin tarquinius has senators begging him not to take their property even the wise numa needed the senate to advise him but not tarquinius he has a higher source of knowledge whenever theres a question about public policy whether its making war on a neighbor or fixing a crack in the cloaca maxima tarquinius whips out the sibylline books picks a verse at random reads it aloud in the forum and declares that its proof that the gods are on his side tarquinius the proud indeed my mouth is awfully dry could we have more wine perhaps youd rather drink some water suggested tituss grandfather i cant imagine why when you have such good wine in this house ah theres the serving girl by all means fill it to the brim excellent this tastes better than the last now what was i saying ah yesthe sibylline books well at least the king paid the sibyl for those fair and square even if he did get the bad end of the bargain usually he just takes whatever he wants even from members of his own family look what hes done to his nephew brutus people love brutus in whispers theyll tell you that he would have made a far better king than his uncle hes one of the few men tarquinius doesnt dare to destroy outright instead hes gradually stripped brutus of all his wealth bit by bit reducing him to a pauper yet brutus has endured every indignity without saying one word against his uncle the king people respect him all the more for showing so much fortitude and restraint collatinuss speech was slurred and his eyelids drooped he abruptly seemed to run out of energy tituss grandfather who felt that too much had already been said saw an opportunity to bring the evening to a close he began to rise but before he could wish his visitors farewell collatinus spoke again cousin tarquinius could take everything from me as well just as he took everything from brutus he could do it like that he snapped his fingers quick as a thunderbolt from jupiter ruinous as an earthquake sent by neptune i could lose everything except the one thingthank the godsthat the king and his sons can never take from me the most perfect and most precious of all my possessions my lucretia all though the evening she had listened to him patiently laughed softly at his jokes shown no embarrassment when he spoke too loudly and blushed sweetly when he complimented her now she graciously took his hand in hers and rose to her feet bringing him with her she had seen that it was time to go and effortlessly assisted her inebriated husband to make a graceful exit titus observing her thought that she must be very wise and very loving as well as beautiful a few days later titus with his friends publius and gnaeus sat on an outcropping of stone near the tarpeian rock watching the workers on the scaffolding that surrounded the new temple titus was explaining how the quadriga with jupiter would be hoisted atop the pedimentvulca had described the procedure to him at lengthwhen gnaeus abruptly interrupted gnaeus had a habit of changing the subject when he grew bored my mother says theres going to be a revolution what do you mean said publius who was also bored by tituss talk about the temple the days of king tarquinius are numbered thats what my mother says peopleat least the people who countare fed up with him theyll take his crown and give it to someone more worthy oh and i suppose tarquinius will humbly bow his head so that they can remove his crown publius snorted what does your mother know anyway shes just a woman my greatgrandfather says quite the opposite publius was proud of the fact that his greatgrandfather was still alive and had all his senses and was very much the paterfamilias of the pinarius family he says that tarquinius has cut the legs off of anyone who might have opposed himmen like his nephew brutusand wed better get used to the idea that one of his sons will take his place after hes gone there may be a tarquinius on the throne for as long as theres a pinarius tending the ara maximathats what my paterfamilias says how about your grandfather titus when youre not putting him to sleep with talk of temple construction what does the head of the potitii say about our beloved king titus didnt like to admit that his grandfather avoided talking to him directly about such serious matters while he had some idea of his grandfathers opinions he also knew that his grandfather wouldnt want him to discuss them openly with the loosetongued publius my grandfather would probably say that boys our age shouldnt indulge in dangerous gossip its only gossip when illinformed women like gnaeuss mother are talking when its men of affairs like ourselves its a serious discussion of politics said publius titus laughed and was about to say something scornful about publiuss inflated ego when gnaeus abruptly threw himself onto the other boy publius was no match for gnaeus especially when caught by surprise in the blink of an eye he was on his back on the ground his limbs flailing helplessly you will apologize for insulting my mother demanded gnaeus titus tried to pull him off but his friends arms were as unyielding as stone gnaeus let go of him how can he say anything while youre squeezing his throat gnaeus let go youll choke him to death titus was genuinely alarmed at the same time he couldnt help laughing publiuss face was as red as the kings toga and the sputtering noises he made sounded as though they should be coming out of the other end of his body titus laughed harder and harder until his sides ached gnaeus trying to keep a scowl on his face suddenly burst out laughing and lost his grip publius jerked free and rolled away he clutched his throat and glared at gnaeus between coughing and wheezing he managed a croak of protest youre mad gnaeus marcius you could have killed me i should have killed you for insulting my mother and impugning my honor your honor publius shook his head there should be a law forbidding a plebeian like you to even lay a finger on a patrician like me gnaeus did not fly at him but stood absolutely still his face turned crimson how dare you say such a thing to me how dare i call you a plebeian its what you are gnaeus marcius only a fool cant accept his fate thats what my paterfamilias says titus shook his head why was publius still taunting gnaeus did he want to be thrown from the tarpeian rock titus was wondering whether he should run to find help when he heard a noise from the city below whats that he said what publius kept a wary eye on gnaeus that sound dont you hear it like a great moan or a roar yes i hear it like the sound you hear from inside a seashell the noise distracted even gnaeus from his rage or a sob he said the sound of a great many women all sobbing at once he said somethings happened said titus its coming from the forum together they strode to the verge of the cliff and looked down the workers on the temple had also heard the noise men climbed from the scaffolding onto the roof of the temple to get a better view a great crowd had gathered in the forum more people were arriving from all directions a group of senators dressed in their togas stood on the porch of the senate house among them even at such a great distance titus recognized the kings gauntfaced nephew instead of a toga brutus wore a ragged tunic hardly fit for a beggara demonstration of the poverty to which the king had reduced him he was speaking to the crowd can you hear what hes saying said titus hes too far away and the crowds too noisy said gnaeus why wont they shut up those in the crowd nearest to the senate house were quiet and attentive and all turned in one direction listening to brutus it was the people at the back of the crowd who were moving about with their hands in the air shouting and weeping they were parting to make way for someone trying to pass through on his way to the senate house whos that man and whats he carrying said titus what man said publius hoarsely rubbing his throat i cant see who it is but i can see what hes carrying said gnaeus a woman hes carrying a woman in his arms shes completely limp people are stepping back to make way for him i think i see blood on his tunic i think the woman must be dead said titus who felt a cold hard knot in the pit of his stomach the man worked his way through the crowd step by step wherever he passed there was a commotion followed by an awestruck silence by the time he reached the steps of the senate house the entire crowd had fallen eerily silent staggering as if the burden he carried had become intolerably heavy he mounted the steps to the porch brutus and the senators bowed their heads and drew aside the man turned to face the crowd i knew it whispered titus its collatinus that means the woman in his arms the lifeless body was dressed in a longsleeved stola of dark blue stained with blood at the breast her head was thrown back hiding her face her dark hair hung straight down so long that it brushed her husbands feet brutus stepped forward now in the utter silence titus could hear him clearly tell them collatinus they wont believe me they dont want to believe such a terrible thing tell them whats happened collatinuss wrenching sob reverberated around the forum and sent a shiver through the crowd for a long moment he seemed unable to compose himself when he finally spoke his words rang loud and clear sextus tarquinius did this the kings son he raped my wife my beloved lucretia while i was away he came to my house he was welcomed as an honored guest invited to dine given a room in the middle of the night he came to her he forced his way into her bedour bed he held a dagger to her throatyou can see where the blade scored her flesh a servant heard her beg for mercy but one of sextuss men guarded the door the servant sent for me but by the time i arrived sextus was gone lucretia was weeping inconsolable mad with grief sextus left behind the knife he used to threaten her before i could stop her she plunged it into her heart she died in my arms as if the weight suddenly grew too heavy collatinus dropped to his knees still cradling the body in his arms he hung his head and wept brutus stepped forward and held up a bloody dagger this is the knife he cried the very blade that sextus tarquinius used when he raped lucretia the blade she used to kill herself he waited for the gasps from the crowd to die down how much longer will we stand for this what else will we allow the tyrant and his sons to take from us this intolerable state of affairs ends here and now today brutus held the knife high in the air and turned to face the capitoline as if he were addressing jupiter in the unfinished temple atop the hill to titus it seemed as if the sternlooking gauntfaced man had abruptly turned to look directly at him and his friends the sensation was unsettling and titus shivered by the innocent blood on this knife declared brutus and by the gods i swear that with fire and sword and whatever else can lend strength to my arm i will pursue tarquinius the proud his wicked wife and all his children not one of whom deserves to live in the company of decent men much less rule over them i will drive them out and never again will i let them or any other man be king in roma the crowd erupted in a tumult of shouting women tore at their hair men shook their fists a mob surged up the steps of the senate house and lifted brutus onto their shoulders he seemed to float above the crowd his arm upraised to thrust the bloody knife toward heaven even from the safety of the capitoline titus felt a prickle of fear he had never seen such a spectacle the fury of the mob was like a force of nature unleashed his heart pounded in his chest his mouth was too dry to speak what do you think he meant by that said gnaeus his voice seemed impossibly calm he couldnt have said it more plainly said publius his voice breaking brutus means to drive tarquinius out of roma yes and then what publius snorted with exasperation brutus will take his place of course no publius thats not what he said never again will i let them or any other man be king in roma brutus means to cast out the king and put no one in his place publius frowned but if theres no king who will rule the city like his friends titus was puzzled he was frightened and exhilarated all at once and struck dumb with grief that lucretiabeautiful wise loving lucretiashould have suffered such a horrible fate he was overwhelmed by what he had just witnessed something had ended that day and something else had begun and all their lives would be changed forever bc dressed in his priestly robes and proudly wearing the talisman of fascinusfor today he was present both in his ancestral role as a priest of hercules and as the scion of the potitiititus stood between his father and grandfather in the front ranks of the crowd that had gathered on the capitoline before the new temple of jupiter the pinarii were there as well in a place of equal honor publiuss greatgrandfather was looking very frail and more than a little confused but whose head was not in a spin after the tumultuous events of the last year the occasion was the dedication of the temple up to the last minute vulca had been frantically putting finishing touches here and theredaubing paint on the scuffed elbow of minerva polishing the great bronze hinges of the doors instructing his men to move the throne of jupiter a fingers width to the left because the statue was not precisely centered atop its pedestal it did not matter that vulca still perceived tiny imperfections everywhere to titus there had never been anything as beautiful as the temple it was truly worthy of its commanding position atop the capitoline which made it the most prominent building in all of roma dominating the skyline from every vantage point with the scaffolding gone at last titus could fully appreciate the perfection of its proportions and the soaring line of the columns that supported the pediment atop the pediment the statue of jupiter in his chariot drawn by four white horses majestically evoked the supreme king of gods and men the temple was a thing of earthly beauty that inspired religious awe standing side by side on the porch of the temple overseeing the dedication were the two consuls brutus and collatinus though his face was as gaunt as ever brutus no longer dressed in beggars rags like collatinus he wore a toga with a purple stripe to denote his status as one of the two highest magistrates of the new republic republicthe word was still new to titus and fell strangely on his ear it came from the words res a thing circumstance state of being and publica of the people res publica the peoples state in the wake of tarquiniuss sudden downfall and departurethe uprising had been so overwhelming that the revolution occurred almost without bloodshedthe leading men of the senate had decided to run the state themselves without a king the common people had loudly insisted they must be given an assembly of their own and laws to protect them because the favor of the king had been their only bulwark against the whims of wealthy powerful patricians rules rules rules complained tituss grandfather after attending the first raucous meetings of the new government when no man is king every man is king and thinks he should have his own way or at least his own say the result is chaos endless arguments and no agreement about anything except that there must be new rules to override any old rules that were previously agreed upon no one is satisfied everyone thinks everyone else is getting a better deal its almost enough to make a man nostalgic for the one we called proud despite all the problems that plagued the new state this was a day of celebration the dedication of the new temple which was to have been king tarquiniuss crowning achievement would serve instead to mark the first year of the new republic indeed to titus the magnificence of vulcas brightly painted statues and the breathless perfection of his architecture exemplified a bold new spirit in the city of roma to a visitor it might have appeared that the two magistrates on the porch of the temple were corulers little different from kings their dress set them apart from and above the rest and like kings they were guarded by lictors armed with rods and axes even the fact that they had been elected to office did not differentiate them from kings for all the kings of roma except tarquinius had been elected to the post even if some had been more freely chosen than others but the two consuls ruling side by side so that one might serve as a check on the other were to serve for only a year and then to relinquish their office to the next two consuls to win election by dividing the powers of the consuls and holding annual elections it was hoped that the state could be made to serve the people and that roma would never again fall under the sway of a tyrant like tarquinius the public ceremony came to an end the great doors of the temple were opened the consuls entered followed by a very select group of citizens for the sanctuary could accommodate only a small portion of the crowd tituss grandfather was among them as was the greatgrandfather of publius who ascended the steps with difficulty leaning upon the arm of his fellow senior priest of hercules titus was not permitted to attend the more exclusive ceremony within the sanctuary but thanks to vulca he had already seen the finished chambers which housed the statues of jupiter juno and minerva and been allowed to gaze upon the gods at his leisure the milling throng began to disperse there was a joyous mood in the air men greeted one another with embraces and laughter titus felt inspired and uplifted when he saw gnaeus nearby his spirits rose even more until publius muttered into his ear look there its your plebeian friend gnaeus marcius how did he get so near the front of the crowd he must be posing as a veturius today pretending his mothers blood makes him one of us shut up publius say nothing to insult him deliberately causing dissension on such a day shows disrespect to jupiter publius laughed by all the gods i should hate to offend your religious sensibilities titus ill simply move along then greet the pompous little pleb in whatever fashion you imagine would please jupiter after publius disappeared titus called to gnaeus who returned his smile you were right all along about vulca and the temple said gnaeus foreigner or not hes given us a truly magnificent building something all roma can be proud of i look forward to seeing the statues inside titus merely nodded to publius he proudly would have boasted that he had seen the statues already but gnaeus might think he was acting superior and take offense gnaeuss smile faded you were standing closer to the consuls than i was did brutus look rather haggard perhaps my grandfather says theres a rumor that hes unwell if it were only that what do you mean gnaeus took tituss arm and pulled him away from the crowd he spoke in a low voice have you not heard the rumors about brutuss sons the consuls two sons were a few years older than titus who knew them just well enough to greet them by name when he saw them in the forum rumors gnaeus shook his head just because your grandfather still treats you like a boy doesnt mean you have to think like a boy titus were too old for that the times are too dangerous you need to take a greater interest in whats going on around you titus smiled crookedly and fingered the talisman of fascinus at his throat all i really care about is learning to be a builder like vulca you should leave such matters to hired artisans men like us were born to be warriors but temples bring us closer to the gods building a temple is as important as winning a battle gnaeus snorted i wont even reply to that but we were talking about brutus and his sons since you seem unaware of the situation ill inform you this precarious state of affairsthis socalled republicis hanging by a thread our neighbors are making alliances to wage war against us without a king they think were weak and theyre right all this strife and bickering has sapped our strength the worthless rabble of the city was placated for a while after the usurpers allowed them to plunder the tarquinius family estatesshame on brutus and collatinus for permitting such an outragebut now the mob is growing suspicious of the new magistrates and they think their own assembly should take the place of the senate may the gods help roma if that should happen and now he lowered his voice even further now theres a plot to restore the king to the throne some of the most respected men in roma are involved titus drew a sharp breath is such a thing possible not without a great deal of bloodshed but yes its possible as long as tarquinius and his sons are alive theyll never stop scheming to take back the throne i know i wouldnt but who would help them to do such a thing after what sextus tarquinius did to lucretia what of it a man raped another mans wife not for the first time and not for the last it was a crime to be surebut not a reason to abolish the whole system of kingship that made roma a strong city dont forget it was a king who gave us that temple youre so proud of the enemies of tarquinius merely used the rape as a means to stir up anger against the king so that they could take his place titus felt a prickle of dread gnaeus youre not involved in this plot to bring back the king are you gnaeus answer me gnaeus affected an aloof mysterious expression and titus could see that his friend was enjoying his consternation no i am not he finally said but nor am i completely unsympathetic to those who think roma was better with a king but gnaeus even for one such as you titus realized he must speak carefully so as not to offend his friend at the same time he wanted to show that he was not as ignorant of politics as gnaeus seemed to think collatinus is a patrician but brutus isnt his mother was the kings sister but his father was a plebeian by winning election to the consulship these two have set a precedent for the future in the republic any man of worthpatrician or plebeianwill have a chance to rule the state gnaeus snorted for a year what good is that titus pressed on new men have been added to the senate as well tarquinius killed off so many senators that brutus and collatinus are nominating new members every day to bring the number back to three hundred not only patricians but plebeians as well even worse is that the best a man can hope for to become one of three hundred titus frowned genuinely puzzled gnaeus i think you miss the point he could not help but imagine how bluntly publius would have stated the case there may be a place for you yet in the new republic gnaeus even though youre just a lowly plebeian no titus you miss the point this republic this government by the peoplewhat can it offer a man except the chance to become a mere senator one of three hundred or at best a consul the first among equals and one of a pair at that elected for only a year so long as roma had a king there was hope there was something a man could strive for i dont understand hope titus an ambitious man a great man a fierce warriora man head and shoulders above all other mensuch a man in the old days might hope someday to occupy the throne to become a true ruler of men to be king of roma but now with the monarchy gone replaced by this pathetic republic what hope remains for such a man titus gazed at his friend fascinated and appalled had gnaeus truly imagined that he might someday be king of roma where had such unbridled ambition come from was it to be feared or admired he almost wished that publius were present to deflate gnaeuss fantastical notions with a snide comment titus shook his head how did we come to speak of such things you were going to tell me something about brutusand his sons never mind said gnaeus he hid his face but in his voice titus heard all the anger pain and exasperation of a youth whose dreams are understood by no one else not even his closest friend gnaeus strode away without another word just as his grandfather had stressed to titus the importance of mastering letters so too had brutus made sure that his two sons could read and write it was this ability that doomed them the younger brother of brutuss wife was deep in the plot to restore the king it was this man vitellius who convinced his nephews to join the conspiracy with promises that they would be greatly rewarded in the second reign of tarquinius secret envoys carried messages back and forth between the king and the conspirators as the date for tarquiniuss planned return grew closera day that would turn the forum into a lake of bloodthe nervous king pressed for greater assurances from his supporters he demanded letters of express intent with explicit pledges of loyalty signed by their own hands the two sons of brutus titus and tiberius signed such a letter and placed it into the hands of a slave owned by their uncle vitellius the slave had been bribed by brutus to keep him informed of the plot brutus knew that his brotherinlaw was involved having no love for vitellius he was determined to expose him brutus did not know of the involvement of his own sons if he could produce proof of the conspiracy the slave had been promised freedom and all the rights of citizenship in the new republic with mingled dread and excitement he strode into the presence of the two consuls to deliver the letters with which he had been entrusted how many said brutus twenty letters said the slave signed by twentyone men brutus frowned one of the letters bears two names yes consul one by one brutus took the letters and read them then passed them to collatinus some of the names came as no surprise to brutus others shocked him acutely conscious of the gravity of the moment he kept all expression from his face the slave averted his eyes when he handed brutus the last letter the consul stared at it for a such a long time maintaining such an unnaturally rigid posture that collatinus waiting for the letter to be passed to him wondered if brutus had been stricken by some form of paralysis growing impatient he took the letter from brutuss hands when he saw the two names upon it he let out a gasp still brutus showed no reaction his voice was devoid of emotion we have their names now we have proof of their guilt we know where all these men reside we must send our lictors to apprehend them as quickly as possible so that none can warn the others and then said collatinus in a whisper there is no need for a trial the senate has entrusted us with emergency powers to deal with just such a circumstance we will act swiftly and surely to save the republic the next day the citizens were called to assemble on the field of mars where the consuls took their seats upon a raised platform the condemned men were brought before them they had been stripped of all clothing they were all young and all from respectable families from a distance they might have appeared to be naked athletes parading before the crowd in the circus maximus except for the fact that athletes would wave to the crowd and these men had their hands bound behind them all eyes were on the sons of brutus if they had learned nothing else from their father they had learned composure while some of the conspirators shouted curses or begged for mercy or wept or struggled against the lictors titus and tiberius stood rigidly upright with their mouths shut and their eyes straight ahead thick tree trunks had been laid in a continuous row before the tribunal the prisoners were made to stand side by side before the trunks then to kneel in the sand and to lean forward until their chests rested upon the wood a long rope was wound once around each mans neck linking them all together the slack portions of rope between each man were secured by iron cleats hammered into the ground thus the prisoners were restrained and made ready for punishment first they were flogged the lictors took their time the sons of brutus and their uncle vitellius were beaten no more and no less than the others the flogging continued until the sand was red with blood some of the prisoners fainted they were doused with water to revive them had the prisoners been the captured warriors of another city or common criminals or rebellious slaves the crowd would have jeered and laughed as it was there was hardly a noise to be heard except here and there the sound of muffled weeping from men who hid their faces and could not bear to watch most in the crowd did their best to emulate brutus who sat in his chair of state as rigid as a statue and observed the punishment of the traitors without flinching one by one the prisoners were beheaded the lictors shared the duty passing the axe from man to man wiping it free of blood and gore before using it again the sons of brutus were near the middle of the line side by side when the lictors came to titus ten men had already been executed their heads lay where they had fallen on the sand in pools of blood that poured from their severed necks some of the men farther up the line were weeping some in fits of panic were struggling frantically against their bonds some had lost control of their bowels and their bladders the stench of urine and feces was added to the odor of blood vitellius who was at the very end of the line had begun to scream incessantly one of the lictors unable to stand the noise gagged his mouth with a bloody rag the axe was passed the lictor wiped the blade raised it in the air and brought it down on the neck of titus tiberius who kept his eyes tightly shut was beheaded next nine more prisoners remained the lictors continued with their work gazing down from the tribunal the face of brutus was no less impassive after his sons execution than it had been before the citizens in the crowd looked at him in awe when his turn arrived vitellius managed to spit the gag from his mouth and began to scream again the axe rose and fell his screaming abruptly stopped the field of mars was utterly silent collatinus stood his bearing was stiff only by the repeated clenching and unclenching of his fists did he betray his agitation next to him brutus rose from his chair for a brief instant he appeared to falter as one the crowd drew a sharp breath fearful that his legs would give way beneath him collatinus instinctively reached out to grasp his fellow consuls arm but stopped short of touching him and drew back his hand collatinus spoke to him in a low voice he was offering to perform a duty which previously they had agreed would fall to brutus brutus shook his head declining the offer he extended his right arm one of the lictors delivered a staff into his open hand vindicius come forward brutus cried the slave who had exposed his master vitellius and the other conspirators approached the tribunal brutus looked down at him for your role in saving the republic from its enemies a reward was promised to you vindicius in the brief life of our republic never before has a slave become a citizen you shall be the first by the touch of this staff i grant you the rights duties and privileges of a free man of roma vindicius bowed his head brutus touched the crown of his head with the staff brutuss voice raised to orators pitch had a shrill edge but it did not break let it be seen that a slave can become a citizen by serving the republic and let it be seen that any citizen who betrays the republic will be shown no mercy all the men executed here today were guilty of treason they betrayed their city and their fellow citizens some of them were guilty of another crime they betrayed their father disloyalty to father or to fatherlandfor either crime there can be only one punishment which you saw carried out today this we have done upon the field of mars with nothing to hide us from the eye of heaven let the gods pay witness by their continuing favor let them affirm that what we have done was well and rightly done brutus stepped down from the tribunal his head held high his gait was steady but he leaned heavily upon the staff in his right hand never before had he needed a staff to help him walk never again would he be able to walk without it among those in the front of the crowd watching the consuls departure were titus potitius and gnaeus marcius titus thanks to his familys status was used to being at the front of any assembly on this day he might have wished to be anywhere else several times especially during the beheadings he had grown faint and nauseated but with his grandfather standing close by he had not dared to look away his friend gnaeus who was used to being further back in any crowd had on this occasion pleaded with titus to allow him a place beside him so that he could have the best possible view of the proceedings when titus had grown weak he had touched fascinus with one hand and with the other had reached like a child for gnaeuss hand gnaeus though it made him feel slightly foolish had held his friends hand without protesting he owed his place at the front of the crowd to titus after all gnaeus was not squeamish the sight of so much blood had not sickened him nor had he felt pity for the prisoners they had taken a terrible risk knowing the possible consequences had they succeeded they would have shown no more mercy to their victims than had been shown to them about brutus gnaeus was not sure what to think the man had a will of iron if any mortal was worthy to be a king it must be brutus and yet the man had no interest in claiming the throne his hatred of monarchy seemed to be entirely genuine brutus had invested all his hopes and dreams in the curious notion of res publica the peoples state res publica had claimed his own sons and had demanded that he carry out the punishment himself even a god who required such a cruel sacrifice might find himself spurned yet brutus still worshiped res publica gnaeus had seen the birth of a new world one in which patriots not kings held sway the world had changed but gnaeus had not he was still determined to be first among men held in esteem above all others how this might be accomplished in the new world he did not know but he had faith in his destiny time and the gods would show him the way bc the arrival of attus clausus in roma was an occasion of great pomp and celebration all concerned recognized that it was a momentous event though none could have realized just how farreaching its effects would be the first five years of the new republic had been marked by many setbacks and challenges enemies from within had conspired to restore the king enemies from without had sought to conquer and subjugate the city the citizens roiled with discontent as power shifted from one faction to another in a relentless contest of wills among the external enemies of the city were the sabine tribes to the south and east who had long been unified in their hostility to roma when one of their leaders attus clausus began to argue for peace between the sabines and roma his fellow warlords turned against him and clausus found himself in imminent danger he made an urgent request to the senate that he should be allowed to emigrate to roma along with a small army of warriors and their families the senate debated the issue and empowered the consuls to negotiate with clausus in return for a substantial contribution to the exhausted state treasury and the induction of his warriors into the roman ranks clausus was welcomed to roma his dependents were promised land on the anio river and clausus himself was enlisted among the patricians and given a seat in the senate on the day of his arrival a great crowd of wellwishers thronged the forum and cheered him as he strolled up the sacred way with his family flower petals were strewn in their path horns and pipes played the festive melody of an old song about romulus his acquisition of the sabine brides and its happy result the procession reached the senate house while his wife and children remained at the foot of the steps clausus ascended to the porch as usual titus potitius stood near the front of the crowd where he was able to get a good look at the famous sabine warlord he was impressed by the mans distinguished bearing and his regal mane of black hair shot with silver tituss grandfather stood among the magistrates and senators on the porch who welcomed clausus and presented him with a senatorial toga the sabine tunic clausus wore was a splendid green garment with sumptuous gold embroidery but he made a show of goodnaturedly raising his arms and allowing the toga to be wrapped around him and properly draped he wore it well and looked as if he had been born to the roman senate speeches followed tituss attention began to wander and he found himself studying the members of the clausus family who were positioned nearby the new senators wife was a striking woman and their children were the offspring of two very goodlooking parents one of the daughters in particular caught tituss eye she was a dark beauty with a long nose sensual lips and flashing green eyes titus was unable to look away she felt his eyes upon her and returned his gaze appraising him for a long moment before she smiled and looked away up on the porch her father had begun to speak tituss heart was stirred as it had not been stirred since he first saw the doomed lucretia clausus spoke latin with a charming sabine accent he expressed gratitude to the senate of romamaking no mention of the common people titus noticedand he promised to continue his efforts to convince the other sabine leaders that a peace accord should be struck with roma but if they cannot be pacified in the counsel chamber then they shall have to be crushed on the battlefield and in that endeavor i shall do my part the sabine warriors i brought with me are now proud roman warriors just as i am now a proud roman senator indeed even as i put on this toga i put aside my sabine name this morning i awoke as attus clausus but as of this moment i declare myself appius claudius i think the name suits me just as this toga suits me he smiled and slowly turned around to show off his new garment eliciting applause and friendly laughter the crowd loved him titus too felt a surge of love and also of hope for now he knew what to call the object of his desire the daughter of any man named claudius would bear the name claudia claudia he thought i am in love with the most beautiful girl in the world and her name is claudia according to appius claudius he will leave the decision to the girl herself what a strange character that man is yes grandfather said titus nodding nervously and and what what was her decision by hercules young man i have no idea i spent the whole visit talking to her father i didnt even see the girl if shes anything like your grandmother she wont make up her mind on the spot give her time to think it over in the days following their arrival in roma appius claudius and his family had been invited to the homes of all the citys foremost families among their first hosts had been the potitii for titus had encouraged his grandfather to invite them to dinner as soon as possible titus had seized the chance to meet claudia and managed to speak to her privately for a few moments she proved to be more fascinating than he could have imagined her voice was like music and the words she uttered took him into a realm of magic claudius whom the romans were beginning to consider a bit eccentric as they got to know him had seen to the education of his daughters as well as his sons claudia could actually read and write and when titus mentioned his interest in architecture she spoke of how impressed she was by the great temple of jupiter atop the capitoline imagine that grandfather titus had said afterward a female who can read and write such a woman might be a great helpmate to her husband or a positive menace a wife who could read her husbands private papers what a dreadful idea but what are you saying titus do you want this girl for your wife so had begun tituss courtship of claudia he was allowed to see her on a few more occasions always with claudias maidservant present to act as chaperone his enchantment with her grew with each brief visit the marriage negotiations had been conducted mostly by the patresfamilias of the two households tituss grandfather sent inquiries to appius claudius who responded with a positive reply a marriage bond would offer advantages to both families claudius was immensely wealthy his daughter would bring a considerable dowry and the potitii were in need of an infusion of wealth they in turn were one of romas oldest and most distinguished families a marriage union with a potitius would grant the claudii instant legitimacy among the patricians of the city the marriage negotiations went very well until the day tituss grandfather came home with unsettling news titus was not the only suitor interested in young claudia who else demanded titus whoever he is i shalli shall he was not certain what he would do but he felt a wave of aggression such as he had never experienced its your friend publius pinarius said his grandfather can you imagine that apparently publius saw the girl that first day before the senate house just as you did and the pinarii had the claudii to dinner the very day after we did publius has been courting the girl ever since just as assiduously as you have this puts appius claudius in a bit of a spot he arguesand i cannot deny itthat there is very little to distinguish the potitii and the pinarii when it comes to a good match for his household our bloodlines are equally ancient equally distinguished in the history of the city except that the pinarii came late to the feast of hercules his grandfather laughed yes there is that but i dont think a blunder made a few hundred years ago is enough to tip the scales in our favor with all things being equal between you and publius claudius says he shall leave the decision to the girl herself when will she decide my dear boy as ive already told you i have no idea i didnt give the man a deadline perhaps you should have i dont think i can stand the waiting this is worse than the first time i went into battle at least then i felt it was all up to me whether i made a good showing of myself or not but this is terrible ive done all i can and now all i can do is wait im totally at her mercy titus began to pace they were in the small garden in the courtyard at the center of the house rose bushes stood at each corner of the garden titus paced from one to the other taking no notice of the blooms or their scent his grandfather shook his head and smiled recalling vaguely what it had been like to feel the passionate longings of a young man not yet married fretting will accomplish nothing he said perhaps you should a slave approached and announced that a visitor was at the door the old man raised an eyebrow this could be our answer claudius said he would send a messenger as soon as the girl made her decision its not a messenger said the slave its the young lady whos visited before claudia titus suddenly short of breath strode past the slave a short hallway led to the vestibule at the front of the house from the open skylight above a beam of midday sunlight lit the impluvium the little pool for catching rainwater flashes of reflected light danced across claudia and her chaperone youve come titus said striding past the maidservant and daring to take the girls hands in his own claudia lowered her eyes yes i had to send my regrets tituss heart sank to publius pinarius my fathers messenger should be at his door now but to you i wanted to come myself so that i could say to you yes i will be your wife titus potitius titus threw back his head and laughed then took her in his arms the maidservant discreetly turned her face away but tituss grandfather from the shadows watched the young couples first kiss with a smile of satisfaction at having conducted the marriage negotiations so successfully he only hoped that young publius pinarius would not take his rejection too bitterly the marriage ceremonies of most romans were simple family affairs without religious rites many couples entered into matrimony with hardly any ceremony at all a man and woman needed only to state that they were married and to live together for their union to be recognized the marriage of two patricians was another matter first tituss grandfather took the auspices to determine a favorable day for the ceremony because the bride would need to perform certain religious rites in her new household on the day after her marriage various days of the calendar with conflicting religious rites were immediately excluded from consideration likewise from long tradition the entire months of februarius and maius were thought to be inauspicious upon the ara maxima tituss grandfather placed a parchment on which he had written five possible dates one by one he placed a stone upon each date watched the flight of birds in the sky for signs of heavens favor and determined the most auspicious day for the ceremony this was the first roman wedding in the family of appius claudius and he was determined to observe all the local traditions when he inquired about the origins of each custom the romans could explain some but not others which had been handed down from a time beyond memory on the appointed day at sundown the wedding party departed from the house of appius claudius the procession was led by the youngest boy in the householdclaudias little brotherwho carried a pine torch lit from the familys hearthfire its flame would be added to the hearthfire of the bridegroom when they arrived at the house of titus potitius following the torchbearer was a vestal virgin wearing the linen vestments of her order with a narrow headband of twined red and white wool tied around her closely shorn hair she carried a cake made from consecrated grain and sprinkled with holy salt a few bites would be taken by the couple during the ceremony after which the cake would be shared with their guests next came the bride claudias veil was bright yellow as were her shoes her long white robe was cinched at the waist with a purple sash tied at the back in a special configuration called the hercules knot later it would be the bridegrooms privilege and challenge to untie the knot in her hands she carried the implements of spinning a distaff and a spindle with wool flanking her making a show of offering support to her arms were two of the brides cousins little boys hardly older than the torchbearer at first these escorts took their duty very seriously and set out with somber expressions but when the torchbearer stumbled they broke into giggles so infectious that even the vestal virgin began to laugh following the bride were her mother and father and the rest of the bridal party who sang a very old roman wedding song called tallasius the foreignborn claudii had to learn this song from scratch but the words were charmingly appropriate considering the circumstances when the sabine women were taken by romulus and his men the most beautiful of the women was captured by the henchmen of a certain tallasius a loyal lieutenant of the king who had observed and selected her in advance as she was carried off the sabine woman begged to know where the men were taking her and so the song went where do you take me to tallasius the dutiful why do you take me because he thinks youre beautiful what will my fate be to marry him to be his mate what god will save me all the gods have blessed this date the wedding party arrived at the home of titus potitius before the house under the open sky by the light of tapers soaked in wax a sheep was sacrificed upon an altar and skinned its pelt was thrown over two chairs upon which the bride and groom sat the auspices were taken and declared to be good the gods were called upon to bless the union still carrying her distaff and spindle claudia rose from her chair and was escorted by her mother to the door of the house which was decorated with garlands and flowers her mother embraced her miming an attack titus stepped forward and pulled his bride from her mothers arms this was another echo of the abduction of the sabines as was what came next titus blushing furiously picked her up kicked open the door and carried her like a captive over the threshold claudias mother wept her father fought back tears with laughter the wedding party cheered and applauded inside the house titus set claudia down on a sheepskin rug she put aside her distaff and spindle he handed her the keys to the house and asked with breathless excitement who is this newcomer in my house claudia answered as the ancient ritual prescribed when and where you are titus then and there i shall be titia thus the bride gave herself a first name the feminine form of her husbands first namesomething that did not exist for women in the world at large and would only ever be used in private between the two of them the wedding banquet was mostly a family affair but certain close friends of the bride and groom were invited titus had thought long and hard about whether to invite publius pinarius in the end he had taken his grandfathers advice and had done so and as his grandfather had predicted publius had spared everyone from embarrassment by sending his regrets saying he could not attend because his family would be visiting relatives in the countryside gnaeus marcius however did accept tituss invitation he had recently become betrothed himself to a plebeian girl named volumnia if he was disappointed not to have arranged a marriage with a patrician girl he did not admit it his demeanor was as haughty as ever if anything his selfassurance had increased bolstered by his first forays into battle as yet gnaeus was still some distance from achieving his lofty goalto become the greatest warrior that roma had ever seenbut he had made a good start coming to the attention of his commanders by repeatedly proving his bravery in combat busy accepting the good wishes of all the other guests titus was able to pay only passing attention to gnaeus he worried that his friend might feel a bit out of place amid so many claudii and potitii or given his sensitivities might experience a bit of envy perhaps even resentment at seeing the trappings of the patrician wedding he himself would never experience then titus saw across the crowd that gnaeus was deep in conversation with appius claudius the two of them looked very serious one moment burst out laughing the next then returned to their sober discussion what were they talking about titus worked his way across the crowd until he was close enough to overhear and yet claudius was saying its my understanding that even before the coming of the republic there was considerable friction between the best families and the common people it seems unfair to blame brutus for stirring a hornets next his intention surely was to spread the powers which tarquinius hoarded to himself among the senators so that all the best men could take a turn at the rudder so to speak the revolution that brutus began still continues and could veer out of control at any moment said gnaeus revolutions begin at the top then work their way down the trick is to arrest the process before the worst people kill the best and gain control but the republic appears to be working said claudius its true and perhaps unfortunate that even the lowliest citizens are allowed to vote for the magistrates on the other hand only the best men are eligible to run for office and citizens vote not as individuals but in tribal units and those votes are weighted the units which include the best families and their dependents count for much more than those of the rabble it seems a reasonable system perhaps if the common people would be satisfied with it but have you listened to the rabblerousers in the forum they say the debts of the poor should be forgiven can you imagine the chaos if that should happen they say the plebeians must be allowed to elect their own magistrates to protect them from the patricians they want two governments instead of one they say the common people should consider seceding from the city altogethergo off and found their own city and leave roma to fend for herself against her enemies thats traitors talk serious matters indeed said claudius thank the gods that roma has clearheaded young men such as yourself gnaeus marcius who can recognize that some beasts were born to pull a plow and others to guide it and thank the gods appius claudius that a man as wise and honorable as you has chosen to join his destiny with that of our beloved roma titus smiled and moved away pleased but not entirely surprised that his aristocratic fatherinlaw and his elitist best friend had each found a kindred spirit in the other bc the slave entered his masters study bearing a large rolled parchment he cleared his throat excuse me senator i believe these were the plans you requested titus potitius who stood bent over a table studying a similar parchment by the bright sunlight from the window looked up and nodded absently what oh yes the plans for the temple of jupiter on the capitoline ive been wanting to see vulcas old drawings they may help me solve a problem ive encountered with the design of the new temple of ceres put the scroll there in that corner ill look at it later the slave obeyed then returned to titus and cleared his throat again yes is there something else you asked me to remind you master when the time for the triumph drew near of course ive been so busy i entirely forgot i mustnt be late i daresay old cominius wouldnt care whether i showed up or not but gnaeus would never forgive me if i wasnt present to witness his moment of glory go fetch my toga and help me put it on an hour later titus stood among his colleagues on the steps of the senate house his grandfather had died not long after tituss marriage his father had died three years ago now at the age of twentynine titus was paterfamilias of the family and one of the youngest members of the senate as always throughout his life his pedigree gave him claim to a place of honorin this case on one of the upper steps that afforded a splendid view on the step above titus stood his fatherinlaw appius claudius who had risen to great prominence in the senate only the consuls and the other magistrates stood higher on the porch of the building on the step below stood his old friend publius pinarius across from the senate house tituss son stood in the very spot where he had stood as a boy at the front of the crowd of patricians who had gathered to watch the triumphal procession on the sacred way the occasion for the triumph was the successful conclusion of a war against a people called the volsci south of roma the consul postumius cominius had led the campaign in short order his troops had seized the volscian cities of antium longula polusca and the greatest prize of all corioli a grateful senate had enthusiastically voted to award cominius a triumph an honor once given exclusively by the kings to themselves but which now was granted by the senate to those consuls who achieved a great military victory titus heard the shrill piping of flutes playing a military air surrounded by the musicians a white ox led the parade it would later be sacrificed along with a portion of the spoils of battle on an altar before the temple of jupiter atop the capitoline following the ox came the volscian warriors who had been captured in battle they had been stripped of their armor and were dressed in rags filthy and unkempt they shuffled forward in shackles hanging their heads the crowd laughed and jeered at them boys threw pebbles to make them flinch a grizzled toothless roman soldier stepped from the crowd to spit on them at the conclusion of the triumph having served their purpose as ornaments the luckiest of the prisoners might be returned to their families if an adequate ransom had been offered the others would be sold into slavery next came the elite prisoners those who had been the chief men of the captured cities for them neither freedom nor slavery waited while the priests sacrificed the ox to jupiter these prisoners would be lowered into the tullianum the prison cell at the foot of the capitoline and strangled by executioners according to the priests offerings were more pleasing to the god when accompanied by the death of those who had been the leaders of romas enemies next came the spoils of battle the captured arms and insignia of the voscians as well as wagons full of coins jewels and fine objects including vases and etched silver mirrorsall the portable items of value that had been seized when the fallen cities were sacked greatest of all was the booty of corioli where the wealthiest of the volsci had lived in great luxury after the spoils of war came the generals lictors wearing red tunics marching in single file with their axes raised high shouting the latin victory chant io triumphe io triumphe io triumphe the general himself followed in a chariot pulled by four horses and decorated with bronze plates embossed with images of winged victories watching the chariot approach titus smiled he could hear in his head the lecturing voice of his grandfather romulus walked up the sacred way for his triumphs his feet were good enough for him this business of riding in a quadriga began only with the elder tarquinius the clatter of the horses hooves was added to the chant of the lictors then both were drowned by roar of the crowd cominius was dressed a tunic sewn with flowers and a goldembroidered robe on his head he wore a laurel crown in his right hand he carried a laurel bough and in his left a scepter surmounted by an eagle his youngest son rode beside him in the chariot and handled the reins in commemoration of the enemy blood spilled under his command the hands and face of cominius were stained bright red with cinnabar he raised his scepter in salutation to the senators who saluted back following the general marched the soldiers who had fought under him at their head in a place of honor was tituss old friend gnaeus marcius the hero of the battle of corioli for years in battle after battle gnaeus had been gaining a reputation as a fearless fighter but at corioli where he had served as second in command to cominius his exploits had elevated him to a new level of glory at a critical moment during the siege the defenders had boldly opened the gates and sent forth their fiercest fighters the bloodshed that followed was horrific but one roman never wavered as he slew enemy after enemy gnaeus marcius driven by a force that seemed more than human he fought his way to the open gates and ran into the city alone the soldiers and citizens of corioli swarmed around him determined to kill him but gnaeus could not be stopped after surrounding himself with corpses he seized a torch and set aflame anything that could burn the conflagration so terrified and distracted the defenders that the gates were left unmanned the romans rushed into the city and a mass slaughter followed after the battle cominius praised gnaeuss heroism before the assembled troops he presented him with a magnificent warhorse with trappings worthy of a general he also promised gnaeus as much of the silver of corioli as he could carry and his choice of any ten captives to become his slaves gnaeus accepted the horse saying it would help him to fight romas enemies and one captive a man he recognized for having fought bravely against him whom he then released the other gifts he rejected saying that he had done no more and no less than any roman soldier should the conquest of corioli itself was the only reward he desired gnaeus marcius had become a hero to his fellow soldiers that day now marching behind him in the triumphal procession they began to chant quietly at first then louder and louder coriolanus coriolanus coriolanusan honorific title to hail him as the conqueror of corioli because such a title would more properly be given to a commander titus thought the men must be referring to cominius the general apparently thought the same thing for he smiled broadly turned around in the chariot to face his troops and raised his scepter to them but in the next instant it became evident for whom the troops were crying out a band of them broke ranks rushed forward and raised gnaeus marcius onto their shoulders they spun him about all the while shouting coriolanus coriolanus coriolanus a lesser man might have betrayed a flash of jealousy at seeing a subordinate so honored on the day of his own triumph but cominius was as canny a politician as he was a commander his unwavering grin became a smile bestowed on gnaeus marcius his raised scepter became a salute to the hero of corioli when the crowd began to take up the chant as well cominius seized the moment he beckoned to the soldiers bearing gnaeus aloft they trotted forward laughing like boys and deposited their comrade onto the chariot alongside the commander a few in the crowd were taken aback at this breach of decorum below him titus heard publius pinarius let out a gasp and mutter by hercules did you ever see anything so audacious but a far greater number of spectators were roused to cheering and even moved to tears especially when cominius warmly embraced gnaeus then placed gnaeuss hand upon the scepter next to his own and raised it high people of roma i give you gnaeus marcius the hero of corioli all hail coriolanus coriolanus the people chanted the name reverberated around the forum like rolling thunder from the step above appius claudius leaned over and spoke into tituss ear i always knew that friend of yours would make a name for himself today he has and everyone in roma is shouting it claudius stood upright cupped his hands to his mouth and joined the others coriolanus all hail coriolanus the temple will be dedicated very soon then said gnaeus marcius titus laughed yes very soon its polite of you to inquire gnaeusor should i call you coriolanus now but we both know you have very little interest in temples and even less in architecture for its own sake we see each other so seldom nowadays it seems to me that we should speak of matters that interest us both they were dining alone in the garden of the house on the palatine where gnaeus lived with his mother and wife the previous day various citizens had organized private feasts to follow the triumph the food had been so sumptuous and titus had eaten so much that he had thought he would never be hungry again yet a day later his stomach was empty again and he found himself craving a simple meal even more he craved the company of his old friend gnaeus just the two of them alone away from the swarms of strangers and wellwishers who had surrounded gnaeus the previous day with their incessant cries of hail coriolanus and so when gnaeus invited him to a private dinner to enjoy his mothers chickpea and millet porridge titus had eagerly accepted its true that our lives have taken different paths in recent years said gnaeus but that may be about to change how so am i to leave the senate and the construction projects theyve entrusted to me and join you in battle i was never very good at it i suppose i could be your spearbearer or hold open the gate of an enemy city while you rush inside i mean quite the opposite i shall be invading your domain my construction projects no i mean the senate what are you saying gnaeus smiled cominius promised me as much yesterday after he invited me onto his chariot as we passed all those cheering people he whispered in my ear see how they love you my boy amazing ive never seen anything like it a man like you belongs in the senate where you can do even more good for roma than you did at corioli i shall make a special appointment and for that alone men will say my year as consul was well spent but gnaeus this is wonderful except that now i truly have no idea what i should call you senator coriolanus senator gnaeus marcius coriolanusthats a mouthful then stuff your mouth with chickpeas and millet instead said gnaeus he laughed but a moment later titus saw that gnaeuss lips were silently mouthing his impressive new title and that it pleased him how the gods must love you you always said youd become romas greatest warrior and so you have now you can become romas most beloved politician cominius is no fool he wouldnt appoint you to the senate if he didnt see great potential in you appius claudius sees it too mark my words in due course you shall be elected consul perhaps in the meantime i shall need someone to teach me the ins and outs of the senate youre the man for that titus i hardly think so appius claudius is your man he took me under his wing when i entered the senate it was thanks to his influence that i was put in charge of building the temple of ceres hell do the same for you insofar as such a capable fellow needs to be taken under anyones wing claudius is a good man to know but nothing takes the place of a boyhood friend when the odds are against me its to you ill turn titus gnaeus put his hand on tituss shoulder titus nodded coriolanus honors me gnaeus leaned back and smiled sohow goes the work on the temple of ceres a subject in which you have no interest no interest as a soldier perhaps but as a senator i may have a great deal of interest in the project then tomorrow you shall come and see for yourself its a prominent location quite spectaculara spur of the aventine that looms above the starting gates of the circus maximus its in the etruscan araeostyle just like the temple of jupiter on the capitoline not as large but it will be quite grandly decorated vulca is no longer with us alas but weve employed the very best etruscan sculptors for the terracotta statue of ceres to execute the frescoes and reliefs on the walls weve brought in two greek artists gorgasus and damophilus theyre almost done and their work is amazing and titus realized that gnaeus was not paying attention he was staring into the middle distance with a distracted look gnaeus noticed that titus had stopped speaking and flashed a wry smile youre right titus i care nothing about the temples architecture or its adornments but i do care about the politics behind it famine said titus bluntly it was the famine three years ago that inspired the building of the temple so many men were called to war that there was no one to sow the crops that year and the fields that were sown were devastated by more warfare roma had insufficient stores in reserve and people starvedthe poorer people anyway my father also died that yearnot directly from the famine because our sort never went hungry but from a fever disease goes hand in hand with famine and from a fever no man is safe the sibylline books were consulted it was decreed that a temple should be dedicated to ceres to prevent another famine we would appeal to the goddess of the harvest sometimes the advice of the sibylline verses actually makes sense or was there another agenda said gnaeus his tone was suddenly grave ceres is a favorite deity of the plebeians is it not true that the annual festival to commemorate her temple will be organized exclusively by plebeians just as the annual festival to commemorate the temple of jupiter is organized by patricians yes thus well have a new plebeian festival to match the old patrician festival whats wrong with that asked titus with a sigh he knew where gnaeuss argument was leading for he had heard it before from appius claudius it was really quite amazing how closely gnaeuss attitudes matched those of tituss fatherinlaw both men were endlessly suspicious of anything that might advance the political power of the plebeians claudius had maneuvered to have titus oversee construction of the temple of ceres not because he approved of the project but for reasons quite the opposite if it must be done then better we put you in charge of the project my boy rather than some sycophant who wishes only to curry favor with the mob titus himself was largely apathetic about politics if anything he was sympathetic to the struggles of the plebs his chief priorities were to determine the best design for any given project to employ the best artists and artisans at the best prices and to see the building progress from imagination to splendid reality gnaeus shook his head if the plebeians continue to have their way titus one morning you may wake up in a world you no longer recognize where the lowest have usurped the highest and the ageold prestige of a name like potitius counts for nothing can you not see that the new plebeian festival indicates a dangerous shift in the balance of power since the birth of the republic by this means and that in small ways and large the plebeian masses have ceaselessly conspired to wrest power from the patricians always to the detriment of romas security and prosperity some would say theyve merely been trying to wriggle out from under the patrician heel said titus theyve refused to pay their debts which is robbery some have refused military service which is treason and last year they pulled the most outrageous stunt of all their socalled secession from the city thousands of themmen women and childrenpacked their things and left roma altogether they brought the city to a standstill and refused to come back until their demands were met were their demands unreasonable of course they were appius claudius fought like a lion to stop his fellow senators from capitulating but they did the plebs were granted their demands and that ended the secession now theyre allowed to elect their own magistrates and what will these socalled aediles of the plebs do their primary function is sacredto guard the new temple of ceres and what will be kept in the temple an archive of the senates decrees that was another of the plebs demands that all the decrees of the senate should be written down so anyone who wishes may search them for discrepancies and scrutinize them for unfair treatment of the plebs is it a bad thing gnaeus that laws and proclamations should be written down the kings ruled by spoken words they could make promises with one breath and take them back with another they could ruin a mans life on a whim then disclaim all responsibility my grandfather may hercules bless him taught me to respect the written word that the laws should be duly and precisely recorded is not a bad thing gnaeus was unswayed even worse than the aedilesmuch worseare these other officers whom the plebeians can now elect the socalled tribunes from ancient times the people have been divided into tribes so they call these representatives their tribunesbut i call them bullies and upstarts under the pretext of protecting common citizens from the alleged abuses of magistrates and senators these tribunes of the plebs can summarily confiscate the property of anyoneanyonewho they deem has threatened the physical wellbeing of a citizen and where will the confiscated goods be deposited in the temple of ceres under guard of the aediles and if any man should dare to threaten or in any way interfere with a tribune that man can be exiled or even put to death titus sighed there have been abuses against the plebs once in the year of the famine i saw an old veteran being hounded by the hired ruffians of a senator the veteran was crippled and in rags he may have owed the senator money but he clearly had no means to repay the debt nor was he fit to work it off no matter how much the ruffians shoved him about the old man begged them for mercy he finally tore off his tunic to show his battle scarsthe wounds he had received fighting for roma if the tribunes had existed then they could have put a stop to that shameful spectacle and if the temple of ceres had existed the veteran could have gone there for protection because among its other functions it will serve as an asylum for the plebs gnaeus snorted ive heard that tired story about the abused veteran a hundred times before and ive never believed it no man worthy to be called a roman veteran would show off his scars to escape paying a debt titus shook his head the temple will also house a center for distributing food to the poor does that offend you indeed it does how will the aediles purchase that food with the confiscated wealth of patricians whove dared to offend the tribunes gnaeus raised an eyebrow then leaned back and crossed his arms he exhaled a long breath titus dear titus i think i liked it better when i was a warrior and you were a builder and we had no interests in common membership in the senate does not necessarily draw men together said titus wryly but if my fatherinlaw and i can get along despite our differences then so can we gnaeus youll find that i have few fixed opinions in matter of politics i follow the consensus the only thing i truly care about is my passion for building the conversation was joined by a feminine voice did i hear you say something about distributing my food to the poor titus potitius is my chickpea and millet porridge too common for your taste titus stood to acknowledge the appearance of gnaeuss mother in the garden one needed to look no further than the graceful veturia to see the model which had inspired her sons erect posture and haughty demeanor veturia you misheard my comments for your porridge i have only the highest praise good i made it myself no slaves cooking will do for my son on the rare occasion that finds him home from fighting romas enemies from behind she leaned over to embrace gnaeus who remained seated and reached up to grasp her hands and give her a kiss the widow veturia was still a very handsome woman and gnaeus unabashedly adored her if only to make my mother proud of me gnaeus had once said declaring his boyhood ambition to become romas greatest warrior at that moment the mother of coriolanus looked very proud indeed it was not every senator whose first speech before the august body set off a nearriot inside the chamber and a fullscale riot outside the special appointment of the hero coriolanus to the senate was swiftly done he was outfitted with a senatorial toga and the day of his induction if not as momentous as that of appius claudius was nonetheless marked by all the proper ceremonies and speeches of welcome the fact that gnaeus was a plebeian was not an impediment to his admission a number of wealthy powerful plebeians had been admitted into the ranks of the senate a small handful had even been elected consul beginning with the great brutus himself though for any man not of patrician rank the attainment of the consulship posed a steep challenge it was one thing to achieve nobilitas the status of being among the known which membership in the senate conferred to a man and his descendents it was quite another thing to attain the nobilitys highest honors as publius pinarius had once remarked to titus approvingly to reach the very top in our brave new republic its not enough merely to be noble its necessary for that nobility to be covered with purple must like old wine to be ancient and rusty like iron that sort of status comes only with generations of breeding if anyone might have opposed gnaeuss appointment to their ranks it would have been the plebeian minority in the senate who regularly put forth radical legislation and who knew very well where gnaeuss allegiances lay but the plebs bided their time and did not speak against him it was gnaeus who spoke against them the more conservative senators had always opposed the establishment of the tribunes as protectors of the plebs some who had acquiesced to the necessity in order to end the secession of the plebs now regretted it yet no one not even the reactionary appius claudius dared to call publicly for the abolition of the tribunes there was some question as to whether it would be even legal to do so to interfere with the work of the tribunes was a crime punishable by exile or death and could it not be argued that calling for their abolition amounted to interference with their work it was left to a man who knew no fear to do what appius claudius and his colleagues were afraid to do on the morning that gnaeus was inducted into their ranks the business of the senate was commonplace funds needed to be appropriated to repair a section of the cloaca maxima more funds were needed to rebuild a portion of a road south of the city rendered impassable by heavy rains a section of the wall protecting the aventine needed repair there was debate as to who should receive these contracts certain senators were notorious for getting the most lucrative contracts and for overcharging as well after some acrimonious exchanges the matter of funding was tabled and scheduled for further debate titus potitius was asked about progress on the temple of ceres i am happy to report that the work of the greek artists gorgasus and damophilus is very nearly complete some of you have seen the results already i believe i can say without exaggeration that our grandchildren and their grandchildren when they look upon this temple will praise their ancestors for having created a gift of such exquisite beauty to the goddess in years of bounty we shall have a place to thank her in lean years we shall have a place to appeal to her favor there was a murmur of approval throughout the chamber titus was well liked and his competence was beyond dispute the attention of the senate turned to its newest member who had put in a request to speak gnaeus who was sitting between appius claudius and titus rose to his feet and strode to the center of the chamber so that he could move about freely and face all the senators in turn my colleagues let me tell you straight out that i am not a man of delicate words my oratorical skills such as they are were not learned on the field of mars where the men standing for consul beg for votes i am not accustomed to flattering anyone least of all my inferiors i learned to speak on the battlefield exhorting other men to fight and to spill their blood for roma today i find myself on another battlefield where the fate of roma hangs in the balance you senators are the warriors i must rally to take up arms and fight for roma not long ago when the plebs staged their socalled secession one of your number the distinguished menenius agrippa made an impassioned speech to the people trying to make them see reason he told them a fable which went something like this long ago the parts of the human body were not all in harmony as they are now but each had its own thoughts and ideas the hardworking limbs and the vigilant eyes and ears noticed that the belly seemed to do nothing but lay idle and wait for the other parts to feed it we all work hard to satisfy the belly but what does the belly do for us they said let us teach the belly a lesson so they conspired to withhold all nourishment from it the limbs refused to gather grain the eyes refused to watch for game the hands refused to take food to the mouth the mouth refused to open when the empty belly began to grumblenot a selfish demand but a warning of dangerthe other parts merely laughed how simpleminded how spiteful were these resentful parts because quite soon the limbs began to wither the hands began to tremble the eyes and ears grew dull the weakened parts fell prey to every manner of disease finally they realized that the belly too had its essential part to play in the great scheme of things for it was the belly that sustained the rest of the body and without it the other parts could not continue to exist the rebellion ceased the natural order was restored the body gradually returned to health and the other parts never again conspired against the belly when it asked to be fed they all worked together to do so without questioning if only the fable told by agrippa had sufficed to make those malcontents see the error of their ways a city must be ruled by the best and wisest of its men and to those men must be given the respect and privileges they deserve the other citizens have their purpose but it is not to rule the city they exist to fill the ranks of the army to settle new colonies so as to spread the power of roma and encircle her with obedient allies to harvest the crops and to build the roads it is not the rabbles place to rule yet they persist in their reckless attempts to pull down their betters and take their place they can only fail because like the limbs who rebelled against the belly what they are attempting goes against the natural order of the universe against the will of the gods and yet these malcontents have already done great damage to the state and they have done so with the craven cooperation of a majority within this very chamber this appeasement must stop more than that it must be rolled back before the damage becomes irreparable this is not merely an internal matter a disagreement among citizens never forget that roma is surrounded by enemies and those enemies are always watching how gleeful they must be to see our predicament one by one the best men of roma will be pulled down by the rabble who then will defend the city against her foes just as the lesser men will destroy the greater men in roma so lesser cities will unite to destroy roma herself your fortunes and your land will be taken from you your families shall be sold into slavery our beloved roma shall cease to existand men will say that her destruction began with the creation of the tribunes of the plebs there was an uproar in the chamber members cried out this issue has already been settled and the plebs are not the enemy but others were exhilarated by gnaeuss words including appius claudius who sprang to his feet and shouted hail coriolanus the man who dares to speak the truth gnaeus raised his hands as the din subsided one senator shouted what exactly do you propose gnaeus marcius what do you think i propose that the tribunes must be abolished the proposal is illegal shouted a senator withdraw it at once i will not i stand by my words and i ask you my colleagues to stand by me a grave mistake was made and it must be rectified for the sake of roma if gnaeus had hoped to put forward a formal proposal and to call for a vote he was thwarted all over the chamber senators sprang to their feet and loudly demanded to be recognized shouting led to namecalling and then to shoving matches amid the chaos gnaeus who was used to the discipline of the army and its clear lines of authority threw up his hands in disgust and strode out of the chamber titus caught up with him as he descended the steps of the senate house gnaeus where are you going anywhere to escape that tumult the senate is just what i expectedall kings and no crown how they ever accomplish anything i cant imagine would you believe it just this morning cominius was telling me that i should consider a run for consul can you see me currying favor with that lot and the common rabble i think not its usually not quite sodisorderly titus laughed you certainly riled them up i did didnt i because they needed it gnaeuss smile abruptly faded in the middle of the forum he found himself confronted by a large group of men one of the men stepped forward are you gnaeus marcius called coriolanus you know i am who are you spurius icilius tribune of the plebs ive been informed of a threat made against myself and the wellbeing of all plebeians what are you talking about did you not only moments ago make a proposal on the floor of the senate that the tribunate of the plebs should be abolished therefore threatening the safety and protection of all plebeians how would you know about that do you have spies in the senate the eyes and the ears of the tribunes are everywhere we are the protectors of the people youre nothing more than hooligans did you or did you not threaten the tribunes what i said before the senate ill say to your face for the survival of roma the tribunes must be abolished gnaeus marcius i place you under arrest for threatening a tribune of the plebs and for interfering with his mission your fate will be decided by a vote of the peoples assembly this is ridiculous you will come with me i will not take your hands off me gnaeus repulsed the tribune so forcefully that the man stumbled and fell backward some of the men with icilius produced cudgels and brandished them gnaeus struck one of them squarely in the nose and sent him reeling then adroitly ducked a cudgel swung at his head he struck another man and knocked him down titus caught up in the excitement joined the fight just as more men with cudgels arrived we must run titus shouted gnaeus run surely coriolanus never runs titus ducked a cudgel when hes unarmed and outnumbered even coriolanus makes a strategic retreat the tribunes men blocked the way back to the senate house titus and gnaeus ran in the opposite direction toward the capitoline with the tribune and his men in pursuit the last time the two of them had ascended the hill had been on the day of the triumph when gnaeus had received his title by the acclamation of the people it occurred to titus that some of the men pursuing them had probably been among those who shouted coriolanus how they had loved gnaeus on that day how they hated him now gnaeus was right he thought the rabble were fickle and foolish and did not deserve to have a warrior like coriolanus to fight their battles they sprinted up the winding pathway and approached the summit has it occurred to you asked titus breathing hard that we shall have nowhere to go when we reach the top there is no strategic retreat without a strategy said gnaeus i shall enter the temple of jupiter and demand asylum if the rabble can find asylum in your temple of ceres then surely jupiter can shield a senator but as they approached the temple steps they were blocked by a group of men who had somehow circled ahead of them there was no choice but to keep running until they came to the tarpeian rock and could run no more the swiftest of the pursuers almost upon them shouted back to the others can you believe it the gods have led them straight to the place of execution stand back cried the tribune icilius no one will be executed today this man is under arrest but as the mob approached there were cries of swift justice and push him over and kill him now titus already lightheaded from running glanced over the precipice and staggered back he was dizzy and his heart was pounding now we see what sort of men you really are said gnaeus coldblooded murderers no one will be murdered insisted icilius he pushed his way to the front of the crowd the mob surged behind him he lowered his voice senator i am barely able to restrain these men do nothing to provoke them further for your own safety senator you must come with me i will not i recognize the authority of no man to arrest a roman citizen simply for speaking his mind call off your curs tribune and leave me in peace you dare to call us dogs one of the men behind icilius threw his cudgel it missed gnaeus but struck a glancing blow to tituss temple titus staggered back and tottered on the precipice gnaeus leaped to catch him and for an instant it appeared that both of them would fall gnaeus at last gained his balance and pulled titus to safety the mob which had watched in breathless excitement now roared with disappointment and surged forward icilius held out his arms to restrain them but there were too many suddenly there was a commotion at the back of the crowd the consul cominius had arrived with his lictors the cudgels of the mob were no match for the axes of the lictors who cleared a path through the crowd tribune what is happening here demanded cominius i am placing this man under arrest thats a lie shouted gnaeus these hooligans chased my colleague and me all the way from the forum with the clear intention of murdering us before you arrived they were about to throw us from the tarpeian rock a traitors death is what you deserve shouted one of the men death to any man who tries to take away the protectors of the people stand down cried cominius spurius icilius stop this madness call off your men retract the arrest do you dare to interfere with the lawful duties of a tribune consul icilius locked his gaze on cominius who eventually lowered his eyes let there be a trial if you insist said cominius but in the meantime let coriolanus go free icilius stared for a long moment at gnaeus then nodded very well let the people decide his fate gradually grumbling and spitting contemptuously at the feet of the lictors the mob dispersed and icilius withdrew gnaeus burst out laughing and strode forward to hug his old commander but the consuls expression was grim titus feeling a bit sick from the blow to his head sat down on the tarpeian rock the others seemed like phantoms from a dream he found himself staring at the temple and the magnificent quadriga of jupiter atop the pediment how he loved the building that vulca had made sometimes i think that even the gods have turned against me whispered gnaeus he paced back and forth across the moonlit garden his face was in shadow as were the faces of those who had come in answer to his summons no lamps had been lit the least flicker of light might alert his enemies to the midnight meeting in the house of gnaeus marcius titus was there so were appius claudius and the consul cominius there were also a number of men dressed in full armor as if ready to ride into battle there seemed to be a great many of them pressed together under the colonnade that surrounded the garden by the light of the full moon upon their limbs titus could see that most were young and by the quality of their armor he could see that all were men of means in recent days gnaeus had attracted a large following of young warriors most of them patricians or men like himself of plebeian rank but with patrician blood their devotion to gnaeusor coriolanus as they always called himwas fanatical no less fanatical was the determination of the tribune icilius and his plebeian followers to see gnaeus destroyed the raging dispute over his fate had torn roma apart his trial was to be held the next day the gods have nothing to do with this farce said appius claudius bitterly men are to blame weak and foolish men you should have been applauded as a hero by the senate gnaeus instead theyve abandoned you the matter was never that simple said cominius with a sigh the right to elect the tribunes was won by the plebs only after a fierce struggle gnaeus stepped into the path of a raging bull when he decided to take them on and are we to do nothing while that bull tramples the best man in roma said titus his voice breaking the day the mob chased them to the tarpeian rock had marked a turning point in his life a great anger had welled up inside him it hardened tituss heart against the plebs and drew him closer than ever to his boyhood friend how had he been blind for so long to the threat posed by the plebs how had he failed to see that gnaeus was right all along titus felt guilty for not having supported gnaeus more enthusiastically from the beginning when gnaeus was booed by weaker men for speaking the truth in the senate titus should have been ready with his own speech to back him up dont worry about the rampaging bull titus said gnaeus he placed his hand on his friends shoulder the beast will never touch me ill sooner die by my own sword than submit to the punishment of that rabble that rabble as you call it is the peoples assembly said cominius and i fear that their right to try you is beyond dispute the matter has been fully debated in the senate shameful muttered appius claudius i did my best to sway them but to no avail and so this mockery of justice this socalled trial will take place tomorrow said gnaeus is there truly no hope cominius none icilius has stirred the plebs into a frenzy i had hoped the influence of their betters might serve to cool their thirst for your blood but even outright bribery has failed tomorrow youll be tried before the peoples assembly and found guilty of impugning the dignity and endangering the persons of the tribunes your property will be confiscated and auctioned the proceeds will be donated to the fund for the poor in the temple of ceres your mother and wife will be left with nothing and i cominius hung his head you will be publicly scourged and executed no never cried one of the young warriors from the shadows of the colonnade his colleagues joined him with cries of outrage gnaeus raised his hands to quiet them he turned to cominius and if i leave roma tonight of my own volition if i flee into exile cominius drew a deep breath icilius could try you in absentia but i think i can convince him not to he will have scored the victory he seeks establishing the inviolability of the tribunes if there is no trial your property will remain intact your mother and wife will be provided for i care nothing for my own life said gnaeus let them flay me and eat my flesh if they wish but i will never allow my property to be put into the hands of the aediles to feed the lazy rabble of roma he turned his face up to stare at the full moon by its white light his handsome features looked as though they had been sculpted from marble exile he whispered after all ive done for roma he lowered his face so that it was once again in shadow he addressed the warriors who surrounded him some of you when last we met made a pledge that you would raise a sword and spill plebeian blood rather than see me executed or failing that that you would follow me into exile but now that the moment of decision has arrived i do not hold any man to that pledge we made a vow objected one of the men a roman never breaks his oath but if we leave roma never to return are we still romans think what it means to be a man without a city this fate was thrust upon me i cannot thrust it upon anyone else one of the men stepped forward we all came here tonight armed and ready to fightready to die if necessary if your decision as our commander is to withdraw instead of engaging the enemy we go with you coriolanus even beyond the gates of roma yes just as we followed you inside the gates of corioli that day you fought your way inside alone and the rest of us trailed after you like tardy schoolboys not so on this day we remain at your side coriolanus so say you all so say we all shouted the warriors gnaeus laughed with that cry youve awaked the whole palatine all roma will soon be wondering whats afoot at the house of gnaeus marcius we have no choice now but to leave at once while the others made ready gnaeus said farewell to cominius and claudius he saw titus standing in the shadows and went to his side ive already said farewell to my mother and my wife look after them titus as carefully as you look after claudia i should go with you gnaeus shook his head you heard what i told my warriors this is a sacrifice i can demand of no man yet they follow you that is their choice it should be my choice as well gnaeus was silent for a long moment shadows hid his face but titus felt the mans eyes upon him you have a temple to complete titus damn the temple of ceres and all it stands for gnaeus frowned a man must have something to believe in as you once believed in roma believe in roma titus believe in the temple of ceres forget that coriolanus ever lived gnaeus turned and walked away his followers encircled him the entourage departed from the garden tituss house was only a short distance away claudius offered to go with him but titus preferred to walk alone the night was warm the shutters were open moonlight flooded the chamber where claudia was sleeping titus gazed upon her face for a long time he walked to the room where his son slept and gazed upon his face for an even longer time he kept thinking of the image which cominius had planted in his mind of gnaeus confronted by a stampeding bull hercules whose altar had been in the keeping of tituss family for generations had once fought a bull on the faraway island of crete gods demanded sacrifice heroes deserved loyalty was not coriolanus just such a hero as hercules had been in his study by moonlightfor he feared that lighting a lamp might wake those who slepthe wrote a message to appius claudius fatherinlaw i beseech you look after your daughter and your grandson i have done what i know to be right he entered his sons room he lifted the talisman of fascinus over his neck and slipped it carefully and quietly over his sons neck deep in slumber the boy reached up and touched the talisman but never woke if titus hurried he might catch up with coriolanus and his men before they passed beyond the city gates bc its a long road thats brought us here said gnaeus a very long road indeed said titus smiling ruefully he knew that his friend did not literally mean the road beneath their feet which brought them with each clop of the horses hooves closer to roma gnaeus was speaking of the curious twists and turns their lives had taken since the night they fled the city two years ago a man such as gnaeus with his knowledge of warfare and his reputation for bravery and with a company of fanatically devoted warriors at his side would have been welcomed in many cities it was ironic but perhaps predictable that he chose to make an overture to the volsci true he had spilled much volscian blood but always in honorable combat and who was more likely than the volsci to recognize his true worth it was a curious thing puzzling at first to titus that those whom gnaeus had fought so ferociously could welcome him into their rank so enthusiastically this was the way of the warrior by a simple twist of fate and in the blink of an eye an enemy could become an ally of course gnaeus being gnaeus had become much more than an ally he quickly became the volscis leading warrior and then just as quickly commander of the whole army the campaign to wreak vengeance on roma had not been his idea but that of the volscian elders who had to argue long and hard to overcome his resistance who better to anticipate and foil every roman strategy than the man who been romas greatest warrior what greater triumph for the volsci than to see coriolanus do to roma what he had done to corioli what sweeter revenge for gnaeus marcius than to bring the city that had spurned him to its knees in the campaign against roma gnaeus had transcended himself the man who had proclaimed his desire to become romas greatest warrior had become the greatest warrior in all of italy and the boldest general as well it seemed to titus who fought at gnaeuss side in battle after battle that the gods themselves must have taken a hand in delivering so many victories to his friend the men under gnaeus developed a superstitious belief in his leadership the magic of his presence not their bravery was the key to victory it was tituss private conviction that the ancient spirit of hercules now lived again in coriolanus the hero of the age this religious conviction was a great solace to titus in those moments when homesickness for roma and his family threatened to overwhelm him now the final battle drew near every clop of the horses hooves along the road brought gnaeus and the army of the volsci closer to the very gate by which he had fled the city in battle after battle the armies of roma had been defeated their ranks were depleted their stores of arms captured and confiscated the people were weakened as well crops had been burned roman colonies had been looted and emergency supplies of grain from sicily had been intercepted as roma grew more enfeebled all the enemies whom she had humiliated in recent years flocked to join gnaeus and the volsci the force led by coriolanus was invincible while the invaders were still two days south of roma envoys had ridden out from the city to meet with gnaeus they reminded him of his roman lineage they pleaded with him to turn back his army gnaeus treated them with scorn but allowed them to return to roma with their heads the fact that the romans beg for peace shows theyre certain of defeat he said to titus the next day two more envoys arrived the dust from their chariot rose high in the still air and could be seen for a long time before they drew near enough to be recognized titus drew a sharp breath when he saw the haggard faces of appius claudius and postumius cominius gnaeus ordered his men to stay back while he rode forward to meet the two senators titus accompanied him while gnaeus acknowledged the two mens greeting titus stayed to one side unwilling to look his fatherinlaw in the eye cominius first assured gnaeus that his wife and mother were well despite gnaeuss betrayal no one had taken vengeance on his family and now no one would dare to do so my daughter claudia and young titus potitius are also well added claudius though titus still averted his eyes speaking for the consuls and the senate the two men acknowledged the great wrong that had been done to gnaeus they promised the restoration of his citizenship and his place in the senate and full immunity from prosecution by the tribunes gnaeus listened respectfully to his two old mentors then asked and what of the tribunes of the plebs and the aediles will they be abolished will the temple of ceres be pulled to the ground cominius and claudius lowered their eyes their silence provided the answer gnaeus laughed you think to turn back coriolanus with a few words yet with all the power of the senate you cannot even bend the plebs to your will no empty promises will stop me now if you truly love roma go back and advise your colleagues to surrender the city i have no wish to spill more blood than is necessary and my mens craving for plunder will be easier to control if they take the city without a fight whether you resist me or not by this time tomorrow roma will belong to me a bitter homecoming said cominius but a homecoming nonetheless and if you take the cityjupiter forbidwhat will you do then asked claudius gnaeus drew a deep breath if they havent already killed themselves certain of my old enemies will receive the retribution they deserve i think you know who heads the list the tribune spurius icilius said cominius what a pleasure it will be to cast him from the tarpeian rock what of the senate said claudius perhaps i will allow it to remain in existence restored to the role it played under the kings to give advice and assistance to the royal power its less useful members will be purged and replaced by new members of volscian blood cominius stifled a cry of despair claudius cast a piercing gaze at titus what do you have to say about this soninlaw titus stared back his gaze steady when i was a boy my grandfather taught me the list of kings romulus numa pompilius tullus hostilius ancus marcius tarquinius the elder servius tullius tarquinius the proud was to be the last the very last cast out and replaced forever by something called a republic a mockery a mistake an experiment that failed today is the republics final day tomorrow men will shout in the forum all hail king coriolanus he drew his sword and raised his arm to gnaeus his horse rose on its hind legs all hail king coriolanus he cried the coterie of loyal warriors who had left roma with gnaeus who always rode at the head of the army heard tituss cry and took it up all hail king coriolanus the cry spread through the ranks of the vast army all hail king coriolanus men raised their swords in salute then beat them upon their shields creating a frightful din as they shouted over and over all hail king coriolanus claudius seemed to wither cominius turned the chariot about a cloud of dust rose behind them as they hurried back to roma at that spot a few miles south of the city the army of coriolanus made camp the next morning the army rose at dawn and made ready to march to battle as always coriolanus rode at the head of the army with titus beside him and his mounted roman warriors immediately behind him with each step they drew closer to roma they approached the crest of a low hill once they reached it the hills of roma would be visible in the distance above the sound of hooves and the rustle created by a vast army on the march titus heard another sound low at first and then louder it came from beyond the crest of the hill something was on the other side not yet visible something that made a horrible wrenching frightening sound a sound such as a man might hear on his descent to the realms of pluto a sound of utter hopelessness and despair gnaeus heard it too he frowned and turned one ear forward what is that he whispered i dont know said titus but it raises hackles on the back of my neck a superstitious fear swept over him what if the gods loved roma more than they loved coriolanus what if by betraying roma titus and gnaeus had sinned against the gods what sort of unearthly creature of doom might the gods have conjured to meet them on the road to roma or had a vast pit opened in the earth into which they would all be cast down never to return that was what the noise sounded likethe shrieking and moaning of a vast chorus of the dead once they reached the crest of the hill they would know gripping the reins of his horse gnaeuss knuckles turned white titus swallowed hard he glanced behind him even the battlehardened warriors in the front ranks had blanched hearing that unnerving noise they came to the crest before them like a gigantic black snake upon the straight road stretching all the way back to the city gate in the far distance was a procession of women dressed in mourning it appeared that all the women in roma had come forth from the city the unearthly sound was the collective noise of their lamentation some softly wept some were wrenched by sobs some swayed and moaned a few shrieked with laughter like madwomen some walked stiffly as if in a dream while others thrashed about in a kind of frenzy and swept the road underfoot with their unbound hair in contrast to the others the women at the very front of the procession strode forward with great dignity they were silent and held their heads high among them by their headbands of twined red and white wool and their cropped hair titus recognized the vestal virgins five of them were present one having been left behind as always to tend to the sacred hearth in the temple of vesta at a time of such crisis it was more vital than ever than the flame should not be extinguished ahead of the vestals were three women who despite their proud upright bearing were dressed in dark tattered rags like beggars in mourning they even went barefoot but clearly were not accustomed to doing so for their feet were bleeding despite the agony they must have felt they never stumbled or missed a step as he had when the senators approached the previous day gnaeus signaled the army to halt while he rode forward with titus beside him shame on the senate said titus the citys envoys failed to stop you so now they stoop to sending women when gnaeus made no answer titus glanced at him instead of a sardonic expression to match his own the look on his friends face was troubled and his eyes glistened tituss heart sank he felt a premonition of what was to come at a signal from the vestals the women behind them shambled to a stop the three woman in rags who led the procession continued to stride forward and stopped only when the two horsemen were almost upon them in the center titus recognized veturia gnaeuss mother she looked much older than when he had last seen her though she stood rigidly upright it appeared that she required some assistance to do so from the two women flanking her to her right was gnaeuss wife volumnia when titus saw the third woman he let out a gasp he had not seen claudia since the day he left roma her face was worn with care she lowered her eyes and would not look at him veturia on the other hand fixed her gaze on her son gnaeus she cried out mother he whispered would you loom above your mother like a master looking down on a slave gnaeus at once dismounted titus did likewise but when gnaeus stepped forward titus hung back he clutched the reins more to support himself than to restrain the horses he suddenly felt lightheaded it was like the feeling he had experienced on the tarpeian rock when he was struck a blow on the head everything between that moment and this seemed a dream and he feared he was about to be rudely awakened his heart pounded in his chest when gnaeus reached his mother he raised his arms but she refused his embrace he stepped back why do you not embrace me mother why do you stand so stiffly if i were to lift my elbows free from the support that volumnia and claudia give me i would fall to the ground i would catch you liar mother she glared at him i always thought if ever i reached an age when i could not stand upright on my own that the strong arm of my son would be there for me to lean on but when i came to need your arm gnaeus it was not there for me i had to lean on othersto my shame may the gods cripple me completely if ever i should lean on your arm harsh words mother not half as harsh as the fate youve thrust upon me what ive done i was forced to do for the sake of my dignity you cast away your dignity the day you took up arms against roma that day you put a knife against your mothers breast today you seem determined to thrust that knife into her heart no mother what ive done i did for you you always taught me i never taught my son to be a traitor if i hear you say such a thing ill pull the sword from your scabbard and fall upon it rather than draw another breath mother mother veturia suddenly pulled her arm from her daughterinlaws grasp with all her strength she slapped gnaeus across the face the crack of the blow was startlingly loud the horses whinnied and wrenched sharply at their reins burning tituss palms veturia began to fall forward but the women caught her gnaeus was stunned after a long moment he signaled for titus to come to him he whispered in his ear tell the men ive ordered a halt set up my tent beside the road too many eyes are upon us i must meet with my mother in private what was said in that tent what promises or threats were made what memories or dreams rekindled none would ever know but coriolanus and his mother veturia was the first to emerge from the tent volumnia and claudiawho still had never met tituss eyesquickly stepped forward to assist her without a word the three returned to where the vestals waited veturia spoke to the virgins in a low voice and they in turn made gestures to the women behind them to turn around and return to the city as the vast procession retreated the multitude of women neither wept nor were jubilant but maintained an eerie silence gnaeus remained alone in the tent for a very long time when he finally emerged he wore upon his face a look of determination such as titus had never seen before gnaeus mounted his steed then summoned his roman vanguard the mounted warriors assembled before him titus was among them dreading what he was about to hear there will be no attack on roma said gnaeus the men were dumbfounded when we left roma we set out to meet our destiny destiny has led us very nearly in a circle we have come this close to romabut we will come no closer over the mountains across the seas there is a vast world beyond the lands of the romans and the volsci out there perhaps is where our destiny now lies the men looked at one another anxiously but such was their degree of discipline that not one of them spoke a word of protest we shall now ride back through the volscian ranks when we reach the rear of the army we shall simply keep riding and the volsci said titus if they wish to attack roma let them theyll never do it youre their talisman only coriolanus can lead them to victory then i suppose theyll turn back as well gnaeus snapped his reins and rode forward the roman vanguard followed titus caught up and rode beside gnaeus the volscian foot soldiers stepped back to make way gazing up at them in wonder and confusion its that womans doing shouted one of them shes turned her son against us coriolanus is deserting us impossible look for yourself but why did he lead us here its a trap coriolanus lured us to this place and now the romans must have a terrible trick in store consternation spread through the ranks it seemed to titus that they rode above a sea of angry faces the roar of that sea grew louder and louder its currents surged this way and that with ever greater violence turn back coriolanus cried the volsci turn back lead us or else a stone struck tituss helmet the noise reverberated though his skull again he was reminded of the day the cudgel had struck him on the tarpeian rock and gnaeus had saved his life more and more the world around him seemed strange and dreamlike muted and distant more stones pelted his armor titus hardly felt them the volsci began with stones but soon enough they drew their swords the romans on horseback did likewise to tituss ears the clash of iron was oddly muffled a blur of motion followed it was with some surprise that he saw blood upon his own sword then felt a burning pain in his side the world spun about and turned upside down titus vaguely knew that he must be tumbling from his horse but never felt himself hit the ground in the days that followed the senate of roma decreed that the day of the citys salvation from coriolanus should be a day of thanksgiving and that special honors should be given to the courageous women of roma who had achieved what neither force of arms nor diplomacy could have achieved those decisions were easy harder decisions followed considerable acrimony attended the debate regarding the ara maxima since the dawn of time the altar of hercules had been kept by the families of the pinarii and the potitii the hereditary priests who jointly celebrated the feast of hercules in light of the dishonor brought upon his family by titus potitius should that family be allowed to continue as keepers of the altar or should they be stripped of their role and should it be given to another family or to priests appointed by the state appius claudius was among those who argued that the state had no right to interfere in a religious arrangement that predated the state itself hercules himself had chosen the two families to keep his shrine no act of the state could undo what a god had willed in a time before memory this was his public stance privately claudius told his colleagues that the shame brought upon him by his soninlaw was a torment hardly to be borne he disowned his daughter and grandchild and declared that so long as he or any descendent bearing his name held any influence in the state no man with the name potitius would ever be elected to high office claudiuss argument carried the senate the keeping of the ara maxima would remain in family hands unchanged but the newly elected consul publius pinarius protested that his family would no longer carry out its traditional duties alongside the disgraced potitii after too many generations to count we relinquish our place in the keeping of the altar let the potitii do it all by themselves there was much talk among the elite of roma regarding these two ancient patrician families and the curious twists of fate which had brought publius pinarius to the consulship the pinnacle of his familys fortunes even as the potitii reached their nadir with the disgrace of titus potitius years later a ragged drifter happened to find himself a few miles south of roma he was a man with no city or tribe doomed to perpetually wander surviving by his wits which were often befuddled and dependent on the mercy of strangers a broken man without hopes or dreams he had not passed this way in many years he only vaguely realized where he was but he knew that the small temple beside the road had not been there before it was of simple design but handsomely executed and beautifully decorated a young shepherd was resting on the steps tell me boy said the vagrant what is this temple to what god is it dedicated the boy looked at the drifter warily at first then saw that the grizzled stranger was harmless not a god but a goddessfortuna the first daughter of jupiter she decides the ups and downs of life i seem to recall that there are many temples to fortuna in roma remarked the drifter his voice dreamy yes but this one is different they call it the temple of fortuna muliebris fortuna of the women why is that because the women of roma paid to build it if you can believe that this is the very spot you see where the villain coriolanus was turned back is it said the drifter with a quaver in his voice indeed it is and afterward the women thought there should be a temple here to mark the spot the senate and the priests approved and the women themselves raised the money to build it its a beautiful building isnt it yes the drifter gazed admiringly at the structure i used to be a builder myself you the shepherd looked at him dubiously then slapped his thigh and laughed and i used to be a senator but look at me now herding these dirty sheep so this was the very spot tituss mind was flooded by memories long suppressed dimly he remembered witnessing gnaeuss gory end even the greatest warrior in italy could not take on the whole of an army he himself had trained for combat at least gnaeus had died fighting dimlythank the gods only dimlytitus recalled the tortures to which the volsci had subjected him before they let him go it all seemed very distant like a dream almost forgotten all the days of his life seemed like that even yesterday even today if you like looking at temples said the shepherd walk on a little ways to the crest of the hill from there you can see the city the highest thing you see is the temple of jupiter now thats a temple it sits on the capitoline like a crown on the head of a king even from here you can see how grand it is go on have a look tituss heart pounded in his chest as he was still wont to do in moments of great emotion even after all these years titus reached up to finger the talisman of fascinus at this throat of course it was not there he had given it to his sleeping son on the night he left roma how was the boy did he still live did he prosper did he keep the ancient rites of hercules as had his ancestors before him go ahead said the shepherd walk to the rise and have a look at the city the ragged wanderer saying nothing turned around and walked in the opposite direction the twelve tables bc another toast declared lucius icilius what surely not another lucius verginius laughed heartily he was a broadshouldered bear of a man who greatly enjoyed wine and his protest was purely for show as your host i must insist said icilius with a wave of his long bony arm he beckoned to the serving girl to refill the cups the occasion was a joyful onea dinner party to celebrate the upcoming wedding of the son of icilius young lucius to verginia the daughter of verginius the marriage would unite two of the most distinguished plebeian families in roma the verginii had been prominent in the city nearly as long as some patrician families the branch of lucius verginius while not wealthy was famed for prowess in battle in recent campaigns against the sabines and the aequi lucius verginius had upheld the standards of bravery set by his ancestors the icilii were welltodo politically active and full of vitality and ambition men from both families had served as tribunes of the plebs the marriage bond between the icilii and the verginii would strengthen both clans it was a love match as well lucius and verginia had fallen for each other at first sight tonight with the wedding only a few days away the two families dined together under the roof of icilius to celebrate their impending union icilius raised his cup a toast to the mothers we must never underestimate the power of a roman matron more than forty years ago when the traitor coriolanus marched on roma what was the only thing that could turn him back not swords not walls not even the abject groveling of the senators only a mothers plea was powerful enough to save roma to the mothers of the bride and groom to the mothers agreed verginius raising his cup yes to our mothers said young lucius his eyes sparkling from having drunk more wine than he was used to the subjects of the toast demurely lowered their eyes and did not join in the drinking nor did the bridegrooms younger sister the darkly beautiful icilia nor did young verginia who had never tasted wine she needed no intoxicant to make her blue eyes sparkle or to add color to her cheeks which were as smooth as rose petals verginia was as fair as lucius was dark she was short and voluptuous rather than tall and lean like her betrothed their physical differences only served to complement each others beauty everyone agreed that they made a lovely couple icilius drained his cup and wiped his mouth now you may wonder why in such congenial company i should mention the foul name of coriolanus which inspires loathing in the breast of any patriot because it brings up the subject of your toasta mothers influence said verginius slurring his words slightly ah yes but more than that i mention that accursed name to remind us of the great boon to roma which was done by one of my relatives the great tribune spurius icilius it was spurius who ran coriolanus out of roma a mother may have kept the villain out but an icilius drove him away in the first place i mention this verginius to show you that the family into which your daughter is marrying while it may not have a history as long as yours has nonetheless made history with an upstanding young scion like my boy lucius this family will continue to do so and why not with the fine sons that my verginia will give him cried verginius verginia blushed so did lucius though he attempted a manly laugh to cover his selfconsciousness icilia whose skin was even darker than her brothers did not easily show a blush but such talk clearly disturbed her the others if they noticed ascribed the pained look on her face to maidenly modesty but more seriously icilius paused all his concentration was momentarily required to suppress a belch the critical moment passed as i was saying on a more serious note forty years have passed since the wicked coriolanus dared to threaten the tribunes and for that crime he was duly punished and yet in many ways the strife between the classes is now fiercer than ever only rarely these days is a plebeian elected to the consulship and this is no accident the patricians grow more jealous of their privileges not less they lay down every possible impediment in order to prevent even the most qualified plebeian from attaining the higher magistracies you know this is true good verginius the other man nodded regrettably good icilius it is the truth lucius groaned no papa no politics tonight icilius shushed him this is not politics my boy this is serious family talk the verginii and the icilii represent the very best of the plebeians the union of our families is much more than the betrothal of a beautiful girl and a fine young man this marriage represents the hope of the future will there ever be lasting peace between the patricians and ourselves we must start by admitting that there have been abuses on both sides since the days of coriolanus we plebs have staged no more secessions but sometimes perhaps we have been too eager to use the power of the tribunes to punish arrogant patricians some tribunes have stirred up the populace unnecessarily and have wielded their power recklessly to be sure more than a few patricians through devious means have eluded punishment and cheated justice failures and abuses on both sides have led to further recriminations which in turn have led to more strife and discord in these dark days despite the best efforts of honest men the two classes seem to be drawing further and further apart we can only hope that the children of lucius and verginia will inherit a better roma than the one in which their parents were born hear hear agreed verginius well said icilius the decemvirs themselves should be here tonight to hear you speak young lucius feeling tipsy raised his cup to the decemvirs his elders abruptly shot him a look that made lucius feel quite small but the mood was too jovial for the tense moment to prevail verginius smiled first then icilius a toast to the decemvirs my son icilius clucked his tongue a toast implies congratulations and in the case of the decemvirs that would be premature no one has yet seen the fruit of their labors though our ten little tarquinii have already put a bitter taste in the mouths of many good citizens the ten tarquinii thats a bit harsh isnt it said verginius is it icilius raised an eyebrow two years earlier the discord in roma had grown so extreme that patricians and plebeians alike had agreed to an extraordinary measure elections were cancelled the senate was disbanded and the magistrates including the tribunes were relieved of their offices a board of ten menthe decemvirswas given temporary power to rule the state and charged with the task of writing a comprehensive code of laws it had sounded like a good idea at the time romas ten wisest men would determine why the state had come to a standstill wield whatever power was necessary to resolve the problems devise fair laws and chisel those laws into stone for all to see the plebs had long agitated for a written law code believing that a clear list of offenses and an enumeration of citizens rights would do more than anything else to put an end to the arbitrary abuses of the patricians but the process had dragged on for two years without visible results and the decemvirs had grown careless and abusive with their power icilius clucked his tongue we all hopedoptimistically perhaps foolishlythat the decemvirs would follow the example of cincinnatus good old cincinnatus a toast to cincinnatus cried verginius who had served under the famous commander eight years before when a roman army had been trapped by the aequi and faced certain destruction the generalturnedfarmer lucius quinctius cincinnatus had been called from retirement he was named dictator and given total power over the state for the duration of the crisis begrudgingly cincinnatus left his plow led a force to rescue the army soundly defeated the aequi resigned his office and returned to his farmall in the span of fifteen days it was said that his plow was exactly where he had left it and he set about finishing the furrow he had begun as if there had been no interruption expeditious and selfeffacing cincinnatus had become a living legend but the decemvirs had not followed the example of cincinnatus by devious means they had extended their original terms of office and continued to rule as absolute dictators while the people still awaited publication of the new law code in recent months their abuses had grown more flagrant as they ruthlessly suppressed anyone who questioned their authority men had died for opposing them but the decemvirs so long as they held office were immune from charges of murder the good news said icilius is that the new law code should be made public any day now the decemvirs call it the twelve tables lets hope theyve done such an outstanding job that the virtues of the twelve tables will make us forget the vices of the ten tarquinii young lucius furrowed his brow i heard a rumor the other day about these new laws a rumor said his father my tutor xenon says they plan to outlaw marriage between patricians and plebeians a terrible idea said verginius iciliuss face grew long what would your greek tutor know about such things lucius shrugged xenon tutors other boys including some of the decemvirs grandsons he hears all sorts of things icilius peered into his empty cup to be sure there are those patrician and plebeian alike who believe that more separation of the classes not less is the answer to romas social ills a ban on intermarriage might not be a bad thing i suppose i should consider myself lucky then said lucius that the most beautiful girl in all of roma happens to be a plebeian and she happens to be betrothed to me he beamed at verginia who grinned and lowered her eyes no one was looking at luciuss sister icilia whose dark beauty was abruptly marred by a deep frown verginius grunted ten tarquinii you called the decemvirs appius claudius must be the worst of the lot a few generations back the claudii werent even romans they werent even the claudii what was that uncouth sabine name his grandfather was born with attus clausus said icilius ah yes and now the grandson is chief among the decemvirs a thoroughly unpleasant fellow always swaggering about surrounded by lictors wearing a purple toga and expecting everyone he meets to do his bidding that man enjoys being a decemvir entirely too much and now he proposes to ban intermarriage the patrician hypocrite only a few months ago he asked me for verginias hand papa verginia spoke up i dont think you should mention why not its not as if either you or i led the old goat on in any way let jupiter strike me down if i tell a lie a few months ago appius claudius asked if he might marry verginia and what did you say asked icilia i told him no of course not that the match would have been unsuitable appius claudius a widower with grown children may be a bit old for verginia but the claudii have made quite a name for themselves in three short generations and they are patricians however newly minted verginius said this in an offhand way but clearly he didnt mind letting icilius know that his daughter could have married a patrician if verginius had so chosen i rejected appius claudius as a suitor because i dont like the fellowits as simple as that couldnt stand the idea of having him be my soninlaw or the father of my grandchildren i much prefer you lucius and more importantly so does verginia verginius laughed heartily and rose from his dining couch to give his daughter a kiss she turned her face to offer her cheek by doing so she also hid her expression from everyone in the room another toast then said icilius another verginius fell back on his couch and pretended to groan yes a toast to love to love indeed said verginius to venus the goddess of love who has clearly blessed this union with the spark of mutual desire what could be better than a genuine love match of which both fathers approve the men drank more wine then burst out laughing the mothers laughed as well caught up in the mens exuberance even dark icilia ceased frowning threw back her head and laughed only verginia failed to laugh from the moment her father had mentioned appius claudius the decemvir and the mans thwarted desire to marry her an uneasy look had settled on her face the next day icilia and verginia went shopping together in the market chaperoned by their mothers the two girls had been raised in different circles and had few acquaintances in common yet since they were soon to be sistersinlaw everyone expected them to begin acting as if they were already old friends their recent outings together since the announcement of verginias betrothal to lucius felt forced and artificial to both of them their mothers endlessly preoccupied with wedding details had more to talk about than they did to complicate matters each of the girls had a problem that weighed upon her but as yet felt unready to share her secret with the other they moved though the market side by side sporadically making conversation each wrapped up in her own private thoughts what do you think of this verginia icilia ran her fingers over a bolt of finely woven yellow linen the merchant grinned from syracuse on the island of sicily all the best things come from syracuse and i offer them at the best prices syracuse had originally been founded by colonists from corinth and was nearly as old as roma it was one of many greek colonies not only on sicily but across the southern part of italy a region so heavily settled by greeks that the romans called it magna graecia great greece romans had traded with these cities for generations and had so far avoided becoming embroiled in the endless wars they fought against one another in recent years syracuse had emerged as the most brilliant the most free and the most prosperous city in all of the western mediterranean the syracusan fleet dominated the tyrrhenian sea syracusan merchants built warehouses in ostia at the mouth of the tiber to house the goods they traded with roma and her neighbors syracusan grain more than once had saved roma from famine syracusan scholars taught in the best roman households iciliuss tutor xenon came from syracuse its alright i suppose said verginia hardly looking at the fabric her thoughts were clearly elsewhere perhaps the young ladies would be more interested in pottery and earthenware suggested the merchant the young ladies may as yet have no households of their own but soon enough two such pretty girls will find themselves married and will be requiring cups and pitchers for entertaining the merchant could see by their simple longsleeved tunicae that the girls were still unmarried they had not yet graduated to the more complicated stolas worn by their mothers he held up a black pitcher this pattern is particularly beautiful the red border is an unusual variation on a traditional greek key design icilia who had frowned and turned aside as soon as the man mentioned marriage suddenly saw a familiar face across the crowded market her heart leapt into her throat looking over her shoulder she saw that their mothers deep in conversation had strolled on ahead impulsively icilia gripped verginias arm pulled her away from the nattering merchant and whispered in her ear verginia you must do me a favor what is it icilia please i beg of you icilia whats the matter nothing is the matter but i must leave you for a momentonly a moment i promise if our mothers come back and miss me saysay that i had to step into the womens lavatory above the cloaca maxima and if they ask why i didnt go with you or if they decide to go looking for you then sayoh i dont know what verginia smiled she was not sure what icilia was up to but from various small signs she had come to suspect that luciuss sister must have a secret suitor perhaps this had something to do with him if icilia was still not ready to tell her the details here was an opportunity for verginia to earn her trust and for the two girls to become closer was that not exactly what their mothers desired of course ill help you icilia do what you mustbut dont be too long i dont have much experience at telling falsehoods to my mother fortuna bless you verginia i shall be very quick i promise casting a final glance at their mothers who had ambled further ahead she vanished into the crowd he had glimpsed her at the same instant she glimpsed him he was waiting for her just around the corner from where she had seen him with an anxious grin on his face icilia titus oh titus it was all she could do not to kiss him right there but although they were away from the heavy traffic of the market they were still visible eagerly he took her arm and led her around another corner into a narrow space between two buildings that was shielded from view by the foliage of a cypress tree he held her body against his and kissed her for a long time icilia was not shy the very impossibility of their relationship encouraged her to abandon all restraint during the rare fleeting moments she was with him she ran her hands over his strong shoulders inside the neck of his tunic and onto his chest which was covered by fine blond hair her fingers encountered the talisman he wore fascinus he called the curious pendant saying it was a god that had protected his family for centuries icilia could not help thinking that fascinus had fallen down on the job in recent generations it was hard to believe that the potitii had once been wealthy even tituss best tunics were threadbare the first time icilia had seen him he was wearing the one garment he owned that was not covered with patches the priestly robe he wore at the ara maxima watching him officiate at the altar with his father she had been swept away by his good looks afterward it had taken considerable ingenuity on her part to make his acquaintance the passion that had stirred between them was so immediate and so overwhelming it must have been the hand of venus that guided them to one another yet when icilia mentioned titus potitius in a very roundabout way to her father he had reacted with a vehemence that startled her icilia at first assumed it was tituss poverty or simply his patrician status that offended her father and hoped these barriers might be overcome it was her brother lucius who had explained to her the reason for the declining fortunes of the potitiithe fact that tituss grandfather had fought alongside coriolanus no wonder her father had reacted so violently the name of coriolanus was accursed in their house and so would be the name of any traitor who had been his ally never would her father agree to let her marry a potitius nor would tituss father approve such a match for it had been an icilius who engineered the exile of coriolanus and by extension the ruin of tituss grandfather the situation was impossible these brief stolen moments were all she would ever have with titus yet her craving for these encounters was almost more than she could bear and in the days between them she thought of little else when titus began to lift the hem of his tunic as well as her own and to press his hardness between her legs she offered no resistance instead she clutched him as hard as she could praying that the gods would stop time and make this moment last forever titus entered her he moved inside her his breath was hot in her ear a fire was ignited at the very core of her being and radiated outward building toward an ecstatic release the rapture reached its pinnacle the pleasure was so intense so perfect how she could doubt the rightness of their union that she should love titus must be the will of the gods which superseded the objections of all petty mortals including her father afterward as he was gasping for breath titus whispered in her ear we must try again we must go to our fathers and beg them to let us marry there must be a way to convince them no my father will never icilia left the sentence unfinished and shook her head the sensation of ecstasy quickly waned and was replaced by hopelessness and despair even if he did approve it wouldnt matter the new lawssuch a terrible rumor what are you saying my brother heard it from his tutor the new laws from the decemvirsthey want to outlaw marriage between patricians and plebeians if that happens theres no hope at all titus clenched his jaw ive heard the rumor as well the whole world conspires against us he sighed and kissed her lips icilia stiffened titus i have to go now are you afraid verginia will tell on you no but our mothers are with us theyre probably missing me right now if titus silenced her by pressing his mouth over hers and drawing her breath away but when she pushed against him he released her she slipped away from him her final touch was a fingertip pressed to the talisman at his breast and then she was gone go away you horrible man back in the market verginia found herself accosted not for the first time by the wheedling little man who called himself marcus claudius the creature certainly hadnt been born a claudius she thought he must have been a slave who took his masters family name when he was manumitted as was the custom marcus claudius had the cringing ingratiating manner of a slave continuously titling his head to one side as if to duck a blow licking his lips and giving her a sidelong leer but why wont you come dear girl he merely wishes to talk to you i have nothing to say to appius claudius but theres so much he wants to say to you i dont want to hear it it will take only a moment hes just over there the man pointed to a building on the far side of the market in the spice shop he owns it theres a cozy little apartment in the upper story do you see that window with the shutters ajar hes watching you even now verginia gazed above the awnings of the market at the building across the way bright sunlight made her squint and shield her eyes not much of the dark interior of the room could be seen but she thought she could discern just barely a shadowy figure standing at the window please go away she said i shall tell my father that would be unwise the decemvir would not wish it said marcus emphasizing appiuss claudius title the decemvir is a powerful man verginia was suddenly short of breath do you threaten my father not i young lady not i who is lowly marcus claudius to think he could ever do harm to a great warrior like verginius oh no it would take a powerful man to bring about your fathers ruin a very powerful man indeed a decemvir perhaps verginia looked at the window she could definitely see the shadowy figure of a bearded man look do you see said marcus he has a gift for you the figure drew closer to the window its outlines became clearer the man was holding something when he extended his hand a bit of sunlight glittered on the object marcus whispered in her ear do you see it a pretty gift for a pretty girla silver necklace with baubles of lapis lazuli how pretty those blue jewels would look against your white throat the man giggled i think he has another gift for you in his other hand while the figure at the window held up the necklace his other hand appeared to be pressing and kneading something beneath his tunic near the middle of his body verginia stifled a cry and tore herself away from marcus she ran headlong into icilia where have you been she cried i looked and looked for you and then that horrible man ah there they are icilias mother standing on tiptoe called out and waved to them from across the crowd what man whispered icilia verginia looked behind her marcus had melted into the crowd she looked at the window above the spice shop the shutters were closed then their mothers were upon them and even if the two girls had wanted to confide in each other they could not a few days later scrolls containing the first portion of the twelve tables were nailed to the posting wall in the forum a great crowd gathered made up of both patricians and plebeians a man with good eyes and a clear voice volunteered to read the scrolls aloud so that the rest could hear including the great majority who could not read he was frequently interrupted by exclamations and questions and when he was done the crowd engaged in a lively discussion in which many voices were raised clearly the new laws affirm the traditional rights of the paterfamilias very good for as long as theres a breath in his body a man should have control over his wife and his offspring and over their wives and offspring as well but what of this right for the head of a household to sell his sons and grandsons into bondage and later buy them back its already being done every day a man falls into debt so he barters his son for a period of servitude the new law merely codifies the common practiceand sets a limit on how many times a man can do it which is a good thing for the sons and grandsons and what about the law giving freed slaves full rights of citizenship why not as often as not a slave is the bastard child of his master the offspring of a slave girl in the household if the master sees fit to free the bastard then the fellow ought to become a citizen just like the rest of the mans sons perhaps the decemvirs havent done such a bad job after all now if only they would see fit to lay down their offices call back the senate and let us elect new consuls and dont forget the tribunes of the plebs the peoples protectors the peoples bullies you mean please citizens please let us not be drawn into that old argument the very purpose of the twelve tables is to heal the rifts within the city and allow us to move forward standing a little away from the crowd icilia strained to hear what the men were saying it would not do for a young woman to stride into their midst or shout a question yet she was desperate to know if the rumored ban on intermarriage was among the posted laws she and verginia had been on their way to the temple of fortuna to consult an auspex who would pick a new date for verginias nuptials verginius had abruptly been called away on military duty and the wedding would have to be postponed for at least a month their mothers chattering away had gotten a little ahead of them and when icilia saw the crowd and realized what they were talking about she begged verginia to tarry with her for a moment its no good she finally muttered shaking her head none of them is discussing marriage its all about slavery and powers of the paterfamilias we can go now verginia verginia she looked about verginia was nowhere to be seen the two mothers had missed them and were heading back looking displeased icilia cried her mother you must keep up no dawdling we have too much to do today where is verginia i dont know was she not with you yes but we stopped for just a moment i turned away and when i looked back icilia was interrupted by a man who came running up to them looking alarmed arent you the wife of verginius he said verginias mother nodded where is your husband he must come at once hes not in the city where is he away on military duty whats happening im not sure but its very strange your daughter verginia what about her come and see the man led them across the forum toward the building where the decemvirs met a small crowd had gathered in front of the building at the center of the crowd flanked by the lictors who customarily guarded the entrance was marcus claudius in his fist he held a rope the end of which was tied around the neck of verginia who stood trembling beside him with downcast eyes and a red face verginias mother gasped in horror what is the meaning of this she cried pushing her way through the crowd men stepped back to make way for her but when she attempted to remove the rope from her daughters neck the lictors brandished their axes and cudgels she shrieked and started back who are you what have you done to my daughter my name is marcus claudius he looked down his nose at her and this female is not your child or course she is this is my daughter verginia you lie this female was born in my household a slave years ago she disappeared stolen in the night only now have i discovered that she was taken into the household of a certain lucius verginius apparently the scoundrel has been passing her off as his daughter and is even now conspiring to arrange a marriage for her under false pretenses verginias mother was stupefied this is madness of course verginia is my daughter i gave birth to her this is my child let her go at once marcus claudius smirked stealing another mans slave and perpetrating a fraudulent marriage are serious crimes under the new laws decreed by the decemvirs what do you have to say for yourself woman verginias mother sputtered and began to weep when my husband yes where is the scoundrel away from the city i see he must have gotten wind that i had discovered his ruse and hes made his escape thats ridiculous this is absurd verginias mother looked pleadingly at the crowd around her some of the men looked at her with pity but some with scorn some openly leered excited by the spectacle of a purportedly wellborn girl revealed as a slave and exhibited with a rope around her neck while the woman claiming to be her mother dashed about in a frenzy icilias mother strode forward to try to calm her but icilia noticed that her manner was strained and her expression was hard to read had the man called marcus claudius sparked a doubt in her mind he claimed that verginius was deliberately perpetuating a fraud if that was true the victims of that fraud were the icilii what sort of man would offer a daughter in marriage and deliver a slave instead and a stolen slave at that icilia could think of only one thing to do find her brother she headed home running as fast as she could marcus claudius crossed his arms clearly wife of verginius since you will not confess to the theft of my slave and instead persist in claiming that shes your daughter her identity will have to be determined by a court of law the court normally in charge of handling such disputes is currently suspended the decemvirs handle all such cases i believe the decemvir in charge of this particular kind of dispute is then call on the decemvirs at once cried verginias mother but in the meantime give her back to me marcus stroked his chin and pursed his lips i think not if her purported father were present i might be persuaded to give her up to himbut not to a woman who can have no legal standing im her mother so you say but where is the man to vouch for that assertion since verginius is not present i will relinquish possession of this female only to a proper authority a number of men in the crowd even those who appeared to sympathize with verginias mother nodded and grunted their approval swayed by marcuss legal reasoning i will give her up only to a decemvir ah look there heres just the man to take responsibility this is the decemvir in charge of deciding such cases appius claudius had appeared seemingly by chance he wore the purple toga with a gold border which the decemvirs affected as their official dress and was accompanied by a bodyguard of lictors he carried himself with great dignity his graying hair and welltrimmed beard gave him a distinguished look with an expression of innocent curiosity he strode through the crowd verginia who had stood motionless for a long time paralyzed by shame hugged herself and began to tremble violently the girls mother fell at appius claudiuss feet decemvir help us she cried of course ill help you good woman he said quietly reaching down to touch her brow he addressed marcus citizen whats happening here his voice was low and steady there was the slightest quaver almost imperceptible to match the fire of excitement that blazed behind his eyes let me explain decemvir said marcus ive just retrieved this wayward slave girl who escaped from my household years ago verginia suddenly clutched the rope around her neck and tried to bolt away but marcus reacting at once tightened his grip on the rope and when she reached the limit of the tether verginia was wrenched to the ground her mother gave a scream of horror appius claudius raised an eyebrow it seems that ive arrived just in time clearly this situation demands the wisdom and authority that only a decemvir can provide at that moment icilia returned accompanied by her brother both of them breathing hard from running at full speed let her go shouted lucius and who are you young man said appius claudius lucius icilius that girl is to be my wife marcus grunted and gave him a scathing look the female is my slave a slave cannot be any mans wife now if i should decided to breed the bitch lucius ran toward him bellowing with rage and swinging his fists the lictors held him back stop this outrage at once shouted appius claudius youre disturbing the peace this man is trying to abduct a freeborn girl shouted lucius thats the outrage if only we still had tribunes to protect us ah now i know who you are said appius claudius the scion of the icilii a family famous for firebrands and rabblerousers well young man bemoan the absence of the tribunes all you like the decemvirs are the only officers of state and it is by a decemvir that this matter must be decided since i happen to be the decemvir in charge of such property disputes this is not a property dispute its an abduction perhaps young man but that is for me to decide decemvir you know this girl this is verginia the daughter of lucius verginius did you yourself not ask for lucius stopped himself that fact that appius claudius had asked to wed verginiaa fact revealed by verginius after drinking too much winewas not a matter lucius would discuss in public young man if you persist in this agitation inciting the crowd to violence i shall have no choice but to order my lictors to stop you i shall empower them to use all necessary force once i give that order you may be killed on the spot icilia gripped his arm brother do as he says calm yourself lucius shook free of her grip his rage turned to tears decemvir dont you see what this man is up to dont you realize what he intends to do to verginia the girl is a virgin shes to be my bride for the sake of decency she cannot spend a night under any mans roof except her fathers i see your worry said appius claudius who used the opportunity to gaze openly at verginia she remained where she had fallen on her hands and knees with the rope around her neck blushing and trembling utterly terrified the decemvirs lips parted his eyes narrowed every man in the crowd was staring at verginia no one noticed the look of lust on appius claudiuss face even lucius seeing verginia in such a shameful position turned his face away appius claudius squared his shoulders and lifted his chin despite his hotheadedness the young icilius is correct until she is determined to be his property the female cannot be left in the possession of marcus claudius pending the return of verginius when an informed judgment can be made regarding the females status i myself shall take her into custody in the meeting hall of the decemvirs i have a private chamber the girl will be perfectly safe there citizen hand me the rope marcus bowing and cocking his head handed the tether to appius claudius the decemvir bent down to touch verginias cheek which was wet with tears on your feet girl come with me he took her arm to help her up few saw just how hard he gripped her digging his fingers into her flesh until she whimpered in pain quaking with fear verginia stumbled forward appius claudius put his arm around her shoulder and whispered in her ear an onlooker might assume he was speaking words of reassurance and comfort in fact no longer able to restrain himself he was saying the things he had long dreamed of saying to her telling her exactly what he intended to do to her as soon as they were alone in his room verginia stiffened and opened her mouth in shock but no sound came out as appius claudius led her into the building verginia gripped the doorway and managed a faint cry for help lucius gave a cry of anguish and ran after them the lictors converged on him they knocked him to the ground and struck him with their cudgels angered at seeing one of their own receive a public beating a group of young plebs in the crowd rushed at the lictors and helped lucius to his feet screams rent the air and blood was spilled on the paving stones more lictors emerged from the building the crowd quickly dispersed shaken and bleeding lucius limped home assisted by his mother and sister verginias mother followed them weeping uncontrollably the actions taken by appius claudius that day and in the days that followed would be speculated upon long afterward when the full story came to light it was widely thought that the decemvir must have fallen prey to a kind of madness surely no reasonable man would have thought that the ruse put forth by marcus claudius would withstand scrutiny or that the people of roma simply would not care about verginias fate and yet at all times appius claudius exercised a kind of reasoning for each step of his scheme had to have been planned in advance and carefully executed even the order calling verginius to military service it turned out had originated with the decemvir appius claudius had not merely taken advantage of a situation that arose or submitted to a sudden temptation that overwhelmed his better judgment he deliberately orchestrated the situation and exploited it with unswerving ruthlessness within an hour of verginias abduction lucius sent a messenger to the military camp outside the city where verginius had been posted verginius rode through the night and returned to roma the next morning the two men verginias father and her betrothed at once set out for the forum where they told their story to any who would listen overnight word of the incident had spread throughout the city making verginias plight the talk of roma when people learned that lucius and verginius were speaking publicly they flocked to hear them the two men presented a pitiful sight after an anxious sleepless night of riding verginius was haggard and hoarse lucius had received a severe beating from the lictors his head was wrapped with a bloody bandage and his face was badly bruised with one eye swollen shut his right shoulder had been dislocated and his arm was in a sling citizens cried verginius many of you know me many more have heard my name ive fought in many battles for roma i fought the aequi under cincinnatus if any man has earned your respect as a soldier its me but what is it that we fight for when we risk our lives in battle we fight to keep our wives and our children safe yet look whats happened even while i was in the field preparing for battle the very thing i fear most took place right here in the forummy daughter a virgin as pure as any vestal was taken from her mother and kept overnight against her will was it done by some savage invader no she was taken by a patrician a man many of you admire and respect although you wouldnt be far wrong if you called him a sabine invader attus clausus was his grandfathers name and i curse the day that sabine pig was admitted to the senate some cheered at this but others booed one man shouted the girl isnt even your daughter shes another mans slave thats a lie there is no question whatsoever about my daughters identity she was abducted in broad daylight and for one purpose onlyto satisfy the lusts of the decemvir appius claudius citizens can you imagine how painful it is for me to even speak of this the shame i feel that i should have to beg for your help in such a matter are there no fathers among you who can imagine what i fear this is ludicrous shouted another man i was there i saw what happened for you to suggest that the decemvir plotted the whole thingits too farfetched a man like appius claudius has too much to lose to ever behave in such a reckless fashion now its possible this shady character marcus claudius was perpetrating a scheme or maybe marcuss story is true said the man who had first interrupted verginius stranger things have happened romulus and remus were princes but they were raised by a swineherd whats to stop a stolen slave girl being raised as a citizens daughter verginia is my daughter my own flesh and blood maybe so said the man and maybe marcus claudius made an honest mistake in that case the decemvir was absolutely right to take charge of the situation instead of tearing your hair and making terrible accusations against appius claudius you should be thanking the man this is insane cried lucius dont you see whats happened a patrician has taken a plebeian girl against her will and against the will of her father and her betrothed who knows what hes done to her overnight it drives me mad to think about it a group of plebeians in the crowd roused by luciuss tears became so infuriated that they began to strike the men who had argued against verginius accusing them of being agents in the pay of appius claudius but whether paid or not there were more adherents of the decemvir in the crowd than the hotheads realized once violence erupted the two sides appeared to be evenly matched eventually lictors emerged from the decemvirs hall and dispersed the crowd all day verginius and lucius remained in the forum speaking to all who would listen again and again crowds gathered and erupted in violence the unruly mobs were repeatedly dispersed but came back in greater numbers each time at last late in the afternoon appius claudius emerged from the decemvirs hall protected by lictors he looked utterly serene indeed he looked quite pleased with himself i am ready to render judgment in the matter of the identity of the female known as verginia he announced erect a tribunal a platform was set up and a chair of state placed upon it appius claudius mounted the tribunal and sat resplendent in his purple toga lucius pushed his way to the front of the crowd the decemvirs smug expression sickened him lictors surrounded the tribunal one of the men who had beaten him the previous day smirked at him lucius trembled with rage appius claudius cleared his throat ive already heard the arguments put forth by marcus claudius privately in my chamber his case is persuasive he mentioned a certain physical characteristic of the slave girl who was stolen from him i was able to ascertain with my own eyes the presence of this distinguishing mark by examining the girl myself what mark cried lucius there is no need to reveal that information what mark demanded lucius the decemvir smiled coyly i would prefer to be less explicit but since you insist on knowing there is a small birthmark on the inside of the girls left thigh the location of the mark is such that no man could possibly have seen it except a husband or as in the case of marcus claudius a citizen who had occasion to intimately examine his slaves lucius covered his face and wept nonetheless said appius claudius it remains for me to hear what this fellow verginius has to say for himself the charge of abducting another mans slave and trying to marry her off as a freeborn girl is quite serious this is a mockery of justice cried lucius you stripped her naked you saw what there was to see and whatever you saw marcus claudius could claim to be the distinguishing mark by which he could identify her be quiet young man unless you desire another beating i dont think you would survive it in fact im certain you would not the smirking lictor suddenly struck luciuss bandaged head with his cudgel lucius screamed and dropped to his knees step forward verginius looking like the ghost of himself verginius made his way to the tribunal beside him stood an elderly woman wearing a simple tunica who is this woman said appius claudius verginiuss voice was very hoarse decemvir this is one of my slaves the nurse who cared for verginia when she was a baby she still resides in my household as you can see she is very old but her memory is sharp i called her here because he hesitated like a man telling a story who has lost his place i brought her because it occurs to me thatthat there is a possibilitythat perhaps when my daughter was still very young she was taken from me and a slave was left in her place my newborn daughter too had a distinguishing mark if the woman who nursed her could now examine verginiaas you yourself were able to examine her he gritted his teeth if you will allow this decemvir then perhaps after all i might be persuaded that the girl whom i thought to be my daughter is not appius claudius shook his head i cant give you custody of the girl for such a purpose you might abscond with her i dont ask for custody decemvir if the nurse and i could simply be allowed to see verginia briefly in a private place the decemvir stroked his beard and said nothing the crowd grew restive a citizen cried out let him see the girl others joined him yes let verginius see her at last appius claudius nodded very well you and the nurse may enter my chambers and examine the female two of my lictors will escort you verginius and the woman made their way to the entrance of the building lucius rushed to join them but verginius shook his head no lucius this task is not for you but i must see her no verginia is my daughter not your wife this duty falls to me and to me alone verginius and the nurse stepped inside the building the meeting room was empty one of the lictors led them down a long hallway to the chamber of appius claudius the lictor allowed verginius and the nurse to enter the room alone but he would not allow them to close the door behind them then avert your eyes demanded verginius the lictor glowered at him but turned his face away the room was small and dark and far enough from the crowded forum that no sound from outside could be heard while verginius and lucius had harangued the citizenry all day this was where appius claudius had kept himself shut away alone with verginia verginius wrinkled his nose the lictor grunted smells like a whorehouse doesnt it verginia was sitting on a couch strewn with rumpled coverlets she rose and clutched her breasts her face was red from weeping papa thank the gods at last verginius turned his face away nurse examine her lictor keep your eyes averted the old nurse stepped forward at the sight of her verginia seemed to become a child she stood passively and made no resistance as the woman lifted her tunica and stooped over to peer between her legs verginiuss voice was a hoarse whisper barely audible what do you see master the child is no longer a virgin the old woman shuddered and began to sob the lictor snickered verginia stepped back from the nurse and pushed down her tunica her lips quivered papa she said she looked at the floor not at her father and her voice trembled with fear verginius moved quickly toward her she abruptly threw open her arms in the posture of a woman expecting an embrace or surrendering to a blow verginius reached into his tunic and drew out a dagger with the last of his voice he gave a cry of anguish the sound that emerged was ghastlya hoarse stifled croak it was the last sound verginia would hear only moments after he had entered the building verginius emerged carrying his daughter in his arms the redfaced lictor ran out after him decemvir it happened before i could stop it i never thought appius claudius rose from his chair of state he clenched his fists but his face registered no expression like a warm wind through a wheat field a murmur passed through the crowd traveling from those who could see verginius back to those who could not the murmur was followed by gasps and stifled cries as men rushed forward to see for themselves a few catching only a glimpse of the girls body thought that she was alive and being carried like a child they cried out in triumph that verginius had rescued his daughter then they saw how the girls arm swayed with each step as limp and lifeless as her hair they saw the red stain on her breast cries of joy turned to cries of anguish marcus claudius appeared spreading his arms to block verginiuss way he glanced over his shoulder at the decemvir with a look of panic in his eyes appius claudius barely raised an eyebrow what have you done you fool shouted marcus claudius the girlmy property this is your doing said verginius yours and the decemvirs you gave me no choice she was my daughter i did the only thing a father could do let the gods judge me let them look down and judge you as well he faced the tribunal and raised the body in his arms and let the gods judge you appius claudius the decemvirs face might have been made of stone only his eyes showed a flicker of emotion which some interpreted as fear but other as derision the crowd was startled by a cry of agony lucius appeared his hands clutching his head his face contorted almost beyond recognition he dropped to his knees before verginius he seized verginias hand clutching it desperately he pressed it to his lips then let it drop horrified by the lifeless flesh he gathered handfuls of her hair sobbed and hid his face amid her tresses up on the tribunal anticipating what was to come appius claudius called for his lictors to gather around him all roma seemed to draw a final breath and then the riot began all the violence that had come before was as nothing compared to the fury that swept through the forum and spilled into the streets beyond the whole city descended into a kind of madness the mobs outrage at the fate of verginia unleashed vast stores of anger and resentment that had nothing to do with the singular villainies perpetrated on her by appius claudius amid the uproar men acted on their most reckless impulses and indulged their darkest cravings for vengeance and retribution men were chased through the streets and beaten without mercy houses were broken into and vandalized old scores were settled with unrestrained violence much blood was spilled in roma that daybut not the blood of appius claudius only his death could have satisfied the angry mob only the sight of his corpse next to that of verginia could have calmed the riot the chair of state was smashed and the tribunal was torn down appius claudius was not amid the wreckage men pushed past the lictors broke into the meeting hall and ran through every room the decemvir was nowhere to be found his inexplicable escape was like a spiteful trick played upon the mob a deliberate insult to their righteous fury almost forgotten amid the chaos verginius lowered the body of his daughter to the ground and knelt over her joined by lucius father and lover wept uncontrollably adding their tears to the blood that stained verginias breast bc by the time icilias pregnancy began to show many things had changed in roma the change that most intimately affected her was the death of her father walking through the forum one day icilius had clutched his chest and fallen by the time he arrived home carried on a litter his heart had stopped beating upon their fathers death icilias brother lucius became paterfamilias it was lucius who would decide icilias fate and the fate of her unborn child great changes had also taken place in the city the tragic end of verginia had shaken roma to its foundations had appius claudius possessed any idea of the forces his mad scheme would unleash it was hard to imagine how any man however blinded by lust or arrogance could have proceeded on such a reckless course for generations to come his name would be a synonym for that which the greeks called hubrisa pride so overbearing that the gods themselves are compelled to annihilate the offender did appius claudius anticipate verginiuss intention to kill his daughter did he deliberately allow it to happen having coldbloodedly determined that this was his best course of action in the aftermath of the upheaval some put forth this opinion they argued that appius claudius had already had his way with the girl and thus had no further use for her she had become a liability to him her death would relieve him of the responsibility to determine her identity and what better solution than to goad her father into committing the act appius claudius thought he had found a way to take what he wanted without paying a price if a man had power and was clever and was brazen enough to follow through on a ruthless scheme then even for the most terrible crime he might hope to avoid punishment others said that even appius claudius could not be that cold and calculating having desired verginia so desperately that he would carry out such a dangerous plot surely a single night and day had not exhausted his appetite for her the fact that his face showed no reaction to her death was because he was utterly stunned by what verginius had done whatever his intentions the decemvirs desire for verginia had nothing to do with politics yet the girls father and betrothed managed to convince their fellow plebeians otherwise a merciless patrician had despoiled a plebeian virgin beaten and humiliated her outraged plebeian suitor and driven her distraught plebeian father to an act of uttermost shame and desperation all the discontent sewn by the decemvirs tyranny came to a head over the outrage committed against verginia for the first time in a generation the plebeians staged a secession such as the one which had won them the right to elect tribunes plebeian citydwellers withdrew from the city plebeian farmers put aside their plows plebeian soldiers refused to fight their demand was the end of the decemvirs and in particular the arrest trial and punishment of appius claudius in the end after much bombast and negotiation all ten decemvirs resigned some managed to escape trial others were charged with misconduct and forbidden to leave the city including appius claudius who barricaded himself in his wellguarded house and refused to come out his abuses were the most egregious of the decemvirs yet he seemed to be the least repentant bitter and unwavering to the end appius claudius hanged himself rather than face the judgment of the court marcus claudius the accomplice of the decemvir was too cowardly to follow his masters example he was brought to trial and condemned verginius himself requested that the villain be spared the penalty of death and marcus was allowed to flee into exile it was said that on the day he left roma the ghost of verginia which for months had wandered from house to house across the seven hills weeping and moaning in the night terrifying children and rending the hearts of their parents at last found peace and ceased to haunt the city the senate reassembled new magistrates were elected among the new tribunes of the plebs were verginius and young lucius icilius the bitterness felt toward the decemvirs as men and as tyrants was almost universal but their labor as lawmakers was widely respected the twelve tables were accepted by a consensus of both patricians and plebeians and became the law of the land the new laws were cast in tablets of bronze which were posted in the forum where any citizen could read them or have them read aloud to him no longer would roman law be a matter of oral traditionan accretion of moldering precedents momentary whims hazy surmises and recondite deductionsknown only to experienced senators and jurists instead the twelve tables were there for all to see virtually every citizen had a quibble or two with some provision of the new laws but these objections were swept aside by the overwhelming value of the twelve tables as a whole once the spoken word of kings had been the highest authority then that of the elected consuls now the written word was king to which each citizen had access on the day the bronze tablets were posted icilia dressed in the plain tunica of one of her slave girls and slipped away from her house she waited in the secluded place near the market where her child had been conceived titus was to meet her there he did not yet know of the childs existence titus arrived late as he slipped past the dense foliage of the cypress tree he managed to smile he kissed her when he drew back the smile had vanished the grimness on his face mirrored her own i came from the forum he said theyve posted the twelve tables youve read them not all but i read the part about marriage he lowered his eyes its just as we feared there can be no marriage between a patrician and a plebeian icilia drew a sharp breath she had been hoping against hope that somehow a marriage to titus might still be possible she had clung desperately to this fantasy for as long as she could now it was gone she felt frightened and utterly alone despite the arms that encircled her titus theres something i must tell you he brushed a strand of hair from her cheek and felt warm tears on this fingertips what must you tell me icilia whatever it is it cant be as bad as what ive just told you titus theres a child growing inside me your child his arms stiffened after a moment he hugged her fiercely and then just as abruptly drew back as if afraid he might harm her on his face was an expression she had never seen on anyone before joyful and despairing at the same time your brother lucius doesnt know yet no one knowsexcept you ive hidden it from everyone but i cant hide it much longer when how soon im not sure i dont know about such thingsand theres no one i can ask fresh tears streamed down her cheeks icilia icilia what are we to do youll have to tell lucius the two of you have always been close perhaps not anymore im afraid of him now ever since verginia died hes a different person he suffers from the beatings he took from the lictors one of his eyes will never be the same theres so much anger in him so much bitterness he never used to hate patricians now hes more vengeful than father ever was he talks of nothing but harming those he hates we cant look to him for help titus but hell have to know sooner or later the decision will be his to make decision she was not sure what he meant he drew back from her just enough to reach up and lift the necklace over his head a bit of sunlight glittered on the golden talisman he called fascinus for our child he said placing it over her neck but titus this belongs to your family its your birthright yes passed from generation to generation since the beginning of time the child inside you is mine icilia i give this talisman to my child the law prevents our marriage even if the law allowed it your brother would forbid it but no law no mannot even the godscan stop us from loving one another the life inside you is the proof of that i give fascinus to you and you will give it to the child you bear the pendant was cold against her flesh and surprisingly heavy titus had claimed it brought good fortune but icilia remembered her doubts oh titus whats to become of us i dont know i only know i love you he whispered he thought she meant the two of them but icilia was thinking of herself and the helpless life within her at that moment she felt the baby stir and give a kick as if pricked by its mothers fear the midwives when lucius angrily consulted them all agreed while there existed means by which a pregnancy could be endedthe insertion of a slender willow branch or the ingestion of the poison called ergotit was much too late to do so without gravely endangering icilia herself unless he cared nothing for his sisters life she must be allowed to bear the child the news clearly displeased lucius the oldest and most wizened of the midwives who had witnessed every possible circumstance attending the birth of child drew him aside calm yourself tribune once the baby is delivered it can easily be disposed of if you wish to save your sister and avoid gossip this is what i advise icilia was sent away from roma to stay with a relative of the midwife who lived in a fishing camp outside ostia there was no need for lucius to invent excuses for his sisters absence a young unmarried woman had little public life few people missed icilia and those who did readily accepted the explanation that she was in seclusion still mourning her father icilias labor was long and difficult the ordeal stretched over a day and a nighttime for word to reach her brother in roma and time for him to arrive in the fishing camp even as the baby was being born afterward when icilia came to her senses the first thing she saw was lucius standing over her in the darkened room her heart leaped with sudden hope surely he would not have come all the way from roma if he simply intended to have the baby drowned in the tiber or cast into the sea brother i was in such pain he nodded i saw the sheets the blood the baby a boy strong and healthy his voice was flat it was hard to read any expression on his face he no longer ever smiled and the upper lid of his bad eye drooped please brother bring him to me icilia reached up with her arms lucius shook his head its best if you never see the child again what are you saying titus potitius came to me a few days ago he asked meno begged meto allow him to adopt your child no one need know where it came from he said ill say it was an orphan from the wars or the child of a distant cousin ive asked my father to let me do this thing and he gave his permission lucius shook his head i told titus potitius it will still be a bastard that doesnt matter he said if its a boy he shall have my name and i shall raise him as my son thats why i came today sister so that you can give the boy to titus icilia sobbed partly from relief partly from sadness lucius grunted to the contrary i told the patrician scum that under no circumstances would he ever come into possession of the child thats why im here i feared potitius might discover your whereabouts and try to lay his hands on the baby i will make sure that doesnt happen icilia clutched his arm no brotheryou mustnt kill him lucius raised an eyebrow causing the other to droop even more that was my intention but now that ive seen the child i have an even better idea i shall take him with me back to roma where i shall raise him as a slave to serve me and my household imagine that a patricians bastard serving as a whipping boy in a plebeian household he smiled grimly pleased at the idea but lucius the child is your nephew no the child is my slave and what of me brother i know a greek trader from croton at the furthest ends of magna graecia hes agreed to take you for his wife you set sail from ostia tomorrow you must never speak of the child you must never return to roma your life will be whatever you make of it you and i shall not speak again lucius such cruelty the fates are cruel icilia fortuna is cruel they robbed me of verginia so now you rob me of my child the child is a bastard and doesnt deserve to live this is an act of clemency sister let me see him no icilia saw that he would not be swayed do one thing for me brother i ask only one thing give him this from me with trembling hands she raised the necklace over her head lucius snatched it from her and studied at it angrily what is this some sort of talisman it didnt come from anyone in our family titus potitius gave it to you didnt he yes lucius stared at it for a long moment then slowly nodded why not it seems to be made of gold i could just as easily take it for myself and melt it down for the value but ill do as you ask i shall let the slave boy have it as a gaudy trinket to decorate his neck it will serve to remind me of his origin let the ancient bloodline of the potitii continue in the veins of a slave and let the slave wear this talisman as a mark of shame the vestal bc on the eve of the greatest catastrophe yet to befall the city the unsuspecting people of roma celebrated their greatest triumph one of the citys oldest rivals had at last been vanquished the city of veii was scarcely twenty miles from roma a man with strong legs could walk the distance in a single day a rider on horseback could journey there and back in a matter of hours yet for generation after generation even as roma conquered more distant enemies veii remained proudly independent sometimes at peace with roma sometimes at war with her in recent generations veii had grown immensely wealthy her alliances with other cities in the region began to threaten romas dominance of the salt route and traffic on the tiber for ten summers in a row romas armies laid siege to veii yet with the coming of each winter and the cessation of warfare veii remained unconquered it would take a very great general to put an end to veii men said at last such a general appeared his name was marcus furius camillus no one who witnessed it would ever forget the triumphal parade of camillus all agreed that it was by far the grandest triumph in memory the number of captives the sheer magnificence of the booty displayed thanks to the opulence of veii and the joyous spirit of the event outstripped all previous triumphs but impressive as they were it was not these details that made the event unforgettable it was the sight of camillus in a chariot pulled by four white horses standing on the viewing platform reserved for religious dignitaries the vestal pinaria let out a gasp she whispered to the vestal standing next to her foslia have you ever seen such a thing i should think not no one has seen such a thing four white horses pinaria shook her head in wonder just like the quadriga of jupiter atop the temple on the capitoline no general has ever done such a thing before declared foslia at seventeen pinaria was the youngest of the six vestals foslia was only five years older but was very studious and something of a knowitall she was especially well versed in the history of religious observances and like every public act in roma a triumph was a religious rite romulus walked on foot for his triumphs tarquinius the elder was the first to ride in a quadriga but no general has ever dared to emulate jupiter and hitch four white horses to his chariot do you think its an impious act asked pinaria that would not be for me to judge said foslia primly still its quite a sight it is indeed foslia smiled and the general is so handsomeeven with his face painted red the two young women looked at one another and laughed the virgo maxima did not approve of such talk but all the vestals indulged in it it seemed to pinaria that when they were not discussing religious matters they were usually talking about men and as often as not about camillus in his fifties the general was more robust than many a man in his thirties with a magnificent mane of white hair a broad chest and powerful limbs do you think he knows how strikingly the white horses set off his white hair asked foslia surely the man who conquered veii has no time for vanity said pinaria nonsense who is vainer than a general especially on the day of his triumph but look there coming up behind himits the statue of juno regina of all the objects taken from veii this was the most prized the massive statue of the citys divine patroness the queenmother of the gods juno in whose honor the grandest temple in all veii had been built for generations juno regina had protected the veiians on the eve of the final battle camillus had vowed that if veii fell he would bring juno regina to roma and built an even grander temple for her now he was making good on the first part of his pledge men who had grown hoarse cheering camillus raised their voices even louder at the sight of the statue it was transported on a massive cart pulled by veiian captives among them the former priests of juno who had been stripped of their robes and put in shackles the statue was made of wood but no joinery was visible the surface had been carved and smoothed by the finest etruscan sculptors and covered with bright paint and precious gilt juno regina sat upon a throne grasping a scepter in one hand and holding a libation bowl in the other with a peacock at her feet magnificent declared foslia there can be no other image of juno to rival it even the statue made by the great vulca for the temple of jupiter cant compare this one is so much largerthree times the size of any mortal the look on the goddesss face is truly sublime and that giant peacock with its wings spreaddid you ever see such a riot of colors while they watched a boy egged on by his friends darted from the crowd he grabbed hold of the loincloth of a captive priest yanked it off and ran back into the crowd whooping and waving the loincloth like a trophy the priest a middleaged man already stumbling from exhaustion turned red and wept from shame unable to cover himself because his hands were shackled to the rope across his shoulder pinaria gasped and foslia raised an eyebrow but neither looked away i wonder what the goddess thinks of that said pinaria keep watching she might speak at any moment are you serious why not you know the story when camillus sent soldiers to take the statue from her temple in veii one of the men just to be funny bowed and asked the goddess if she would like to be taken to her new home what a shock those fellows had when the statue actually noddedand then spoke out loud they thought someone was pulling a prank so they asked her again and as clearly as im speaking to you now she said yes take me to roma at once they say she sounded angry juno regina doesnt like to repeat herself of course she wanted to come here if she hadnt lost affection for the veiians they would never have been conquered camillus has ordered the building of a new temple on the aventine especially to house the statue veiian wealth will pay for materials veiian slaves will supply the labor that naked priest can stop blushing a slave doesnt need clothing to dig a trench or carry bricks do you think the greeks treated the trojans this way after they conquered them asked pinaria among the vestals there had been many discussions of late comparing the fall of veii to the fall of troy a tale that the romans had learned from the greek colonists to the south just as the siege of troy had lasted for ten years so had the siege of veii just as the greeks finally took the city by guileusing the famous trojan horse devised by odysseusso too had the romans finally triumphed by a clever stratagem tunneling under the walls so that roman soldiers could steal inside by night and open the gates of course they did said foslia the trojan women including queen hecuba and the princesses were taken as slaves so were the men at least the ones who werent killed no city is conquered unless its people have offended the gods for the conquerors to kill or enslave the inhabitants is pleasing to the gods the people of roma have always known this the humiliation of our enemies is one of the ways by which we please the gods and by pleasing the gods we continue to prosper as usual foslias religious logic was irrefutable and pinaria gladly deferred to her yet the sight of the disgraced veiian priest disturbed her she turned her head and looked instead at the triumphal chariot which was now receding from them in the direction of the capitoline camillus turning this way and that to wave to the crowd happened to look over his shoulder his gaze abruptly settled on pinaria he ceased waving tilted his head at a quizzical angle and flashed an enigmatic smile foslia grabbed her arm and squealed with delight pinaria hes looking straight at you and why not youre so lovely even with your hair cut short oh if he should look at me that way i think i would die pinarias face turned hot and she lowered her eyes when she dared to look up again the chariot had rounded a corner and was no longer in sight she heard a sudden burst of laughter and applause from the crowd following the statue of juno regina came a flock of geese the white birds strutted forward stretching and flapping their wings craning their necks and honking these were the sacred geese of juno captured from the veiians along with her statue objects of religious veneration but also of goodnatured humor the pampered creatures seemed to understand their exalted position they gazed back at the crowd with haughty heads held high one of the geese suddenly raced forward toward the priest who had been stripped naked and bit the man on the ankle the priest let out a plaintive howl getting back at her former keeper for some transgression i have no doubt whispered foslia the crowd roared with laughter in the last hour of daylight after the sacrifice of a white ox upon an altar before the temple of jupiter and the ritual strangulation of highborn captives in the tullianum as the feasting and dancing in the streets began to die down the vestals convened at the temple of vesta while the others had watched the triumph one of their number as always had been left to tend to the sacred hearthfire within the round temple now her five sister virgins rejoined her for the recitation of evening prayers led by the eldest of them postumia the virgo maxima the keeping of the sacred hearthfire was the primary obligation of their order should the fire ever go out catastrophe and misfortune for roma would surely follow the keeping of their vows of chastity was an equally important obligation should a vestal ever break that vow she might conceal the crime from other mortals but never from the goddess vesta would know and in consequence the hearthfire would sputter and dwindle only a pure virgin could maintain a steady flame in vestas hearth the vestals linked hands and stood in a circle around the flame while the others swayed gently and hummed in harmony the virgo maxima intoned the evening prayer goddess vesta hear us we have kept your flame for another day and now another night descends its darkness illuminated as always by your undying light you warm us you light our way the same unwavering fire that comforted the baby romulus at his birth comforts us here in your temple postumia was the eldest but her short gray hair still had strands of black in it and her voice was strong without a quaver she hummed and swayed with the other virgins for a moment gazing at the flame then recommenced the prayer for thirty years each of us vows to serve you goddess vesta we come to you before the age of ten for ten years we learn for ten years we perform the public rites for ten years we teach the newcomers then we are free to goor stay bless me goddess vesta my thirty years passed years ago but i chose to remain in your service permit me to stay goddess as long as i have eyes to witness the holy flame and strength to tend it as long as i have words and wisdom sufficient to teach the younger virgins bless us all goddess vesta but especially open your embrace to the youngest of us pinaria seven years she has been among us now that foslia has entered her tenth year pinaria is the only novice she still has much to learn give her special guidance goddess vesta pinaria who had entered a kind of trance while humming and watching the flame gave a tiny start at the mention of her name it was not often that the virgo maxima mentioned the vestals by name in her prayers why was she doing so now and why for pinaria what she said next unsettled pinaria even more we pray goddess that you will remember all the vestals who have come before us going back to the days of king romulus who named the first four vestals in roma and king tarquinius the elder who raised our number to six and who in his wisdom imposed a punishment far more terrible than simple death for any vestal who should break her vowsthe punishment that remains in force to this day pinaria drew a sharp breath as did all the vestals their serene thoughts suddenly invaded by images of that most dreadful of all deaths the humming and swaying stopped the little temple became utterly silent except for the crackling of the hearthfire pinarias heart was beating so hard that she thought the others must be able to hear it why had the virgo maxima mentioned her in the prayer and in the very next breath spoken of the terrible punishment for those who strayed give all of us strength goddess vesta whispered postumia the way of the vestal is not always easy and harder for some than for others only the presence of your hearthfire within our hearts can keep us pure the prayer ended the vestals released each others hands beyond the open doorway of the temple twilight had turned to darkness you may each ignite a taper from the sacred flame to light your way safely back to the house of the vestals its pinarias turn to tend the flame for the next four hours since shes a novice ill stay with her for a while but virgo maxima ive tended the flame plenty of times before all by myself i know how to pinaria saw postumias withering gaze and lowered her eyes of course virgo maxima im honored that youll stay with me the others filed out carrying their tapers foslia the last to leave glanced back at pinaria with a guilty look on her face before she shut the door behind her for a long time postumia stared at the flame and said nothing at last she took a deep breath you may find this hard to imagine pinaria but once upon a time i was your age i was not as beautiful as youoh no not nearly as beautiful for better or worse pinaria with your auburn hair and your bright green eyes you are an exceptionally lovely girl but i was young and passably pretty and very very vain as only a young girl can be i took my vow of chastity very seriously but nonetheless i saw no harm in adorning myself i wore bracelets made of silver and sometimes a necklace of carnelian that had belonged to my grandmother i told people that i thought the red stone went very well with the red and white fillet we wear around our heads but in fact i thought it set off the pink glow of my cheeks i anointed my hands and face with a scented oil that came all the way from egyptor so claimed the merchant who came once a month to the house of the vestals to offer us such things the virgo maxima allowed this said pinaria postumia never permitted any of the vestals to wear jewelry or to use any sort of perfume or unguent and while men were allowed to enter the house of the vestals during daylight hoursnever after darkthey could do so only if they had official or family business with one of the virgins a seller of scented oils would never be permitted inside the virgo maxima in those days was very permissive she doted on the younger vestals she doted particularly on me i was her favorite she encouraged me how pretty that necklace looks on you postumia she would say or my what lovely skin you have so flawless and smooth i cant blame her for my vanity but she certainly did nothing to discourage it nor did she discourage my flirtatious nature vanity leads to flirtation you see what good is being pretty if no one notices and how can a girl know that shes noticed unless she looks others in the eye first she accepts their admiring gazes and after that she accepts their spoken compliments and after that postumia shook her head such behavior is dangerous for a vestal very dangerous and it all begins with the eyes a man gazes at us and we accept his gaze with pleasure and that pleasure which seems so innocent leads us to desire other pleasures pinaria frowned virgo maxima i dont understand why youre telling me this i never wear jewelry you dont allow it and even if you did i have no desire camillus looked at you today pinaria blinked perhaps he looked at you with pleasure pinaria shrugged did he i couldnt say whether and it gave you pleasure did it not that such a great man the hero of the hour so strong and handsome should desire to look at you pinarias face grew hot i did nothing wrong virgo maxima you returned his gaze perhaps but only for an instant pinaria furrowed her brow for a brief irreverent moment she imagined that the virgo maxima was jealous of the look camillus had given her virgo maxima surely camillus is a pious man no roman is more respectful of the gods or more beloved by them before the final siege of veii he pledged to build a grand new temple for juno regina and in return the goddess allowed him to capture the city as well he pledged a tenth portion of all the booty to the god apollo i dont question the piety of camillus but a pious man is a man nonetheless pinaria pinaria i dont mean that camillus himself poses a threat to youunless you were to lead him on the threat comes from within yourself but virgo maxima silence postumias bosom rose and fell in a sudden access of emotion she watched the flames until she grew calmer listen to me pinaria as i told you when i was your age i was very vain i adorned myself i accepted the gazes of menand returned them i laughed when they said amusing things i tried to be witty in return and when men laughed i felt a flush of excitement i did nothing wrongcertainly nothing that betrayed my vow to vesta but my behavior attracted attention the year that i was elevated from novice to fullfledged priestess a series of bad omens occurred a goat was born with two heads a summer hailstorm rained tiny frogs worst of all one augury after another indicated misfortune on the battlefield the people were alarmed they wanted to know the cause had the military commanders failed to make proper sacrifices to the gods was the pontifex maximus at faulthad the highest authority of the state religion been derelict in his duties or had the priests who keep the sibylline books misread the prophecies and led the people astray all these possibilities were investigated yet no fault could be found with the performance of any of the sacred rites and no impurity was detected in those charged with carrying out those rites and thenthe investigation turned to me again postumia fell silent for a long time staring at the flame do you know the penalty imposed on a vestal who is found to have lost her virginity pinaria was barely able to speak about a whisper of course i do virgo maxima then tell me pinaria swallowed hard if a vestal is charged with breaking her vow of chastity the pontifex maximus himself investigates the matter a board of priests renders judgment if they find her guilty go on the priests strip her of her vestments the man with whom she broke her vows is brought before her in chains and beaten to death before her eyes then the priests turn their fury on the vestal they scourge her with whips until she can no longer stand they dress her like a corpse all in black and tie her with leather straps to a funeral bier so tightly that she cant cry out they place the bier upon a funeral wagon draped in black and the wagon is paraded through the city for all to see just as if the vestal were already dead and being taken to her funeral go on they take her to a place where a crypt has been dug beneath the city wall they remove her from the wagon and lower her into the crypt they seal the entrance and cover it with a mound of earth no funeral rites are conducted for her she is never spoken of again pinarias mouth was so dry that she could hardly speak no man kills her no man sees her die what happens to her in the tomb is known only to vesta postumia nodded gravely who was the last vestal to receive this punishment pinaria furrowed her brow come come pinaria foslia would answer in a heartbeat i remember now it was almost a hundred years ago it was exactly seventynine years ago said postumia harshly in the days of my grandmother as you say virgo maxima what were the circumstances what was the vestals name she was called urbinia the women of roma had fallen prey to a pestilence especially women who were pregnant there was one miscarriage after another the pontifex maximus suspected impurity it was found that urbinia had given herself not to one man but two and yet she still dared to tend the sacred flame urbinia was tried and found guilty after she was punished the pestilence ceased and the women once again bore healthy babies postumia nodded urbinia was the most recent vestal to be found guilty of impurity and punished but she was not the first you come from a very old family do you not pinaria yes virgo maxima a family older than the republic older than the kings a family that has given roma many consuls and magistrates many warriors and priests and not a few vestals but even the most respectable families have stains on their history it was king tarquinius the elder who initiated the method by which vestals are punished and what was the name of the very first vestal to be punished according to that practice her name pinarias heart skipped a beat come child you know the answer her name was the same as my own pinaria an ancestress of mine was the first vestal to be buried alive whispered postumia she drew a deep breath buried alivethats what they did to pinaria and to urbinia thats what they wanted to do to me even now i cant speak of it with a steady voice but surely you were innocent of course i was you stupid girl had i been less than innocent i wouldnt be here today in the end thank the goddess i was able to convince the pontifex maximus of that fact but the investigation itselfthe fear i feltthe humiliationthe terrorthe nightmares i still experience after all these years postumia cleared her throat when i became virgo maxima i promised myself that no vestal in my charge would ever suffer such an ordeal to keep your vow is not enough innocence is not enough a vestal must be above temptation yesbut she must also be above suspicion do you understand pinaria yes virgo maxima i understand pinaria shivered and began to weep postumia embraced her holding her tightly and stroking her closely shorn hair there there ive frightened you child but i do it for your own good i do it for the good of us all though the door was shut a sudden draft passed through the chamber as if the temple itself drew a breath the sacred hearthfire leaped this way and that wavered and for an instant appeared to vanish altogether bc of course the ban on intermarriage between plebeians and patricians should never have been repealed said postumia foslia laughed out loud but virgo maxima what can that possibly have to do with the socalled veii question postumia who was about to take a bite from a stuffed grape leaf held delicately between her forefinger and thumb put down the delicacy and cleared her throat she was slightly flustered by foslias disrespectful laughter all questions of right and wrong impinge on one another in matters of religionand there are no matters unrelated to religionevery subject is relevant to every other foslia was skeptical a ban on marriage between the classeswasnt that in force only briefly because it was so unpopular and it was all so very long ago people my age are hardly aware that such a ban ever existed the occasion was dinner in the house of the vestals the weather was mild the priestesses dined in the garden under the open sky reclining on couches the couch of the virgo maxima was at the head of the group dining on a couch opposite the virgo maxima was the youngeststill pinaria for in the three years since the triumph of camillus no vestal had retired or died and so no new novices had been inducted female servants moved silently among them delivering fresh dishes and taking away empty ones the eyes and ears of the pontifex maximus foslia called their servants they watch us like hawks she had once remarked to pinaria they listen to every word we say if ever a vestal should stray the pontifex maximus will know about it even before the goddess does thanks to his vigilant spies foslia said such things in jest but pinaria was not amused nor was the virgo maxima amused by foslias dismissal of her comment on marriage may i remind you foslia that a marriage between two patricians requires a religious rite while any marriage involving a plebeian is purely a civil matter in the time of the decemvirs this fact was one of the strongest arguments against intermarriage in any mixed union the patrician partner is deprived of religious ceremonya state of affairs that must surely offend the gods a patrician should marry only another patrician and do so in accordance with the sacred rites yes the ban was rescindedbut that doesnt mean it wont come back postumia took a bite of the stuffed grape leaf then returned the remainder to a small silver plate and waved for a servant to remove it she was finished eating and ready to pontificate for the benefit of the younger vestals times of piety and of impiety occur in cycles i grew up in a permissive era but we now live in an age not so very different from that of the decemvirs in recent years due to the press of constant warfare the election of consuls has been suspended and roma is ruled instead by six military tribunes as for the conflict between the classes if anything it may be worse than in the days of the decemvirs because the patricians continually retreat and the plebeians continually demand more concessionsmore land to settle more debtrelief more voting rights if our leaders would use their power to reinstate the intermarriage ban in that sphere at least roma would again be in harmony with the will of the gods and the classes might resume their rightful roles in the state such an idea did not originate with me it comes from our sacred father the pontifex maximus who told me only yesterday that he intends to petition the military tribunes for a return of the intermarriage ban and in this house we do not contradict the pontifex maximus if you have a conflicting opinion foslia keep it to yourself of course virgo maxima foslias sardonic tone seemed to indicate that while she might keep her opinions private she would keep them nonetheless and of course youre right to say marriage at least any marriage involving a patrician is a religious matter but we were discussing the veii question and surely that is about only two things money and politics postumia shook her head to the contrary foslia can you not see that the veii question is very much a religious matter pinaria youre very quiet this evening you may still be the youngest but youre no longer a novice speak up pinaria swallowed an olive stuffed with goat cheese very well virgo maxima it seems to me more than ever that romas conquest of veii is a mirror of the greeks conquest of troy first it took ten years second it came about by a clever stratagem rather than by brute strength third while it seemed to solve all our problems at the time instead like the greeks after troy we discovered that the conquest merely led to more dissention at home postumia nodded thoughtfully continue veii was so rich people thought the capture of so much booty would relieve the tensions between the classes surely they thought there would be enough and more than enough for everyone in roma but when the time came for the division of the spoils no one was pleased the temple to juno regina and the ceremonies to dedicate the temple cost a great deal more than anyone expected added to that was the tenth portion promised by camillus to apollo and his priesthood the plebeians said they were being robbed of booty for which they had spilled their blood in reply to that the patricians said it was sacrilegious of the plebeians to try to claim booty that had been promised to the gods and the result bitter accusations of unfairness and greed from both sides which is certainly nothing new said foslia who could never stay out of any discussion for long for generations patricians have argued quite reasonably that everyone must pull together for the common good we must be united under our leaders all willing to sacrifice in the face of so many threats from so many enemies and for just as long selfish shortsighted plebeians have done nothing but complain at times theyve even refused military service of course pinaria said then hesitated certain ideas which she overheard outside the house of the vestals were not always welcomed by her fellow vestals especially the virgo maxima go on said postumia yes go on said foslia with a mischievous glint in her eye hoping to see the virgo maxima provoked pinaria spoke slowly and carefully these are not my ideas you understand but one does hear things for instance there are some who argue that while the temple itself honors juno regina the money to build the temple actually goes into the pockets of the contractors chosen by the state most of those contractors are patricians and are already quite rich and because those contractors tend to use slavesmen captured in war and sold to them cheaply by the stateplebeian workers see no profit at all from such a project their profit is the good will of the goddess who is pleased by her temple declared the virgo maxima to reduce the building of a temple a sacred act to a squabble over money is nothing less than sacrilege of the sort spewed by the worst rabblerousers really pinaria you must learn to allow such talk to go in one ear and out the other think about it simple reason dictates that the gods must always be given the first and greatest portion of the spoils otherwise we might lose their favor and then where would we be veii would have conquered us instead of the other way around after the gods our responsible hardworking leaders the men who ensure the proper worship of the gods must be given their rightful share and after that the plebeian rabble should be satisfied with whatever spoils may remainjust as they should be satisfied to marry within their own class instead of nurturing wild notions that they themselves are fit to rule the state they should submit to those whose families have proved themselves best able to guide the destiny of roma this is a dangerous world full of enemies only proven leadership that is pleasing to the gods can preserve us from catastrophe pinaria bowed her head the virgo maxima speaks wisely the other vestals including foslia nodded and echoed her words the virgo maxima speaks wisely and yet postumias voice trembled with emotion and yet it sometimes seems that our worst enemies are inside the city not outside the rabble may be unfit to rule but they still have their tribunes and other powerful men who cater to them as we have seen demonstrated only too well in recent days the other vestals put aside their food the virgo maxima was alluding to a topic painful to them all foslia broke the uncomfortable silence is there no hope for camillus virgo maxima postumia sighed the situation remains unchanged even as we speak marcus furius camillus is making ready to leave roma rather than face trial he will go into exile we all know how this lamentable state of affairs came about in their fury over the spoils of veii the rabble decided to vent their spite on the man most responsible for dispensing those spoils they accused camillus of breaking the law they claim he wrongfully enriched his friends and family members but surely he isnt guilty said one of the vestals the virgo maxima shook her head alas men wise in the ways of the courts tell me otherwise by the strict letter of the law camillus did indeed commit improprieties he is unable to account for all the wealth that was dispensed the courts take such matters very seriously and cannot look the other way really these laws are written as if they were intentionally fashioned to give a weapon to the enemies of any man in public life the higher a man rises and the more farranging his decisions the more vulnerable he becomes to charges of corruption and so camillusour beloved camillusis being driven from roma only three years ago every man woman and child was shouting his name in the streets praising him as our savior and now this vesta forgive me for saying such a thing but if camillus were to raise arms against us as coriolanus did i should hardly be able to deny that the city deserved it but of course he will never do that camillus is too great a man and too loyal a roman no matter that his enemies have made him an outcast tonight when we gather at the temple we must all remember him in our prayers may camillus be comforted and kept warm by vestas fire however far he may journey from the hearth may vestas fire keep him warm echoed the other vestals and some quietly began to weep many tears had been shed in the house of the vestals over the misfortunes of camillus in recent days in the years since his triumph all the vestals including the virgo maxima had come to regard the conqueror of veii with a certain awe in reverent tones they spoke of his military triumphs and his grandiose public works in whispers they spoke of his chiseled features and brawny bearing the exemplar of roman manliness the vestals had built a veritable cult around camillus and his fall had devastated them pinaria did not weep she was remembering the day of camilluss triumph and the shock she had felt at seeing the four white horses that pulled his chariot surely jupiter who saw everything from the clouds had seen those white horses as well had the god believed that a mortal was mocking him the virgo maxima saw the will of the gods in all things so why not in the downfall of camillus but pinaria had already provoked the virgo maxima once this evening she did not care to do so again by imputing any fault to a man whom the vestals held in such esteem it occurred to pinaria that in the course of the evenings digressions the topic that had originally been brought up was the very topic no one had discussed the veii question the spoils of veii had been claimed the people had been sold into slavery and the conquered city had been stripped of every ornament as vultures strip a carcass of its flesh but even the most ravenous vultures leave bones behind and the bones of veii remained its houses walls wells fountains assembly halls streets gardens and temples the houses of veii stood empty veii was a city without citizens what was to be done with veii one faction led by a tribune of the plebs named sicinius argued that half the population of roma should leave their homes and move to veii taking up residence in the empty houses there renters could become owners men mired in debt could make a fresh start farmers who had been promised small homesteads in distant conquered volscian territory could instead receive lots outside veii enjoying the amenities of a city already built and living close to their family and friends in roma with two complete cities to accommodate the population of one much of the disparity between the haves and havenots of roma could be eliminated overnight the supporters of siciniuss proposal were wildly enthusiastic but the opposition was fierce the landlords and moneylenders of roma had everything to lose and nothing to gain those who ran the city foresaw a dilution of their authority what if veii became not an annex of roma but a rival city with its own magistrates and priesthoods opponents accused sicinius of scheming to make himself rich by controlling the distribution of properties in veii perhaps he even intended to become king of veii to the opposition the proposed migration was nothing less than another secession of the plebsonly this time the secession would be permanent the gods had shown favor to one city roma and roma should remain as it was veii should be utterly destroyed it walls pulled down and its buildings burned to the ground camillus had been among those who spoke most vehemently against the move to occupy veii in a speech to the senate he had uttered a phrase which became the rallying cry of the opposition any city abandoned by the gods must never be inhabited by men some said his exile was the price he paid for opposing sicinius and his faction they had brought charges of corruption against which camillus had been unable to defend himself but the real issue had been camilluss stand on the veii question should roma be one city or two should veii be inhabited or destroyed the unresolved issue overshadowed every other concern facing the city the debate was fierce and unrelenting and often descended to open violence in the forum there seemed to be no middle ground migration either promised the solution to all problems or threatened the annihilation of roma the stakes were incredibly high no wonder foslia had laughed at the virgo maximas quaint digression on intermarriage when the veii question was raised and yet as postumia had argued all such questions were at some level related to one another politics split each question into many different questions all of them vexed and insoluble every man asserted his own will and whoever was strongest at a given moment prevailed religion unified all questions into one to which there was a single answer the will of the gods it often seemed to pinaria that the world outside the house of the vestals was a swirling chaos of violence and uncertainty the enemies of roma sought her destruction as she sought theirs the citizens of roma endlessly struggled against one another for wealth and power even within families sons contested against one another and sometimes disobeyed their paterfamilias and wives rebelled against their husbands but these struggles were mere shadows of something far greater and yet hard to see as a temple by its vastness must be hard for an ant to discern the will of the gods wisdom came not from within or from other mortals wisdom came from determining the desire of the gods but how was this to be done even after her many years of study the path often seemed obscure to pinaria she was glad the dinner was over and conversation had ceased now the vestals would make their way to the temple of the goddess for the evenings thanksgiving no matter how much delight the play of words gave to clever people like foslia or to teachers like the virgo maxima talking never resolved anything peace came only in the performance of ritual and the greatest peace came in those precious moments when pinaria could gaze uninterrupted and free from all extraneous thoughts into the hearthfire of vesta knowing it to be the one thing in all the world that was pure and everlasting they are on their way they are on their way i must warn everyone they are on their way the madman had forced his way past the servants at the entrance of the house of the vestals he had rushed though the vestibule and into the atrium where he now stood in the center of the impluvium it was high noon and the sun shone directly down on him when he stamped his feet in the ankledeep water like a child throwing a tantrum the sunlight sparkled and lit rainbows amid the splashing water they are on their way he cried clenching his fists at his sides and drawing his eyebrows to a point why will no one listen the vestals and their huddled servants kept their distance and watched him fascinated foslia who had just arrived whispered in pinarias ear who is this creature i dont know but ive seen him before in the street between here and the temple of vesta he looks like a beggar to judge by those rags and that awful unkempt hair and beard has he threatened anyone no he seems to be trying to warn us about something the virgo maxima has gone to find the pontifex maximus you must be joking i should think shed fetch some armed lictors to take the man away in chains she seemed to take him rather seriously there was a commotion at the entrance postumia and the pontifex maximus appeared in the vestibule and strode into the atrium followed by a retinue of priests and augurs the madman dropped to his knees with a splash pontifex maximus at last you will hear the truth of what i say the high priest wore a toga distinctive for its many folds gathered and tucked in a loop just above his waist the cowl that would have covered his head at ceremonies was pushed back to reveal a bald crown fringed with white hair he stroked his long white beard and looked down his nose at the man in the impluvium marcus caedicius how far youve fallen in the worldand i dont just mean to your knees pontifex maximus do you know this man said postumia i do caedicius used to be a respectable plebeian a fuller who washed and dyed wool observe the dark stains behind his fingernails but some time ago he gave up his shop and became a vagrant he frequents a particular spot in the street above the temple of vesta have you not seen him pacing this way and that muttering to himself well caecidius what is this nonsense what can you be thinking forcing your way into this sacred dwelling and terrifying the holy virgins what do you have to say for yourself oh pontifex maximus you must listen to me i am listening you fool speak i heard a voice i was in the street alonethere wasnt another mortal in sight i swearand a voice spoke to me as clearly and distinctly as im speaking to you now a voice from nowhere caedicius wrung his hands and chewed his lower lip by hercules man spit it out do you think i have nothing better to do what did this voice say it said the gauls are coming thats what it said as clearly as you hear me now the gauls are coming the pontifex maximus wrinkled his brow the gauls one of his subordinates drew alongside him a tribe of savages who come from a land far to the north pontifex maximus beyond a great mountain range called the alps some years ago they discovered a pass across the alps some of them moved into italy and founded a city called mediolanum poets say it was a craving for wine that drew the gauls to italy in their native land they have nothing like it their language is said to be a combination of grunts very uncouth and grating to the ear yes ive heard of these gauls said the pontifex maximus why should they come here marcus caedicius and why should we care caedicius splashed his hands in the shallow water close to weeping the gauls are coming do you not understand their arrival shall be terrible the most terrible thing that has ever happened doom death destruction warn the magistrates flee at once and take the vestals with you pray to the gods for our salvation for quite some time a rotund little priest in the retinue behind the pontifex maximus had been searching through a scroll rotating the cylinders with both hands and scanning the text the man gave a sudden jerk which caught pinarias attention foslia also noticed she gripped pinarias arm and whispered into her ear do you realize what that priest is holding its one of the sibylline books surely not whispered pinaria arent they kept on the capitoline in a vault beneath the temple of jupiter of course thats where the priests study the greek verses translate them into latin and debate their meaning that rolypoly little fellow must be one of the priests and that must be one of the sibylline books i never thought that i should ever actually see one said pinaria feeling a tremor of dread the arcane verses were consulted only in times of dire crisis the priest gave another jerk and uttered a cry of excitement pontifex maximus ive found something i knew i had seen the reference before at last ive located it the sibyl herself foresaw this moment she wrote a verse to guide us what does it say read the oracle aloud the little priest looked up from the scroll he stared wideeyed at marcus caecidius for a long moment blinked and cleared his throat and read a man kneels on water and does not sink he speaks to the wise to make them think from his warning they must not shrink the little priest lowered the scroll everyone in the room gazed at the man who knelt in the shallow water who claimed to have heard a warning from a disembodied voice that proclaimed the gauls are coming not long after caedicius delivered his warning word arrived that a vast army of gauls had swept down from the north and was laying siege to the city of clusium located on a tributary of the tiber a hundred miles upriver from roma the city fathers conferred the prophecy of caedicius and the words of the sibyl were debated it was decided that a delegation should be sent to clusium to observe the gauls at first hand if they were as numerous as rumor asserted and as menacing as caedicius believed then the envoys should attempt to use diplomacypromises pacts or threatsto turn the gauls back from clusium or at the very least to dissuade them from moving further south and setting their sights on roma the roman ambassadors were three brothers of the distinguished fabius family the gauls received them courteously for they had heard of roma and knew the city was a force to be reckoned with but when the fabii asked what injury the clusians had done to the gauls that they should attack their city and if making war unjustly was not an offense to the gods the chieftain of the gauls merely laughed at them brennus was a bigjawed man with a bristling red beard and a shaggy red mane so massive and ruggedly muscled that he seemed to have been hewn from a block of granite the gauls were very nearly a race of giants and brennus towered over the roman ambassadors even though he spoke with a kind of rough humor it seemed to the romans that he was belittling them how have the clusians offended us brennus asked by having too much while we have too little by being so few while we number so many as for offending the gods yours may be different from ours but the law of nature is the same everywhere the weak submit to the strong so it is among gods beasts and men alike from everything ive heard about you you romans are no different havent you done your share of taking what belongs to others making free men into slaves simply because youre stronger than they are and because it suits you i thought so so dont ask us to pity the clusians instead maybe we should pity the people youve conquered and oppressed maybe we should go about setting them free and restoring their goods how would you like that romans what do you say ha brennus laughed in their faces the fabii were greatly insulted but kept their mouths shut the matter might have ended there but quintus fabius the youngest and most hotheaded of the brothers was determined to draw some gallic blood all races including the gauls recognized the divinely protected status of envoys it was universally agreed that ambassadors must be afforded hospitality and must not be harmed and in return must not take up arms against their hosts quintus fabius violated this sacred law the next day putting on the armor of a clusian he joined the forces of the besieged city and rode into battle against the gauls picking out a gaul of particularly large stature he rode straight toward the man and killed him with a single blow of his sword wanting a trophy quintus fabius jumped from his horse and set about stripping the dead man of his armor and in doing so his clusian helmet fell from his head brennus fighting nearby saw his face and recognized him at once the gallic chief was outraged had he been able to confront quintus fabius there on the battlefield the death of one or the other might have ended the matter but the press of the battle carried the two men apart and both ended the day unscathed the fabii headed back to roma brennus an impulsive prideful man brooded all night in the morning he announced that the siege of clusium was ended for grossly insulting himfirst by suggesting that he had offended the gods then by flagrantly breaking divine law to take up arms against himthe romans must be punished brennus declared that the entire force of the gaulsmore than fighting menwould march south at once in roma the pontifex maximus called for the punishment of quintus fabius saying that all guilt should rest on one man so as to exonerate the rest of the citizens and spare them from divine retribution but popular opinion applauded quintus fabius for his recklessness the people scoffed at retribution from either gods or gauls had not quintus proved how easily a gaul could be killed no matter how gigantic and had not the gods seen him safely home election time was at hand and rather than punishing quintus fabius the people elected him and his brothers military tribunes brennus hearing this grew even more enraged his speeches whipped the gauls into a frenzy the vast horde rushed down the valley of the tiber and rapidly drew nearer to roma one man had the proven ability to unify the roman forces and lead them to victory even in the face of overwhelming odds but that man was in exile camillus nightly the vestals prayed for his return even as they saw omens everywhere that foretold disaster but camillus was not recalled from exile and no dictator was appointed to deal with the emergency instead the fabii and the three other military tribunes saw fit to split the command between themselves though they managed to muster an army to match the gauls in numbers the vast majority of these soldiers were raw recruits many had never held a sword or cast a spear full of bravado like their leaders they were unruly undisciplined and overconfident on the eve of battle still at odds with the priesthood that had demanded the punishment of quintus fabius the commanders neglected to take the auspices or make sacrifices to the gods roma was to face brennus without camillus without a sufficiently trained army and without the favor of the gods the battle took place on the summer solstice the longest day of the year became the most miserable day in the history of roma the roman forces were advancing upriver beside the tiber poorly massed and in disarray thanks to conflicting instructions from their commanders as they approached the confluence where the river allia ran through a steep ravine to join with the tiber about ten miles upriver from the city they heard a noise like a multitude of animals braying the noise grew louder and nearer until the romans began to realize it must be a marching song sung by the gauls in their uncouth language the scouts had given no warning and it seemed impossible that the gauls could have come so far so quickly a tremor of fear ran through the front ranks in the next instant they came face to face with the enemy the romans panicked broke ranks and ran thousands were pushed into the river and drowned thousands more fled into the narrow ravine those who were not trampled by their own men were slaughtered by the gauls those who survived the battle did so only because brennus amazed at the ease of his victory suspected a trap he kept his men from advancing as quickly as they might have which allowed the romans who threw down their weapons and cast off their armor to outrun their pursuers saving themselves while shedding every vestige of their dignity because it was closer most fled to veii not to roma only a handful made it back to the city with news of the disaster the roman army was destroyed its remnants were disarmed and scattered elated by their good fortune but exhausted from so much slaughter the gauls rested that night the next day they stripped booty from the fallen dead so many romans had been killed that the process took all day the next morning the gauls pressed on toward roma when they arrived at nightfall they beheld a city with open gates and not a single sentry on the walls all was silent and still so eerie was the sight that brennus camped outside the walls that night again fearing a trap he waited until morning to venture into the defenseless city alone in the temple of vesta pinaria slept not even the goddess was present for the sacred fire of vesta was gone only ashes remained in the hearth the previous day while the others made ready to flee racing about the house of the vestals in a panic pinaria had been overcome by a desire to spend a few more moments however fleeting in vestas temple she had meant to steal quickly to the temple and just as quickly back again but the masses of people in the street thwarted her intentions by the thousands romas citizens were abandoning her some fled on foot with nothing more than the clothes they wore some pushed carts loaded high with belongings some hitched donkeys to wagons and attempted to take all their possessions with them as pinaria threaded her way through the throng others seeing her holy vestments tried to make way for her but in many places the crowd was simply too thick pinaria was jostled this way and that the heat of the midsummer day was stifling and oppressive people moaned in misery a woman screamed and cried out that her child had fallen and was being trampled underfoot pinaria turned to look but the crowd carried her forward against her will at last she reached the temple she broke away from the crowd and rushed up the empty steps the doors stood open there was no one inside pinaria closed the doors behind her and took a deep breath why had she come vesta was no longer here wherever the hearthfire was that was the place where the goddess might be found and the eternal flame had been transferred to a portable brazier to be transported away from roma to a place of safety the pontifex maximus and the virgo maxima had overseen the grim ceremony while the vestals looked on and wept as long as vestas hearthfire could be preserved there remained a chance however slender that the city of roma might endure the circular sanctum was dark and empty the chamber was surprisingly quiet the heavy doors muffled the hubbub of the crowd outside as she stood alone in the temple of vesta a sense of calm descended on pinaria what use is prophecy she said aloud though there was no one to hear marcus caedicius had warned the magistrates and the priests about the gauls yet his warning had done no good despite their efforts to prevent the coming of the gaulsindeed because of those very effortsthe gauls were now marching on roma with nothing to stop them the prophecy of caedicius had proved no more useful than the prophecies of the trojan princess cassandra who foresaw her citys doom and yet could do nothing to prevent it was the fate of troy to become the fate of roma pinaria shuddered and shut her eyes she suddenly felt very weary she knelt on the floor and leaned against the empty hearth she had not meant to fall asleep indeed she would have thought it impossible to do so considering the overwrought state of both the city and herself somnus the god of sleep overwhelmed her accompanied by his son morpheus the shaper of dreams pinaria woke she did so suddenly with a jarring sense of dislocation in time and space where was she blinking she realized that she was in the temple of vesta she felt a stab of panic had she fallen asleep while tending the sacred flame she looked at the hearth it was cold and dark the fire extinguished her heart raced and she felt lightheaded then she remembered the gauls were coming the flame had been removed so that it could be carried to safety she sensed that many hours had passed since she entered the temple the murmur of the crowd no longer penetrated the heavy doors no sound at all came from outside it was not nighttime bright sunlight leaked in from the narrow gap beneath the doors pinaria opened the doors and shielded her eyes dazzled by bright morning light the hand of somnus must have been very heavy upon her to make her sleep from one days light until the next morpheus had visited her as well for now she remembered a dream that had haunted her sleep foslia was in the dream nattering on and on showing off her erudition everything she said irritated pinaria and made her more distressed romulus walked on foot for his triumphs do you suppose brennus will ride a quadriga through roma like camillus i wonder if brennus is as handsome there was more though in the dream pinaria protested and tried to stop her ears the trojan women were taken as slaves do you suppose we vestals will become slaves i dont imagine the gauls will allow us to remain virgins for long and though pinaria howled in protest still foslia continued determined to show off her irrefutable religious logic no city is conquered unless its people have offended the gods killing or enslaving the inhabitants of a conquered city pleases the gods now the gauls have conquered roma what do you think that means pinaria what does it say about roma what a terrible nightmare pinaria shivered despite the warmth of the day as she descended the steps and looked around her what she saw was as disquieting as the dream and just as strange the street was littered with castoff items all the things that people had thought they could carry while they fled but had abandoned when panic or common sense overcame them pieces of pottery sacks full of clothing boxes stuffed with trinkets and mementos toys made of wood or straw even chairs and small tripod tables forsaken wagons and handcarts had been knocked on their sides with their contents strewn beside them not a single person was to be seen nor the sound of a single voice to be heard pinaria had lived her whole life in the city she was used to its teeming energy its loud brash crowds to see the city without people was bizarre roma was like an empty shell it was like a tomb without a body even the gods were gone before fleeing the romans had stripped their temples of every sacred object the hearthfire of vesta statues of the gods sacred talismans of the kings the sibylline booksall been taken away for safekeeping or buried in secret places throughout the city only somnus and morpheus remained perhaps they hovered over her still for pinaria felt as though she were walking through the strange unreal landscape of a nightmare she wandered about the forum sometimes startled by the echo of her footsteps in the empty public spaces rounding a corner she drew a sharp breath she was not alone after all on a backless chair before the entrance to his official residence sat the pontifex maximus he heard her gasp gave a start and turned his head as surprised to see her as she was to see him she ran to him he stayed where he was sitting stiffly upright and furrowing his brow pinaria what are you doing here all the vestals left yesterday she knelt beside his chair yes pontifex maximus and i was to go with them but i wanted to visit the temple of vesta one last time i meant to stay only a moment but somehow shhhh do you hear pinaria cocked her head the sound was distant and vague at first then grew closer and more distinct it was the sound of men talking punctuated by shouts and raucous laughter the gauls whispered the pontifex maximus theyve come at last but pontifex maximus why are you still here why have you not fled because some among us are still romans flee the city never but when the gauls find you im not the only one walk across the city and youll see the others who remain mostly old men like myself men who have never in their lives fled from an enemy and have no intention of doing so now nor will we cower inside our houses each of us has drawn a chair before his domicile to sit and await whatever is to come with our roman dignity intact but the gauls are monsters theyre giants twice as big as normal men they drink human blood and sacrifice babies and burn their victims alive they may destroy my body but they shall not rob me of my dignity but listen pinariatheyre drawing closer you must flee where cross the street quickly hide among the branches of that yew tree and dont make a sound no matter what you see go reluctantly pinaria left him she hid herself just before a troop of gauls came striding up the street laughing and swinging their swords for the thrill of hearing the blades cut the air they were indeed large though not as gigantic as pinaria had expected nor were they as ugly as she had thought some might even be called handsome despite their strangely braided hair and untrimmed beards the gauls saw the pontifex maximus and fell silent for a moment they drew closer peering at him curiously he sat so still with his hands on his knees and his eyes staring straight ahead that perhaps they thought he was a painted statue they slowly circled him grunted to one another in their savage language laughed and pretended to poke at him with their swords he did not react in any way he did not even blink at last one of the gaulsa redheaded giant from whom the others took ordersstooped down and peered at the pontifex maximus eye to eye and nose to nose he grabbed hold of the long white beard grinned and gave it a sharp tug the reaction of the pontifex maximus was instant he slapped the gaul across the face the crack of the blow echoed up and down the street pinaria gasped the gaul sprang back and roared he drew a long sword and swung it in a circle in the air the pontifex maximus did not move but his face became as white as salt with all his strength the gaul swung his blade against the neck of the pontifex maximus there was a sickening sound and then the priests head went flying through the air the white beard trailing behind it like a comets tail it landed in the street bounced once then rolled to a stop only a few steps from the place where pinaria was hidden despite herself she opened her mouth to scream but from behind a hand slipped over her mouth and an arm embraced her so tightly that she had no breath to cry out the decapitated body of the pontifex maximus became a fountain of blood the limbs jerked in a spastic fashion and the fingers madly twitched the gauls laughed and seemed refreshed by the rain of blood upon them the sight was so horrible that pinaria struggled wildly against the arms embracing her desperate to flee but the man held her fast against her back she could feel that his heart was beating as rapidly as her own the body of a vestal was sacrosanct pinaria was not used to being touched the sensation of being held so tightly was at once terrifying and strangely comforting the gauls knocked the body of the pontifex maximus from its chair kicked it a few times then began to move on their leader barked an order at one of his men who ran back to fetch the severed head the man came so close to pinaria that he might easily have seen her had he peered into the foliage of the yew tree but he kept his eyes on the head as he grabbed it by the beard and ran off swinging it over his head the gauls moved out of sight slowly the man loosened his grip on pinaria she slipped free and spun around to see a youth no older than herself he was dressed in a tattered tunic his shoes were mere scraps of leather so worn as to be hardly worth wearing pinaria glanced at the hand that had covered her mouth then at the one that had touched her breast where is your ring she said the youth merely raised an eyebrow he had bright blue eyes and was very handsome despite a haircut so ragged that his fair hair poked this way and that like tufts of straw your citizens ring demanded pinaria where is it following a custom of the greeks every roman citizen wore a ring usually a simple band of iron sometimes such rings were carved with identifying initials or symbols those who had cause to send letters or documents used their rings to impress their insignia on the sealing wax i dont have a ring said the youth but i do have this he indicated an amulet that hung from a leather strap around his neck it appeared to be made of lead very crudely molded in the form of a male member with wings pinaria blanched youre a slave arent you yes a slave dared to touch me the youth laughed had you rather id let you cry out those gauls would have found you for sure and then theyd have found me as well and since im prettier than you who knows which of us they would have ravished i dont know about you but i dont fancy becoming a plaything for one of those bloodthirsty giants pinaria stared at him dumbfounded no man had ever spoken to her in such a crude fashion few slaves had ever spoken to her at all except in response to her orders no one had ever looked her in the eye and grinned at her in such a brazen way the slave looked her up and down you must be a vestal i am what are you still doing here i should have thought youd have left yesterday pinaria was suddenly on the verge of tears she drew a breath to steady herself youre very impertinent is that what youll say to brennus when he has you staked spreadeagled in the middle of the forum and the line of gauls queued up to make your acquaintance runs all the way to the aventine pinaria slapped him across the face then began to weep uncontrollably the slave made no move to touch her but stepped back and crossed his arms have i frightened you yes good because more gauls will be here at any moment and this is not a very good place to hide pinaria fought back her tears i must get out of the city impossible then where can i go take my hand what more gauls are coming cant you hear them pinaria listened from nearby she heard men braying a marching song in the ugly language of the gauls they sounded drunk my name is pennatus by the way now take my hand and dont let go were going to run very fast where how should i know well trust the gods to guide us the gods have left roma said pinaria but she took his hand nonetheless this way and that they ran uphill and downhill heading nowhere striving only to avoid the gauls as more and more gauls appeared overrunning the city like rats overrunning a ship eluding them became harder sometimes they were seen and the gauls cried out and ran after them but each time they escaped pennatus seemed to know each winding alley and every hole in every wall in the city they saw many terrible things like the pontifex maximus others had decided to greet the gauls fearlessly seated like statues before their houses some like the pontifex maximus had been beheaded others had been strangled or stabbed to death some had been hanged from trees there seemed to be a surprising number of romans in the city who like pinaria had intended to flee but had failed to do so before the gauls arrived the city became a killing field the gauls were the hunters the romans the prey men were slaughtered and women and children were raped while pinaria watched shops were looted buildings were set on fire the gauls gawked at the opulent houses on the palatine and gawked even more at the crude hut of romulus preserved as a rustic monument in the midst of the citys finest dwellings could such unfeeling halfhuman creatures understand what the sacred hut represented while pinaria watched from the shadows a group of drunken gauls stood in a circle around the hut and urinated on it whooping and making a contest of their desecration no other sight that day offended pinaria as deeply or made her feel more desperately that the history of roma was finished forever the dreadful day seemed endless at last passing below the tarpeian rock pinaria and pennatus heard voices calling from above here up here youll be safe if you can get to the top of the capitoline looking up they saw tiny figures peering over the rock the figures beckoned to them then frantically pointed gauls very near you just behind that building run hurry if you can get to the path that winds up the capitoline pinaria was too frightened to think too weary to move it was pennatus who dragged her forward holding her by the hand crossing the forum they were spotted by the same troop of gauls who had beheaded the pontifex maximus one of the giants still toted the priests head as a trophy carrying it by the beard pinaria screamed the gauls laughed and ran after them they came to the path which would take them to the top of capitoline the same route by which every triumphal procession reached the temple of jupiter drained by grief immobilized by terror pinaria had reached the end of her endurance yet with pennatus pulling her along she seemed almost to fly up the winding path truly she thought the slave must have wings as his name suggested for how else was she being transported when her limbs had failed and her will was utterly spent with its steep slopes the capitoline had always presented one of the most naturally defensible positions among the seven hills over the generations an accretion of monuments and buildings linked by walls and ramparts had essentially made it into a fortress the defenders at the top had only to fill a few openings and passageways with rubble to secure the perimeter they were doing so even as pennatus and pinaria reached the top of the winding path a narrow gap still remained amid the stones and bits of timber that were being hastily piled up to block the passage a man stood in the breach waving frantically the gauls are right behind you he cried another roman appeared atop the barrier raised a bow and let fly an arrow that very nearly parted pinarias scalp the buzzing of the arrow was followed by a scream so close behind her that pinaria flinched the pursuers were very near practically breathing on her neck pennatus rushed through the breach pulling her behind him she tripped on the rubble and scraped her shoulder against a jagged bit of wood as she passed through to safety more arrows whizzed through the air even as men rushed to fill in the breach the archer gave a whoop of triumph theyre retreating i got one in the eye and another in the shoulder even giants turn tail and run if you show them whos in charge the archer jumped down from the barricade rattling his armor he removed his helmet to reveal a cleanshaven face bright green eyes and a shock of black hair he squared his broad shoulders and stood stiffly erect gaius fabius dorso he announced in a deep voice taking such pleasure in enunciating his name that the effect was almost comical he glanced at her vestments can it be possible that youre one of the vestals my name is pinaria she said trying to steady her voice whats this dorso peered at her shoulder the fabric of her gown had been torn the pale flesh was marred by a scrape and bright red speckles of blood he averted his eyes conscious of the sanctity of her body how did such a thing happen the slave must have treated you very carelessly if he needs to be punished dont be ridiculous said pinaria the wound is nothing and the slave saved my life she covered the exposed scrape with her hand and winced suddenly aware of the pain she looked at pennatus perhaps he was not as handsome as she had thought seeing him next to gaius fabius dorso he looked slightly ridiculous with his badly cropped hair and shabby clothes nonetheless when he grinned at hersuch cheek from a slaveshe could not help but return his smile her face grew hot and she lowered her eyes if you truly had wings you could fly away from here said pinaria if only she stood behind a rampart on the capitoline overlooking the forum and the hills that surrounded it many days had passed since the coming of the gauls the sight of roma occupied by savageshorrifying and bizarre at first almost beyond comprehensionhad now become commonplace rarely now did the beleaguered romans atop the capitoline hear the screams of some hapless citizen being rousted from a hiding place by the gauls to be tortured and raped most of those in hiding had been discovered in the very first days of the occupation a lucky few had made their way to the capitoline nonetheless the gauls assaults upon the city itself continued day after day after a house was ransacked the gauls often set it on fire apparently for no reason other than to delight in its destruction or to infuriate the romans watching from the capitoline on this day from all over the city great plumes of smoke rose into the air high above the hills the smoke coalesced into a grey miasma that obscured the midsummer sun and turned midday into twilight the handful of defenders atop the capitolinegaius fabius dorso insisted that they think of themselves thus and not as captives for they were romans and stood upon roman soilhad for the time being enough to eat and drink in the first days of the occupation they stayed busy strengthening their defenses they erected pickets dug trenches and even chipped away some of the hillsides to make them even steeper so long as they kept watch day and night their position was virtually impregnable and yet despair was always near the sight of their beloved city being demolished house by house the loss of all contact with those who had fled the fear that the gods had abandoned themthese anxieties preyed on their waking thoughts and colored their nightmares if only one had wings if only one could fly away beside her pennatus smiled he was always smiling despite the grimness of their situation he was quite unlike anyone pinaria had ever encountered most of the slaves she had met were quiet and selfeffacing desirous of nothing except to go unnoticed most of the free men she had known were selfconsciously deferential in her company awkward or aloof pennatus was none of these things he was constantly joking and making light of their situation and her exalted status seemed to mean nothing to him he appeared to be utterly without religious scruples or even religious belief he often said things that went beyond sacrilege not so much disparaging the gods as disavowing their existence pinaria had never met such a person or even imagined that such a person could exist it seemed there was nothing pennatus feared to say to her sometimes she thought he must be flirting with her though she had so little experience in such matters that she couldnt quite tell if only foslia were with her so that pinaria might have someone to talk to about the unfamiliar feelings stirred in her by this peculiar slave for better or worse said pennatus despite my name i do not have nor have i ever had wings did i not tell you already how i came by my name pinaria shook her head it was given to me by my master when i was an infant he owned my mother as well what about your father pennatus shrugged i never knew him for all i know the old master sired me pinaria blushed pennatus clucked his tongue really do they teach you vestals nothing about the facts of procreation well of course they dont to what practical purpose could a vestal virgin put such knowledge she blushed more deeply really pennatus i shall pray to vesta that you may become more respectful of her servants why bother im only a slave i should think your goddess has no more interest in me than i have in her pinaria sighed exasperated you were telling me how you acquired your name from this pendant i wear as you see it has wings my mother wore it it protected her in childbirth but afterward she wanted me to have it she placed it on a cord around my neck not long after i was born the old masters eyesight was poor and all he could tell about the talisman was that it had wings and so he called me pennatus winged i was still quite small when my mother died her gift helps me to remember her pinaria gazed at the black object which nestled in the cleft of pennatuss chest his tunic was crudely made and the wide opening for his head exposed a considerable portion of his chest so that the talisman was always visible not for the first time pinaria noticed that the muscularity of his chest was quite pronounced and the firm sunburned flesh was covered with soft golden hair what is the amulet made of he smiled oddly as if at some private joke what does it look like she shrugged lead he hummed and nodded and what master would bother to take a worthless lead pendant from a slave now if it were made of some precious metalsilver or even goldmany a master would take the talisman for himself either to wear it or to sell it even a kindly indulgent slightly doddering old master might do so i suppose said pinaria who seldom thought about the lives of slaves and the problems and humiliations they faced the world was as the gods had made it and one did not question such arrangements but if one were like pennatus who seemed not to believe in the gods how very different the world and the people in it must appear pennatus had been lucky his master treated him well and in return pennatus had been very loyal to the old man who needed constant looking after when the gauls came the master was too frail to be moved pennatus stayed with him and by doing so missed the chance to flee the city the shock of events proved too much for the old man his heart stopped beating the very morning the gauls arrived leaving pennatus to fend for himself that was how pennatus came to be wandering the city when he encountered pinaria pinaria sighed and gazed at the plumes of smoke that rose from all over the city a noise from below drew her attention down in the forum a group of drunken gauls were attacking a marble statue of hercules with wooden staves their staves kept breaking against the stone but the redfaced maniacally laughing gauls stubbornly kept up their assault at last a finger broke off the statue and went clattering across the paving stones the gauls pranced about and howled in triumph pennatus laughed what idiots what monsters pinaria was not amused the sorry spectacle made her feel disheartened and full of sorrow she raised her eyes to the vast nimbus of smoke that veiled the dark red sun if you truly had wings pennatus would you not fly away from here at once far far away he raised an eyebrow i might or i might keep my wings folded and stay here with you what a silly thing to say muttered pinaria but suddenly she felt less sorrowful they looked at each other for a long moment then both turned at the sound of approaching footsteps gaius fabius dorso strode toward them as always he carried himself with an erect military bearing but he was not clad in armor he wore a toga with a ceremonial belt of gold and purple cloth and a headband of the same material as if he were about to take part in some religious rite in his hands a bit awkwardly he carried several small vessels made of hammered copper are you ready pennatus i can carry the vessels of wine and oil myself but i shall need you to carry the bowls of salt and ground millet pennatus nodded he stepped forward to relieve dorso of the bowls whats happening asked pinaria dorso stood tall before her and raised his chin this is the day of the annual sacrifice of the fabii on the quirinal since i am the only fabius left in roma i shall tend to the ritual but where will you offer this sacrifice at the ancient altar on the quirinal of course but how there must be a thousand gauls between here and there yes and another thousand swarming over the quirinal like rats nonetheless it is incumbent upon me to perform the ritual and so i shall but dorso it isnt possible the ritual has been performed on this day every year without fail for many generations long ago during the very first war against veii an army made up entirely of fabiithree hundred seven in allwent to fight for roma there was a terrible ambush from which only a single fabius returned to avert the recurrence of such a disaster each year we make an offering to father romulus in his divine guise as the god quirinus today is the day but dorso to leave the capitoline would be madness perhaps but to neglect the sacrifice would be a greater madness surely dear vestal i should think that you of all people would understand that i shall walk across the city directly to the altar i shall perform the ritual i shall walk directly back again if the gauls challenge me i shall tell them they are standing in the way of a sacred procession these gauls are a peculiar people they appear to possess little knowledge of the gods but they are very superstitious and can easily be overawed but you dont even speak their language they will see that i carry sacred vessels from my face they will know that my purpose is a holy one the god quirinus will protect me pinaria shook her head she glanced at pennatus and swallowed a lump in her throat must you take pennatus with you a slave customarily accompanies the fabius who performs the ritual to help carry the vessels but pennatus is not your slave no he is not and i am not compelling him to go with me i asked him to go and he agreed pennatus is this true the slave shrugged and flashed a crooked smile it seemed reasonable at the time im getting bored trapped up here day after day i think it may be a great adventure pinaria shook her head no this isnt right pennatuspennatus is impious he cant be part of such a ritual he has no more respect for the gods than the gauls do all the better declared dorso if i fail to overawe them perhaps the gauls will see in pennatus a kindred spirit and leave us alone for his sake he smiled at pennatus who smiled back at him the unlikely friendship that had developed between the two young men was a great puzzlement to pinaria two mortals could hardly be more different gaius fabius dorso was a pious upright patrician warrior he was oddly likeable despite being more than a little vain and selfimportant pennatus was an impious slave who seemed to respect nothing and no one and yet thrown together atop the capitoline in a situation where the normal constraints of society were undone the two men had discovered a pleasure in each others company that grew deeper every day now to pinarias amazement and dismay they were about to set out together on a mad venture that would surely put an end to both of them pinaria stepped forward and laid her hand on dorsos arm please i implore you dont do this thing forgo the ritual the godsif they still have any love for uswill understand and forgive her touch humbled dorso he lowered his eyes please vestal i need your blessing not words of discouragement the truth is this i returned to the city from the battle at the river allia and i remained here despite the coming of the gauls for the express purpose of performing this ritual i am he drew a deep breath and lowered his voice to a whisper i am all too aware of the role played by my kinsmen in drawing the wrath of the gauls and perhaps the wrath of the gods upon roma i cannot turn back time and reverse the damage that was done by my impetuous impious cousin quintus for his crime quintus should have been punishedthe pontifex maximus himself said sobut instead he was commended by the people of roma and made a commander of the legions now disaster has overwhelmed us and it falls to me to honor the gods and my ancestors by performing this ancient ritual if again he drew a deep breath if i should die in attempting to do so perhaps my blood will assuage the gods perhaps they will accept my sacrifice in place of my cousin quintus and return their favor to roma pinaria was so moved that for a long moment she could not speak she fought back tears and finally said if the virgo maxima were here she would bless youbut the virgo maxima is gone and so are the other vestals im the only one left in roma so i will bless you gaius fabius dorso go and make the sacrificeand come back safely dorso bowed his head to her then turned and strode toward the barricade carrying the vessels of wine and oil pennatus lingered behind for a moment he gave pinaria an odd look his eyes seemed to smile even though his lips did not he looked down at the vessels of millet and salt frowned and furrowed his brow then puffed out his cheeks and seemed to reach a decision well then i told him i would go with him and so i shall come back safely pennatus she whispered she very nearly touched his arm as she had touched the arm of dorso but at the last moment she drew back her hand it would hardly be pleasing to the goddess for a vestal to touch a slave pennatus squared his shoulders and took a deep breath of course ill come back will your gods not protect me if the gauls menace us i shall simply sprout wings and come flying back to you with dorso leading and pennatus walking behind him the two men strode across the capitoline word of dorsos intentions had spread and a crowd gathered to watch them depart soldiers rushed forward to help the two men keep their balance as they climbed over the barricade holding the ritual vessels aloft not a grain of salt or millet or a drop of wine or oil was spilled and this was seen to be a good omen the soldiers crowded together along the top of the barricade to watch dorso and pennatus descend the winding path heads turned and a hush fell over the spectators as pinaria climbed up to join the soldiers they drew aside to make room for the vestal she gazed at the receding procession of two and began to move her lips without making a sound thinking to join her in prayer men muttered pleas to the god quirinus for the safekeeping of his worshippers but the words shaped by pinarias lips were not addressed to any god come back she begged silently come back to me pennatus the hours passed slowly the afternoon sun suffused the smoky sky with a lurid glow and began to descend toward the distant hills beyond the tiber on the barricade sharpeyed lookouts kept a watch on the quirinal but saw nothing to indicate the fate of dorso and pennatus pinaria paced back and forth across the open spaces of the capitoline reflexively she muttered prayers to vesta but in her heart she felt she was speaking to empty air the hearthfire of the goddess was gone from roma and her temple had been desecrated by godless savages vesta must be far far away thought pinaria beyond the reach of even the most devoted vestal even if the goddess was still present and could hear her would she not see into pinarias heart and know that her prayer was profane for a vestal to pray for the safe passage of dorso was one thing he was a roman citizen on a holy mission but the prayer that came unbidden to pinarias lips was not for dorso and had nothing to do with the fulfillment of sacred rites what would the goddess think to hear one of her virgins plead so desperately for the return of a slave it was better that the goddess was absent unable to hear pinarias prayer than that vesta should hear it and perceive the longing in pinarias heart she was shaken from her gloomy reverie by a shout from one of the lookouts there at the foot of the capitoline i see them dorso and the slaveand gauls hundreds of gauls the words gave pinaria a momentary flash of hope then plunged her into despair she imagined dorso and pennatus running at top speed pursued by warriors she pictured their severed heads borne aloft on stakes by taunting gauls she ran to the barricade climbed to the top and peered down the steep hillside there said the lookout on the path coming toward us what she saw was the last thing she expected walking proudly erect bearing in their upturned hands the now empty sacrificial vessels dorso and pennatus were ascending the winding path at a steady unhurried pace a huge crowd of gauls followed them bearing swords and spears but keeping at a distance and doing nothing to impede their progress the officer in charge of the barricade shook his head these gauls and their cruel games theyll wait until dorso is almost to the barricade then strike him down while we watch vile creatures we should fire upon them now while dorso still has a chance to break and run archers raise your bows no cried pinaria cant you see their faces its just as dorso predicted the gauls are in awe of him see how they hang back see how they whisper among themselves and jostle one another trying to get a better look at him hes put a kind of spell on them if you fire on them youll break the spell lower your bows do nothing say nothing the men on the barricade unnotched their arrows and fell silent following the winding path dorso and pennatus drew closer and closer the gauls followed doggedly behind them pinarias heart pounded in her chest the wait was excruciating why did they walk so slowly she caught a glimpse of dorsos face as he rounded the final bend she saw the serene expression of a man at peace with himself and his fate ready to live or die as the gods saw fit then she saw pennatus her heart leaped as his eyes met hers he smiledand then winked at her the two men reached the barricade hands stretched down to take the vessels and help them climb up dorso clambered atop the barricade and looked over his shoulder stupid gauls he muttered archers heres your chance to kill a few of those fools take aim and fire at once before they can run arrows whistled though the air followed by screams and the chaotic sounds of the gauls retreating in a sudden panic dorso quickly escorted pinaria away from the barricade out of harms way it was your blessing vestal that did the trick he whispered i felt the goddess of the hearth looking over us every step of the way did you did you truly feel vestas presence pinaria looked from dorso to pennatus something must have protected us said pennatus it was amazing the gauls were dumbfounded they fell back on all sides like grain cut by a scythe not one of them dared to approach us not one of them even raised his voice dorso and pennatus looked at each other and spontaneously embraced laughing like two boys after a great adventure pinaria longed to join their embrace especially she longed to hold pennatus and to be held by him to reassure herself that he still lived and breathed to feel the warmth of his body to touch his hairy chest where the black pendant hung between the firm muscles such thoughts made her feel weak and flushed but she could not control them could it be as dorso said could it be that vesta had watched over and protected both men despite pinarias impure feelings or had pennatus survived only becauseor precisely becausethe goddess was absent no longer present to punish an erring vestal and the object of her desire either vesta knew of pinarias passion for the slave and approved of itmad thoughtor vesta was gone perhaps forever and no longer held sway over her devoted virginanother mad thought in either case pinaria knew in a blinding flash that no impediment remained to hold her feelings in check the realization dazzled her the ground gave way beneath her and the sky cracked open she looked at pennatus he looked back at her their eyes spoke a secret language she knew he felt the same in that moment pinaria was lost and she knew it she burst into tears those who had gathered to welcome dorso assumed they were tears of joy and relief and men bowed their heads at the sight of a sacred virgin so deeply moved by the evidence of the gods continuing favor for the people of roma there was little privacy to be had among the defenders atop the capitoline but such privacy as could be arranged was given to the vestal who dwelled among them while others slept in the open or crowded together inside the temples and public buildings a small chamber in the foundations of the temple of jupiter was given to pinaria for her sole use the entrance to pinarias room was at the back of the temple out of sight it was pennatus who suggested to dorso that it would be proper to install a simple lock on the inside of the door so that no one could possibly walk in on the vestal unannounced or by accident as pennatus knew how to fashion such a lock he was given the job of making it himself what a clever fellow you are remarked dorso after the lock was installed one night there came a soft knocking on pinarias door the hour was late but pinaria was not asleep she rose from her bed and went to the door at once she did not bother to ask who was knocking she opened the door and saw his head and shoulders silhouetted by moonlight her first thought was that he was mad to come to her on a night when the moon was so bright and might cast such a glaring light on his movements what if he had been observed in the next instant he was inside shutting the door behind him then his arms were around her and his body was pressed against hers it was pinaria who initiated the kiss pressing her mouth to his she had never kissed a man before it seemed to her that they drew the same breath and shared the same heartbeat she was not accustomed to being naked even among the other vestals but that was the way he wanted her she allowed him to disrobe her then helped him to take off his own tunic she wanted no pretense that anything was being done solely at his behest or against her will whatever might happen it would not occur because she merely allowed it but because she made it happen she knew a little about the basic act of sex but she could not have imagined the sensations that accompanied it the touch of his flesh against her own was thrilling but nothing compared to the feeling when a part of his body actually entered her own and began to move inside her there was a sharp pain at first but it seemed a small thing to bear compared to the pleasure that followed the rhythm of the act was like a complicated dance or a song of unearthly beauty sometimes slow and languid sometimes rushed and breathless his rhythm inspired her to find a rhythm inside herself she struggled to match his movements cried out in frustration at the sudden awkwardness of it and then laughing breathlessly clutching his hips she demanded that his rhythm match her own he submitted resisted submitted again they seemed to be in competition for a while and then almost at odds and then without warning in perfect ecstatic harmony they reached the pinnacle in the same instant she felt him shudder and convulse inside her and at the same time a wave of exquisite pleasure washed over her entire body the thing was done there could be no turning back the occupation of the gauls continued throughout the hot summer and into the autumn cooler days brought some relief to the defenders atop the capitoline but their hunger increased rations were reduced to a handful of bread and a cup of wine a day house by house the gauls continued to pillage and burn the city below poisoning the air with smoke after the failure of their initial attempts the gauls stopped laying siege to the capitoline but sentries still kept constant watch around the perimeter on an autumn night when the air was cool but acrid with smoke pinaria and pennatus lay naked upon her bed a shaft of moonlight from a high small window illuminated their sweatglazed bodies the hour was midnight but neither of the lovers slept there was still too much pleasure to be had from each others bodies to think of sleep pinaria had been delighted but not surprised to discover that pennatus was such an insatiable lover what had surprised her was the depth of her own craving which was as great as his if not greater the devotion she had once given to tending the sacred hearthfire she now gave to the tending the fire that flared up inside them each time their bodies met when she joined with pennatus it seemed to her that she was taken to a place beyond the mortal world to a mystical realm such as that where the gods must dwell she worshiped his body the vehicle that transported her to that divine place she adored his sex that part of him so potent yet so exposed and vulnerable which he eagerly placed into her safekeeping such thoughts were blasphemous surely but the gods were gone and the vestal was no longer a virgin and a slave had become her master the world was a mad broken place but pinaria had never before felt so alive and complete through the little window very faintly they heard the cry of all clear from the nearest sentry the cry was echoed from various points around the perimeter of the barricades and cliffs in the silence that followed a goose let out a single plaintive honk to save them from the gauls the sacred geese of juno had been brought from the goddesss new temple on the aventine and were being kept in an enclosure beside the temple of jupiter we shall have to eat them soon said pennatus the geese theyre sacred to juno said pinaria but what good are geese to a goddess if all her worshipers die of starvation no one would dare to touch them yet ive noticed that their ration of grain has been cut those geese are getting awfully skinny soon therell be no meat on them worth eating better to eat them now while they can still give us some sustenance people would sooner eat the dogs but the dogs at least serve a function they keep vigil at night along with the sentries my old master was especially fond of goose liver he said it was quite delicious pennatus what terrible things you say he snuggled close like the things i whisper in your ear when im inside you she shivered and clutched his sex which was full and firm in her hand they had finished only moments ago and already he was stiff again he cupped her breast and kissed her nipple a wave of sheer pleasure rippled through her she sighed long before anyone considers eating the sacred geese camillus will come this was the hope on everyones lips only a few days earlier an intrepid soldier from the outside pontius cominius had managed to pass through the gauls defenses and reach the defenders on the capitoline he had filled his tunic with bits of cork and floated down the tiber and then by night stole through the streets and scaled the capitoline at a point so craggy and steep that the gauls kept no watch on it the roman sentry who witnessed his arrival had been amazed to see a human scrambling like a spider up the sheer rock face and even more amazed when the man called out to him in latin pontius cominius brought word that the roman forces were gradually regrouping under the leadership of the exiled camillus who requested that the handful of senators trapped atop the capitoline should formally invest him with the powers of a dictator the senators had sent pontius cominius back to camillus with a pledge of their full support and promises to pray for his victory had the messenger passed safely through the gallic forces to return to camillus no one knew but the news from outside had brought fresh hope to the capitoline camillus was on the march and might arrive any day camillus the conqueror of veii would rescue them and drive the gauls from roma pennatus rolled away from her onto his back his member became noticeably more pliant in her hand and then what you shall go back to being a vestal and i shall go back to being a slave the sweat turned cold on pinarias body she released his sex and pulled the coverlet over her breasts the future that pennatus suggesteda resumption of the way things had been before the gauls camewas far less horrible than the one she envisioned pinaria knew all too well what was done to a vestal found guilty of breaking her vow and what was done to the vestals lover who can say what the future will bring she whispered who knew that camillus would be exiled or that brennus and the gauls would come and change everything who knew that you would become my loverwho could imagine such a thing who knew that i the sudden break in her voice caused him to furrow his brow go on pinaria what were you about to say she drew a sharp breath i may be mistaken it may be the strain of the siege that caused the interruption i think that this happens to women sometimeswhen theres a terrible crisis or if they go hungry pinaria what are you saying the full moon has come and gone and come again and yetno blood flowed from inside me i dont know much about such thingsbut even i know what it means when a womans menses is interrupted he rose onto his elbows and stared at her shadows hid his face are you with child i dont know not for certain as i said perhaps theres another explanation he moved closer the moonlight revealed his awestruck expression but this is wonderful terrible and wonderful at the same time pinaria shivered and hugged herself sooner or later it will begin to show what will i do then perhaps no one will notice not notice i shall grow fatter while everyone else grows thinner you can loosen your robes you can say that you need seclusion ill wait on you and not let anyone else approach and maybe camillus will come soon and set us free and we can leave the capitoline and go where i could never hide my condition among the others in the house of the vestals then we shall go into hiding or run away well flee up to gaul and live among godless savages i dont know what well do pinaria but well think of something its just as you said no one can know what the future will bring he slipped beneath the coverlet and lay next to her his hand sought hers and held it tightly together they stared into the dark corners of the room i know youre afraid he said afraid of what the others will do to us if they find out butis it more than that what do you mean are you unhappy becausebecause its the child of a slave inside you pennatus i never expected to carry any mans child i dont know what im feeling i never said i was unhappy becausebecause theres something about me that you dont know it might make a difference she turned to face him she touched his cheek and looked into his eyes which reflected the pale moonlight i know that youre very brave pennatus and very funny and wicked sometimesthe things you say i know that youre not like anyone else ive ever met and that i love you and i know that you love me such a precious thing this love between us sometimes i think it must be a gift from the goddess even though i know thats impossible i could never regret that youve given me a child pennatus i only wish i wish things were different too i wish that you werent a vestal i wish that i wasnt born a slave if it werent for the bitterness of fate i might have been as highborn as you pinaria i have the blood of patricians in me what do you mean this talisman i wearits more than it appears to be and so am i he held up the image of fascinus the black amulet gleamed dully in the moonlight its not made of lead pinaria its only been dipped in lead to hide whats beneath so that no master would bother to take it if you scratch through the lead you can see the pure yellow gleam underneath its made of gold pinaria its an heirloom its very ancient older than roma itselfolder than all the gods and goddesses of roma fascinus was here first even before jupiter she shook her head more blasphemy pennatus this isnt funny its neither blasphemy nor a joke its the truth pinaria before she died my mother told me where i came from and who i really am i was born a slave yes and so was she but her father was the son of titus potitius a roman of the most ancient patrician blood and icilia the sister of lucius icilius who was a tribune of the plebs the son of titus potitius and icilia was illegitimate and he was made a slave at birth because of the spite of his uncle but even as a slave he wore the talisman of the potitii around his neck and titus potitius himself in secret told him the tale of his birth that slave passed the talisman on to his daughter my mother she was born a slave in the household of icilius but was later sold to my master in whose house i was born before she died she passed the talisman to me it represents the god fascinus the most ancient deity worshipped by mortals in roma fascinus was known even before hercules and jupiter and long before the gods who came to us by way of the greeks pinaria was silent for a long time you never told me this before its my deepest secret pinaria you scoff at the gods i believe in fascinus you mock the freeborn you laugh at the vanity of patricians i am a patricianby blood if not by birth titus potitius was my greatgrandfather dont you see pinaria the child inside you isnt the offspring of a nobody a slave who came from nowhere who has no ancestors worthy of remembrance the child inside you carries the blood of the first settlers of roma from both his mother and his father whatever others may say and whatever the law may call me you need not be ashamed of the child you can be proud even if you must be proud in secret pennatus i feel no shame for what weve done or whats resulted from it perhaps its not even sinful if vesta is truly gone and all the gods have left their temples here on the capitoline it may be that your god fascinus holds sway in roma all alone as he once did long ago and you and i are doing his bidding and everything is proper who can say in a world where everything can change in the blink of an eye no pennatus im not ashamed but i am fearful for you and for me and for the child she shook her head i didnt mean to tell you some impulse came over me and made me speak i had thought to keep it to myself until i was sure or else she bit her tongue and said no more why tell pennatus where her thoughts had led whenever she considered the child that might be growing inside her there were ways to rid a womans womb of an unwanted baby pinaria had a vague notion that there were potions that could be drunk some of them dangerously poisonous or that a slender wand perhaps made of supple willow might be inserted into her body to bring about the desired expulsion but pinaria had no sure knowledge of such matters and there was no one she could ask for advice or assistance and there was no way to obtain such a potion there was not a single willow tree on the capitoline and now that she had told pennatus about the child and he had responded by sharing his deepest secret with her and had shown an almost fierce pride in the act of giving her a child she shook her head the voice of the holy vestal that still dwelled inside her whispered what a thing that a slave should be proud of his offspring what a world where a vestal could delude herself into thinking that her pregnancy might please a god suddenly in the quiet stillness of the night one of junos sacred geese let out a loud blaring honk the unexpected noise broke the tension between them pennatus laughed pinaria managed a crooked smile the goose honked again and then again if that keeps up a certain goose is likely to get plucked sacred to juno or not muttered pennatus he brought his lips to hers they kissed he moved to embrace her then drew back the single goose had been joined by others making the same abrupt braying racket a good thing were not trying to sleep its the sentrys fault waking them up by calling the allclear said pinaria but that was a long time ago long enough for the geese to fall asleep again pennatus frowned maybe long enough for the sentry to fall asleep the honking of the geese continued stay here whispered pennatus lock the door after i leave therell be others up awakened by the geese i may not be able to return tonight without being seen kiss me pinaria pennatus tore himself from her arms reached for his sworddorso had insisted on arming him despite his statusand slipped out the door he waited until he heard her drop the lock into place then hurried toward the sentry post beyond the goose pen the rocky face of the capitoline was very steep at that pointindeed it was the very place where pontius cominius had made his impossible ascent but of course the ascent of pontius cominius had not been impossible if he could do it so could others on a moonlit night might a company of gauls be able to find the footholds and handholds by which pontius cominius had reached the top of the capitoline it seemed impossible and surely in the stillness of the night a sentry would hear anyone making such an ascent and peer over the side to see them long before they reached the top unless the geese continued to honk pennatus saw the sentry standing at his post at the cliffs edgethen realized that the figure dimly lit by the moon was not the sentry but a gaul while pennatus watched two other gauls appeared clambering over the ledge and standing upright his blood froze he tightened his grip on the sword he had never actually used such a weapon except in practice with dorso he gripped the image of fascinus and did something he had never done before he whispered a prayer for courage and strength out of my way slave an armorclad figure knocked him aside and rushed past him pennatus recognized marcus manlius a friend of dorsos and a former consul the grizzled veteran rushed headlong toward the gauls giving a great shout he struck the foremost with his shield the man staggered back and fell screaming from the cliff taking the other two with him more gauls scrambled over the edge manlius struck with his shield and stabbed with his sword pennatus gave a cry and ran to join him his sword struck metal with a deafening clang he lunged again and struck flesh the sickening impact seemed to travel into his arm and all through his body pennatus had scarcely ever caused another man to bleed much less killed a man under moonlight the blood on the paving stones was glistening and black he heard a shout turned and saw dorso the warrior slashed his sword against the exposed neck of a gaul with such force that he nearly decapitated the man a fountain of blood erupted from the wound the look on dorsos face was ferocious and frightening filled with utter hatred the gauls had destroyed his city driven away his gods ruined his world now at last dorso had a chance to bring death and suffering on at least a few of the gauls in return what had the gauls done to pennatus their invasion had brought him unexpected freedom a friendship he could never have known before and a love he would never have dared to imagine he feared the gauls but he could never hate them as dorso did then he thought of pinaria if the capitoline was taken all would be lost pinaria the most exquisite and perfect thing in all the worldwhat might they do to pinaria miraculously the gaul who had been struck by dorso was still alive staggering this way and that with a great cry pennatus ran toward him raised his blade and finished what dorso had started the gauls head went flying through space it disappeared beyond the precipice where yet more gauls were climbing over the edge the geese cackled madly men shouted and screamed suddenly there were many more gauls and just as many romans what started as a skirmish abruptly became a battle with clanging swords all around and blood everywhere the moonlit battle seemed incredibly intense and yet utterly unreal to pennatus like a strange dream yet it was no strangerand no more dangerousthan the waking dream in which pennatus had become the secret lover of a fallen vestal the gauls were repulsed for being the first to rush to the romans defense marcus manlius was declared a hero and rewarded with extra rations of bread and wine a full ration of grain was also restored to the sacred geese whose honking had alerted the defenders as for the sentries on duty that night the military commanders at first declared that all would be put to death for negligence so would the dogs who kept vigil with them it was presumed they had all fallen asleep at their posts including the dogs since not a single dog barked the geese had proven to be better sentinels dorso argued against the mass punishment pointing out that the romans could ill afford to lose so many men and among the common soldiers there was a great outcry it was decided that only the sentry responsible for the area where the assault took place would be punished the man denied that he had fallen asleep in the stillness of the night he said he had heard a man and a woman talking distracted and bored he wandered from his post toward the temple of jupiter trying to figure out where the voices came from his excuse gained him no sympathy he was hurled to his death from the ledge where the gauls had staged their attack as a token punishment a single guard dog was also thrown from the cliff the romans increased their vigilance so did the gauls who were determined that no more messengers should reach the capitoline from the outside world throughout the winter the occupation and the siege continued rain brought fresh drinking water to the romans but food grew scarcer if only it would rain fish said pennatus one day watching a downpour from beneath the pediment of the temple of jupiter or honey cakes said dorso or bits of dried beef said marcus manlius who had a fondness for military rations the situation atop the capitoline grew more and more desperate but so did the circumstances of the gauls having never dwelled in a city they understood nothing about sanitation and the disposal of their own wastes they made a pigsty of roma and a plague broke out among them so many died so quickly that the survivors gave up on burying the bodies separately but instead piled the corpses in heaps and set fire to them once again as earlier in the siege flames and columns of smoke surrounded the capitoline the sight of the flaming pyres was ghastly the smoke and the stench from the burning bodies was stifling as pennatus wryly commented to dorso these gauls have a madness for burning having torched all the houses now they set fire to each other the gauls also grew hungry early in the siege they carelessly burned several warehouses full of grain they sorely missed that grain now though the romans on the capitoline could not know it the forces of camillus had taken control of much of the countryside and the gauls could no longer go raiding at will to replenish their stores the city which they had claimed as a prize was becoming a trap and a tomb publicly pinaria joined in the daily prayers that camillus would soon arrive and rescue them privately she lived in constant fear she did everything she could to hide the visible evidence of her pregnancy she had so far succeeded perhaps because the child growing inside her was small and undernourished but what would happen when she gave birth even if she could hide in her room and deliver the child in secret how could she conceal a crying baby could she bear to kill the child immediately after it was born babies were allowed to die every day especially if they were imperfect but even the most unfeeling mother did not kill an unwanted baby with her own hands it was taken from her and left in an open place to die from exposure to the elements or wild beasts the quickest and easiest way to dispose of the child would be to throw it from the capitoline but even that might prove impossible because such a close watch was kept at all points of the perimeter would pennatus do it if she asked him what a terrible thing to ask a father to murder his own child and yet if the child were born and allowed to live it would surely be discoveredthe proof of their crimeand they would all three be put to death many times pinaria woke from nightmares in which she saw pennatus beaten to death and then was sealed in a chamber underground without light or air the baby was buried along with her and in the utter darkness of the crypt its wailing was the last sound she could hear in dark moments she allowed herself to imagine that the baby would be born dead that would end the fear and dreadbut what a thing for a mother to wish for to give birth to a dead child perhaps it would be better for pinaria to jump from the precipice herself and to do so soon before the child inside her grew any larger let the gauls find her broken body and burn it on a pyre men would honor her memory then they would say she had offered herself a pure vestal as a sacrifice to the gods the unborn child would die with her and pennatuss guilt would never be known slave or not such a clever fellow surely had a life worth living ahead of him he would soon forget her and the child that had resulted from their crime it would be as if pinaria had never lived the one outcome that she would not allow herself to imaginebecause it was impossible and thus too painfulwas that the baby would be born healthy and whole and that she would be able to look upon its face and proudly show it off and cherish it with all the devotion and affection of any normal mother such a thing could never happen these desperate thoughts consumed her she grew distant from pennatus they ceased to make love the act that had given her such delight she now saw to be a treacherous thing a trap into which she had foolishly fallen for a while they still met in secret and instead of making love they conversedbut what was there to talk about except the suffering inflicted on them by the siege and the even greater suffering that awaited them eventually she forbade pennatus to come to her private chamber again saying she did so for his own safety when in fact she simply could not bear to be alone with him she grew closer to dorso who treated her always with deference and respect pennatus as dorsos friend was often present in their company but he knew better than to treat her with too much familiarity he hid his pain and confusion by making wry comments and bitter jokes and no one noticed that his behavior was any different than before people did notice a change in pinaria and commented on it men called her the melancholy vestal but they thought her suffering was for their sake and they honored her sadness as a sign of her piety for seven months the gauls occupied roma from midsummer to midwinter it was on the ides of februarius that pinaria crossing the capitoline her head clouded by dark thoughts was given the news by dorso he ran up to her he said something she was so distracted that she did not hear his words but from his animated expression she realized that something of great importance had happened from the corner of her eye she perceived movement she looked around and saw that all of the capitoline was in a great commotion people hurried this way and that gripped one another spoke in whispers and shouts laughed wept whats happening dorso a messenger has comea roman the gauls allowed him to pass he came right up the pathway a messenger who sent him camillus of course come lets hear what the man has to say he led her to the temple of jupiter where a soldier dressed in armor but carrying no weapons stood on the top step to address the crowd people shuffled aside to allow pinaria to move to the front of the crowd men were shouting questions at the messenger who raised his hand be patient he said wait until everyone has gathered otherwise i shall have to repeat myself a hundred times but look here shouted marcus manlius gaius fabius dorso has arrived with the melancholy vestal thats everyone who counts say what you have to say people in the crowd laughed the mood was cheerful for everyone could see by the messengers face that he came with good news very well over the last few months our armies have regrouped under the leadership of the dictator marcus furius camillus there was a great cheer who has met with the gauls in a number of minor engagements we cannot claim to have defeated the enemy but we have stung them repeatedly and the gauls have had enough theyre ready to leave roma the cheer was deafening the messenger motioned for quiet but the gauls will not leave without a ransom a ransom shouted manlius havent they looted everything that was of any value in roma they have but they demand still more there is to be a payment of jewels and precious metals camillus has gathered everything he can from the romans in exile and appealed to our friends for contributions the people of clusium should pay the ransom shouted manlius did we not sacrifice ourselves to save them from being sacked by the gauls the clusians have contributed very generously and so have many others said the messenger but there is still not enough camillus looks to you here on the capitoline who never left roma to help make up the final measure of the ransom there were shouts of protest us said manlius for months weve eaten flyblown flour and drunk nothing but rainwater these people have nothing left to give are you sure perhaps some of you know where treasure was buried to hide it from the gauls perhaps some of the women still have a few pieces of jewelry all the roman women in exile have already contributed every piece of jewelry they possessed this is wrong shouted manlius our women should not be stripped of every ornament simply to satisfy the greed of brennus there is no other way said the messenger the gauls must be paid once they leave the city will be ours again and we can begin to rebuild dorso looked over his shoulder at pennatus and grinned perhaps you should donate that little talisman you wear so proudly pennatus gripped the image of fascinus he scowled and clutched it so hard that his knuckles grew pale dorso laughed relax pennatus i was only joking not even a gaul would want that worthless piece of lead the ransom was paid in the forum brennus insisted on a formal ceremony at which camillus himself was present those on the capitoline watched the transaction with mingled dismay and relief the gauls produced a huge set of scales large enough to weigh a whole ox lead weights were placed on one tray the roman emissaries piled the ransom onto the other the treasure of ingots coins and jewels rose higher and higher until at last the lead weights began to rise the two sides of the scale reached equilibrium a sigh passed through the crowd watching from the capitoline to see such a fortune paid to recover the city that was theirs by birthright down in the forum brennus strutted before the scales and laughed not quite enough he shouted camillus looked at him darkly what are you saying the scales are balanced i forgot to include this you want me to put it aside do you not brennus drew his sword and tossed it atop the lead weights groans of anger and disgust rose from the roman delegation some of the officers reached for their swords but camillus held up his hand to stay them we have yet a little more treasure in reserve place it on the scales more was added to the ransom until the two sides were balanced again brennus let out a roar of triumph and clapped his hands the gauls broke into raucous cheering and laughter even from the capitoline the watchers could see camilluss face turn dark red from fury and chagrin pinaria watching with the rest suddenly felt the presence of pennatus beside her his hand sought hers she submitted to linking her fingers with his whatever may happen pinaria i love you he whispered and i she could not bring herself to say the words she let out a gasp drew back her hand and placed it on her belly the baby was kicking inside her she sensed that the time was drawing very near like a ruinous floodtide receding the gauls withdrew from roma the process took several days there were a great many of them and they were not in a hurry they continued to rummage for loot and set fires until the final hour of their occupation the romans on the capitoline despite their impatience waited until the last gaul had departed before they began to climb over the barricades and descend the winding path elated to be free at last but horrified at the wreckage of their beloved city they dispersed across the seven hills each seeking a remnant of home and awaited the return of camillus and the exiles dorso with pennatus at his side accompanied pinaria to the doorway of the house of the vestals the structure appeared to be intact though the doors had been broken open and hung crookedly from their hinges trembling pinaria stepped inside dorso moved to follow her but pinaria shook her head no stay back what i must do here i must do alone but we cant be sure its safe i cant leave you vestal of course you can do you think the goddess has protected me this long only to allow some misfortune to befall me in the house of the vestals go dorso leave me so that i can set about purifying the house before the other vestals return arent you eager to see whats become of your own house dorso frowned and you pennatus where will you go he shrugged back to my old masters house i supposeif theres anything left of it very well then said dorso the three parted company only moments after pinaria crossed the threshold her water broke and then the pains began staggering she made her way to her bedchamber the room was filthy the bed disheveled a gaul had slept there in her absence she felt a wave of revulsion but had no other choice than to collapse onto the bed a little later she opened her eyes pennatus stood over her in her delirium she thought he was an image sent by vesta to taunt her with her guilt but then pennatus smiled and she knew he was real he took the cord from his neck and placed it over her head fascinus protects women in childbirth he whispered dont worry pinaria ill stay with you but what do you know about childbirth he grinned what do i not know when i was small i watched slave girls give birth to my masters bastards when i grew older i carried and fetched for the midwives i know what to do pinaria youll be safe with me and so will the baby pennatus pennatus will you never cease to amaze me never i love you pinaria that amazes me most of all it was an early birth and the baby was small but nonetheless healthy he gave a great cry when pennatus held him up to examine him for defects for an hour pinaria held him the winter day was short and shadows were already growing long there were voices from the street the first of the exiles had already entered the city at any moment the vestals might arrive pennatus what shall we do with the child he was born whole and healthy that means the gods want him to live do you really think so i want him to live no matter what the gods intend blasphemy pennatus she shook her head and managed a rueful laugh how absurd that i should chide you ive just given birth to a child in the house of the vestals will you stay here pinaria theres nowhere else for me to go the baby cant stay here with you no can you bear to give him up pinaria she gazed at the child in her arms where will you take him pennatus what will you do with him i have a plan you always do my clever pennatus gently he took the child from her tears ran down her cheeks she touched the talisman at her breast you must take this as well for the baby pennatus shook his head fascinus is for you it averts the evil eye it will protect you from the scrutiny of the other vestals no pennatus fascinus is my gift to you let it remind you of me pinaria as it served to remind me of my mother your mother is dead pennatus and so am i in the world to which you must return we will never see one another again pinaria at least not like this we will never again be alone together never speak words of love but you will know that our child is alive and well proof of the love we shared on the capitoline i promise you that she closed her eyes and wept when she opened them again pennatus and the baby were gone the room grew dark time passed and more time and the room slowly grew light again from within the house she heard voices indistinguishable at first then growing closer and louder they were the voices of women talking with great excitement she recognized the voice of the virgo maxima and of foslia they called her name aloud pinaria pinaria are you here the vestals had returned tell me again where and when you found this infant said dorso frowning yesterday abandoned in the bushes outside the ruins of my old masters house said pennatus clearly the mother had just given birth and who might the mother have been not a gaul surely the child is too handsome to be a gaul dont you think dorso scrutinized the baby he is a goodlooking fellow and too tiny to be a gaul the child of a returning roman then my intuition tells me so no doubt the mother experienced great hardship during the occupation and when she returned to the city to find that all she knew was burned or in ruins the prospect of caring for the newborn was simply too much for her another harsh legacy of the gauls that the women of roma should be so beset by fear and uncertainty that they abandon their children and such a beautiful child as this little fellow you appear to be very fond of this infant pennatus there is something very special about him can you not sense it i think it was a sign that i should have found this child on the very day the gauls departed and the romans returneda pledge from the gods that the city is to be reborn that its best years lie ahead words of piety and optimism from you pennatus i am a changed man since my months on the capitoline and you will be a free man as well if i have any say in the matter you accompanied me when i made the sacrifice on the quirinal you fought beside us when the gauls gained the summit and frightened the geese youve more than earned your freedom and your master is dead and no longer needs you i intend to approach his heirs pay them a reasonable sum and see that they set you free what do you say to that pennatus the gods are surely smiling upon me that i should rescue this child and receive such a pledge from you in the space of two days but what is it pennatus speak if you truly wish to reward a humble slave for his service on the capitoline i have a different request to make not so much for myselffor what am i except a broken thread in the great tapestry woven by of the fatesbut for the sake of this helpless innocent child dorso pursed his lips go on what use is freedom to me on my own in such a devastated city a dull fellow like me would probably starve i would much prefer that you purchase me outright and keep me as your slave i promise that i shall strive every day to prove my worthiness to be your trusted servant i shall be honored to be the slave of the bravest descendent of the bravest of all roman houses the fabii and if someday after my years of service you should see fit to manumit me i will proudly bear a freedmans name that honors my former master gaius fabius dorso pennatus dorso was not immune to flattery even from a slave i see your point i will be glad to honor this request you shall be the most senior of the slaves in my household and my trusted friend and alsothough i know this is an extraordinary request still i feel compelled to make iti ask that you adopt this foundling and raise him as your own son seeing the look of surprise on dorsos face pennatus pressed on is there not an ancient precedent for such an act romulus and remus were foundlings the flotsam left behind by a great flood so too this child was left behind when the gauls at last receded faustulus adopted the twins and never had cause to regret it for the gods meant him to do so and surely you shall not regret it if you adopt this foundling dorso raised an eyebrow why was pennatus so interested in the child he claimed to see the newborn as an omen but seeing omens and bowing to the will of the gods was not in character for pennatus unless his captivity on the capitoline had truly transformed him was it not more likely that pennatuss concern for the newborn sprang from a more personal reason in his head dorso had already done some simple arithmetic the occupation and siege had lasted seven months a normal pregnancy lasted about nine months it was not hard to imagine that pennatus had enjoyed a dalliance shortly before the arrival of the gauls and then during the occupation had became separated from his loverprobably a slave girl but possibly a free woman perhaps even highborn for such things did happen now pennatus had descended from the capitoline to discover that he was the father of a newborn whether slave or free the mother felt obliged to relinquish the child rather than keep itand now the wily slave sought by this gambit to make his own bastard the son of a fabius dorso felt an impulse to call pennatuss bluff and demand the truth from him and yetthe gods worked their will in mysterious ways using doubters and disbelievers and even slaves as their unwitting vessels pennatus might think he was getting the better of his new master but in fact it might be that the gods were guiding both men to do exactly what the gods desired dorso recalled the long walk from the capitoline to the quirinal with pennatus following behind him in retrospect the mad boldness of the act took his breath away yet it had proved to be the best thing he had ever done or probably ever would do that action had made him a famous man his name would be spoken and revered long after he died on that day dorso had become immortaland pennatus had been there with him every step of the way helping him keep up his courage simply by showing no fear pennatus had done no less than dorso yet he would be forgotten by posterity did dorso not owe a debt to pennatusa debt so great that it demanded a repayment as bold as the walk to the quirinal itself dorso nodded gravely very well pennatus i will adopt youri will adopt the child he shall be my son he took the baby in his arms and smiled at the tiny infant then laughed aloud at the look of wonderment on pennatuss face did you not expect that i would say yes i hopedi dreamedi prayed pennatus dropped to his knees clutched dorsos hand and kissed it may the gods bless you master reflexively he reached to clutch the talisman of fascinus at his breast but his fingers touched only his own bare flesh the scattered exiles returned to roma little by little order was reestablished in the devastated city the senate reassembled the magistrates resumed their offices almost at once the veii question was raised again camillus was determined to settle the matter once and for all a few of the most radical of the tribunes of the plebs argued that the city was so ruined and its sacred places so polluted by the gauls that roma should be abandoned altogether they proposed that the entire population should move at once to veii where many of the exiles had taken shelter during the occupation and had begun to feel at home ignoring all other possibilities camillus seized on this argument and decided to frame the debate as an allornothing proposition would the citizens completely abandon roma and move to veii or would they pull down every building in veii for materials to rebuild roma with the senate united behind him camillus came before the people assembled in the forum he mounted the speakers platform to address them fellow citizens so painful to me are these controversies stirred up by the tribunes of the plebs that in all the time i lived in bitter exile my one consolation was that i was far removed from this unending squabbling to contend with this nonsense i would never have returned even if you recalled me by a thousand senatorial decrees but now i have returned because my city needed meand now needs me again to fight an even more desperate battle for her very existence why did we suffer and shed our blood to deliver her from our enemies if now we mean to desert her while the gauls held the city a small band of brave men held out atop the capitoline refusing to abandon roma now the tribunes would do what the gaul could notthey would force those brave romans as well as the rest of us to leave the city is this a victory to lose the thing dearest to us above every other concern the will of the gods must be considered when we follow divine guidance all goes well when we neglect it the result is disaster a voice from the heavens announced the coming of the gauls to marcus caediciusa clear warning to mind ourselvesand yet soon after one of our ambassadors to the gauls flagrantly violated sacred law and took up arms against them instead of being chastised by the people the offender was rewarded soon after the gods punished us by allowing the gauls to take our beloved roma but during the occupation acts of such great piety occurred that the favor of the gods was restored to us against impossible odds gaius fabius dorso performed a miraculous feat to honor the divine founder of the city he left the safety of the capitoline and walked to the quirinal unarmed and oblivious to danger so overwhelming was the aura of sanctity that shielded him that he returned unscathed and though the defenders of the capitoline suffered terribly from hunger they left the sacred geese of juno unmolestedan act of piety that resulted in their salvation how lucky we are to possess a city that was founded by romulus with divine approval those who followed filled it with temples and altars so that gods dwell in every corner of the city some fools will say but surely the gods can be worshiped just as well at veii as here in roma nonsense blasphemy if the gods wished to live in veii they would never have allowed it to be conquered if they did not wish to dwell in roma they would never have allowed us to retake the city the divine favor of a place is not something you can pack in a trunk and take with you yes roma is in ruins and for a time we must endure discomfort but even if we must all live in huts again what of it romulus lived in a hut our ancestors were swineherds and refugees yet they built a city in a few years out of nothing but forests and swamps we shall look to their example and rebuild the city better than it was before this disaster of the gauls is no more than a brief episode roma has a great destiny her story has only just begun have you forgotten how the capitoline received its name a human head was exhumed there which the priests declared to be a mighty omen in this place would reside one day the head and supreme sovereign power of the world that day has not yet comebut it will abandon roma and you abandon your destiny you consign your descendents to oblivion look to your hearts romans this is your heartland let me tell you from my own experience nothing is worse than to pine with homesickness in my exile i never ceased to dream of these hills and valleys the winding tiber the views from the summits the endless sky beneath which i was born and raised here i belong here you belong here and nowhere else now and forever the crowd was deeply moved but remained undecided they responded to camilluss final words with a prolonged uneasy silence just at that moment a company of soldiers returning from guard duty arrived at the far end of the forum the soldiers scheduled to relieve the company were late the exasperated commander ordered his men to halt no point going elsewhere he said we might as well settle right here the acoustics of the forum were such that his words rang out loud and clear to camilluss listeners almost as if they came from the sky people looked at one another in wonder there was nervous laughter and cries of amazement its an omen someone shouted an omen from the gods the voice spoke to marcus caedicius before this whole affair began now the voice speaks to us again we might as well settle right here settle right here the people chanted settle right here settle right here the crowd broke into an uproar of cheering laughter and tears of joy camillus who could see to the far side of the forum and knew exactly where the voice came from was acutely chagrinned for all his eloquence and passion it was a chance remark from an anonymous soldier that tipped the scales standing in a place of honor maintaining their composure despite the uproar of the crowd were the vestals the virgo maxima stood stiffly upright allowing herself a faint smile foslia more smitten than ever by camillus gazed raptly at the dictator her hand sought pinarias and squeezed it tightly oh pinaria she whispered weve been through so muchyou more than any of us and yet all shall be well again vesta never ceased to watch over us and now her servant camillus will guide us back to virtue pinaria did not answer the loss of her baby and her parting with pennatus had plunged her into deep sorrow the resumption of her daytoday duties as a vestal brought her no comfort her contemplation of the sacred hearthfire only filled her with doubt during its hiatus from romaso the other vestals assured herthe fire had never wavered in the least but burned as steadily as ever how could that be when pinaria had repeatedly broken her vow of chastity her transgressions should have extinguished the flame altogether what did it mean that pinaria had sinned and yet no consequence had followed was the goddess oblivious or forgiving or did she simply not exist if a sin had been committed pinaria should be dead if there had been no sin then she should never have been separated from her baby foslia squeezed her hand and gave her a commiserating smile poor pinaria had suffered so much in captivity it was no wonder that she should weep when pinaria bowed her head and clutched her breast foslia thought her sister vestal was suffering a pain in her chest not knowing of the talisman that was hidden beneath pinarias vestments bc the citizens voted to demolish veii and to rebuild roma in celebration a temple was built on the spot where marcus caedicius had received the divine warning it was dedicated to a new deity called aius locutius the announcing speaker camillus also decreed an annual ceremony to honor the geese for saving the romans on the capitoline a solemn procession would be led by a sacred goose of juno perched in state upon a coverlet in a litter to be followed by a dog impaled on a stake the city was rebuilt in hurried and often haphazard fashion neighbors built across each others property lines new construction often encroached on the public rightofway pinching streets into narrow alleys or blocking them altogether disputes over property would continue for generations as would complaints that sewer lines that originally ran under public streets now ran directly under private houses for centuries to come visitors to roma would remark that the general layout of the city more closely resembled a squatters settlement than a properly planned city like those of the greeks the son of pinaria and pennatuswho unknowingly carried the patrician bloodlines of both the pinarii and the potitiiwas duly adopted into the almost equally ancient family of the fabii dorso named the boy kaeso and raised him as lovingly as if he had sprung from his own loins if anything young kaeso received greater favor than his siblings for he was a constant reminder to dorso of the best days of his own youth no other time of his life would ever be as special to dorso as those months of captivity atop the capitoline when nothing seemed impossible and every day of survival was a gift from the gods pennatus lived out his life as the loyal slave of gaius fabius dorso his cleverness and discretion got his master out of many scrapes over the years often without dorso ever knowing pennatus especially looked after young kaeso friends of the family ascribed pennatuss special affection for his young charge to the fact that he had discovered and rescued the foundling to see the two of them walking across the palatine pennatus doting on the boy and the boy gazing up at the slave with complete trust was a touching sight pinaria remained a vestal all her life though she was plagued by doubts that she kept secret and expressed to no one not so secretly she cherished the gift pennatus had given her from which she carefully removed the lead restoring its golden luster and which she wore openly after postumia died and foslia was made virgo maxima when the other vestals expressed curiosity she explained the antiquity of fascinus without revealing its origin foslia was especially intrigued by the protective qualities of fascinus as virgo maxima she introduced the practice of incorporating fascinus into triumphal processions she had a copy made of pinarias original and placed it out of sight under the chariot of a victorious general where it served to avert any evil that might be cast by envious eyes the placement beneath the chariot of this object called a fascinum became a traditional duty of the vestals from that time forward similar amulets made of base metals quickly spread into common use in time almost every pregnant women in roma wore her own fascinum to protect her and her baby from malicious spells some had wings but most did not pinaria had become very fond of dorso during their captivity on the capitoline afterward she was careful to keep a respectable distance from him lest their friendship arouse unsavory suspicions nevertheless at public ceremonies their paths frequently crossed on those occasions pinaria sometimes caught glimpses of pennatus she avoided looking into his eyes and never spoke to him these occasions also allowed pinaria to see her son at various stages as he grew up when kaeso attained his majority and celebrated his sixteenth birthday by donning a mans toga no one including kaeso thought it odd that pinaria should be invited to the celebration everyone knew that the vestal had witnessed his fathers famous walk beyond the barricades and that his father held her in special esteem but young kaeso was a little surprised when pinaria asked him to join her alone in the garden he was still more surprised at the gift she gave him it was a gold chain upon which hung a gleaming golden amulet of the sort called a fascinum kaeso smiled with his unruly strawcolored hair and his bright blue eyes he still looked like a child to pinaria but im not a baby and im certainly not a pregnant woman im a man thats the whole point of this day even so i want you to have this i believe that a primal forcea power older than the godsaccompanied your father and protected him on his famous walk that force resides in this very amulet are you saying that my father wore this when he walked among the gauls no but it was very close to him nonetheless very close this is no common fascinum of the sort that anyone can buy in the market for a few coins this is the first of all such amulets the original this is fascinus who dwelled in roma before any other god even before jupiter or hercules kaeso was a little taken aback these were odd words coming from a vestal an image of the masculine generator of life was an odd gift to receive from a sacred virgin nonetheless he obediently put the necklace over his head he examined the amulet its edges were worn from time it does look very old its ancientas old as the divine power it represents but its too precious i cant accept it from you you can you must she took his hands and held them tightly on this your sixteenth birthday i the vestal pinaria make a gift of fascinus to you kaeso fabius dorso i ask you to wear it on special occasions and to pass it on in time to your own son will you do that for me kaeso of course i will vestal you honor me both heard a slight noise and turned to see that the slave pennatus was watching them from the portico there was a look on his face such as kaeso who had known the slave all his life had never seen before an extraordinary expression of mingled sorrow and joy fulfillment and regret confused kaeso looked again at the vestal and was astounded to see the very same expression on her face pennatus disappeared within the house pinaria released kaesos hands and departed in a different direction leaving him alone in the garden with the amulet she had given him adults were so very mysterious kaeso wondered whether he was ready to become one of them despite the fact that this was his toga day the architect of his own fortune bc so young man this is your toga dayand what a splendid day for it tell me how have you celebrated so far surrounded by the magnificent gardens at the center of his magnificent house wearing his finest toga for the occasion quintus fabius sat with his arms crossed wrinkled his craggy brow and appeared to scowl at his visitor young kaeso had been warned about his eminent cousins severe expression romas greatest general was not known for smiling kaeso tried not to be intimidated even so he had to clear his throat before he could answer well cousin quintus i rose very early my father presented me with a family heirloom a golden fascinum on a golden chain which he took from his own neck to place over mine theres a story connected with it it was given to my grandfather long ago by the famous vestal pinaria then father presented me with my toga and helped me put it on i never imagined it would be so complicated to make the folds hang correctly we took a long walk around the forum where he introduced me to his friends and colleagues i was allowed to mount the orators platform to see what the forum looks like from the perspective of the rostra of course when i was boy said quintus interrupting the speakers platform was not yet called the rostra because it hadnt yet been decorated with all those ships beaks do you know when that happened kaeso cleared his throat again i believe it was during the consulship of lucius furius camillus the grandson of the great camillus the coastal city of antium was subdued by roman arms and the antiates were made to remove the ramming prowsthe socalled rostra or beaksfrom their warships and send them as tribute to roma the beaks were installed as decorations on the orators platform hence the platforms name the rostra quintus scowled and nodded go on after i stood on the rostra we ascended the capitoline there we observed a dorso family traditionretracing the route taken by my greatgrandfather gaius fabius dorso when he walked from the capitoline to the quirinal defying the gauls at the altar of quirinus an augur took the auspices a single hawk was seen flying from left to right the augur declared it a favorable omen favorable indeed the hawk will watch after you in battle and how does it feel young man to be wearing a toga it feels very good cousin quintus in fact the woolen garment was heavier and hotter than kaeso had expected quintus nodded he thought the toga looked rather incongruous on young kaeso serving only to emphasize his boyish good lookshis blond curls and blushing beardless cheeks his full red lips and bright blue eyes aloud quintus merely said you are a man now congratulations thank you cousin quintus kaeso forced a smile of all the days events this visit might the most important of all in honor of his ascent to manhood he had been invited to dine alone with the most eminent of all the fabii the leading member of the many branches of the family the great statesman and general quintus fabius nervous and tired but determined to make a good show of himself kaeso sat stiffly in his backless chair and met his cousins steely gaze well then let us retire to the dining room said quintus you and i shall eat and drink like two men of the world and talk about your future in fact the discussion was almost entirely about the past over various delicaciespork liver with celery in a wine sauce tripe stewed with cinnamon and nutmeg mutton in fennel creamquintus imparted bits of family history kaeso had heard almost all of these tales before but never as told by the great quintus kaesos greatgrandfather had still been alive when quintus was young quintus had met the illustrious dorso on several occasions and had heard the tale of the famous walk from the man himself quintus also related the most famous and tragic exploit of the fabii their great sacrifice during a war against veii when the family raised a whole army from its own ranks only to see all but one killed in a terrible ambush out of three hundred and seven warriors that young man alone survived to carry on the family name said quintus like a forest of noble trees destroyed by fire from a single seedling the family regenerated itselfproof of the gods determination that the fabii should play a great role in romas history quintus was no less shy about trumpeting his own accomplishments early in his career as master of the horse to the dictator lucius papirius cursor he had engaged in battle with the samnites against the dictators express orders though he won a resounding victory he had faced death for his disobedience there i stood in the forum with my father on his knees before papirius pleading for my life only a great outcry from the senate and the people stayed the dictator from ordering his lictors to execute me on the spot with their rods and axes though i was stripped of my office i kept my headbarely but reversals of fortune can be swift just three years later i became one of the youngest men ever to be elected consul i soundly defeated the samnites once again and was awarded a great triumph the very next year the consuls who succeeded me handed the samnites one of their greatest victories over us for better or worse i was not present at the disaster of the caudine forks i suppose you know the shameful story kaeso quickly lowered the olive that was on its way to his mouth yes cousin a roman army under the consuls titus veturius calvinus and spurius postumius seeking a shortcut passed through a narrow defile into a gorge that narrowed even more at its far end when they reached the second narrows the army found that the passage had been completely blocked with felled trees and other debris they hastened back to the entrance only to discovered that it too had been made impassable by the enemy these narrow defiles were the caudine forks between which the whole army was helplessly trapped days passed rather than allow the men to starve or attempt an impossible escape that would have resulted in a complete massacre the consuls submitted to the terms of their samnite captors and what did those terms include said quintus go ahead young man tell me what youve been taught the romans were made to lay down their arms and their armor and to strip off every garment naked they were made to exit through the defile passing under a yoke as a symbol of their subjugation to the enemy even the consuls were forced to do this the samnites jeered and laughed at them and brandished their swords in the romans faces the soldiers returned home alive but in disgrace it was a very dark day for roma the darkest since the coming of the gauls declared quintus but rather than pretend it never happened we must acknowledge it and by perceiving the mistake which the consuls madefailing to scout the path ahead of themwe will make sure that such a thing never happens again meanwhile the war with the samnites continues but there can be no doubt as to the eventual outcome only by conquest can we continue to prosper only conquest can make us secure it is the duty of every roman to raise his sword and lay down his life if he must to fulfill romas destiny the domination of all italy and after that expansion to the north where we shall one day revenge ourselves upon the gauls and make sure they never menace us again will you do your duty to roma young man kaeso took a deep breath i should very much like to kill a few samnites if im able and perhaps a few gauls as well for the first time quintus smiled good for you young man his scowl returned as he began to expound on politics as patricians he asserted it was incumbent on the fabii to assert their hereditary privileges at all times and to protect those privileges against any further encroachment by the plebeians to be sure there are some plebeians worthy of attaining high office it is to romas benefit that the most ambitious and capable of the plebeians have risen to join the ranks of the nobility intermarrying with us and ruling the city alongside us roma rewards merit the rabble foreigners even freed slaves are given a chance to work their way up the ladder although there are plenty of barriers to slow their advance which is as it should be democracy as practiced by some of the greek colonies in southern italygiving every man an equal sayhas been kept out of roma thank the gods here republican principles reign by which i mean the freedom of the noble elite to compete equally and openly for political honors he leaned back on his couch and ceased his discourse for a few moments to enjoy a plate of sautéed carrots and parsnips but ive strayed from the subject of family history a more suitable topic for your toga day the origin of the fabii is shrouded in mystery of course as are all matters that stretch back to a time before writing was introduced among the romans however our best authorities believe that first roman families were descended from the gods my friend marcus julius claims that his family is descended from venus said kaeso indeed said quintus raising an eyebrow that might explain why the julii make better lovers than fighters our pedigree is a bit more heroic according to family historians the very first fabius was the child of hercules and a wood nymph born on the banks of the tiber at the dawn of time thus the blood of hercules flows in the veins of the fabii even now quintus begrudged kaeso a second smile then abruptly frowned and fell silent there was an uncomfortable moment as both men realized they were thinking the same thoughtthat kaesos immediate branch of the family springing as it did from an adoption did not actually carry the ancient fabian blood neither quintus nor kaeso had any way of knowing that the truth was considerably more complicated in fact the claim of the fabii to be descended from hercules was completely spurious while the blood of the visitor later identified as hercules did indeed flow in kaesos veins through his descent from the potitii a circumstance unknown to either man the uncomfortable moment stretched intolerably kaesos face grew hot they had drawn close to a subject that had made kaeso uneasy ever since the day he first learned as a child that his grandfather was not born a fabius but was an adopted foundling the story was told with pride for it demonstrated the piety of the great dorso who from the ruins of roma brought up a newborn orphan to be his son it had also been explained to kaeso that his grandfather was special had not the gods themselves determined that the foundling should be made a fabius the gods set life in motion what mattered after that was what a man made of himself the true test of a romanso said kaesos fatherlay not in his pedigree but in bending the world to his will despite these assertions and reassurances the fact that his actual bloodline was unknown had frequently caused kaeso to wonder and to worry about his origins it seemed inevitable that the subject would come up on this particular day and so it had even if it remained unspoken kaeso became so flustered that he abruptly changed the subject you spoke earlier of your own illustrious career cousin but you made no mention of an episode that has always intrigued me oh yes said quintus what is that i believe it happened not too long before i was born when you were just beginning your political career it had to do with a famous case of poisoningor rather many cases of poisoning quintus nodded grimly you refer to the investigation that took place the year i served as curule aedile a veritable plague of poison if you had rather not talk about it im quite willing to discuss it as with the disaster of the caudine forks there is no sense in hiding such an episode no matter how distasteful as you say i was a young man and quite thrilled to have been elected curule aedile a magistracy that automatically admitted me to the ranks of the senate to me fell the responsibility of keeping law and order in the city that sounds like a fascinating job does it for the most part it consists of tedious administrative dutiesfining citizens whove damaged public property investigating accusations of overcharging by moneylenders that sort of thing not a happy post for a man who would rather be fighting but my complaints paled beside the general gloom that reigned over the city that year people were fearful and uneasy for it seemed that a terrible plague of a most peculiar nature had descended on us its victims were all mennot a woman among themand the symptoms varied inexplicably some died swiftly others recovered for a while and then relapsed and expired even odder was the fact that a disproportionate number of those who died were men of high standing plagues tend to strike the poor and the lowborn in preference to their betters not the other way around the peculiar nature and the mounting toll of this plague were only gradually perceived over a course of months and by that time the priests and magistrates were greatly alarmed it seemed that the wrath of the gods must be at work what had the people of roma especially their leading men done to offend them eventually the senate resorted to an ancient recourse in times of epidemic as you know there is a wooden tablet inside the temple of jupiter affixed to the doorway that leads into the sanctuary of minerva on the right since the founding of the temple every year on the ides of september one of the consuls drives a nail into that tablet to mark the passage of each year thus the age of the temple and of the republic can be calculated the tablet adorns minervas sanctuary because numbers were one of her gifts to mankind but the tablet has another rarer function in times of epidemic a special dictator may be nameda religious not military appointmentto carry out a single duty he must drive an additional nail into the wooden tablet how this custom came about no one knows but its effect is to lessen the ravages of plague thus also the years of plague can be recalled and the frequency of such outbreaks reckoned so it was done in this instance a special dictator was appointedgnaeus quinctilius as i recall with the vestals and the priests and all the magistrates in attendance quinctilius drove a nail into the tablet and then his duty done he resigned his office but the ritual brought no relief the plague continued and the number of victims increased the people grew more frightened and their leaders more uneasy i was as concerned as anyone of course but as curule aedile it hardly fell to me to devise a proper means of propitiating the gods and dispelling the plague then one day going about my business in my chambers in the forum a young woman came to see me she refused to tell me her name but from her dress and manner i could see she was a freeborn servant from a respectable household she said she had something terrible to tell me but only if i would promise to shield her from punishment by the state or retribution by those whose crimes she would reveal well i thought this was going to be nothing more dire than a case of a contractor embezzling bricks from the city or some pipelayer charging twice for repairing the public sewer i gave her my assurances and she proceeded to tell me that the plague that was afflicting the city was of human originand perpetrated not by men but by women she accused her own mistress along with some of the most highborn women in roma on its face her story seemed preposterous for what possible reason would so many women resort to poisoning their husbands and other male relatives one woman might resort to poison yes but scores of women repeatedly all in the same year and yet by that time hundreds of men had died and no cause had yet been discovered i asked for proof she offered to take me to a house where the poisons were made if we were lucky she said we might catch some of the women in the act of brewing them i had to act and quickly in that moment the job i had considered trifling and humdrum suddenly weighed upon me as the world must weigh upon the shoulders of atlas quintus sighed but his eyes glittered relating the grim story clearly gave him great satisfaction and then what happened cousin quintus speed was essential yet proper forms had to be observed or otherwise any evidence might be compromised i alerted the consuls at oncehow old gaius valerius blustered when i woke him from a nap in the middle of the day with the consuls as witnesses along with their lictors i went to the house in question the home of a patrician named cornelius one of the first victims of the plague his widows name was sergia her door slave seeing such a company blanched and tried to shut us out i pushed my way inside at the back of the house we found a room which must have been a kitchen at one time but that had been given over entirely to the brewing of potions herbs were hung by bits of string from the rafters pots were bubbling and steaming one pot had been set on a wooden rack to cool lined up beside it was a row of little clay bottles sergia was clearly in charge the other women were merely servants when she saw us and realized what had happened she grabbed one of the bottles and raised it to her lips i knocked the bottle from her hand it shattered on the floor and spattered my tunic with a green liquid the lictors restrained her there was a rage in her eyes that chilled my blood sergia refused to answer questions but with a little persuasion her slaves spoke readily enough they led us to more than twenty houses where the products of sergias kitchen might be found what a day that was bursting into house after house witnessing the outrage of the women the disbelief of their husbands the fear and confusion of the children the implicated women were made to appear before the consuls in the forum along with the potions that had been seized before that day there had never been a public inquest into charges of poisoning such matters were rare enough and when they did occur they had always been handled entirely within the affected household with justice dispensed by the paterfamilias it began beneath his roof let it end beneath his roof as the saying goes if a head of households wife or daughter or his son for that matter dared to commit such a crime it was the prerogative of the paterfamilias to determine guilt and exact punishment but this was clearly beyond the scope of any one paterfamilias there was simply no precedent for such a thinga vast web of crimes spun by a conspiracy of women the consuls were fearful of repercussions from the powerful families involved they were only too happy to allow me as curule aedile to conduct the questioning sergia at last broke her silence she claimed that her potions were remedies for various ailments none of them poisonous if that were so i said then let every woman present swallow the potion that was found in her possession this caused a great stir among the women there was much weeping shrieking tearing of hair gradually the women quieted one another at last they agreed to the test in unison following the lead of sergia the women swallowed their socalled remedies quintus shook his head what a sight what a sound the death throes of more than twenty women there before our eyes not all the potions were the same and their effects differed some of the women were seized by violent convulsions others stiffened and died with a hideous grimace i was a young man but i had already fought in several battlesi had killed men and seen men killedyet i had never witnessed anything as strange and terrifying as the death of those women by their own hands kaeso gazed at his cousin wideeyed the details of the mass poisonings were completely new to him kaeso found the tale at once thrilling and repulsive was that the end of it cousin quintus far from it the friends and servants of those dead women had much more to tell us as more women were implicated we realized that the scale of the conspiracy was larger than anyone could have imagined in the end more than one hundred and seventy women were found guilty and all were put to death the murder of so many upstanding citizens the shocking investigation the executionsall cast a shadow of despair across the city the truth was too appalling for some to accept there were those who said i went too far that my judgment was faulty that i allowed wicked people to falsely accuse the wives and daughters of their enemies well even the gods are not infallible i believe my investigation was thorough and impartial and that no other man could have done better in any event the poisonings stopped and the citizens of roma rewarded me with election to higher office in the years that followed kaeso shook his head i had no idea the crimes were so widespread and so bizarre id heard only vague rumors before im not surprised when the wretched affair was over people did their best to forget it but why did those women commit such crimes the reasons they gave were as varied as the poisons they used greed revenge spite jealousy having committed murder once many of the women seemed unable to resist doing so again it was as if a kind of madness spread among them a homicidal contagion a compulsion to kill the root cause of that madness no one could determine the only certain cure was death i put an end to the plague of poisonings and since that time it has never recurred what a fascinating story do you really think so absolutely i should like to know even more who were those women what were their names whom did they kill and why and when and amused and a little flattered by his young cousins enthusiasm quintus emitted a goodnatured grunt that sounded suspiciously like a laugh well young man as it happens i kept a very thorough dossier of materials relating to my investigationfor my own protection if nothing else so that if called upon later i could show exactly what evidence i had obtained and the circumstances under which i obtained it all the details are therenames dates even the recipes the women used to concoct their various poisons quite a few of them were able to read and write and some of them kept copious notes about the poisons and their effects would you allow me to see that dossier cousin certainly do you know no one has ever asked to see it before and yet that investigation is now a part of the familys history a part of romas history it shouldnt be forgotten said kaeso quintus nodded very well those materials must be somewhere among my memorabilia when i have time i shall locate them and let you have a look later that night alone in his room in his fathers house kaeso prepared for bed by the flickering light of a single lamp he removed his toga without assistance getting out of the garment was much easier than putting it on he carefully folded the toga and placed it on a chair he stripped off his undertunic and loincloth and stood naked except for the gift his father had given him that morning the fascinum which hung from the chain around his neck among the other gifts kaeso had received that day was a small mirror a slave had already hung it on the wall the mirror was round made of polished silver and decorated around its border with images engraved in the metal the images depicted the exploits of hercules no doubt the giver a colleague of kaesos father had thought the mirror would make a particularly appropriate comingofage gift for a young fabius as the fabii considered themselves to be descended from hercules but the reflection of his own face surrounded by images of the demigod only reminded kaeso that he was not really a fabius by blood only by adoption kaeso stood naked before the mirror and gazed at his shadowy reflection today you are a man kaeso fabius dorso he whispered but who are you where did you come from your grandfather was a foundling among the rubble was he begotten by a god or a gaul will you live and die and never know the secret of your originor is there an oracle who can answer your question he touched the amulet at his chest the gold of the fascinum caught the lamps flickering light and kaeso was dazzled by its reflection in the mirror the next morning kaeso donned his toga again to pay a formal call upon a man he had never met appius claudiusthe seventh of that name in the line descended from attus claususblinked in disbelief when his secretary announced his first visitor of the day the young fabius he said are you sure you heard the name correctly the slave nodded claudius pursed his lips and stroked his beard which was still more black than silver very well show him in ill meet him here in the garden turn away all other visitors until were done if anything the garden of appius claudius with its splashing fountain surrounding a statue of three muses and its terraces of roses was even more magnificent than the garden of quintus fabius kaeso was duly impressed but not surprised if any man was as powerful and respected in roma as his cousin quintus that man was quintuss longtime rival appius claudius i believe that congratulations are in order young man said claudius standing to greet him your toga suits you well in fact kaeso had dressed himself that morning without the help of a slave and had not quite succeeded in making the garment hang correctly he was glad to take the chair which claudius offered sitting disguised the awkward folds of his toga thank you for receiving me censor kaeso addressed his host by the title of the prestigious office he held in many ways the censorship was an even higher magistracy than the consulship and its exalted rank was signified by the purple toga that the censor alone could wear the censor had the power to fill vacancies in the senate he also kept the rolls of citizenship he could add men to the list or with just cause strike them from it the censors list determined the division of citizens into voting units a tool the patricians had long used to their advantage by manipulating the list the censor could influence the course of elections appius claudius had also used the powers of his office to gain complete control over two public works projects of unprecedented vastness this was the reason kaeso had come to see him if i look a bit surprised you must understand that its been a very long time since any man named fabius has cast a shadow in this garden said claudius who smiled as readily as quintus scowled kaeso had heard that the mans charm was his most notable quality when the fabii said this it was not a compliment whenever a political question arises it seems that your cousin quintus leans in one direction and i lean in the other the two of us can never seem to meet either on policy or in the flesh kaeso spoke carefully no one holds quintus fabius in higher esteem than i do but i am my own man well spoken i myself am only too well acquainted with the burden of having famousand infamousrelatives fortunately the worst of them are long dead but like you kaeso i am my own man i am no more responsible for the criminal behavior of my greatgreatgrandfather the decemvir than you are responsible for the dunderheaded backwardlooking politics of your esteemed cousin we are each his own man and each man is the architect of his own fortune shall we drink to that a slave had appeared with two cups of wine kaeso feeling a bit disloyal to quintus but eager to ingratiate himself with his host took a sip the wine was unwatered and stronger than he was used to almost at once he felt warm and a little fuzzyheaded claudius signaled that both their cups should be refilled given the chilly relations between your cousin quintus and myself i assume you must have a very good reason for coming to see me kaeso could feel that the wine was beginning to loosen his tongue perhaps it would not be so difficult to state his desire after all he was just opening his mouth to speak when his host interrupted him but noi can tell that youve come here on business of some sort and its still too early in the day for me to discuss serious business lets get to know one another a little perhaps we have interests in common do you read latin of course i do censor and greek wella little said kaeso by which you mean not at all a pity i thought i might show you my library which is the best in roma but since almost all the books are in greek it would mean nothing to you every roman should learn at least enough greek to read the great playwrightsaeschylus sophocles euripides and of course the great philosophersplato and aristotle but your face remains a blank kaeso do these names mean anything to you im afraid not censor alas claudius shook his head and do you know where that word alas comes from kaeso frowned no and you a fabius with family ties to hercules alas is a latinization of a greek name hylas and who was hylas kaeso furrowed his brow and shrugged claudius sighed hylas was a beautiful boy the beloved of hercules the two of them together accompanied jason and the argonauts on their quest for the golden fleece when the argo dropped anchor at the mouth of the river ascanius hylas was sent to fetch fresh water from the springs but the nymphs were jealous of his beauty and hylas was pulled into the water never to be seen again hercules was distraught beyond comforting for a long timelong after hope of finding the boy was gonehe wandered up and down the riverbank crying out hylas hylas and thus we still cry alas alas when confronted by great sorrow kaeso raised his eyebrows hylas was not among the characters engraved on the mirror he had been given i never heard that story before its quite beautiful there are several versions of the tale of hercules and hylas among my books but you must know greek to read any of them ive never claimed to be a scholar censor a romans primary duty is to serve the state as a soldier indeed and as a warrior you could surely benefit from reading homers iliador even better the life of alexander by cleon of corinth i received a copy only yesterday by courier all the way from a book vendor in athens you have heard of alexander alexander the great of macedonia who hasnt heard of him first he conquered greece and then the whole of the world to the south and eastegypt persia and faraway lands that lie beyond any map my father says were lucky he didnt turn his attention to the west or else wed have had to fight him on the banks of the tiber but alexander wont conquer anyone else hes been dead for ten years now eleven years actuallybut you do indeed seem to know who alexander was very good claudius laughed and shrugged one never knows what a young man is likely to know or not know given the dreadful state of roman education many a roman can name his own ancestors going back ten generationsnot a hard feat since they tend to all have the same namebut how many can name the reigning tyrant of syracuse or find carthage on a map kaeso smiled my father says youre obsessed with syracuse and carthage indeed i am because the future of roma resides in the sea lanes of the mediterranean and those sea lanes will be controlled either by syracuse or by carthageor by us my cousin quintus says our future lies to the north not to the south first we conquer all of italy then we look to gaul nonsense the gauls have nothing to offer us not even a god worth worshiping or a language worth learning the wealth of the world will belong to whoever controls trade in the mediterranean to do that we shall have to become a sea power or else make subjects of those who already have a navysuch as the syracusans and carthaginians your cousin fabiuss misreading of romas destiny lies at the very heart of the disagreement between us ah but here i am talking politics when i was hoping to find common ground between us claudius pensively tapped his forefinger against his lips since you are a kaeso i suppose i might ask your position regarding the controversy over the letter k controversy my own opinion is that it should eliminated altogether from the roman alphabet what need is there for k when c will do just as well thus your name would be spelled caeso and pronounced the same butim rather fond of the k in my name and what about z i say it is abhorrent and must be gotten rid of abhorrent the sound it represents is uncouth and has no place in a civilized language z grates on the ear and offends the eye the eye here observe my face as pronounce it claudius parted his lips clenched his teeth and made a prolonged buzzing noise there do you see a man who makes the sound of z resembles a grinning skull hideous the sound and the letter must be ruthlessly eliminated from the latin language kaeso laughed you seem very passionate about it passion is life young man and yes language is my passion what is your passion kaeso abruptly felt quite sober the conversation had arrived at his reason for coming i want to be a builder censor claudius raised an eyebrow do you yes more than anything im eager to fight for roma of course and if i must enter politics and learn something about the law i will ill even learn some greek if the greeks can teach me something about architecture and engineeringbecause what i really want to do is build its been so ever since i was a child when i was little my favorite toys were building blocks when i grew old enough to go about on my own instead of watching athletes or chariot races or soldiers drilling on the field of mars for hours i would stand at the site of a new temple or monument or even at a place where the city walls were being repaired watching the workmen and the equipment seeing how the hoists and levers and pulleys were used observing how mortar was mixed and bricks laid out to make arches and doorways i admit that i have no special training but i can drawi know that a builder must be able to drawand im very good with numbers much better than i am with letters i see and so youve come to me yes men say that the road youre building running south to capua is like no road ever built beforestraight as a ruler flat as a table hard as bedrock and everyone is talking about your brilliant idea for bringing fresh water to the citytapping the springs near gabii ten miles from roma running the water underground then delivering it to the city atop an elevated channel supported by arches an aqueduct i think you call it amazing these projects are the most exciting things that have happened in my lifetimemore exciting than battles or elections or even stories about conquerors at the far end of the world i want to be part of them i know theres much ill need to learn but im willing to work very hard i want to do whatever i can to help you build your new road and your aqueduct claudius smiled you enthusiasm is flattering i speak from the heart censor i can see that strange the fabii have always been warriors and a few have allegedly been statesmen but never builders i wonder how you came by such a trait kaeso did not care for the question as it reminded him of his unknown origins but he tried not to let his vexation show does your father know that youve come to me yes censor although he disapproves of your politicshe calls you a radical populist radical because i give common citizens wellpaid work on public projects that benefit all of roma i suppose he calls me a demagogue as well kaeso cheeks turned hot his father had indeed used that despised word imported from the greek for an unscrupulous leader who exploited the unruly passions of the mob despite our political differences censor my father understands how greatly i desire to work for you he will do nothing to prevent me and your cousin quintus i havent discussed it with him but i dont need his approval i am yes i know you are your own man claudius drummed his fingers on his knees for a while then nodded and smiled very well kaeso fabius dorso i shall find a suitable place for you on one of my projects thank you censor and in the meantime to please me perhaps you will consider changing the k in your name to a c wellif you really think its necessary kaeso im only jokingalas at dawn the next day following the instructions of appius claudius kaeso set out from his home on the palatine he walked past the ancient hut of romulus and the fig tree called the ruminalis a descendent of the tree which shaded acca larentia when she suckled romulus and remus he descended the winding walkway known as the stairs of cacus he walked through the forum boarium originally bovarium as appius claudius had informed him but the letter v had long ago been dropped by common usage the workers in the shops and markets were just beginning their day he passed the ancient ara maxima where long ago his ancestors the pinarii and the potitii had inaugurated the worship of hercules the potitii still made a sacrifice at the altar each year but a long decline in the familys fortunes had reduced their annual feast to a paltry affair even with his supposed connection to hercules through the fabii kaeso was only vaguely aware of the feast of hercules that took place at the ara maxima each summer and had no idea that it was the oldest such observance in the city of his descent from the pinarii and the potitii he knew nothing his destination was a work site at the foot of the aventine hill between the temple of ceres and the north end of the circus maximus he knew he had reached the place when he saw the great piles of earth and the network of ramparts that had been built around the excavation a small army of workers made up of freedmen and freeborn citizens had gathered they milled about joking and complaining about having to wake up so early the sky growing lighter every moment was dotted with small clouds and there was a breeze from the east looks to be an excellent day for working outdoors said one of the men too bad well be stuck underground a foremen appeared the men formed a queue one by one they were issued shovels and spades then disappeared into a cavelike hole at the base of the hill kaeso waited until the foreman had a spare moment then approached him and introduced himself as claudius had instructed him to do the man was tall and slender but wiry with muscle his tunic was spotless but there was dirt under his fingernails so youre the young fabius here to learn about the aqueduct my name is albinius im in charge of all aqueduct operations within the city walls the most interesting part of the project from an engineering standpoint do you know where the city gets its water currently from the tiber i suppose and from springs here and there inside the city and some people collect rainwater thats right and so its been from the beginning but the water from the tibers not always as clean as you might like and some of the springs have dried up and you cant always depend on rain and the bigger roma grows the more water her people need water for drinking and cooking of course and for irrigating crops outside the city but also for bathing most people like to wash a bit of themselves every day and a lot of people want to wash from head to foot every few days that requires a lot of water the demand has grown so great weve reached a point where the city cant accommodate more people unless we can somehow get more water what to do well simply bring the water we need from elsewhere said appius claudius what carry it by the wagonload said the skeptics no you fools said claudius we shall make the water flow here of its own accord through the channel i shall build and thus thanks to the genius of the censor the aqueduct was bornfirst of its kind anywhere on earth and soon to be the envy of every thirsty city on earth right here is where the aqueduct will end with the water pouring into a big public fountain do you know where the aqueduct begins ten miles west of the city at the springs near gabii said kaeso thats right the fresh water from those springs will pour into an underground channel lined with stones and mortar because its downhill from there to here that channel will carry the water all the way to the city walls to a point near the capena gate the underground channel is impressive in itself if only for the amount of labor involved ten miles requires a lot of digging and its hardly a straight line it twists and turns to follow the contours of the landscape and keep the water flowing downhill but what happens when the water reaches the city will be even more impressive claudius wants the water to come here to the place where were standing the natural way to do itto let the water follow the lay of the land and run downhillwould mean digging a channel straight down the spine of the horseracing track in the circus maximus that would be too disruptive instead claudius wants the water to make a detour around the circus maximus to accomplish that were tunneling through the aventine the channel disappears into one side of the hill and will come out the other right here amazing no but thats still not the most impressive part follow me they walked along the foot of the aventine crossing the open area to the south of the racing track as they approached the city wall and the capena gate claudiuss novel solution for transporting the water loomed before them to bridge the space between the high ground to the left of the gate and the high ground to the right a channel was being built atop a series of arches constructed of brick and mortar the road leading to the gate ran directly under one of these arches to bring the water to roma claudius will not only make it run undergroundhell make it flow above our heads said albinius this elevated part of the aqueduct runs for only a few hundred feet out of a total distance of many miles but its a brilliant solutiona river in the sky theres no reason this kind of construction cant be repeated elsewhere and no reason that such an elevated aqueduct cant be built on an even larger scale running mile after mile water can now be carried from any high point to any low point all thats required is to dig and tunnel and where necessary to run the channel over a series of arches as weve done here since the beginning of the world men have had to build cities where there was adequate water now a city can be built anywhere men wish and the water can be brought to them such a possibility never existed before the aqueduct will change not just roma but the whole world the foremans enthusiasm was contagious and kaeso was impressed he would have liked to spend the rest of the day at the mans side but following claudiuss instructions he took his leave of albinius walking under the immense arch of the aqueduct kaeso passed though the capena gate and beyond the city walls a brisk walk brought him to the censors other great construction project the site swarmed with workers busily digging mixing mortar and pushing barrows filled with gravel kaeso asked for the foreman a man named decius and was taken to the biggest brawniest man in sight so youre here to learn about road building are you said decius well ive been at it all my life learned a thing or two in my fortyodd years but thanks to appius claudius this is the first time ive ever seen a road planned ahead of time with so much care and precision the whole course has been laid out all the proper materials have been acquired and the best team of workers in roma has been assemblednever mind that the boys working on the aqueduct might wish to dispute that claim this is going to be a job we can all be proud of your descendents a thousand years from now will walk on this road and say by jupiter what an outstanding job old appius claudius and his boys did when they laid down this road this road will still be here a thousand years from now it most certainly will kaeso assumed the big man was exaggerating but as decius took him through the steps of laying down the road he began to think the claim might have some merit your first roads were hardly more than footpaths said decius beaten into the ground by so many men passing byor by animals since they make trails too and can usually figure out the best way to get over a pass or around a rough spot when men started using wagons the wheels wore ruts in the ground and that made wider roads finally some unknown genius decided it was time to make a road to fit the purpose instead of just letting it come about on its own and so the art of road building was born the road were building follows a very old trail thats been here for centuries appius claudius says it dates back to the days of the old salt traders and metal traders before roma existed here you see some workers performing the first step in the process see how theyre digging two shallow trenches parallel to each other the trenches mark the breadth of the road this road is fifteen feet wide the sum of three men lying head to toe roman men that is it takes only two and a half gauls to cover that width they say a gaul cut in half is the best kind especially if its the half without a head decius laughed heartily at his own joke and slapped kaeso on the back as if he could jar him into doing the same now if youll follow me up ahead you can see that theyve moved on to the second stage theyve dug out the loose earth between the trenches and excavated down until theyve reached a solid foundation for the materials to rest on how far down you have to dig depends on the terrain sometimes if the grounds swampy or the soils peculiar you have to drive piles into the earth fortunately thats not the case here a strong digger can reach solid roadbed without breaking his back these fellows hardly even break a sweat isnt that right men the diggers looked up at decius and grinned kaeso could see that they liked the foreman keep walking ill show you the next stage see there up ahead those big piles of stones those are for laying the first course of the road these stones have been sorted for size these are what we call handsized no larger and no smaller than will fit in a mans hand they make up the first stratum on top of those we lay down a mass of broken stones about nine inches deep rammed down hard and cemented with limethats called rubblework above that we lay the roadcore about half a foot deep which is made up of bits and pieces of bricks and pottery smaller bits than the stones in the rubblework and cemented with lime you can see a section where the cores been finished up ahead its a bit higher in the middle than at the edges isnt it said kaeso very observant we do that on purpose to let the water run off for now to finish the road were laying down a layer of gravel thats usually the end of the job but on this project the gravel layer is to be only temporary as time and money permit the plan is to scrape away the gravel and lay down blocks of the hardest stone we can find around roma that usually means basaltic lava the stones arent uniform like bricks theyre broken and cut into all sorts of random shapespolygonal we call thembut skilled workmen can pick and choose among those stones and fit them together until the surface is so perfectly even and smooth youd be hardpressed to find the tiniest gap even with your fingertip ive seen walls built that way and theres no reason it cant be done on a road as well up ahead weve completed a small section of the road with a finished stone layer just as a showpiece for now here it is have a look walk on it jump on it stoop down and run your hands over it so flat and smooth and perfect wouldnt you swear it was made of one solid stone that just happens to have a few seams running through it its amazing said kaeso and beautiful and likely to last for more lifetimes than those of all your ancestors put together do you really think the entire road can be finished this finely all the way to capua i believe that roads this fine will some day run all up and down italy and far beyondas far as any roman dares to travel from the pillars of hercules to the banks of the euxine sea people will say here runs a roman road decius laughed you know what appius claudius once said to me alexander conquered half the world with his army but can you imagine what he might have done if only the greeks knew how to build a roman road and just how long has this been going on demanded quintus fabius scowling a month or so since the day after my toga day said kaeso just as i thought this relationship with appius claudius wont do young man it simply wont do quintus had asked his younger cousin to pay him a visit but he did not receive him in the garden instead he met him in the vestibule not only was kaeso being kept from the heart of the house like a merchant paying an unwelcome call and being made to stand rather than sit but here in the vestibule following patrician custom the wax busts of quintuss ancestors were placed in niches in the walls from which they stared unblinking at all who came and went it seemed that not only quintus was scowling at kaeso and judging him so were several generations of dourlooking fabii cousin i am aware of your disagreements with appius claudius the man is degenerate hes polluted his mind with socalled greek learning given half a chance hell pollute your mind as well i dont think you need to worry about that said kaeso so far claudiuss efforts to teach him greek had been fruitless happily kaesos aptitude for engineering exceeded even his own hopes and claudius had been quite impressed with his new protégés intelligence and enthusiasm i sought out appius claudius only because of his construction projects im learning a great deal about roadbuilding and also about the new aqueduct all you need to know about those wasteful and inefficient projects you could have found out by asking me young man they are the result of a gross abuse of the censors office somehow claudius managed to circumvent the senate and plunder the treasury to finance his illegal schemes but those schemes as you call them are surely for the benefit of all roma they are for the benefit of claudius a means to extend his political patronage by giving them jobs he buys the loyalty of the thousands of citizens he employs no doubt he is also enriching himself kaeso frowned are you accusing him of embezzling public funds quintus grunted i wouldnt put it past him youre young kaeso you havent yet seen enough of the world to judge a mans character believe me claudius is not the sort of man with whom our sort should associate but surely hes as patrician as you or i said kaeso did quintus hesitate before replying was he thinking of kaesos origin by adoption and his uncertain bloodline he shook his head the claudii have always been vain and selfimportant but at least in the old days they were rock solid in their support of patrician privilege appius claudius has done an aboutface and made himself a champion of the lower classes oh he pays lip service to patrician idealsthe glory of the ancestors and the founders of the republicbut at heart the man is a demagogue he panders to the rabble he flirts with dangerous democratic ideas which he probably picked up from reading those wretched greek philosophers he admires he should never have been given control of the citizen rolls but as censor thats his duty to update the rolls yes but not to tinker with them and in a most irresponsible fashion oh hell tell you hes simply reorganizing the voting blocks to make them more efficient but his scheme is to make elections more democratic and less weighted to the blocks dominated by patriciansa very dangerous idea the founders in their wisdom designed the electoral process deliberately to give more influence to those families whose achievements long ago earned them a special place in the state nothing must be done to erode that system it has served roma well since the birth of the republic it will serve us just as well for another two hundred years even worse young man is claudiuss abuse of the censors right to fill vacancies in the senate every vacancy is filled with a man loyal to claudiusand some of those new senators are the sons of freedmen such a degradation of the senate would have been unthinkable in my grandfathers day what have we come to times change cousin said kaeso and seldom for the better once a radical idea takes root no one can predict how fast or how far it will spread consider the consulship for a very long time only patricians were able to get themselves elected to the highest office shutting out the plebeians the patricians exclusive claim on the consulship became a tradition which eventually took on the force of law but the socalled reformers objected and fiftyfive years ago they managed to pass a law that allowed one of the two consuls to be a plebeian a matter of fairness said the reformers if a plebeian is clever enough to get himself elected consul then why not but that was only the beginning thirty years ago the reformers passed another law and this one mandated that one of the consuls must be a plebeian where will it end such changes are always due to rabblerousers like appius claudius traitors to their patrician blood claudius is a dangerous man you should steer clear of him kaeso sighed cousin quintus please understand i share your political views how could i not theyre the ideas my father imparted to me while i was growing up but just as i convinced my father to allow me to work under claudius so i hope that i can convince you to lift your objections i have no intention of aiding or abetting appius claudius in any rabblerousing schemes but the aqueduct and the new road are being built no matter what objections you may have and i want to have a hand in them if such projects yield political benefits then why should claudius be the sole beneficiary why should there not be a fabius involved in the projects learning how the process works in years to come more roads and aqueducts will be built and when that happens i want it to be a fabius who takes the credit and reaps the benefits quintus shook his head you walk a dangerous path kaeso to learn a bit about building and engineering is not a bad thing but claudius is a devious man and charming he may yet seduce you to his way of thinking i assure you cousin he will not would it set your mind at rest if i were to promise you that i will not learn a word of greek it would be an easy promise as i seem incapable of doing so anyway quintus begrudged him a faint smile kaeso kaeso very well since youve convinced your father to acquiesce to this arrangement then i shall not object at least not publicly ill keep my mouth shut and hope that you know what youre doing he glanced at the rows of wax effigies in their niches always remember your ancestry kaeso and preserve the dignity of your name did he once again hesitate and blink as he looked from the faces of the deceased fabii to the face of kaeso which bore no family resemblance but i asked you here for another reason said quintus i have something for youthat is if youre still interested come with me kaeso followed him to a room where the walls were lined with pigeonhole bookcases stuffed with scrolls on tables here and there unfurled documents were laid flat for perusal with paperweights to hold down the corners the library of quintus fabius was smaller than that of appius claudius and its contents were quite different here there was not a greek text to be found or any volumes pertaining to the history of foreign peoples all the documents in the library of quintus fabius had to do with legal matters property claims monetary transactions family history or genealogy you expressed an interest in seeing the various documents regarding the investigation i conducted many years ago as curule aedile into the mass poisonings in the city they were a bit scattered but i believe ive managed to gather them in one place quintus indicated a tube made of leather into which a great many scrolls rolled together had been inserted this is the dossier pertaining to the case of course i realize that your studies under appius claudius may be claiming all of your time and attention not at all cousin quintus im very grateful that you remembered my interest in the matter and that you went to so much trouble to make these available to me in fact in the excitement of his work for claudius kaeso had completely forgotten the discussion about the poisonings but it would hardly do for him to say so did his cousin intend for him to sit here in the library examining the documents kaeso did not have time he was eager to get home so that he could perform a task which claudius had assigned to him recalculating the measurements for a section of the aqueduct would it be possible for me to take this with me so that i can peruse the contents at my leisure quintus frowned usually i would never allow any of these documents to leave my possession some contain sensitive information many are irreplaceable butwhy not i ask only that you be very careful with them and return them in due course hopefully theyll give you some insight into the challenges and responsibilities of holding a magistracy a life of public service can be very demanding but also very rewarding you must think of your future kaeso beyond this work youre doing for the censor this is very kind of you cousin i shall look at them tonight as it turned out laboring under the flickering light of a hydraheaded lamp that hung from the ceiling of his room kaeso worked much too late that night to bother looking at the documents from quintus he finally fell into bed exhausted but he did not sleep well perhaps his head was too full of numbers perhaps the disapproval of his cousin weighed on him more heavily than he realized in his dream kaeso was back in the vestibule of his cousins house alone except for the wax busts of the ancestors in the niches suddenly each of the effigies blinked at once the disembodied heads turned to stare a him scowling then began to speak their voices were sarcastic and hateful hes not one of us who is he where did he come from who knows what sort of blood flows in his veins he might be the offspring of a gaul the foul product of a rape pollution corruption filth the blood of the noble fabii can be traced back for centuries but this creature comes from nothing hes like a fly that rises from a dung heap in his dream kaeso ran from the room he found himself in the forum his father was leading him onto the rostra a great multitude had gathered before the platform to hear him speak but when he opened his mouth only nonsense came out the crowd began to laugh and jeer at him their heads were made of wax like the effigies of the fabii he ran from the rostra to the house of appius claudius the censor greeted him warmly oblivious to kaesos distress he unrolled a map which showed the course of the aqueduct the line to gabii ran off the map into a gray nothingness but where are the springs said kaeso oh dont worry about that said claudius i know where the water will come from what i dont know young man is where you come from suddenly the censor was glowering at kaeso looking as stern and disapproving as the effigies in quintuss vestibule kaeso woke his body was covered with cold sweat his reading lamp was still lit in his exhaustion he had forgotten to extinguish the tiny flames that danced upon the projecting tongues of each of the hydras heads desperate for any distraction he reached for the dossier his cousin quintus had given him he pulled out the documents rubbed his eyes and began to read the tale of the poisonings and the ensuing investigation was told in bits and pieces the fragmentary nature of the material only made it more fascinating like a puzzle with many pieces grateful for anything to make him forget his nightmare kaeso perused the documents far into the night in the months that followed kaesos life settled into a comfortable pattern he worked very hard under the tutelage of appius claudius learning everything he could about every aspect of the great road which men were calling the appian way and about the water channel which men had dubbed the appian aqueduct there was no task high or low in which he did not take part from digging trenches to calculating the volume of water that could pass through a given section of the aqueduct in a given amount of time he even managed to learn the greek alphabet and a few rudiments of the language but whenever claudius set him the task of translating a passage in greek about hydraulics or engineering the complexity of the language continued to stymie him one thing is clear said claudius in exasperation one day there cannot be a drop of greek blood in you the comment was entirely innocent but set off a fresh cycle of nightmares that haunted kaesos sleep at night after a long day of working hard with his body and his mind kaeso looked forward to eating a hearty dinner with his parents relaxing for a while in the garden and then spending an hour or so reading the documents that quintus had loaned to him he found it strangely relaxing to sift through the confessions of the poisoners the lists and memoranda scribbled in quintuss hand the official decrees of the senate and the consuls and the various other pieces of evidence an obscure reference in one document would lead him to search out another and then another which he might already have read but had not fully understood without the later knowledge that came from further research the puzzlelike nature of the material amused and engaged him from seemingly unrelated bits and pieces an increasingly coherent picture of events began to emerge like the creation of a mosaic from odd bits of stone over and over and utterly fascinated he read the statements given by the women i did it because my husband slept with another woman said one i did it because the shopkeeper looked at me the wrong way said another my brother and i had always quarreled said one i was tired of quarreling and another i did it because my two sisters had done it to their husbands and i did not want to feel left out the notorious sergia had performed a great deal of experimentation with various plants and other substances making notes on how the poisons could be extracted which of them were more or less reliable the symptoms they caused the time they required to take effect and how they worked in combination sergia had also made detailed sketches of numerous plants to serve as guides for her servants when she dispatched them to find specimens growing in the wild typical of sergias notes was her entry about aconitum illustrated by a drawing of the flowering plant aconitum a white powder derived from the plant called plutos helmet because the purple flower which grows in upright clusters is shaped like a warriors helmet with a high crest and cheek plates the plant is kneehigh to hiphigh and grows in the shade of trees in moist soil a greek merchant tells me that his people call it the queen of poisons legend says the plant first sprang from the saliva of the threeheaded dog cerberus guardian of the underworld all parts of the plant appear to be toxic but most especially the roots from which the white powder is derived ingestion causes death the powder may also kill a woman if it comes into contact with her genitals very quick to actdeath may occur within ten minutes and almost certainly within four hours the victim quickly experiences numbness and tingling in the mouth and throat both of which feel parched also there is a severe burning sensation from throat to abdomen tingling spreads to the hands and feet and then the whole body the skin and extremities feel cold and clammy to the touch yet at the same time the victim may feel as though his limbs are being flayed legs become weak sight and hearing grow dull but the victim will be clearheaded until the moment of death muscles twitch and convulse pulse weakens pupils dilate the slightest exertion results in a fatal swoon and so it went with kaeso falling asleep with details of longago murders in his head such reading matter provided an escape from the pressing problems of the day his last conscious thought was less likely to be about some vexing technical puzzle posed by the aqueduct than about the patrician matron cornelia who killed her husband while they were copulating by inserting her middle finger covered with the white powder aconitum into his fundamenta method of stimulation he demanded of her and which she found distasteful the poison killed the victim within minutes but not according to cornelia before he had attained a peculiarly violent orgasm the dossier was full of such extraordinary details no amount of reading would banish the dreams that arose from kaesos anxieties regarding his origins these nightmares recurred from time to time usually set off by some chance remark made to him during the day that had nothing to do with his ancestry but that nonetheless made him feel exposed and vulnerablean outsider an interloper an imposter within one of romas most ancient and distinguished families thus for a while kaesos life settled into a comfortable pattern then there came a day that he knew was to change his life forever but not for the reason he thought the obvious event of the day was his betrothal to a girl named galeria the betrothal was the culmination of intense negotiations between the two patrician families involved on the fabius side it was quintus who pushed for kaeso to marry the young man had shown himself to be bright and ambitious but also stubborn and contrary the responsibilities of marriage might be just the thing to tame his reckless energy kaeso had mixed feelings about the prospect of marriage but galeria was a pretty girl with the figure of a venus and in his chaperoned conversations with her she was charmingly shy and sweet the betrothal was finalized one afternoon at the house of quintus fabius kaeso his father and galerias father drank several toasts with quintuss best wine as soon as he could kaeso feeling a bit tipsy stole away and headed for the house of appius claudius eager to share the news with his mentor the door slave explaining that the censor was meeting with a visitor on official state business asked him to wait in the antechamber next to claudiuss library it was a warm day and the doors were open kaeso could hear quite clearly the conversation that was taking place in the adjoining room admittedly claudius was saying there is some precedent for what youre asking to do the state religion has grown so large and complex with so many rituals that must be performed every day all over the city that in recent years more and more duties have been delegated to temple slaves who are owned by the state and receive special training from the priesthoods nonetheless titus potitius what you propose is a bit different and sure to be controversial the name potitius meant little to kaeso he knew the potitii to be a patrician familyone of the oldestbut they figured little in the politics of the day and were seldom seen in the exalted social circles of the fabii if pressed he might have recalled that they had something to do with the ara maxima and in fact it was that ancient hereditary duty that titus potitius had come to discuss with claudius please understand censor the man sounded old and his voice was weary and downtrodden if i saw any other solution to the familys ills i would never have come to you with this request the sad fact is the potitii can no longer afford to maintain the altar or to put on the annual feast in herculess honor the altar itself is woefully in need of restoration have you looked at the site lately its an embarrassment to us all the feast has become a paupers banquet it causes me great embarrassment to admit this but its the simple truth our inability to properly fulfill these duties does not reflect in an honorable way upon roma or upon the god or upon the potitii our continuing attempts to do so are only driving the family into greater poverty alas in the days of our ancestors an altar could be nothing more than a flat stone and a feast could be a handful of beans but roma is no longer like that as the citys power and wealth have grown so have the standards of religious observance the state can afford to restore and maintain the ara maxima and to honor hercules with a feast that will make all roma proud the potitii cannot your point is well taken titus potitius in return for ceding this privilege to the state i presume you will expect a substantial payment it would be proper a payment large enough to get you and your kin out of the financial hole you find yourselves in the states generous recompense will be put to good use censor so an exclusive hereditary religious duty jealously guarded for centuries is merely a commodity to be bought and sold you realize that this is what some people will say as censor i believe you have the authority to approve this transaction and if i do what will people say of me there goes appius claudius abusing his office again its not enough that he packs the senate with his lowborn friends and fixes the elections now hes tinkering with the most ancient religious rites in the city potitius sighed i realize that the decision would be a difficult one for you on the contrary i wholeheartedly approve of your idea you do absolutely the oldfashioned notion that certain priesthoods and religious rites should remain under the exclusive control of a particular family is obnoxious to me any religious function that affects the entire state should be in the hands of the state the peoples religion should be controlled by the people for that reason which has nothing to do with your familys financial woes i entirely approve of your offer to cede authority over the ara maxima and the feast of hercules to the state toward that end im sure i can arrange for just compensation to be paid to your family censor i can hardly express my gratitude then dont at least not yet as i warned you there will be some who rabidly oppose this change theyll accuse me of impiety and abuse of my authority theyll defame you and your kin you must be prepared for their aspersions i understand censor very well before we can proceed i must ask if you truly represent the will of the entire family from the census rolls kaeso heard a rustling of scrolls claudius grunted i see that your numbers are smaller than i supposed can this be right there are only twelve separate households of potitii remaining in roma comprising some thirty males who carry the name that is correct our numbers have dwindled along with our fortunes and you have authority to speak for them all i am the paterfamilias senior to all others the matter has been thoroughly discussed within the family and decided very well claudius called for a secretary to whom he issued some instructions he exchanged some parting pleasantries with titus potitius and escorted him from the room as the two of them stepped into the antechamber claudius saw kaeso and smiled broadly kaeso saw that potitius had gray hair and a gray beard to match his elderly voice and was wearing a toga that had seen better days the old man gave kaeso a passing glance then stopped short and stared at him do i know you young man he said i dont think weve met said kaeso allow me to introduce kaeso fabius dorso said claudius a young fellow with a wonderful head on his shoulders hes helping me build the new road and the aqueduct and this kaeso is the venerable titus potitius paterfamilias of the potitii one of our most ancient families said kaeso simply to be polite we made our mark on the city in its early days said potitius now its the turn of families like the fabii to make their mark as im sure you will young man but i must say he peered at kaeso squinted and shook his head you do remind me of someonemy cousin marcus who died some years ago yes you are the very image of marcus when he was a young man the resemblance is uncanny you even sound like him i wonder is it possible that the two of you are somehow related i recall no marriages between the potitii and the fabii in recent years but perhaps i think not said kaeso brusquely im quite sure theres no family connection between us kaeso your face is as red as a roofing tile said claudius i feel warm muttered kaeso it must be the wine i drank at cousin quintuss house ah well the resemblance is merely a coincidence then said potitius but he continued to stare at kaeso at last he lowered his eyes only to stare at the fascinum that hung on a chain around kaesos neck kaeso had decided to wear it that morning to mark the occasion of his betrothal whats that said potitius kaeso stepped back irritated by the mans scrutiny its a family keepsake the famous vestal pinaria gave it to my grandfather on his toga day surely youre seen a fascinum before such trinkets are usually made of cheap metal not gold and this one appears to have sprouted wingsmost unusual yet it seems oddly familiar yes im sure it stirs some memory but of what potitius scratched his head kaeso was beginning to seriously dislike the old man claudius deftly took potitiuss arm and steered him toward the vestibule im sure you must be eager to get back to your family and tell them of the success of your proposal he said farewell titus potitius the door slave will see you out farewell censor and thank you the old man took claudiuss hands and squeezed them before he turned away he shot a last curious gaze at kaeso and the amulet he wore an unpleasant fellow said kaeso after potitius was gone a bit scatterbrained but harmless said claudius kaeso winkled his nose he imagines were related claudius shrugged im related to him myself if rather distantly the connection goes back to the early days of the republic a daughter of the very first appius claudius married a potitius but the fellow turned traitor and fought against roma with coriolanus for a long time there was bad blood between our two families but all that is ancient history now and the potitii have fallen on such hard times that one can only pity them but come kaeso lets speak of happier things unless im mistaken youve come to share some good news kaeso told him of his betrothal as the two of them celebrated with a cup of wine kaeso pushed the unpleasant encounter with titus potitius from his mind what a large vestibule declared kaesos mother stepping inside the front door of the little house on the aventine mother this isnt the vestibule there is no vestibule this is the house itself what only this one room of course not theres a garden in the center of the house that little plot of dirt under that hole in the roof and theres another room at the back which serves as a kitchen and pantry behind that is a cubby for the slaves to sleep in though i dont suppose well keep more than one apiece theyll have to sleep on top of each other as it is well i suppose it wont take much to furnish the place at forty herminia was still a pretty woman but she had a tendency to make unpleasant faces that spoiled her looks really its hardly worth it for you to move out of the family house into such cramped quarters nonsense said kaesos father cousin quintuss wedding gift is very generous its not every pair of newlyweds who can celebrate the ceremony at their own house it needs a bit of fixing up to be sure i hope galeria likes a challenge said herminia its the location i like best of all said kaeso the aventine herminia made a particularly unpleasant face well at least youre on the north slope come see the view from this window be careful of those loose floor tiles kaeso flung open the shutters spectacular isnt it i see a great clutter of rooftops said herminia dubiously no mother look therebetween those two houses kaeso pointed ah yesyou can just catch a glimpse of the elevated portion of the aqueduct that eyesore your friend claudius has inflicted on the city kaesos father cleared his throat we have much to do today wife indeed we do i need to draw up the list of guests then perhaps we should run along ill stay here for a while if you dont mind said kaeso very well herminia kissed her sons forehead and swept from the room kaesos father hung back for a moment he tapped his foot against the loose floor tiles dont worry son well find the money to fix the place up you forget that i have my own income father claudius pays me quite generously i believe its the state that pays you the censor merely fixes your salary of course father hadnt you better join mother before she grows impatient kaeso was left alone his mothers caustic remarks did nothing to deflate his buoyant mood the gods were smiling on him his work for appius claudius was more fascinating than ever his wedding day was fast approaching and the gift of a house from his cousin quintus had not only surprised him but had deeply moved him he recalled one of claudiuss favorite aphorisms and said it aloud each man is the architect of his own fortune kaeso gazed out the window at the distant aqueduct if thats true then i must be a very fine architect indeed im sure you are said a voice behind him kaeso spun about his father must have left the door ajar an old man in a shabby tunic stood in the middle of the room kaeso stared at him for a moment then furrowed his brow titus potitius so you remember me im afraid i do what are you doing here your tone is very harsh young man thats no way to address an elderespecially an elder kinsman what are you talking about old man kaeso drew back his shoulders but in his chest he felt a sinking sensation you and i have much to talk about kaeso we have nothing to talk about potitius cocked his head and peered at him youre not wearing the fascinum today kaeso touched the empty spot at his breast i wear it only on special occasions do you know where it comes from the vestal pinaria gave it but before that do you know from whom she obtained it no but i know its very ancient it is indeedas ancient as the potitii themselves what are you saying old man im the paterfamilias of all the potitii im also the family chronicler and historian i understand your cousin quintus serves much the same function for the fabiikeeping scraps of parchment and scribbled notes about who was married to whom and the names of their offspring and who did what and when and how our families are so very old and our ancestors accomplished so many thingsgreat and small wonderful and terribleits hard to keep track sometimes i think it would be a relief if we all turned to dust so the rest of the world could simply forget us and go on about its business as if we never existed i dont think quintus fabius feels that way potitius made a croaking sound which kaeso took for a laugh i daresay youre right but imagine the things he must know a family chronicler becomes privy to all sorts of secrets he knows the things that no one must ever speak ofmysterious deaths babies born out of wedlock bastards sired on slave girls if you have something to say say it very well you and i are kinsmen kaeso you are a descendent of the potitii kaesos mouth was suddenly parched how do you know this first of all i could tell simply by looking at you you favor my cousin marcus more than anyone else but with those eyes that chin and the shape of your mouth you could pass as a son or brother to any number of my cousins at first i thought perhaps old marcus had spilled his seed outside his marriage bed but as i began to track down the truth i realized that the connection was far more complicated and went much further back in time just now as he was leaving i took a good look at your father he too has the look of a potitius but his features are less distinctive for some reason the gods decreed that the family traits should resurface fullblown in you it was your precious fascinum that provided the key somewhere in the family chronicles i knew i had seen a reference to a winged fascinum made of gold it was worn by an ancestor of mine also named titus who lived in the days of the decemvirs after that titus there is no further reference to the golden winged fascinum which disappears from the family history however according to family legend titus sired a child out of wedlock and that child became a slave as you can imagine this is seldom talked about but slaves are property and romans keep very thorough records of property as thorough as their genealogical records through diligence and a lot of pestering and a bit of guesswork i was able to trace the descent of that bastard child down to a slave called pennatus have you heard of him kaeso swallowed a hard lump in his throat it was a slave called pennatus who found my grandfather among the ruins left by the gauls so it was did you know that this same pennatus was trapped for several months atop the capitoline with the vestal pinaria who somehow came into possession of the golden fascinum and for reasons never explained felt obliged to pass it on to your grandfather when he came of age now you wear the fascinum kaesoand you are the very image of a potitius do you begin to see how all these things connect guesswork innuendo you slander the memory of a pious vestal you have no proof of anything the gods know the truth about you kaeso and now so do you kaeso felt faint the room seemed to pitch and sway around him why are you telling me this isnt it always better to know the truth no what was it i heard you say as you looked out the window something about being the architect of your own fortune how can you build a lasting monument a life of virtue and accomplishment unless you begin with a firm foundation of selfknowledge youre a stupid old man titus potitius you and your thirdrate family have squandered whatever good fortune ever accrued to you youve offended the gods by selling your birthright to the ara maxima how dare you come to me with such a lie suggesting my grandfather was the bastard of a vestal and a slave potitius sighed this has gone badly i never intended to offend you dont worry kaeso ill be discreet what ive discovered is for your ears only i havent even told any other members of the family shout your lies from the rooftops if you dare to youll only make yourself a greater laughingstock than you already are titus potitius shuffled toward the door and disappeared kaeso violently kicked at the floor and sent a loose tile flying against the wall that night sleep was slow to come when it did kaeso was haunted by nightmares more vivid and disturbing than any he had previously experienced one dream jarringly led into the next in each of them he felt heartwrenchingly alone and bereft the object of other mens ridicule and disdain at one point naked and covered with sweat he sat bolt upright in his bed and reached up to discover that he was wearing the fascinum though he had no memory of having put it on angry and distraught in tears he tore the chain from his neck and cast the amulet into the darkness only to see it come flying back at him he shrieked in terrorand only then awoke realizing that he had still been dreaming his mother and father stood at his door staring at him his screams had awakened them he felt embarrassed to be naked before his mother but there was nothing with which to cover himself he looked again and in his fathers place he saw titus potitius clucking his tongue there there my child said the old man dont be afraid of the truth kaeso was still dreaming when at last he did awake he felt utterly exhausted he squinted suspiciously at the sunlight that leaked around the shutters afraid he might yet be asleep trapped in another nightmare he rose from the bed on trembling legs he shambled across the room and opened the box where he kept the fascinum the sight of it repelled him he should throw the awful thing away but his father would expect him to wear it on his wedding day to get rid of it now would only call attention to its absence he slammed the box shut on the day before his wedding kaeso went to the house on the aventine to make sure that all was ready to receive him and his bride the next day in preparation for the ceremony an altar had been erected before the front door for the sacrifice of the sheep and the taking of the auspices inside the house were the ceremonial chairs for the bride and groom ready to be taken into the street for the openair celebration both chairs were stacked high with dried garlands that would be used to decorate the doorway between them was the sheepskin rug upon which he would set galeria after he carried her across the threshold as if she were his captive sabine kaesos heart sped up as he considered the momentousness of the looming event by this time tomorrow he would be a married man the house was sparsely furnished but the floor tiles had been fixed and the whole house had been scrubbed clean the little garden had been planted with new shrubberies and flowers and the kitchen had been stocked with pots and pans he saw the bed that had been placed against the wall near the windowa new bed larger than the one in which he was used to sleeping aloneand he felt a quiver of erotic anticipation galeria grew more beautiful every time he saw her soon he would see her naked and would be naked with her and would possess her any hesitation he felt about the ceremony faded when his thoughts turned to the carnal pleasures that awaited him he crossed the room wanting to take a closer look at the bed a voice that was almost a whisper said the house looks very nice kaeso spun around what are you doing here get out titus potitius stood in the doorway can a kinsman not visit a kinsman on the day before his wedding to wish him well youre a madman the gods have made you mad as a punishment for selling your birthright then we sold it for too little appius claudius should have thrown you out when you came begging he shouldnt have given you so much as a copper coin its curious that you should mention money along with paying my respects thats one of the reasons ive come to see you potitius stood with his hands clasped before him and his eyes downcast galerias family is wealthy i presume she comes to you with a substantial dowry as well i think the censor must have arranged a very generous salary for you you even own your own house you are a most fortunate young man to be of independent means at such an early age and you are an old fool to have squandered everything at your age the travails of the potitii began long before my time how typical of our misfortunes that one of the most gifted young men of his generation who should be the scion of the family does not even bear the name potitius still in a time of trouble i am hoping that young man will hear the call of the blood in his veins and will help his kinsmen kaeso clenched his teeth what do you want from me a loan only that a small loan from one kinsman to another why now why must you spoil a day when i should be thinking of nothing but my wedding my request has nothing to do with your marriagealthough im sure the brides father would be shocked to learn that she is about to marry the descendent of a slave and a tarnished vestal kaesos legs grew unsteady he sat on the bed potitiuss voice was gentle its a curious thing that you should be a builder your ancestor titus potitius the friend of coriolanus was a builder toodid you know that he was also the first to bring shame on the family it would be a pity if you should take after him in that regard as well how much do you want potitius named a sum kaeso drew a sharp breath appalled at the mans greed but relieved he had not asked for more it was agreed that potitius would come to him in two days time and that kaeso would pay him then amazingly despite his excitement at his impending wedding and the anxieties aroused by his unwanted visitor kaeso slept like a stone that night he experienced no nightmares he woke early before the first cockcrow feeling clearheaded and refreshed he lit a lamp some time earlier he had finished reading all the documents loaned to him by his cousin quintus he had been meaning to return them but in the rush of getting ready for the wedding had neglected to do so he reached for them now he found himself rereading certain of the documents occasionally nodding and humming after a while he set the documents aside extinguished the lamp and slept for another hour as men do when they have made an irrevocable decision and are at peace with the gods and themselves when titus potitius next came to call it was ostensibly to pay his respects to the newlyweds kaeso received the visitor in his new home without a trace of rancor he even spoke warmly to him and apologized for his earlier harsh words then introduced him to his new bride to potitius it seemed that a night of marital bliss had done wonders to correct kaesos attitude and why not as he saw it there was no need for kaeso to be unfriendly having convinced himself that selling the familys rights to the ara maxima was acceptable potitius had further convinced himself that his request for assistance from kaeso was entirely reasonable they were kinsmen after all kaeso had plenty of money and potitius was in dire straits the gods smiled on generosity there was no reason the transaction should be unpleasant indeed kaeso should be proud to help an elder kinsman in need with his head full of such rationalizations and his guard down potitius thought nothing of it when the bride offered him a portion of the traditional dish of beans left over from the wedding feast and he did not notice that it was kaeso who actually put the bowl in his hands he was hungry and the beans were delicious kaeso discreetly slipped him a small bag of coins then hurried him out the door potitius took no offense at being dismissed so quickly it was only natural that the groom was eager to be alone with his bride patting the money bag that hung from his waist humming a happy tune potitius crossed the aventine heading for his house on the less fashionable south side of the hill walking in front of the temple of juno regina he saw that one of the sacred geese had escaped its enclosure and was strutting across the porch craning its neck this way and that potitius smiled then felt a sudden tingling in his throat his mouth was very dry he should have asked for something to drink to wash down the beans abruptly a flame seemed to run down his throat all the way to his bowels the sensation was so intense and so peculiar that he knew something was seriously wrong he had reached that advanced age when a man might die at any moment suddenly and without apparent cause was that happening now had the gods at last chosen to end the story of his life without knowing how he got there he found himself lying flat on his back on the ground in front of the temple hardly able to move a crowd gathered around him people stooped over and peered down at him their expressions were not encouraging men shook their heads a woman covered her face and began to weep cold he managed to say cant seemto move as if to contradict him his arms and legs began to twitch a little at first and then so violently that people drew back in fright the alarmed goose honked and flapped its wings potitius realized what had happened he hardly thought of it as murder but rather as yet another misfortune to befall the potitii how the gods must hate his family it never occurred to him to accuse kaeso with his dying breath to admit his extortion would only blacken his own name and further humiliate the family his convulsions ceased along with his breathing titus reigning paterfamilias of the potitii died swiftly and in silence two lictors sent by the curule aedile arrived to look after the body until a family member could claim it the lictor who took an inventory of the dead mans possessions recognized potitius and expressed surprise that the old fellow should be carrying such a substantial amount of money on his person the potitii are always crying poverty but look at all these coins maybe its what left of that settlement the censor gave him for selling the rights to the ara maxima said his companion no good could come of such sacrilege no goods already come to this poor fellow to kaesos eye titus potitius the son of the deceased paterfamilias looked only slightly younger than his father so you see said potitius as far as i was able to figure out you must have been one of the last people to see him alive papa told one of the slaves he would be stopping here on his way home but he didnt say why its a bit of puzzle how he came to have so much money on him no one has a clue as to where he got that bag of coins the two of them sat in the tiny garden of kaesos new house there was no innuendo or suspicion in potitiuss voice he sounded like a bereaved son who simply wanted to learn all he could about his fathers final hours still kaeso felt a flutter of anxiety in his chest he chose his words carefully and spoke in what he hoped was a suitably commiserating tone of voice its true your father paid us a brief visit that day he and i had met briefly once before at the house of appius claudius it was very considerate of him to come by and congratulate us on our nuptials such a nice old fellow remarked galeria who sat nearby with her spindle and distaff spinning wool with the assistance of her slave girl galeria had many oldfashioned virtues but keeping silent was not one of them and the house was too small for kaeso to conduct a conversation out of her hearing he seemed very fond of you kaeso potitius smiled i can see why papa might have taken a liking to you you probably reminded him of cousin marcus oh yes the resemblance is quite striking and papa was very sentimental andhe wasnt above imposing on people he didnt potitius lowered his eyes he didnt by any chance ask you for money did he im afraid papa had a bad habit of asking for loans even from people he barely knew of course not potitius sighed ah well i had to ask im still tracking down his unpaid debts where he acquired that bag of coins may remain a mystery kaeso nodded sympathetically clearly the younger titus potitius knew nothing of his fathers scheme to extort money from him and yet the mans fretting over the bag of coins and his remark about kaesos resemblance to a kinsman made kaeso uneasy kaeso took a deep breath the flutter in his chest subsided as had occurred in the early hours of his wedding day a resolution came to him and with it a sense of peace he looked earnestly at potitius like my dear friend appius claudius im moved by your familys plight that one of romas most ancient families should have dwindled so greatly in numbers and fallen into such poverty should be a cause for concern to all the citys patricians we of the old families squabble too much among ourselves when we should be looking out for one another im only a young man and i have very little influence you underestimate yourself kaeso you have the ear of both quintus fabius and appius claudius not many men in roma can say that i suppose thats true and i should like to do what i can to help the potitii i would be very grateful for any assistance you can give us potitius sighed the duties of paterfamilias weigh heavily upon me perhaps i can help to relieve that burden if only a little upon my recommendation my cousin quintus might be able to secure positions for some for your kinsman and so might the censor you and i should meet again titus over a bit of food and wine i would be honored said potitius my house is hardly worthy to receive you but if you and your wife would accept an invitation to dinner and so kaeso began to insinuate himself into the household and into the trust of the new paterfamilias of the potitii bc the new fountain at the terminus of the aqueduct was not merely the largest fountain in all of roma but a splendid work of art the shallow elevated pool into which the water would spill was a circle fifteen feet in diameter in the center from the mouths of three river sprites magnificently carved from stone water would continuously jet into the pool many of the citys most distinguished citizens had gathered to witness the inauguration of the fountain chief among them was appius claudius smiling broadly and looking resplendent in his purple censors toga quintus fabius was also there exhibiting his perpetual scowl he had agreed to attend only begrudgingly and kaeso felt obligated to stand next to him the auspices had been taken the augur had spotted several riverfowl wheeling over the nearby tiber a sure sign of the gods favor there was a lull in the festivities while the engineers made ready to open the valves quintus began to grumble so this is your friend claudiuss excuse for hanging on as censor well past his legal terma fountain kaeso pursed his lips claudius argued that his work on the aqueduct and the road is too important to be interrupted he asked to continue as censor the senate agreed only because claudius has packed the senate with his minions hes as devious and headstrong as his ancestors and just as dangerous for his own selfish ends hes caused a political crisis in the city quintus shook his head these socalled grand projects of his are merely a diversion while he continues to press for the implementation of his radical voting schemes he wont rest until hes made the roman republic into a greek democracy ruled by a demagogue like himselfa disaster that will never happen as long as i have a breath in my body please cousin were here to celebrate a feat of roman engineering not to argue politics surely the aqueduct is something we can all be proud of quintus grunted in reply his frown abruptly softened how is the little one kaeso smiled galeria had become pregnant very soon after their wedding and had recently given birth to a son kaeso knew that quintus would be pleased but he had been surprised at how avidly his cousin doted on the baby little kaeso is in good health he loves the gourd rattle you gave him and all the other toys quintus nodded good hes very bright and alert that one with those lungs of his hell make a powerful orator someday he can certainly make himself heard agreed kaeso claudius mounted a platform and raised his hands to quiet the crowd citizens we are almost ready to fill the fountain but first if you will indulge me i should like to say a few words about how this marvelous feat of engineering was achieved he proceeded to discourse on the importance of water to the growing city recalled the flash of insight that had inspired him to commence planning the aqueduct and recounted a few anecdotes about the construction his speech delivered from memory was full of puns and clever turns of phrase even quintus grunted an involuntary laugh at some of his witticisms there are many many men who must be thanked for their contributions to this great enterprise said claudius lest i forget a single one of them i have written them down claudius proceeded to read the names kaeso was flattered that he was mentioned early in the long list as claudius continued to read quintus whispered to kaeso why is he squinting so kaeso frowned quintus had touched upon a matter of growing concern to him the censors eyesight quite abruptly claudiuss vision had begun to deteriorate to such a degree that he practically had to press his nose against his beloved greek scrolls to read them the list he was now reading had been written in large letters yet still he had to narrow his eyes to make out the names quintus saw the worry on kaesos face the rumor is true then appius claudius is going blind of course not said kaeso hes merely strained his eyes from working so hard quintus raised an eyebrow you know what people are saying dont you people are fools whispered kaeso he had indeed heard the vicious rumor being put about by claudiuss enemies they said the censor who so loved the pleasures of reading and writing was being punished with blindness by the gods for having allowed the transfer of religious duties at the ara maxima from the potitius family to temple slaves whatever you may think of his politics cousin appius claudius is a pious man who honors the gods if his eyesight is failing its not because the gods are punishing him and yet the gods punished those other unlikely friends of yours the potitii did they not and most severely kaeso drew a sharp breath but did not answer in his dealings with the potitii over the last year kaeso had been acting in his own selfinterest to obliterate the secret of his origins and to safeguard the future of his offspring but might the gods have taken a part making him the instrument of their wrath against an impious family ripe for destruction do you doubt that the terrible end of the potitii was the result of divine judgment said quintus pressing him what other explanation could there be for such an extraordinary sequence of deaths in a matter of months every male in the family grew sick and died not a single potitius is left to pass on the name one of romas oldest families has become extinct some said they died of plague said kaeso a plague attacking only one family and only the males that was what the potitii themselves believed yes and in their desperation they convinced the senate to appoint a special dictator to drive a nail into the wooden tablet outside minervas sanctuary to ward off pestilence it did no good at least they had the comfort of a steadfast friendyou kaeso others turned their backs on the potitii fearful of being contaminated by their bad fortune but you having just befriended them remained loyal to the very end you never stopped visiting the sick and comforting the survivors quintus nodded sagely once long ago we fabii were almost extinguished as you well know but that was honorably in battle and the gods saw fit to spare one of our number to carry on the line history shall reflect very differently upon the fate of the wretched potitii be proud of the name you have passed on to your son kaeso the name means more to me than life itself cousin appius claudius finished reading the list amid applause he raised his hand to order the opening of the valves let flow the aqueduct from the mouths of the three river sprites issued a great rush of air as if they groaned the gurgling sound reminded kaeso of the death rattles of his victims what a great deal of ingenuity and cleverness and sheer hard work had been demanded of him to win the trust of the potitii and make sure they never suspected him from appius claudius he had learned the arts of charm from his cousin quintus he had learned everything there was to know about poisons once it began his quest to eradicate the potitii had become allconsuming each new success was more exhilarating than the one before kaeso had almost regretted killing the last of his victims but when it was done he felt an indescribable sense of relief his secret was safe no man would ever tell kaesos son the shameful truth of their origins the groaning of the river sprites grew louder the noise was so uncanny that the crowd drew back and gasped then water began to jet from all three mouths at once it was a spectacular sight foaming and splashing the torrents began to fill the pool claudius shouted above the roar citizens i give you water fresh pure water all the way from the springs of gabii the crowd broke into rapturous applause hail appius claudius men cried hail the maker of the aqueduct bc before the senate the aged appius claudius now called appius claudius caecusthe blindwas delivering the greatest speech of his life more than two hundred years later the orator cicero would declare this speech to be one of most sublime exercises in the latin language and appius claudius caecus would be revered as the father of latin prose the occasion was a debate on romas resistance to the greek adventurer king pyrrhus the greatest menace to confront the romans since the gauls just as his kinsman alexander the great fifty years before had conquered the east with lightning speed so pyrrhus thought he could invade italy and make quick work of subjugating its barbariansthe term being a greek epithet for any race that did not speak greek thus far the romans had confounded pyrrhuss plans the invader continued to win battles but these costly triumphs stretched his supply lines weakened the morale of his overburdened officers and wore away the numbers of his fighting men if there are many more such pyrrhic victories declared appius claudius caecus king pyrrhus may soon discover to his dismay that he has won one battle too many the chamber resounded with laughter the unflagging wit and relentless optimism of the blind senator were much appreciated amid the gloomy debates of recent years some of you are calling for peace with pyrrhus said claudius you want an end to the spilling of roman blood and the blood of our allies and subjects you are ready to offer concessions you will allow pyrrhus to gain the permanent foothold he seeks on italian soil hoping he will be content with a little kingdom here and put aside his dream of a western empire to rival alexanders empire in the east i tell you pyrrhus will never settle for that he will never stop scheming to rob us of everything he will not be satisfied until he has made us his slaves you all know that i am a man who treasures greek learning and the beauties of greek literature and art but i will never have a greek rule over me and i will never obey any law that is not chiseled in latin the future of italy belongs to usto the people and senate of roma it does not belong to any greek and not to any king we must continue the struggle against pyrrhus no matter the cost until we drive him out of italy entirely when the last greek ship bears away the last remnants of his exhausted army italy shall be ours and roma shall be free to fulfill the destiny the gods have decreed for us a majority of the senators sprang to their feet applauding and shouting accolades seeing that claudius had decisively carried the day those who had argued for appeasing pyrrhus begrudgingly joined the ovation the war against pyrrhus would continue even as he was leaving the senate house assisted by a slave to guide him on the steps claudius was thinking ahead to his next oration unable any longer to read or write he had become adept at composing and memorizing long passages in his head the topic would be romas relationship with carthage the great seaport on the coast of africa founded by phoenicians at about the same time romulus founded his city whose rise to prominence in many ways mirrored that of roma the senate had just signed a treaty of friendship with carthage and the incursion of pyrrhus into their mutual sphere of interest had made roma and carthage alliesbut for how long once pyrrhus was expelled claudius believed that a natural rivalry between roma and carthage for domination of sicily southern italy and the sea lanes of the western mediterranean was certain to come to the fore of course once again those fools the fabii cant see the obvious he muttered to himself they still think roma should expand her reach northward to the alps and beyond and pursue a policy of moderation toward carthage but southward and seaward lies our destiny a clash with carthage is inevitable the slave remained silent he was used to hearing his master talk to himself sometimes claudius carried on elaborate arguments with himself that lasted for hours changing voices as he shifted points of view now in the twilight of his life frail and nearly blind a lesser man than claudius might have succumbed to bitterness his radical attempts at reform had failed a few years after his censorship quintus fabius had seized control of the office and had ruthlessly undone almost all of claudiuss populist enactments quintus fabius was repeatedly elected consul and his supporters dubbed him maximus appius claudius became the blind while quintus fabius became the greatest claudius had been forced to realize that true popular government would never take root in roma but his physical monuments would endure the appian aqueduct remained a marvel of engineering and each year another stretch of the appian way was paved with stone that would last for the ages after a lifetime of victories and defeats appius claudius caecus was more passionate than ever about the destiny of roma crossing the forum clinging to the arm of his guide claudius heard a voice call out senator may i have a word with you claudius stopped abruptly almost certain that he recognized the voiceand yet it was impossible that voice beloved to his memory belonged to his onetime protégé kaeso fabius dorso but kaeso was no longer among mortals he had died many months ago in a battle against pyrrhus although they had drifted apart over the years claudius had followed kaesos career at a distance his youthful interest in building had eventually been eclipsed by his excellence at soldiering like a typical fabius kaeso was born to become a warrior claudius grieved when he learned of his death hearing his voice now brought back a flood of memories claudius gripped the arm of his guide who speaks to me what do you see slave is it a man or only the shade of a man i assure you senator i am not a shade said the voice that sounded so familiar my name is kaeso fabius dorso ah you must be the son of my old friend you remember my father then i certainly do my condolences to you on his death he died honorably fighting for roma i also fought in that battle under his command i saw him fall afterward i tended to his body you can be very proud of him i am he was a fearsome warrior men say he killed more of the enemy in that campaign than any other soldier in the legion my father took a fierce delight in bringing death to the invaders bloodlust has its place on the field of battle declared claudius your fathers joy in killing redounded to the glory of roma and the honor of our gods kaeso reached up to touch the talisman at his neckthe golden fascinum he had retrieved it from his fathers corpse on the battlefield the amulet had failed to protect its wearer against the spear that killed him but it was a cherished heirloom nonetheless kaeso wore it in memory of his father tell me kaeso how old are you thirtytwo and your father when he died he was fifty can so many years have passed so swiftly claudius shook his head but whats that young man do i hear you weep only a little im very honored sir to hear my father praised by a man so renowned for noble speech indeed claudius beamed his slave eyed kaeso suspiciously and spoke into claudiuss ear master the fellow is a fabius so he is but his father was different from the rest of them perhaps the son takes after the father he seems respectful enough i assure you senator i hold your achievements in the highest regard thats why i approached you today i was hoping you might honor a request perhaps young man though im very busy speak my father was always quoting your aphorisms sometimes it seemed that half his sentences began as appius claudius so wisely put it i was hoping in honor of my father that you might assist me to make a collection of those sayings i know many of them by heart of course but i should hate to get a single word wrong and there must be some ive forgotten and some ive never heard i was thinking that you could dictate them to me and i could write them down and we could group them according to subject we might even attempt a translation of the latin into greek you know greek well enough to have served as my fathers translator for the messages we intercepted from pyrrhuss couriers the son of kaeso not only has a literary bent but has mastered greek truly each generation improves upon the last i can never hope to be the mankiller my father was said kaeso humbly come walk with me the day is mild and i need the exercise we shall walk up to the capitoline and you shall describe to me the recent adornments which alas i am unable to see with my failing eyes they ambled up the winding path to the summit where in recent years the city had indulged its fervor for grand public works the barren hilltop where once romulus had set up his asylum for outcasts had become a place of lavish temples and magnificent bronze statues this new statue of hercules said claudius is it as impressive as men say ive touched the thing but its so big i can do no more than grasp its ankles to kaeso the statue hardly seemed newit had been there since he was a boybut perhaps time was measured differently by the much older claudius well of course my family is descended from hercules ah you fabii never miss a chance to remind us of that claim so i have a tendency to favor any image of the god and the bigger the better actually the bronze workmanship is quite good hercules wears the cowl of the nemean lion and carries a club his expression is quite fierce should the gauls ever dare to come back i think his image alone might scare them away from the capitoline how does it compare to the colossal statue of jupiter over by the temple oh the jupiter is much taller than the hercules as i suppose the father should be people can see it all the way from mount alba ten miles down the appian way you know the story of the statues creation yes after spurius carvilius crushed the samnites he melted their breastplates greaves and helmets to make the statue the gods enormous size represents literally the magnitude of our victory over our old enemy out of the bronze filings left over the consul made the lifesized statue of himself that stands at the feet of the jupiter you need not describe that to me i remember quite clearly how ugly carvilius is and atop the temple of jupiteris the quadriga as magnificent as they say it used to be made of terra cotta you know an expressive but rather delicate material it was repaired from time to time but some parts were as old as the temple and probably made by the hand of the artist vulca himself but now the terra cotta has been taken down and replaced with an exact duplicate done entirely in bronze i remember the original terra cotta said kaeso believe me the bronze is much more impressive the details of jupiters face the flaring nostrils of the steeds the decoration of the chariot are all remarkable alas if only i still had eyes to see the bronze replacement for the quadriga was done by my dear colleagues gnaeus and quintus ogulnius you know it heartens me to see men of a younger generation take up the populist banner in the year both ogulnius brothers served as curule aediles they put the worst of the rich moneylenders on trial and convicted them out of the confiscated property the ogulnii paid for that new bronze quadriga they also paid for that new statue of romulus and remus over on the palatine which has become such a shrine for the common people of the city do you know ive never seen it really neither have i but blindness is my excuse how your cousin quintus must detest the ogulnii and their politics we call my venerable cousin maximus nowadays said kaeso i suppose hes deliberately kept all the fabii from paying homage to the ogulniis great monument we must go at once so that you can finally see it they descended the capitoline crossed the forum and ascended the stairs of cacus the slave barely needed to assist claudius who knew the way by heart at the foot of the fig tree not far from the hut of romulus the statue of the twins had been erected upon a pedestal it was not colossal in size but the image was striking beneath a standing shewolf two naked babies squatted and turned up their faces to suckle the animals teats well what do you think young man its remarkable very powerful very beautiful do you suppose the founder of the city and his unfortunate brother were literally raised by a wolf so legends tell us and do you never question legends some believe the she wolf to be a metaphor or perhaps a tooliteral interpretation of a tale passed down by word of mouth the same word after all can refer to a woman of the shewolf varietya prostitute is it not more likely that the twins were raised by such a woman rather than by a wild animal claudius was unable see the younger mans expression but from the silence that ensued he could tell that kaeso was taken aback claudius laughed goodnaturedly forgive my outspokenness obviously such ideas are not spoken in the staid households of the fabii some of your ideasare novel to me admitted kaeso my father said you often challenged his ways of thinking but that you also inspired him thank you for showing me the statue of the twins and the she wolf claudius smiled were not far from my house would you like to see my library its grown considerably since the days when i tried to teach your father greek new scrolls arrive every month i cant read them myself of course someone must read them aloud to me you have a very pleasant voice kaeso senator i would be honored to read aloud to you the slave led them homeward well take some refreshment said claudius walking through the vestibule then perhaps we can get to work on that collection of aphorisms you propose kaeso nodded happily then frowned there was one of your sayings that my father found particularly inspiring something to do with architecture and fortune each man is the architect of his own fortune exactly my father lived by those words im sure that no man ever put those words into practice more faithfully than did kaeso fabius dorso scipios shadow bc we brought these accursed carthaginians to their knees once we shall do it again so declared quintus fabius maximus wearing an expression stern enough to have pleased his greatgrandfather who had been the first to take the name maximus almost ninety years earlier with one hand he held a cup of wine with the other he tapped his upper lip a nervous habit that called attention to a very prominent wart for this distinguishing feature on an otherwise homely face his friends had playfully given him an additional name verrucosus from across the dining room young kaeso stole glances at his hosta man he found quite intimidatingand wished that his own physical imperfections were limited to an ugly wart or two one of kaesos legs was shorter than the other one of his forearms had a strange bend in it and its muscles were not always entirely under his control he walked with a slight limp and had never been able to ride a horse he was also subject to the falling disease the fluttering in his head occurred at the most inopportune times at its worst it caused him to lose consciousness completely despite these imperfections kaesos mother had always assured him that he was nonetheless beautiful at twenty kaeso was old enough to look at himself critically in a mirror and see that this was not a mothers flattery or wishful thinking but the truth his eyes were a rare shade of blue his lustrous hair was the color of sunlight in honey his face might serve as a model for a greek sculptor but what use was a handsome face if a mans body was unsuited to riding or marching or fighting as the times demanded far better to have a strong body and a wart on his lip the size of a chickpea like his great and powerful cousin maximuswho had just caught kaeso staring and stared back at him scowling kaeso lowered his eyes and nervously tapped at the gold fascinum at this neck a precious heirloom that he had put on especially for this very important occasion the other two guests at the dinner were the same age as kaeso his cousin quintus was the son of maximus publius cornelius scipio was their mutual friend the occasion was a somber one come morning quintus and scipio would be going off to war how kaeso wished he was going with them seventy years had passed since appius claudius the blind had delivered his stirring speech in the senate against the greek invader pyrrhus the final retreat of pyrrhus from italy was now a distant memory but there were still old fighters alive who could remember the even greater war that followed with carthage as appius claudius had predicted after their mutual enemy pyrrhus was defeated romas maritime rival had become her military foe for over twenty years in sicily and africa on land and sea the romans and carthaginians waged a bloody war the peace that followed on terms to romas advantage had lasted for a generation but now the two cities were at war again and carthage led by a general named hannibal had brought the war to italy as you ride off into battle said maximus addressing his son and scipio but pointedly ignoring kaeso never forget it wasnt roma that broke the peace it was that mad schemer hannibal when he dared to attack our allies in spain the man has no shame no scruples and no honor a curse on his mongrel army of libyans numidians spaniards and gauls may their elephants go mad and stamp them into the dirt here here said quintus raising his cup like his father he was homely and he displayed the same earnest scowl which looked more like a pout on his youthful face scipio raised his cup and joined the toast like kaeso scipio had been blessed by the gods with striking looks though his hair was darker and his features of a more rugged cast he wore his hair long and swept back from his facelike alexander people saidand he was powerfully built as a student he had quickly matched and then exceeded the erudition of his tutors as an athlete he had excelled above all others as a soldier he had already made a name for himself he was known for his sure quick stride and his strong grip scipio made a powerful impression on everyone he met kaeso belatedly raised his cup as well only scipio seemed to take notice of him tipping his cup in kaesos direction and shooting him a quick smile as you say maximus the carthaginians are most certainly in the wrong said scipio his deep voice was strong but mellow people often remarked that he would make a fine orator when he was old enough to run for office but surely you misspeak when you say that hannibal is mad obsessed perhaps we all know the tale of how his father bitter at his own humiliation and the concessions made by carthage after the last war made the boy hannibal swear undying hatred of roma and all things roman clearly hannibal took the oath to heart no one can accuse him of shirking his filial duty he deliberately broke the truce when he attacked our allies in spain then they say he had a dream of the future a god placed him on the back of a gigantic snake and he rode the snake across the earth uprooting trees and boulders and causing utter destruction hannibal took this dream to mean that he was destined to lay waste to all of italy so he told his soldiers quintus smirked he probably made up that dream to spur them on true or not he set out from spain and crossed the southern coast of gaul everyone said the alps would keep him out of italy no one thought he could cross the mountains with his army and his elephants intact but he found a pass and swept down upon us like a firestorm one drubbing after another hes given us i was there with my father at the river ticinus in the first engagement of the war when the day went so badly for us dont be modest scipio said quintus you saved your fathers life when he was wounded on the battlefield and everyone knows it i did what any son would do if scipio downplayed his own bravery he also glossed over the magnitude of the repeated defeats the romans had received at hannibals hand in his devastating forays across the italian peninsula hannibal had acquired a reputation for almost superhuman ingenuity and resilience he had shown himself to be a master of disguise escaping plots to assassinate him by donning wigs and costumes he had recovered from terrible wounds including the loss of an eye he had conceived and executed outrageous stratagems one dark night he threw a roman army into utter confusion by tying flaming torches to the horns of a herd of cattle which in their panic created the illusion of a vast army rushing in all directions across an otherwise deserted mountainside even as his implacable hatred and seeming invincibility inspired their fear and loathing hannibal had won the grudging admiration of many romans and scipio spoke of him with a certain respect now the oneeyed cacus and his mongrel mercenaries have penetrated to the very heart of italy said quintus they roam and ravage at will and pick off our allies one by one but not for much longer eh scipio right you are quintus tomorrow we set out to hunt down hannibal and put an end to him once and for all maximus grunted you know my opinion on this matter he said grimly the previous year maximus had been appointed dictator with emergency powers while his colleagues in the senate clamored for yet another confrontation with the invaders fabius had practiced a shadow war hounding and harrying hannibals army but avoiding a direct engagement his advice had been and was still for caution and patience while the romans continued to fight the carthaginians in other arenason the sea in spain and in sicilyin italy he believed they should avoid any more pitched battles with hannibal whose rampaging elephants and numidian cavalry had so far proven invincible instead the romans should sit back and let the logistical problems of feeding and finding winter shelter for fifty thousand mercenaries and ten thousand horses take their toll but maximuss tactics had been ridiculed and scorned his enemies named him cunctatorthe delayerand he had become the most unpopular man in roma now the moment belonged to the newly elected consul gaius terentius varro a populist firebrand determined to take the battle to hannibal he and his fellow consul lucius aemilius paullus would be setting out the next morning at the head of the largest roman army ever assembled more than eighty thousand men the plan was to overwhelm hannibal with sheer numbers in spite of his fathers objections to the campaign quintus would be serving in the post of military tribune as would scipio kaeso looked at the two other young men and felt acutely aware of his physical limitations luckily for him his imperfections had not been immediately apparent at birth or otherwise he might have been exposed to the elements shortly after emerging from the womb his mother had borne two previous sons with such gross physical defects that they had been carried off to die at the behest of kaesos father after kaeso his dispirited mother had given birth to no more children when his father died at the battle of the ticinus kaeso became paterfamilias of his small branch of the fabii but his freedom and status would do him little good unable to complete the prerequisite ten years of military service kaeso would never be eligible to run for public office and thus could never compete in the course of honor the sequence of posts that led to the senate and the higher magistracies kaeso gazed across the room at his friend scipio and was torn by mixed emotions how he admired scipio how he envied him scipios steadfast friendship made him feel quite special and yet whenever he compared himself to scipio he felt only disdain for himself scipio was everything kaeso was not must we add deafness to the list of your defects young man snapped maximus kaeso rudely jolted from his reverie stared blankly at his older cousin its a tedious guest who makes a host repeat himself i asked you to make a toast they say youre good with words kaeso if with nothing else surely these two young warriors deserve some words of encouragement from those of us who will be sitting out this battle kaeso has been quiet all night long said scipio his warm smile and gentle tone were in marked contrast to maximuss brusqueness thats not like our kaeso hes usually so funny i suspect my dear friend must be thinking some very deep thoughts tonight i was thinking kaeso cleared his throat i was thinking that my wise cousin maximus is most certainly right no matter what others say the proper strategy to deal with the devious carthaginian is to play a game of evasion and wait him out let him spend himself against our allies the more territory he takes the more he must defend let him tie himself down with commitments all over italy and spread himself thin let the harvests fail then watch his troops go hungry let the winter storms come and spread illness among his men as ive heard you declare on more than one occasion cousin maximus our new consul varro is a hotheaded fool you never mince words do you cousin not even with a poor cripple like me but kaeso drew a deep breath but if there must be a battle and if it must be sooner rather than later roma could not ask for better men to fight for her than these two he raised his cup if every man in the army of varro and paullus was the match of you scipioand of you cousin quintusthen hannibals elephants would do well to pack their trunks and leave italy tomorrow the two warriors laughed and raised their cup thats my kaeso said scipio the one who makes me laugh kaeso basked in his friends affectionate gaze and forgot his feelings of envy and unworthiness the final course of stewed onions in a beef broth was served quintus suggested a final toast but maximus instead called for a slave to collect their cups youll thank me in the morning when you ride out of roma with a clear head on your shoulders the dinner guests made their way to the vestibule to take their leave kaeso trailed behind maximus who put his arm around quintuss shoulder and spoke into his ear kaeso could not help overhearing im glad we had this time together sonthough if you ask me this should have been a party for fighting men only id never have invited cousin kaeso except that your friend scipio insisted what he sees in that boy i dont understand quintus shrugged scipio says theres more to life than war and politics he and kaeso have interests in common they both love books and poetry even so kaesos attention was suddenly claimed by a hand on his shoulder i think you must have drunk too much wine tonight said scipio you look flushed kaeso abruptly reached into his tunic and produced a tightly rolled scrap of parchment he pressed it into scipios hand whats this a parting gift said kaeso no dont unroll it now read it later what is it i commissioned a poem from ennius i know hes your favorite specially written for the occasion but why didnt you read it aloud at dinner you could have added some polish to the evening kaeso turned even redder the poem had not been something he was willing to share with maximus glowering at him ennius is a fighting man like you the poem is a call to arms quite stirring i assure you no one does that sort of thing better than ennius hell be as famous as homer one of these day mark my words said scipio kaeso shrugged a bit grandiose for my taste but i know how much you like his poetry read it before the battle to screw up your courage or after the battle to celebrate presuming i survive the battle said scipio kaeso felt a chill dont say such a thing scipio in the days to come however the fighting turns out a great many men will die one of them might be me no the gods will protect you scipio smiled thank you for the blessing kaeso and thank you for the poem after leaving the house of maximus scipio and quintus went in one direction while kaeso headed off in another the summer night was warm the moon was full kaeso glumly watched his shadowa limping figure traversing the dark quiet streets of the palatine maximuss animosity and scipios talk of death had left him feeling moody and anxious but he knew a place where he could breathe freely and relax even at this late hour kaeso reached the foot of the palatine and headed across the forum passing beyond the district of temples and public spaces he entered a much humbler part of town the narrow winding streets of the subura offered distractions of every sort especially after dark on this final night before their departure for war soldiers crowded the taverns gambling dens and brothels the sounds of a scuffle echoed from nearby from elsewhere came drunken voices singing an old marching song the whole area stank of spilled wine urine and vomit the shutters of an upperstory window flew open bright moonlight revealed a grinning prostitute wearing a scanty tunica she stared down at kaeso and brazenly beckoned to him kaeso stared straight ahead and hurried on he found the alley he was looking for the dank passage was so narrow he could touch both walls at once no torches were set in the walls and no moonlight penetrated the gloom the way was very dark kaeso arrived at his destination he knocked on the crudely made door a peephole opened an eye peered at him kaeso spoke his name the slave opened the door at once kaeso stepped into a crowded room where the atmosphere was very different from the staid patrician decorum that reigned at the house of maximus in one corner a musician was playing a lively tune on a flute but he could barely be heard over the din of conversation a mixed assortment of guests of all agessome richly attired some in shabby tunicssat close together on couches or on rugs on the floor there were even a few women present every hand held a cup the hosta portly bearded man in his thirtieswas going about pouring wine from a clay pitcher with a cracked handle titus maccius plautus looked up from his duties saw kaeso smiled broadly and stepped toward him sloshing wine onto one of his guests a fraillooking youth who shrieked with laughter plautus found an abandoned cup pressed it into kaesos hand and poured him some wine there you go boss medicine for your melancholy what makes you think im melancholy that frown on your face but we shall get rid of that soon enough boss plautus patted kaeso on the back with avuncular familiarity dont call me that you silly sybarite but you are my boss i am a playwright and you own a substantial share of the theatrical troupe that makes you my boss does it not and the boss of every fellow here well the actors anyway not their admirers kaeso looked around the room although the presentation of plays was sponsored by the state as part of various religious festivals acting was not a profession for reputable citizens most of plautuss performers were slaves or exslaves of various national origins the ones who played heroic roles or girls tended to be quite young and some were very handsome all were extroverts there was little evidence of shyness in the room one of the actors a swarthy spaniard abruptly jumped up from the floor and began to juggle a cup a copper brooch and a small clay lamp the spectators put down their cups and began to clap in time with the flute music the juggler was barely sober enough to keep the objects in the air he made a great show of staggering about and putting those nearby in peril his companions roared with laughter every time he came near to missing one of the flying objects watching this raucous buffoonery kaeso heaved a deep sigh and felt himself slowly relax how much more at home he felt here than in the house of maximus kaesos eye fell on one of the younger actors a newcomer with chiseled features and long blond hair the youth reminded him a little of scipio i cant blame you for staring at the greek boy said plautus in his ear but the fellow we need to impress this evening is the one sitting over there wearing the very expensivelooking toga who is he none other than tiberius gracchus scion of a very wealthy plebeian family hes been elected curule aedile so hell been putting on the annual roman games coming up in september along with the religious procession and the feast of jupiter and the chariot races and boxing matches there will of course be a day of comedies to entertain the masses as gracchus is footing the bill and because hes an aficionado of the theater hes taken a personal interest in picking the program i presume youve submitted a script for his approval yes indeeda thighslapper i call the swaggering soldier adapted from a greek original as is the fashion but i think ive managed to give the material a decidedly roman twist gracchus came here tonight to return the script and give me his comments and he loves it said he fell off his couch laughing he sees the buffoonish womanchaser of the title as a lampoon on our bellicose consul varro says the play is both timely and hilarious a good thing since im asking a bigger fee for this production than ive ever dared ask before your work is worth it plautus you have the best actors of any troupe in the city and you write the wittiest dialogue of any playwright alive what ennius is to poetry you are to comedy plautus rolled his eyes heavenward and to think i was raised a poor country boy in umbria had to make my living as a baker when i first came to roma thought id never get the flour out of my hair for years i was just another starryeyed wouldbe actor with a funny stage nameyes they called me plautus on account of my flat feet but i figured it was a name no one would forget but fortunas wheel turns round and round and plautus the clown is the best playwright in town boss you make me blush dont call me that they were both distracted by a sudden crash the juggler had dropped everything at once the lamp shattered against a wall the cup skittered across the floor the copper brooch struck one of the actors in the forehead the fellow jumped to his feet and lunged at the juggler fists flailing the flute player trilled a shrill discordant tune as if to encourage them plautus hurried to break up the fight kaeso heard a chuckle behind him i saw that coming got out of the way just in time youre kaeso fabius dorso i believe kaeso turned yes and youre tiberius gracchus i am it was hard to judge the mans age his hair was turning silver at the temples but his sunburned skin had few wrinkles he had a powerful jaw and strong cheekbones but the ruggedness of his features was softened by a mischievous glint of amusement in his gray eyes if he was drunk he didnt show it he carried himself with a graceful dignity that seemed entirely natural kaeso and gracchus conversed gracchus did much of the talking mostly about the challenges of mounting the roman games and the fine work plautus had done on the swaggering soldier gracchus had a remarkable memory he recounted long stretches of dialogue verbatim and his deadpan delivery make kaeso laugh out loud there was no talk of hannibal or duty or death such weighty topics would have seemed out of place in the house of plautus after a while kaesos eyes fell upon the young newcomer he had noticed before the greek youth smiled back at him i believe his name is hilarion said gracchus following kaesos gaze is it yes hilarion means cheerful in greek the name fits him why dont you try your chances with the boy tonight before everyone else has him im not sure what you mean said kaeso gracchus smiled knowingly sporting with catamites was not the sort of thing our staid ancestors approved of although i suspect they did their share of such things whether it was spoken of or not nor i daresay would your staid cousin maximus approve even nowadays but we live in a new age kaeso we inhabit a much bigger world than did our ancestorsa bigger world than men like maximus have eyes to see the spartans who are renowned as great warriors consider nothing more manly than the love of two soldiers on her wedding night a spartan woman must cut her hair and put on a boys tunic to coax the groom into desiring her the athenians put the love of an older man and a younger man at the very center of their philosophy carthaginian generals make love to their young officers before allowing them to marry their daughters jupiter had his ganymede hercules his hylas achilles his patroclus alexander his hephaestionor perhaps it was the other way around as alexander was the younger partner nature gives us appetites appetites must be fed if your eye should fall on a handsome and available greek slave why not do something about it so long as you maintain the dominant role of course the roman male must always dominate kaeso nodded the wine was hot in his veins he gazed at the longhaired greek youth and allowed himself to feel desire but in his heart he longed for scipio the midsummer month of sextilis brought sweltering weather to roma everyone complained of the heat people grew listless and shorttempered a stifling haze settled over the city and with it an atmosphere of tension and foreboding each day the forum was filled with people seeking news of the war and the news was always the same the roman consuls and hannibal were shadowing one another across italy as each side maneuvered to engage in battle at the most opportune place it was only a matter of time the longedfor confrontation would take place any day now kaeso was limping across the forum happily whistling a tune after an evening of pleasure at plautuss house on the day the terrible news arrived near the temple of vesta a weeping woman ran across his path then he came upon two elderly senators in togas at first he thought they were arguing for one of them was shouting at the other all of them the man said how is that possible i dont believe you then dont said the other the news is not official there is no official news since no officers survived to send word back to roma it cant be true it simply cant kaeso felt a prickling across the back of his neck what news the senators looked at him with ashen faces utter disaster said the quieter one varro and paullus met hannibal at a place called cannae near the adriatic coast somehow the romans became encircled the entire army was annihilated varros fate is unknown but paullus is dead along with most of the senate how do you know this a few survivors came straggling into the forum this morning each tells the same story a complete massacre the largest army ever assembledobliterated the worst day in the history of romaeven the capture of the city by the gauls was not as bad as this and theres nothing to stop hannibal from doing just as the gauls did marching on the city and burning it to the ground theres no one to stand in his way theres no roman army left it cant be as bad as that said kaeso shaking his head but it was hannibals victory at cannae was overwhelming on the second day of the month of sextilis more than seventy thousand romans perished and ten thousand were taken prisoner a mere thirtyfive hundred escaped and many of those were wounded the magnitude of the loss was far beyond anything the romans had ever experienced amid the panic that threatened to overwhelm the city it was maximus who took charge the wisdom of his scorned policy was now clear to all and the steady hand with which he took control of the city impressed everyone the remaining members of the senate a gray and toothless assembly granted him emergency powers no one opposed the appointment if only because there was no one left to do so virtually every ablebodied member of the senate had either died at cannae or was fighting the carthaginians abroad no man of maximuss experience and stature was left in the city for much the same reasonbecause he was one of the few remaining magistratesthe curule aedile tiberius gracchus was appointed to serve as master of the horse who was the righthand man to the dictator first maximus dispatched riders to seek out the scattered survivors hoping that more might have escaped than was previously thought when the riders returned bringing home a handful of men they only confirmed the grim truth to raise a fresh army maximus decreed that underage boys would be recruited when their numbers proved insufficient he declared that slaves would be eligible for military service eight thousand were enlisted and armed such a thing had never been done before but no one could suggest a better solution kaeso eagerly responded to the call to arms but in front of the recruiting officer in public view on the field of mars he suffered a bout of the falling sickness he was carried home unconscious and was forbidden to report again by maximus himself who wished to suffer no further embarrassment from a member of his family amid the general hysteria two vestals opimia and floronia were accused of breaking their vows the news caused riots a mob outside the house of the vestals accused the transgressors of bringing ruin on the city both vestals were quickly tried and found guilty opimia committed suicide floronia was entombed alive near the colline gate while the clamorous mob looked on the men found guilty of defiling them were publicly bludgeoned to death by the pontifex maximus each day by the thousands more men were confirmed dead great crowds of women gathered in the forum to receive the news reacted with uncontrollable grief they ripped their garments tore out their hair and fell to the ground wailing their frenzy spread across the city in every street the sound of sobbing was heard all night long roma was a city on the verge of madness maximus finally declared that such extreme displays of emotion offended religious decency the cacophony of so much weeping would drive the gods out of the city he ordered all women to be shut indoors and imposed a rule of silence it was decreed that the period of mourning for the dead of cannae would be limited to thirty days after that the city would resume business as usual the show must go on declared plautus amid the din of hammering so you say muttered kaeso so says your cousin the dictator maximus so says our friend tiberius gracchus who assures me that the roman games will proceed exactly as planned like everyone else in light of the crisis i had assumed that the plays would be cancelled is anyone really in the mood for a day of comedy but the dictator believes that sticking to the regular calendar will reassure the public heres hoping that hannibal doesnt show up just as we begin the opening scene of the swaggering soldier from above a carpenter dropped a hammer it whistled past plautuss head barely missing him idiot shouted plautus thats what i get for hiring free labor instead of renting slaves ah well perhaps standing under this scaffolding is not a good idea they were in the circus maximus where in the great curve at one end of the long racetrack a temporary stage was being constructed for the roman games the curved bleachers would serve as seats for the audience with the humblest among them crowding into the semicircle of open ground before the stage the stage itselfan elevated wooden platform with a decorated wall to serve as a backdropwould be thrown up quickly and even more quickly pulled down after a single day of performances it would be dismantled overnight to clear the racetrack for the next days athletic competitions accordingly the standards of craftsmanship were no higher than they needed to be the ornate columns and relief sculptures of the backdrop were illusions made of wood plaster cloth and paint tawdry when seen close up but convincing enough at a distance dont the greeks have permanent theaters built of stone asked kaeso yes sometimes built into the sides of hills with such remarkable acoustics that the actors hardly need to raise their voices to be heard in the back row but the greeks are a decadent pleasureloving people sensual to a fault romans are not so while we love a good comedy a play may be enjoyed only in the context of a religious festival and the stage and all its trappings must vanish before the festival is over its a stupid policy but it keeps these mediocre carpenters employed you seem preoccupied boss im worried about my friends theres no word yet about cousin quintusor about scipio kaeso wrinkled his brow no news is good news i suppose and the best news is that theres no news of hannibal marching on roma whats keeping him i wonder maximus made a speech the other day he said the hand of jupiter himself has stayed the carthaginian monster plautus wrinkled his nose is ennius writing his speeches these day the masses love that sort of religious hokum it reassures them like putting on a festival when the end of the world may be near he shook his head i have to wonder whether hannibal isnt a bit like one of his elephantshuge and destructive but ultimately rather stupid tiberius gracchus speculates that hannibal instead of heading straight to roma may want to win over our enemies and lay siege to our allies so as to secure the whole of italy while were helpless to stop him but why should he bother to conquer the limbs one by one when he could cut off the head yet the days pass and hannibal does not arrive nor does news of scipio whispered kaeso look here comes tiberius gracchusand he does not look happy in fact gracchus looked very grim without the mischievous glint in his eyes his face assumed a severe aspect suitable to the master of the horse at romas darkest hour bad news said plautus bad news and worse news said gracchus plautus sighed ill have the bad news first then after a very long very unpleasant discussion the dictator and i have decided that the swaggering soldier is not suitable to be presented at the roman games what no plautus was outraged the comedies are cancelled then no the plays will go on but the swaggering soldier will not be among them youre throwing it out we have a contract gracchus you signed it as curule aedile think plautus the comedy pokes fun at a pompous philandering military man whos going to laugh at that after what happened at cannae you thought it was funny you thought it was about varro who barely escaped with his life people are stunned by varros defeat theyre appalled by his miscalculations theyre numb with furybut no wants to see him made fun of not after seventy thousand men have died plautus pinched the bridge of his nose all this incessant hammering is giving me a headache yes i see your point what shall we do then youll substitute another play at the last moment impossible you must have something think wellthere is a script ive been working on its not nearly as funny as the swaggering soldier its called the casketa sweet little farce about a girl exposed at birth whos eventually reunited with her parents under the circumstances i suppose it would at least have the virtue of being inoffensive but it needs work several scenes need to be completely rewritten youll simply have to pull it together said gracchus you can do it plautus youre funny when you write under pressure no i get indigestion when i write under pressure but if i mustyes i suppose it could be doneif hilarion can play the girl gracchuss expression became even grimmer plautus stiffened bad news you saidand worse news what is it gracchus gracchus lowered his eyes what sort of news could cause the master of the horse to avert his gaze kaeso held his breath do you remember when the vestals were accused of breaking their vows how could i forget said plautus for a few days the whole city was obsessed with the scandal it took peoples minds off hannibal even while it gave them someone to blame for what happened at cannae as if a couple of vestals by losing their virginity were responsible for so many deaths if indeed the vestals were guilty if people wanted vengeance its varro they should have buried alive instead of that poor girl gracchus drew a sharp breath you forget my position plautus as master of the horse i represent the state religion no less than does the pontifex maximus to question the verdict or punishment of the vestals is tantamount to blasphemy if you say so being a country boy from umbria i still find roman religion a bit puzzling im serious plautus people are in no mood for unpatriotic or irreligious talk you must watch what you say the playwright clucked his tongue duly noted but you were saying the vestal floronia was properly punished but opimia escaped her punishment by committing suicide auguries were taken an unfavorable sighting of birds confirmed that the gods had not been fully propitiated something must be done to make up for the failure to bury one of the vestals alive the sibylline books were consulted a verse was found gracchus quoted the chosen passage a lamb fated for sacrifice dies too soon kill two pair of beasts before the next moon from fields to the north and east of noon plautus wrinkled his nose if only my sponsors were as indulgent of my cracked phrasing as was tarquinius of the sybils and what was the interpretation of these lovely lines the priests conferred among themselves it was decided that to cleanse the city of the vestals sins a pair of gauls and a pair of greeks must be buried alive plautus shook his head human sacrifice is a carthaginian vice its one of the reasons we look down on them as savages its neither your place nor mine to question the dictates of the sibylline books gracchus sighed the priests came to me for a list of names to you a registry is kept by the curule aediles of all foreigners residing in roma so is a registry of all slaves listing their nationality the priests asked for the lists i supplied them how the priests determined which two gauls and which two greeks i dont know but they informed me of their decision this morning plautus snorted i own a gaul or two myself and more than a couple of greeks his face fell by hercules thats why youre here isnt it the cancellation of the swaggering soldier was only the bad news worse news you said one of the greeks they chose was hilarion kaeso who had listened in silence let out a gasp youll be properly compensated of course said gracchus hastily averting his eyes compensated for the sacrifice of your property butwhy hilarion i dont know the priests chose the names the pontifex maximus confirmed their decision i suppose i have no choice in this matter none whatsoever lictors were dispatched to your house before i came here i imagine theyve already taken hilarion into custody workmen began digging the pit in the forum boarium last night the entombment will take place this afternoon whats the old etruscan adage quickly done is best done said plautus bitterly he gripped his head oh that infernal hammering tiberius gracchus took his leave and strode away kaeso felt unsteady on his feet there was a fluttering in his head such as sometimes preceded his seizures his vision became blurry tears welled in his eyes he shuddered but he did not weep madness whispered plautus when a horror like cannae occurs do men react with compassion reason kindness no they blame the outsider they punish the guiltless and if you point out their madness they call you a traitor and a blasphemer thank the gods i have a vessel into which i can pour my darkest feelingsmy comedies otherwise i should go as mad as the rest your plays arent dark said kaeso dully they make people laugh comedy is darker than tragedy said plautus no laugh was ever born except out of someones suffering usually mine and nowpoor hilarion the two of them stood motionless for a long time enduring the din of the hammers suddenly kaeso blinked and furrowed is brow is thatmy cousin quintus a young officer wearing the insignia of a military tribune was striding purposely across the open expanse of the circus kaeso ran toward him quintus looked pale and haggard there was a fresh scar across his forehead but otherwise he appeared to be intact youre alive said kaeso by the will of the gods weve had no word your father has been ill with worry even so it looks like hes managed to keep the city running i understand hes been appointed dictator have you not seen him i only just arrived what news news kaeso dreaded to ask what of scipio quintus smiled wouldnt you know he proved his bravery once again just as he did at the ticinus if there was one roman hero to emerge from the catastrophe at cannae it was scipio tell me the mongrels encircled us the slaughter was terrible only a handful of us managed to fight our way through it and escape with our lives we became separated we were wounded dazed fearful of capture at any moment it took days for us to find one another one by one all the time hiding from hannibals mercenaries when we finally regrouped and put enough distance between ourselves and the enemy to catch our breaths a debate broke out where should we go and who should lead us there i confess i was among those who gave in to despair and argued that we should leave italy altogether we assumed that hannibal would march on roma at once burn the city and enslave the citizens theres a roman army in spain and a roman navy fighting the war on the sea join them i argued and see where the future leads us because roma is finished forever and theres no going home but scipio wouldnt hear of it even though his father and uncle are off fighting in spain he said he had no intention of joining them not as long as roma needed us to defend her he mocked our despair he shamed us he made us take an oath to jupiter never to abandon the city to die fighting for her rather than to surrender to hannibal once we took that oath it was as if a great weight was lifted from us we knew we could endure anything because scipio had given us back our honor then we watched and waited days passed but hannibal made no move to march toward the city we were puzzled then elated we began the journey back to roma taking back roads so that no carthaginian outriders would find us the way was slow some of the men were badly wounded and scipio refused to leave them behind finally we reached the appian way and i rode ahead im the first to arrive and scipio he should be here tomorrow or the day after hes alive then yes youre certain of course kaeso began to cry weeping unabashedly with joy as he had been unable to weep with sorrow for hilarion indeed in his relief for scipio he all but forgot his grief over hilarion quintus who had seen terrible things at cannae and had despaired of ever returning to roma had tears streaming down his cheeks as well together they went to find maximus on the eve of the roman games the city was gripped by yet another crisis an emissary from hannibal a carthaginian noble named carthalo arrived at the city gates in exchange for a steep ransom he offered to return a large number of roman prisoners a few representatives of the prisoners came with him to plead their cause for the romans had a long history of turning their backs on men who had surrendered to the enemy in spite of the ban a vast crowd of women gathered in the forum to plead for the ransom of their husbands fathers and sons behind closed doors the senate debated the matter the representatives of the prisoners defended their actions they had remained on the battlefield at cannae until the bodies lay thick around them then had managed to break through the enemy circle and flee to the roman camp in the morning rather than die on the ramparts they had given themselves up it was true that they had neither died bravely nor been clever enough to escape yet they argued was it not better to pay for the return of genuine roman soldiers than to enlist yet more slaves to defend the city those who opposed the ransom argued that the captives had surrendered rather than die fighting and had therefore proven themselves cowards who deserved to be sold into slavery by their captors besides any ransom paid from the public treasury would enrich hannibal and enable him to hire more mercenaries in the end it was decided that the ransom would not be paid the prisoners were abandoned to their fate most would be sent back to carthage as slaves their relatives would never see them again there was bitter lamentation throughout the city maximus dispatched his lictors to maintain order in such an atmosphere the date arrived for the roman games the invocation to jupiter on the capitoline had an edge of desperation the procession from the temple of jupiter to the circus maximus was a sad affair many of the senators and magistrates who normally would have strutted before the people were conspicuously missing the feast of jupiter consisted of little more than the scant daily rations allowed by the dictator for the duration of the crisis the company of plautus performed the casket their rehearsal for the new play had been rushed and chaotic and the terrible fate of hilarion had shattered their morale the production was a disaster plautuss only consolation was that the comedys spectators were even more depressed than its performers the audience scarcely noticed the tardy entrances missed cues and flubbed lines no one hissed or booed nor did anyone laugh the athletic competitions were equally lackluster many of romas best young runners and boxers had died at cannae and the highly trained slaves who ranked fastest among the chariot racers had been called away to military service the citizens who took part in the roman games merely went through the motions performing their patriotic duty to attend an annual celebration that dated back to the days of the kings they had been rendered insensible by the massacre at cannae the scandal of the vestal virgins and the wrenching rejection of the captives plea for ransom roma was numb with grief and worry the future of the city was very much in doubt bc four years later the war with carthage continued to rage with no end in sight hannibal never marched on roma this curious fact was to become part of the citys legend another element of her mystique at the citys most vulnerable moment she was spared an assault that would surely have ended in her destruction how and why had roma survived fabius maximus was given credit for seizing the reins when chaos threatened and scipio was widely praised for his inspiring example to the younger generation but most romans agreeing with their priests believed that jupiter himself had deflected the wrath of hannibal allowing the romans a chance to rally hannibal and his marauding army remained in italy his apparent strategyto isolate roma and to undermine her dominance of the peninsula by winning over her allies either by force or by persuasionmet with only limited success the romans steadfastly avoided another direct confrontation with hannibal but ruthlessly struck back at the allies who betrayed them in regrouping their forces marshaling their resources and regaining their morale the romans proved to be remarkably resilient meanwhile the theater of war already waged in spain and sicily and on the sea expanded to the east philip of macedonia the heir to alexanders homeland allied himself with carthage to counter the threat from philip roma dispatched ambassadors to seek new alliances in greece and asia as the struggle between the two cities spread across the whole of the mediterranean world from the pillars of hercules to the straits of the hellespont the romans adopted an increasingly outwardlooking foreign policy the more visionary men of the senate dared to indulge in heady dreams of empire far beyond the confines of italy roma was like the legendary phoenix consumed by fire only to rise from its own ashes the turn of events also brought unexpected good fortune to kaeso because of his lameness and his nonexistent political prospects his parents had despaired of finding him a suitable wife after the massacre at cannae and the resulting shortage of young bachelors kaesos mother was able to find a perfectly acceptable patrician girl for him to marry sestia was not beautiful people said she had a mannish face but kaeso found her pleasant enough to look at like kaeso she had not expected to marry and was pleased that fortuna had allowed her to achieve the status of matron she seemed content to confine her interests to running the household and demanded no more of kaesos attention than he demanded of hers she never questioned him about his expenses or business affairs his abrupt comings and goings the odd hours he kept or the exotic perfumes that frequently scented his clothes her simple needs and incurious nature suited kaeso both accepted from the outset that the principal purpose of their marriage was to create a child they made love on a regular basis though without much enthusiasm on eithers part their workmanlike efforts were rewarded within a year after they were married sestia gave birth to a daughter when he saw that little fabia had been born without physical defects kaeso was enormously relieved he had feared that the baby might be a monster like the children who had preceded him from his own mothers womb or at best flawed and ungainly like himself but fabia was perfect in every regard there and then after giving thanks to the gods kaeso swore never to have another child to settle for a daughter was not the roman way kaesos relatives and inlaws suggested that he and sestia should try again to see if she could give him a son but kaeso fearing to tempt the fates and little drawn to having sex with his wife remained adamant that he would produce no more children after fabia she was now almost three years old sestia had brought with her a small but useful dowry with it kaeso had been able to buy out the other investors in the theater company of plautus being the sole owner of a comedy troupe would never make him wealthy and certainly would never earn him the respect of his patrician relatives but kaeso delighted in the role of impresario and took an active part in running the company he consulted with plautus about the greek source material for his plays he haggled with magistrates about budgets and allowances for festivals and he particularly enjoyed auditioning the young slaves whom plautus put forth as possible additions to the company the fourth anniversary of cannae came and went stirring bitter memories of the massacre and its terrible aftermath but also a sense of rejuvenation and hope the unspeakable despair of those days now seemed distant and unreal like a bad dream as sextilis gave way to september kaeso looked forward to the annual roman games with special anticipation for his dear friend scipio had been elected curule aedile and was in charge of putting on the festivities by law scipio had been too young to stand for the magistracy but on voting day an adoring crowd raised scipio on their shoulders and carried him through the city demanding his election with chants songs and deafening cheers the throng grew so large and unruly that the polling officials were completely overwhelmed after a hasty conference they allowed the unprecedented election of a twentyfouryearold to the office of curule aedile afterward with a wink and a laugh scipio denied any responsibility for engineering the spontaneous nearriot that resulted in his election if all roma wants to make me aedile he said well theni must be old enough surprised or not by his election he seemed quite ready to take office on the very day he assumed the aedileship he announced a detailed plan for putting on the most lavish roman games ever produced the city needs a celebration he declared an escape from months and years of constant worry this year let the games be not a patriotic duty but a pure delight a few grumblers complained that election laws that had served roma for centuries had been broken to reward an upstart youth and that scipios bland disavowals of selfpromotion proved him to be devious and disingenuous well thought kaeso what politician was not and if anyone deserved to have the rules bent on his behalf was it not the young hero of the ticinus and cannae kaeso was in awe of his friends relentless drive and ambition and hardly surprised by his extraordinary popularity it seemed to kaeso that no man was more deserving of every mans love for the theatrical program naturally enough scipio solicited a comedy from kaesos company after consulting with plautus kaeso suggested the swaggering soldier it was a daring gamble in the aftermath of cannae gracchus had canceled the play fearing that its portrayal of a vain lecherous military man would be taken as a distasteful lampoon of romas defeated generals but now with the insertion of a few new puns and some hints from the costumingwould a patch over one eye be too obviousthe character of the swaggering soldier might be seen as a parody of the most arrogant military man of allhannibal until now the romans dread of the carthaginian had been too great to indulge in satire but in the years since cannae he had shown himself to be indecisive and increasingly fallible the romans still loathed and despised hannibal were they ready to laugh at him when scipio came to kaesos house for a copy of the play kaeso expected him to take it and read it at his leisure instead scipio began to read it at once kaeso left him alone in his study and for a while paced nervously in his garden then he heard scipio laugh for the next hour the laughter continued with hardly a break finally scipio stepped into the garden clutching the scroll in one hand and wiping away a tear of laughter with the other he flashed a mischievous grin looking as carefree as a boy who had yet to don his first toga hilarious charming an utter delight the lovers get each other and the swaggering soldier gets his comeuppancea sound flogging right there on the stage serve all lechers so and lechery would cease to growindeed its the ideal play for the occasion by hercules i needed to laugh like thatand so do the people of roma theyre going to love it and theyre going to love me for treating them to it he tapped kaesos chest with the scroll youre a clever fellow kaeso fabius dorso kaeso lowered his eyes plautus is the clever one of course he is but without you to finance the company the playwright would have no stage and without a stage all his clever lines would be no more than whispers in the wind dont sell yourself short kaeso you have an eye for talent just as a good general has an eye for bravery youre a valuable fellow to know the play had put scipio in such a facetious mood that he tousled kaesos hair then gave his backside a playful swat with the scroll kaeso blushed so furiously that scipio drew back and blinked at him in wonder then swatted his backside again and laughed uproariously kaeso drew a sharp breath then he began to laugh too he laughed at himself at the absurdity of the world at the ridiculous vanity of the swaggering soldier he laughed until his sides ached and tears flowed from his eyes he had not laughed like that in a very long time the splendor of the roman games that year was on a scale such as roma had never witnessed before the sacred rites atop the capitoline exuded an air of buoyancy and optimism men smiled as they intoned the ancient formulas to dedicate the festivities of the coming days to jupiter greatest of gods the procession to the circus maximus became a joyous celebration led by brightly clad charioteers on horseback strutting boxers in scanty loincloths and dancers twirling javelins to the music of flutes lyres and tambourines mimes in the guise of satyrs scurried in and out of the crowd pinching bottoms and eliciting screams of laughter from the women and girls griffinheaded censers hung from poles were swung about scenting the air with clouds of incense in the vicinity of the circus maximus the perfume of the censers gave way to the aroma of meat roasting in the open air the scent of freshly baked bread the tangy smell of pickled fish and the delicate odor of salted olives served in oil no curule aedile had ever fed the citizens of roma so well or so copiously there was so much food on offer in so many places that hardly anyone had to stand in line and everyone could go back as many times as he wished the feast of jupiter would last all day and continue the next day as well it was as if every man for a couple of days was a rich man with a belly as full as he could want and his hours filled with leisure secure in the blessings of jupiter in the midst of the feasting a freshfaced youth with a powerful voiceone of plautuss actorsintrainingstood on a box and addressed the crowd citizens stop stuffing your faces for an hour and come see the swaggering soldier its a new comedy by plautusthats right the flatfooted playwright from umbria the one who makes you laugh until you piss come see the swaggering soldier himself pyrgopolynices as he puts the make on his concubine the ravishing philocomasium people in the crowd began to laugh if only at hearing the boy wrap his tongue around the absurdly convoluted greek names come citizens and behold the heartsick pleusicles a young man desperately in love as he does his best to rescue the soldiers concubine come see the angry old man periplectomenus the boy raised his eyebrows and pressed a forefinger to lips and whatever you do dont tell periplectomenus about the secret passageway between his house and the soldiers or youll spoil the plot come see the wily slaves palaestrio sceledrus and lurciothey always know more than they let on the boy jumped from the box produced a pipe and played a merry tune to lead the spectators into the circus maximus underneath the stage kaeso stood not far from the trapdoorplautus had thought of a number of ingenious ways to use it during the playand peered through a peephole to watch the bleachers fill up scipio he noticed was among the first to arrive taking his place in the dignitarys section along with a retinue of friends and colleagues the day was mild and the sky was clear with no sign of rain the feast had put the audience in a happy mood ready to be entertained with full bellies and a warm sun the danger was that they might fall asleep as it turned out there was no chance of that any spectator who nodded off for even an instant would have been awakened by the roars of laughter around him the players did an outstanding job during rehearsals kaeso had never seen them attack plautuss lines with such vigor the laughter of the audience inspired them to outdo themselves on that day as never before kaeso saw the living proof of a belief that plautus after several cups of wine had once confided to him when does comedy become sublime when there is a collaboration in equal measures between playwright players and spectators all working together in harmony to delight the gods with the music of human laughter when men laugh the gods laugh and for a brief time this miserable world becomes not merely bearable but beautiful the applause at the end of the play was thunderous the audience hailed the players especially the actor who portrayed the blustering pyrgopolynices plautus ran onto the stage to take several bows then scipio laughing and genuinely taken by surprise was swept off his feet and lifted onto the shoulders of his companions to receive the gratitude of the adoring crowd kaeso remained under the stage observing the audience through his peephole at that moment he wanted very much to be close to scipio but in such a throng even approaching him would be impossible as he watched scipio dispatched a young slave who dexterously threaded a path through the crush and made his way under the stage the slave found kaeso and drew a quick breath my master publius cornelius scipio says to tell you that he wishes he could congratulate you in person but with all the days events he must hurry off however in three days time when the games are over and well behind him he says he would be honored if you would join him for dinner of course said kaeso of course well come plautus will be delighted the slave smiled and shook his head my master asks that you come alone he says hell feast the playwright on another night but once the games are done he looks forward to a quiet repast in the company of an old friend no power on earth could have kept kaeso from joining scipio on the appointed night what a whirlwind i only wish my father could have been here to see it scipio gazed into his cup and swirled the wine it seemed to kaeso that his friend had drunk very little that night perhaps scipio found the success of the games intoxicating enough your father is where roma most needs him to be with your uncle commanding the legions in spain said kaeso have you heard from them lately scipio frowned i received my fathers last letter almost two months ago a letter from uncle gnaeus arrived a few days after that not a word since then no news from spain at all just a long silence kaeso shrugged messages go astray your father and uncle are such busy men im surprised they have time to write at all they call spain the vipers nest dont they because it was hannibals original base of operations everyone agrees theres no battleground in the war thats more important or more fiercely fought theyve been at it for years now trying to drive out the carthaginians according to my father if any man hates us more than hannibal its his brother hasdrubal who commands the carthaginians in spain kaeso nodded not sure what else to say he would have liked more wine but it was uncouth to drink more than ones host scipios full cup seemed merely a dark mirror upon which to focus his gaze in my fathers last letter said scipio he complained of the cowardice of the locals his celtiberian allies deserted the roman camp overnight they claimed there was a tribal conclave that required their attendance at the far side of the peninsula but it was obvious they were fleeing because word had arrived that an army of suessitani was coming down from gaul to reinforce the enemy scipio sighed father was already feeling outnumbered by the carthaginians and the numidians what a cavalry those african bastards can mountas we learned to our regret at cannae numidians are born on horseback father says they have a very strong leader in spain an audacious young prince named masinissa hardly more than a boy but utterly sure of himself its masinissa who worries him now even more than hasdrubal scipio sighed again perhaps this masinissa was the true model for the swaggering soldier said kaeso to his relief scipio laughed what a delight that play was really your troupe outdid themselves kaeso they made me very proud i sat through all the other comedies but not one of them made me laugh half as much as yours its plautus who should get the credit but on his behalf i gratefully accept your words of praise to plautus kaeso raised his cup scipio did likewise and kaeso was happy to see him drain his cup the wine seemed to affect scipio almost at once perhaps being normally so abstemious he was more vulnerable to intoxication than a heavier drinker like kaeso a splendid play he said dreamily and the athletic competitions were just as splendid wonderful chariot races excellent boxing foot races and javelin tosses i especially enjoyed that exhibition of greekstyle wrestling though the athletes were not entirely naked as the greeks prefer he grinned perhaps you would have preferred that as well kaeso kaeso stammered for a moment but scipio didnt seem to expect an answer talking about the games had excited him what did you think of the feast of jupiter it was the best public feast i can remember handing out vessels of olive oil to everyone who attended was a very nice touch and the menu for the second day was even better than the first it was wasnt it roast pork and fowl savory onions on skewers and chickpeas with garum dont you love garum kaeso i mean a really good garum not too sweet not too saltynot that cheap pickled fish sauce they sell in the subura but the kind thats been properly fermented so pungent it pops the top of your head off ill wager that most people at this years feast of jupiter had never before tasted a garum as good as the one i gave them when they think of the best garum they ever ate they shall always think of me and vote for you exactly scipio giggled like boy and raised a brawny arm to push back his mane of chestnut hair kaeso blinked and tried to think of something to say the games must have cost you a fortune indeed they did father supplied most of the money but it wasnt nearly enough you cant imagine all the expenses it was like running a military campaignlogistics supply lines transport im afraid i had to borrow quite a bit scipio ill feel guilty now asking for the fee we agreed on nonsense every politician goes into debt to finance public entertainments for the voters thats what moneylenders are for do you know i think i shall have some more of this very fine wine i paid for it out of the budget for the games after all scipio poured them both another cup a toast to our friendship to our friendship whispered kaeso and they both drank deeply scipios eyes glittered in the lamplight i treasure our friendship kaeso youre so very different from most of the men i associate with nowadays theyre all so relentlessly ambitious always pushing to get ahead concerned about nothing but fighting and politics their lives have no other dimensionthere is the course of honor and nothing else their marriages are only a means to an end as are their friendships the same applies to their educationthey duly memorize a few passages so they can drop a learned quotation into a speech from time to time but they have no appreciation of beautiful writing and lofty ideas they dont know their ennius from their iliad even the worship of the gods means little to them apart from the role it plays in advancing their careers he sighed its the way of the world i suppose but you and i kaeso we know theres more to life than chasing after wealth and honor theres a spark of life inside us unique and separate from everything else a kind of secret flame that must be cherished and tended as the vestals tend the sacred hearth sometimes i find it hard to remember that sometimes i envy you kaeso standing as you do outside the course of honor kaeso managed a halting laugh surely you joke scipio he gazed at his friend admiring his beauty acutely aware of his accomplishments and the adoration he received from others and found it very hard to imagine that scipio was envious of any man scipios face became grave he placed his hand on kaesos and gazed into his eyes no kaeso im not joking your friendship is different from any other it means a great deal to me you mean a great deal to me kaeso looked at the hand that remained atop his own if he dared to move his forefinger it would brush against scipios forefinger in an unmistakable gesture of intimacy i think this must be the wine talking he whispered perhaps but in wine is truth as the saying goes do you not feel the same about me kaesos pulse began to race he felt lightheaded his mouth was suddenly dry wine give me strength to speak the truth he thought but did he dare to say aloud what he felt for scipio he had no fear that his friend would scoff or laugh or do anything to belittle or berate him but even the least expression of pity or disdain on scipios face would be devastating to him kaeso opened his mouth to speak he looked up intending to gaze steadily into scipios eyes but his friend was looking past him at a slave who had entered the room what is it daphnis a messenger master he says its very urgent scipio snorted probably a contractor for the games wanting a payment no master its a centurion he has a message from your uncle in spain scipio withdrew his hand from kaesos he sat upright he drew a deep breath all traces of inebriation vanished show the man in the centurion wore a grim expression he extended a small wax tablet to scipio of the type used for writing and rewriting short missives scipio stared at it for a moment then shook his head no read it aloud to me the centurion balked are you sure aedile read it the centurion untied the lacings and opened the hinged cover he stared for a long moment at the tiny crabbed letters scraped in the wax then cleared his throat to my nephew publius i send tragic news your father my beloved brother the soldier hesitated for a long moment then thrust out his jaw and continued your father my beloved brother is dead riding forth to engage the suessitani before they could reach and reinforce the carthaginians and numidians he unexpectedly encountered all three enemies one after another he was outflanked in the thick of battlefighting rallying his men exposing himself wherever they were hardest pressedhe was pierced through the right side by a lance scipio gave a cry and pressed a fist to his mouth after a moment he waved to the centurion to continue he fell from his horse the romans lost heart and took flight but escape through the line of numidian cavalry was impossible the only survivors were those who managed to stay alive until nightfall when darkness put an end to the battle and allowed them to elude the enemy nephew i mourn with you but at this moment i can write no more your fathers heroic death has made hasdrubal and masinissa bolder than ever they press upon us our spanish auxiliaries have melted away the situation is desperate jupiter be my shield mars be my sword farewell nephew your uncle gnaeus having finished the centurion again offered the tablet to scipio who took it but seemed unable to focus his eyes upon the wax he put the tablet aside his voice was hollow is this all my uncle sent did he send no memento of my father a scrap of his armor some keepsake your uncle yes speak your uncle is also dead aedile because of storms i had to wait many days to catch a ship from spain even as i was boarding the ship another messenger arrived he brought news of the battle in which gnaeus cornelius scipio perished the enemy laid siege to his camp and overran the ramparts he took refuge in a lookout tower the tower was set aflame the commander and his men emerged and died fighting i know no other details but im sure he died as heroically as his brother before him scipio stared at the dancing flame of the lamp that lit the room his voice was strangely distant my fathermy uncleboth dead yes aedile impossible i assure you aedile but who is commanding the legions in spain iim not sure aedile for a long time scipio stared at the flame the centurion used to awaiting orders stood silent and still kaeso hardly dared to look at his friends face fearful of seeing his anguish but scipio with his long hair and handsome features might have been a statue of alexander without moving without expression he stared at the flame at last scipio stirred he stood and looked down at each of his limbs in turn with a bemused expression as if he had forgotten who he was and needed to take account of himself then he strode purposefully out of the room kaeso followed him scipio where are you going where the god calls me said scipio with no further explanation in the vestibule he paused to look at the wax effigies of his ancestors then dressed as he was in a light tunic and thin slippers he opened the door and left the house he walked steadily through the dark deserted streets descended to the forum then headed for the path that would take him to the top of the capitoline kaeso followed at a distance in poems and plays he had read of men possessed by the gods but he had never seen such a thing had scipio been possessed by a god his reaction to the dreadful news seemed so strange and his movements so controlled and deliberate that kaeso could hardly believe scipio was acting of his own volition atop the capitoline scipio entered the temple of jupiter kaeso stopped at the foot of the steps it seemed somehow improper to follow scipio inside kaeso waited the landscape of the night seemed unfamiliar to him and slightly eerie the sacred precinct of temples and towering statues was utterly quiet as if the gods themselves were sleeping but not for long a flicker of torches caught kaesos eye a group of magistrates and priests approached headed by the pontifex maximus the priest gave him a nod of recognition youre maximuss young cousin yes kaeso fabius dorso have you heard a catastrophe the worst defeat since cannae i heard the news at the side of the curule aedile himself said kaeso quietly i followed him here young scipio is in the temple jupiter summoned him summoned him thats what scipio said the pontifex maximus gazed up uncertainly at the open doors of the temple like kaeso he and the others chose to wait at the foot of the steps soon others joined them for news of the disaster was spreading quickly through the city as was word of scipios lone vigil inside the temple little by little a great throng gathered the space was filled with low murmurs of lamentation and cries of grief the light of many torches turned night into day if the gods had been sleeping before thought kaeso they were awake now at last scipio emerged from the temple people shouted his name along with the names of his father and his uncle and cried aloud to jupiter for protection and salvation many in the anxious grieving crowd believed that scipio had been communing with the god and awaited his message scipio stood for so long on the porch of the temple unmoving and hardly seeming to notice the crowd that kaeso began to fear that his friend had lost his senses suddenly scipio stepped forward raised his arms and gave a shout citizens be quiet can you not hear the voice of jupiter speaking be quiet the crowd fell silent all eyes were on scipio he cocked his head and returned the crowds gaze with a look of bewilderment at last as if solving a puzzle he raised his eyebrows and nodded no none of you can hear what i hearbut you can hear my voice so listen to what i have to say citizens i saved the life of my father in battle once long ago at the river ticinus but when the combined fury of our enemies encircled him in spain i was not there and i could not save him when they turned their wrath against his brother gnaeus my father was not there to come to his rescue and neither was i my father is dead my uncle is dead the legions in spain are broken and leaderless roma stands defenseless against our enemies to the west if hasdrubal should come to join his brother hannibal in italyif he should bring the numidian whelp masinissa with himwhat shall become of roma there were cries of alarm from the crowd that must never happen cried scipio the bleeding wound of spain must be stitched up hasdrubal and masinissa must be driven out the suessitani must be punished tonight here before you upon the steps of the gods dwelling place i make the vow that jupiter demands of me i pledge to take my fathers placeif the people of roma see fit to give me the command i pledge to avenge his death i pledge to drive his killers from spain and after that task is accomplished i pledge to drive the oneeyed fiend himself from italy along with every mongrel mercenary under his command to the east philip of macedonia will be punished for allying himself with our enemy we shall take the war to carthage we shall make them regret that they ever dared to challenge the will of roma it may take many yearsit may take all the days that remain of my lifetimebut when i am done i will make sure that carthage can never endanger us again i make this pledge to you and i make this pledge to jupiter greatest of all the gods of jupiter i beg for strength of you i ask for my fathers command the crowd reacted moaning and weeping turned to shouts of exultation the people began to chant send the son to spain send the son to spain send the son to spain kaeso looked at the faces of the magistrates and priests at the front of the crowd they did not join in the chanting but they did not dare to stop it wise men would argue that scipio was far too young and inexperienced to receive such a command just as he had been too young to serve as curule aedile but he had asked the people directly for the command of spain and who could doubt that he would receive it kaeso bowed his head and wondered at his own audacity how could he ever have thought however fleetingly that he might lay claim to the affections of a man so beloved by so many whether destined for triumph or defeat scipio had embarked on a path upon which kaeso could not hope to follow i think i must have felt as men felt in the presence of alexander the great said kaeso plautus gave him a sardonic look madly in love with the fellow you mean kaeso smiled crookedly what an absurd idea even in the uninhibited atmosphere of the playwrights house he felt uncomfortable talking about his feelings for scipio is it so absurd said plautus alexanders men were all in love with him and why not they say there was never a man more beautiful or more full of firea divine fire a spark from the gods and alexander loved at least one of them in return his lifelong companion hephaestion they say he went mad with heartbreak after hephaestion died and rushed to join his beloved in hades whos to say you couldnt be hephaestion to scipios alexander dont be ridiculous hephaestion was alexanders equal as an athlete and a warrior for one thing besides greeks are greeks and romans are romans plautus shook his head men are the same everywhere thats why comedy is universal thank the gods for that a laugh is a laugh whether youre in corinth or corsicaor carthage i daresay every man likes to laugh eat spill his seed and get a good nights sleepusually in that order kaeso shrugged and sipped his wine the playwright smirked divine spark or not your friend scipio has fallen behind in his social engagements didnt you say he intended to have me over to celebrate our mutual success its almost a month since the roman games and im still waiting for my dinner invitation you cant be serious plautus can you imagine how busy scipio must be preparing to take the command in spain he doesnt have time to entertain i was probably the last person with whom he actually sat down and enjoyed a meal you should feel lucky then and honored i do it will be a very long time i imagine before scipio smiles again as he smiled that nightrelaxed and contented and with hardly a worry now the weight of destiny is on his shoulders plautus nodded hes set himself an arduous task it will make him or break him only time will tell whispered kaeso he mouthed a silent prayer to jupiter to watch over his friend bc eleven years later scipio had fulfilled the vows he made to jupiter to the shades of his father and uncle and to the people of roma after decisive victories in spain scipio took the war to africa and proceeded to menace carthage this was done over the strenuous objections of fabius maximus who told the senate that hannibal should be decisively defeated in italy rather than lured away and who warned against the uncertainties and entanglements of an african campaign but scipios strategy succeeded brilliantly panicked the carthaginians recalled hannibal from italy to defend their city just as many of romas jealous allies and subjects had eagerly betrayed her so did many of carthages neighbors scipio pressed his advantage at the battle of zama some one hundred miles inland from carthage the long war reached its climax before the battle in a final attempt at negotiations hannibal asked to talk with scipio and the two met face to face in scipios tent for a long moment both men were struck dumb with mutual loathing and admiration hannibal spoke first asking for peace despite the bitter taste of the word in his mouth he offered terms advantageous to romabut not advantageous enough scipio craved a victory not a settlement nothing less would satisfy his vow to jupiter hannibal made a final plea you were a boy when i began my war on roma youve grown up ive grown old your sun is rising i see twilight ahead with age comes weariness but also wisdom hear me scipio the greater a mans success the less it may be trusted to endure fortuna can turn on a man in the blink of an eye you believe that you have the upper hand going into this battle but when the bloodshed and the madness begin all the odds count for nothing will you stake the sacrifice of so much blood and so many years of struggle on the outcome of a single hour scipio was unimpressed he pointed out that roma had proposed terms of peace on numerous occasions to which carthage had always turned a deaf ear negotiation was no longer an option as for fortuna scipio was well aware of her vagaries she had taken those dearest to him but she had also given him a chance to exact his revenge hannibal was allowed to return to the carthaginian camp unharmed the next day the two most famous generals commanding the two mightiest armies in the world advanced to battle the closely fought contest was a test of sheer endurance for both sides scipio had prayed for a rout he achieved a bare victory but a victory nonetheless defeated exhausted abandoned by fortuna hannibal fled back to carthage the romans terms were harsh stripped of her warships and military stores and made to pay massive reparations carthage was reduced to little more than a client state of roma a war that had wreaked havoc on the whole of the mediterranean for seventeen years had at last come to an end and roma emerged stronger than ever a power poised to rival the fabled egyptians or the persians at the peak of their empires the survivors who had fought and won the war could rightly consider themselves the greatest generation in roman history and the greatest among them without question was publius cornelius scipio forever after to be called africanusconqueror of africa hes cut his hair short when did that happen ive never seen him without his long mane of chestnut hair kaeso spoke wistfully through the peephole beneath the stage he gazed at the crowded bleachers of the circus maximus where scipio had finally arrived to take his seat of honor the crowd stood and cheered him for a long time crying africanus africanus eventually the spectators began to take their seats and kaeso was finally able to get a clear view of the recipient of their acclaim are you disappointed boss said plautus who was performing a lastminute inspection of the trapdoor the simple task made him huff and puff over the years he had grown fat with success does short hair not suit him quite the contrary it suits him very well indeed kaeso squinted slightly his eyesight was not as good as it used to be he no longer looks like a boy i should think not he must be at least thirtyfive but hes more handsome than ever not so much like alexander anymore more like hercules perhaps he used to be almost too pretty you know now he looks so rugged so by venus and mars stop swooning plautus laughed hes just a man really did you see the triumphal procession some of it it went on too long for me to watch the whole thing all those captives all that booty the splendor of his chariot the magnificence of his armor all those people shouting his name im only glad he decided to include an afternoon of comedy among the festivitiesthough i must admit i was a bit surprised when he requested that we revive the swaggering soldier for the occasion why not the swaggering soldier it hearkens back to his very first elected office people still talk about the roman games of that year and its a clever way for him to show people that he doesnt take himself too seriously the audience can see the play as an affectionate parody of romas most beloved soldier a man whos earned the right to swagger the invincible scipio africanus giving them a laugh at his own expense will only make them love him more while you dear boss could hardly love scipio more than you already do kaeso made no reply he was deep in thought musing on scipios spectacular success his own life seemed hopelessly humdrum and shabby by comparisona comfortable but loveless marriage a daughter to whom he had never felt particularly close an endless series of dalliances with actors and slave boys and a merely adequate livelihood earned from his theater company and from his staff of scribes who specialized in copying greek books for sale to the literate upper classes plautus slapped his shoulder snap out of it boss youve been a shadow to scipio all your life youve admired him desired him idolized him envied himdone everything i suppose except hate him that i could never do ah but there you differ from your fellow citizens they adore him nowthey worship him like a godbut theyll turn on scipio some day impossible inevitable the audience is fickle kaeso you alone are faithful like the keeper of a shrine scipio should appreciate you more than he does has he invited you to dinner even once since we met to talk about putting on the play hes been very busy kaeso frowned then a flash of movement caught his eye one of the actors had forgotten from which side he needed to make his entrance and was using the passage under the stage to get across the actor was new to the company and quite young they seemed to grow younger every year he was also uncommonly goodlooking with long hair and broad shoulders he flashed a grin at kaeso as he hurried past plautus glanced over his shoulder then looked back at kaeso and smiled ah yes the new boy from massilia scipios haircut notwithstanding i see you havent entirely lost your appreciation for longhaired beauties i suppose i havent admitted kaeso with a crooked grin above their heads the play began the tromping of the actors across the boards was loud in their ears but not as loud as the first roar of laughter from the audience amid the din kaeso was sure that he could distinctly hear scipio laughing louder and harder than anyone else bc it seems we hardly ever run into each other anymore except at the theater said scipio when did i see you last kaeso its must have been a couple of years at least the festive occasion was the opening of a temple on the palatine dedicated to a goddess new to roma cybele the great mother of the gods whom the romans called magna mater her cult was said to date back to prehistoric times but was not native to roma or even to italy it had been imported from one of romas new allies in the east the kingdom of phrygia since the defeat of carthage romas expanding sphere of influence had resulted in an influx of new people new languages new ideasand new deities cybele was quite unlike any goddess previously seen in roma the statue in the new temple depicted her wearing exotic garments and adorned from head to foot with bulls testicles along with her statue the priests of cybele had also been imported from phrygia they were called galli and were also something new to roma eunuchs games had been organized to celebrate the occasion and a temporary theater had been erected in front of the new temple the company of plautus was about to put on a new comedy for this performance kaeso had chosen to sit in the audience rather than remain backstage and had invited scipio to sit beside him before he could answer his friends question a small commotion in the audience distracted them both the galli had arrived in a group and were filing into their seats of honor not far from kaeso and scipio the priests were gaudily attired in red turbans and yellow gowns they wore bangles on their wrists and paint on their cheeks can you imagine our grandfathers putting foreignborn eunuchs on the sacred payroll asked scipio our ancestors thought of eunuchs if they thought of them at all strictly as the sycophants of kings halfmen who could never breed and so would never try to put their own progeny ahead of the kings heirs a republic has no king ergo no need for eunuchs yet now we have eunuchs in roma thanks to cybele fascinating arent they i hear they cut off their testicles themselves they work themselves into a such a frenzy that they dont even feel it amazing the acts to which religious devotion will drive a man kaeso winced at the idea of a man castrating himself but found himself staring at one of the galli a darkeyed exceptionally goodlooking youth with full lips and skin like marble he had heard that a man who was castrated in adulthood did not lose his erotic appetites what sort of proclivities might such a young man possess who had been willing to do such a thing for his goddess kaeso could not help being curious aloud he remarked if anyone should know about the great mother and her galli its you scipio after all it was you who officially welcomed them to the city and accepted the gift of the black stone the black stone even more than the statue of the goddess was the centerpiece of the new temple it was said to have fallen from the sky and its shape roughly depicted an even more primitive image of the goddess an amorphous mass suggesting a massively pregnant female with no distinguishing features the black stone too was unlike anything previously worshiped in roma but when the galli in the phrygian city of pessinus offered it as a gift along with a request to establish cybeles worship in roma a verse had been found in the sibylline books that called on the roman people to accept the gift and welcome the new goddess whatever its religious function the importation of cybele possessed a political dimension as well men of vision like scipio believed that romas future now lay to the east after hannibal had been dealt with the romans turned their energies to defeating philip of macedonia and had done so with help from phrygia romas embrace of the great mother would strengthen her bonds with her new ally when the stone arrived by ship at ostia the verse in the sibylline books required that only the greatest of the romans could accept it naturally publius cornelius scipio africanus was chosen for the honor perhaps because he was thinking of the galli and their sacrifice kaeso touched the golden fascinum that hung from the necklace he wore he had put away the heirloom many years before and had virtually forgotten about it until he happened to come across it while going through a box of old things the glitter of the gold caught his eye and on a whim he decided to begin wearing it again on special occasions as had been the practice so he had once been told of his ancestors touching the fascinum led to another train of thought he cleared his throat and said to scipio in an offhand way all these new religions flooding into romasome official somenot so official what do you think of the socalled cult of bacchus they say it offers initiation into secret rites that promise an ecstatic release from the material world scipio looked at him sidelong and raised an eyebrow the cult of bacchus is controversial to say the least like everyone else ive heard about it it seems to be an offshoot of a greek cult that worships a god of wine and madness how much of what ive heard can be believed or how widespread the cults become i dont know i do know it has no recognition from the state so its not illegal not technically i suppose but from what ive heard the cults ecstatic rituals are nothing more than drunken orgies where every possible sexual act is encouraged also scipio lowered his voice the initiation of men into the cult requires that they submit to anal penetrationas if they were slave boys ive also heard that the cult is nothing more than a front for a group of ruthless criminals the socalled priests and priestesses are forgers blackmailers even murderers scipio took a deep breath i would advise you kaeso to steer clear of any cult that has no official status especially the cult of bacchus yes of course muttered kaeso he hurriedly changed the subject im a grandfather now scipio smiled so ive heard congratulations my daughter struck a lucky match when she married young menenius no man could have given her a more beautiful baby i only wish my wife had lived to see little menenia yes i was saddened to hear of sestias death kaeso shrugged to be honest i was never much of a husband to her nor was i much of a father to fabia but the role of grandfather seems to suit me i dote shamelessly on menenia as i never doted on her mother or grandmother and what about you scipio youve just had a daughter indeed i have if you think you dote on menenia you should see me with cornelia kaeso nodded curious that your daughter and my granddaughter should be almost exactly the same age perhaps they can grow up to be friends as you and i have been friends kaeso i should like that kaeso said i should like that very much he gazed steadily at scipio his chestnut hair kept short was now mixed with silver in his rugged features all trace of the boy was gone except in his eyes which sometimes glowed with youthful exuberance when he laughed this was one of the reasons kaeso had invited scipio to sit beside him in the theater that day because it would give him such pleasure to see scipio laugh they were distracted by the sound of applause and a flurry of movement many in the audience spontaneously rose from their seats plautus had just entered the theater and was making his way to the empty seat next to kaeso at the age of sixtythree the umbrian playwright was the grand old man of the roman stage the audience knew him by sight and gave him a standing ovation the galli alone failed to recognize him they looked at one another in puzzlement then stood and joined uncertainly in the applause plautus embraced kaeso then exchanged greetings with scipio the three of them sat and the applause gradually dwindled so my flatfooted friend whats the play today said scipio plautus shrugged oh a trifle ive titled after the main character a wisecracking slave its called pseudolus a trifle your masterpiece declared kaeso spoken with all the conviction one would expect from the owner of the company plautus laughed oh the dialogue sparkles in places i must admit but not nearly so brightly as words may sparkle in real life i refer scipio to the dialogue you exchanged with your old enemy hannibal when the two of you met face to face on your recent mission to the eastif one can believe the gossips can one believe the gossips scipio had already told the anecdote to kaeso when they met outside the theater but he obligingly related it again its true while i was in ephesus i learned that hannibal happened to be there as well and i arranged to meet him our spies say hes been wandering the east for years offering his services to any king willing to challenge roma its because of that accursed vow he made to his father he can never stop plotting our downfall as long as theres a breath in his body so far hes had no takers hes become a bit of a joke actually what did you two talk about said plautus this and that at one point i asked him which general in his opinion was the greatest of all time a leading question said plautus what was his reply alexander hannibal answered and what commander would he place second pyrrhus he said and third myself declared hannibal well i had to burst out laughing i said and where would you rank if you had defeated me hannibal looked me in the eye and replied in that case i would put myself before pyrrhus and even before alexanderin fact before all other generals who ever lived plautus slapped his knee outrageous really i could never invent a line like that or a character like hannibal its carthaginian flattery dont you see said scipio devious and indirect buti was flattered nonetheless he sighed someday i have no doubt hannibal will be assassinated or else driven to suicide not by me of course but by those who come after me kaeso shook his head therell never be another man big enough to take your place scipio laughed a little sadly and a little bitterly sweet words my friend but alas i grow smaller every day and the space i occupy becomes easier to fill i feel my influence waning the world has grown tired of me just as the world has grown tired of hannibal when people hear his name they no longer tremble they smirk they hear my name and they shrug my political enemies circle me like wolves waiting for the chance to bring me down on some trumpedup charge the same smallminded men who will murder hannibal will sooner or later drive me into exile if they can kaeso was distressed no i dont believe you surely youre at the peak of your power you were chosen to accept the black stone of cybele a magnificent arch is being built in your honor to serve as the gateway to the capitoline hill the arch of scipio africanus will stand forever as a monument to your glory perhaps monuments last men dont as for glory scipio shook his head when we met for the first time before the battle of zama hannibal said something ive never forgotten the greater a mans success the less it may be trusted to endure we shall both be swept aside hannibal and i swallowed by the rush of time do you want to see the future look there he pointed to a senator in the audience a man in his forties perhaps a little younger than scipio his slender face seen in profile was dominated by a beaklike nose he was leaning forward with a tense posture and scanning the crowd with a predatory birdlike gaze my nemesis marcus porcius cato said scipio a socalled new man first of his family to hold elected office he added with some disdain but his neophyte status doesnt stop him from slandering me at every opportunity and muttering behind my back about finishing the war with carthageas if we had any reason to attack a crippled seaport thats been stripped of her champion her navy and her colonies he says my handling of the settlement after zama was lackluster bordering on incompetent says i accomplished nothing in the long run because i failed to have hannibal beheaded and burn carthage to the ground he slanders me on personal grounds as well says ive gone greek because i happen to like the baths and the theater given catos loathing for all things not roman im rather surprised to see him in the audience today what in hades is he doing here as if on cue cato rose from his seat citizens citizens listen to me he cried in such a powerful strident voice that in short order he had the attention of everyone in the audience citizens you know me well i am marcus porcius cato i began my service to roma when i enlisted at the age of seventeen back when that scoundrel hannibal was having his run of luck setting italy on fire since that time i have devoted my entire life to the salvation of this city and the preservation of the roman way of life four years ago you honored me by electing me consul and sending me to spain subsequently i received a triumph for pacifying the revolt there if further unrest broke out again after my departure i think we can safely say that was the fault of my successor under his breath scipio muttered an obscenity it was scipio who had taken control of spain after cato in terms of holding high office some call me a new man said cato but in terms of the bravery and prowess of my ancestors i assure you that i am as old as any man here so i hope you will lend me your ears for a few moments and consider what i have to say citizens what are you doing here today what is this decadent spectacle in which you have chosen to take part think of it here you are gathered to watch a play based on a greek original performed in honor of an asiatic goddess imported from a land ruled by a king all to make a group of foreign eunuchs feel welcomed to all of this i say no no no how can such an abomination have come about ill tell you how wealth and all the vices that spring from wealthgreed love of luxury crass opportunismare leading you astray from the upright virtues of your forefathers i look about me and everywhere i see loose morals loose living and loose thinking now it comes to this we are deliberately polluting the purity of our religious worship diluting and demeaning our reverence for the ancient gods who have preserved us for centuries things go from bad to worse importing a priesthood of eunuchs is bad enough but one hears of even stranger and more insidious foreign cults spreading among the populace the play to which you shall be subjected today will i daresay be bad enoughyet another revolting compendium of greek obscenitiesbut recently some senators who should know better have spoken of erecting a permanent theater in roma built of stone are we romans to become as idle and pleasureloving as the greeks you there marcus junius brutus cato pointed to the praetor who was sponsoring the games what would your heroic ancestor say he who revenged the rape of lucretia and brought down the last king tarquinius if he could see this sorry sight has our beloved roma risen to unparalleled heights of glory only to fall into an abyss of shame citizens i beseech you if my words have ignited even the tiniest spark of patriotism in your heart do as i now do and leave this place at once cato ostentatiously gathered the folds of his toga after a few steps he halted and turned back oh and one more thing carthage must be destroyed with that he stalked out of the theater followed by a substantial entourage a handful of people scattered throughout the audience did likewise but a greater number began to boo cato who disappeared through the exit without looking back people shifted uneasily in their seats a murmur spread through the audience scipio rose from his seat he said nothing to call for the crowds attention but gradually all eyes came to rest on him the audience fell silent citizens if the senator who just imposed on our patience by marring the joyous nature of this occasion had not seen fit to attack me personallysomething he appears to do compulsively like a man with an uncontrollable twitchi would not presume to try your patience further by addressing you myself however i feel obliged first to say this a man who leaves a mess behind him has no business casting aspersions on the man who comes after him just as i had to clean up the mess left behind by hannibals elephants so i had to clean up the mess that cato left behind in spain the audience burst into laughter the tension left in catos wake was dispersed in an instant second if after all my years of service to the roman people i have any claim to speak on their behalf allow me to apologize to our guests of honor the priests of the goddess cybele for the aspersions cast upon them by the senator i assure you not all romans are so boorish and inhospitable the galli who had sat stonefaced through catos harangue smiled and nodded to acknowledge scipios courtesy likewise allow me to apologize for the uncouth words that my colleague addressed to you marcus junius brutus generous sponsor of these festivities instead of citing your great ancestor to make a dubious rhetorical point let him use the example of one of his own famous ancestors oh but im forgettingcato has no famous ancestors brutus laughed and called out here here well said africanus as for all the other drivel that spilled from the senators mouth i will say only this scipio gestured to plautus in the terrible year of cannae all the might of hannibal could not stop the performance of this playwrights work surely a temper tantrum by cato will not stop it today the show must go on laughing and applauding the audience leaped to their feet and gave scipio a joyous ovation the crowds response reassured kaeso here was proof he thought that scipios gloomy fears about the future were unfounded but what a burden his friend had to bear enduring the abuse of men like cato whatever kaesos own petty problems at least he did not have to worry about ruthless rivals plotting his downfall perhaps there was something to be said for leading an insignificant life he thought of hannibals words to scipio but reversed their meaning he muttered aloud the smaller a mans success the more it may be trusted to endure what did you say asked plautus as the ovation began to die down nothing said kaeso nothing at all the play was a rollicking success after it was over kaeso declined an invitation to celebrate at plautuss house limping slightly he set off alone the days official festivities were over but there were still a great many people out and about kaeso was jostled by the crowd more than once he had to sidestep a pool of vomit left by someone who had celebrated too much he only vaguely noticed these irritations as always after seeing scipio he was restless and unsettled preoccupied by thoughts of how his life might have turned out had he been a different man with a different destiny a man like scipio or else a man who could have been scipios comradeinarms worthy to share his adventures his glory his tent as he drew nearer to his destination a house on the aventine hill the crowds thinned the streets were almost empty he sighed with relief glad to be out of the crush and knowing that the place where he was headed would offer relief from all his earthly cares on a respectable street in a respectable neighborhood he came to a house where all the windows were shuttered he rapped at the door the peephole slid open for a moment he forgot the pass phrase but then it came back to him upon mount falernus in campania grow the grapes from which falernian wine is made the phrase was changed often but always had something to do with wine because wine was bacchuss gift to mankind and essential to his worship the door opened then was quickly shut after kaeso stepped inside the garden at the center of the house had been closed off and all the windows had been shuttered with heavy hangings pulled across them to keep sounds from reaching the neighbors as a result the interior was quite dark except for the soft illumination cast by lamps and the sounds from within were strangely muffled those sounds included exotic music played upon tambourines and pipes the tune was by turns languorous and dreamy then fast and frenzied familiar faces male and female emerged from the shadows they smiled and bowed their heads in deference to him welcome high priest they said in unison one of them whispered in his ear a new acolyte is within awaiting initiation kaeso raised his arms from his sides until they were parallel with the floor the men and women undressed him then anointed his naked body from head to foot with sweetsmelling oil a cup filled with wine was pressed to his lips he threw back his head and swallowed wine overflowed his mouth and trickled down onto his chest where greedy tongues lapped it up hands glided over his shoulders and chest and hips and buttocks caressing him fondling him exciting him he was taken by both hands and guided into a room that smelled of sweat and incense here the music was louder and he could now discern the murmur of a low insistent chant in which the name of bacchus was invoked the room was hazy with incense and crowded with warm naked bodies pressed close together presiding above the crowd upon a high pedestal was a statue of the godbacchus deity of wine and euphoria with grape leaves in his air and a smile of bliss upon his bearded face kaeso gazed up at the god with reverence and gratitude the coming of the cult to roma had marked the beginning of a new epoch in his life in the warm secret embrace of the god kaeso had at last found a purpose to his existence kaeso abruptly experienced a fluttering in his head of the sort that sometimes preceded one of his falling spells but he felt no anxiety the priests and priestesses of bacchus had explained to him that his affliction was not a curse but a mark of special favor from the god just as scipio had always enjoyed a special relationship with jupiter so kaeso had at last discovered his own special link to the god bacchus the fluttering in his head subsided on this occasion the god had seen fit merely to pass through him without striking him senseless someone whispered in his ear high priest the initiate is ready for the ritual his rigid sex was firmly grasped and in his other ear a voice whispered and you appear to be ready for the initiate kaeso touched the fascinum that lay upon his bare breast he tightly closed his eyes step by step the acolytes guided him forward until his sex was met by a circle of resistance then swallowed by a convulsive embrace he heard the muffled cry of the initiate followed by a whimper and a groan kaeso surrendered to a state of bliss who was the initiate before him male or female young or old he did not know behind his closed eyes it was scipio he envisioned scipio when his hair was still long and not a single battle scar had yet marred his perfect beauty it was scipio into whom he thrust all the love and longing inside him even in the throes of ecstasy he knew that his vision of scipio was only a fantasy but the bliss he felt was genuine when all was said and done only these brief moments of release were real all else was illusion earthly glory was meaningless scipio himself had admitted as much scipio had reached a pinnacle of socalled greatness unknown to other men but had scipio ever attained the unspeakable delights that kaeso had experienced since he joined the cult of bacchus bc kaeso ran his fingers through the mop of graying hair on his head and closed his eyes to rest them for a moment how weak his vision had grown in recent years when he was younger even well into his forties he had been able to read without effort all those poems by ennius and plays by plautus no matter how tiny the letters now squint as he might it was almost impossible for him to read any of the documents spread before him reading was his secretarys job of course but kaeso wanted to make sure that no mistakes were made he had decided to liquidate all his assets a group of buyers had been found to purchase his theatrical troupe and his staff of scribes was being sold piecemeal he was going over his will as well though the terms were simple enough his entire estate would be left in trust to his granddaughter menenia kaeso opened his eyes and gazed about his study at all the pigeonhole bookcases stuffed with scrolls over the years he had accumulated a considerable library anticipating long years of retirement in which he would require many books to keep him company amid the bookcases there was a small shrine a little stone altar upon which stood a miniature statue of bacchus kaeso gazed into the gods smiling eyes for a long moment then looked away i think our work is done you may go now he said to the secretary send in cletus the secretary withdrew a few moments later a handsome young slave with broad shoulders and long hair stepped into the room cletus i wish to go for a walk today of course master the weather is quite fine the slave offered a thickly muscled forearm for kaeso to lean upon kaeso did not really need the support but he enjoyed clinging to cletuss arm anyway together they took a long stroll around the city first kaeso visited the arch which had been built to commemorate scipios victories conspicuously located on the the path that led to the top of the capitoline the relief carvings depicting the triumphs of africanus were as magnificent as he remembered it was a worthy monument to his friend next he ventured to the necropolis outside the esquiline gate where he placed flowers upon the humble funeral monument of plautus this day was the first anniversary of the playwrights death how kaeso missed himhis keen insights his piercing wit his unflagging loyalty to his friends at least the scores of plays that plautus had written would live on kaeso had kept copies of them all leaning upon cletuss armfor he was genuinely growing a little wearykaeso headed toward the aventine hill for the final destination of his excursion in the vicinity of the circus maximus he noticed a highly animated group of men from the way they were all talking at once they appeared to be discussing some highly significant bit of news was the news dreadful or joyous kaeso could not tell from their expressions among the men he recognized an old acquaintance lucius pinarius and sent cletus to ask him over whats going on lucius you havent heard would i be asking if i had hannibal is dead kaeso drew a sharp breath as simple as that hannibal is dead it was like hearing that the sea had dried up or the moon had fallen from the sky and yet it must be true what could be simpler or more inevitable hannibal was dead how suicide sixtyfour years old and still plotting against us trying to stir up trouble in greece and asia the senate finally had enough of his treachery and sent a military force to extradite him i suppose he couldnt face the humiliation of being tried and executed he took poison but before he died he dictated his last words to a scribe let us now put an end to the great anxiety of the romans who have thought it too long and too heavy a task to wait for a hated old man to die a bitter end and long overdue scipio africanus yes i know scipio should have killed him when he had the chance and burned carthage to the ground but ill not hear a word spoken against the memory of my dear departed friend certainly not on this day kaeso turned away from pinarius he called for cletus to lend him his arm so they could proceed how prescient scipio had been all had come to pass just as he predicted but what a stroke of fate that the two great generals who once bestrode the world like titans both should have died within a year with cletus to help him kaeso struggled up the slope of the aventine finally arriving at the humble house of ennius the poet resided alone with only a single slave woman to serve him she opened the door to kaeso and showed him in to enniuss study cletus stayed behind in the vestibule i suppose youve heard the news said kaeso about hannibal yes the poet who was careless with his dress and perpetually in need of a haircut and a shave looked even shabbier than usual i dont suppose hannibal will be needing an epitaph for his gravestone from what i heard he uttered his own epitaph with his dying breath kaeso smiled what about scipios epitaph have you finished it yet i have indeed its ready to be chiseled on his grave monument i was greatly honored that in his will he asked me to compose it who else you were always his favorite poet well ennius handed him a piece of parchment kaeso made a face you know i cant possibly read this recite it aloud to me ennius cleared his throat the sun that rises above the easternmost marshes of lake maeotis illumines no man my equal in deeds if any mortal may ascend to the heaven of immortals for me alone the gods gate stands open kaeso managed a crooked smile a bit grandiose for my taste but just the sort of thing scipio would have wanted where on earth is lake maeotis ennius raised an eyebrow its the body of water located beyond the euxine sea at the uttermost edge of the civilized world i have no memories of it from this life but i think in my first life i must have gone there of course i would never have actually seen the sunrise since i was blind during that incarnation kaeso nodded since becoming a follower of the teachings of the greek philosopher pythagoras ennius was convinced of the transmigration of souls he was quite certain that he had begun existence in the body of homer author of the iliad his other incarnations included a peacock several great warriors and pythagoras himself ennius was still speaking but kaeso who found such notions tiresome let his mind wander his thoughts returned to scipio how accurately his friend had foreseen his fate in the end his enemies overwhelmed him he did accomplish one final military victory a successful campaign against the upstart king antiochus who presumed to challenge romas hegemony in greece but it was a pyrrhic victory when scipio returned to roma he was charged with taking bribes from the king and conspiring to join him as a coruler no accusation could be more damning to a roman politician than the claim that he wished to make himself a king it was cato of course who masterminded the prosecution rather than face trial scipio retired to his private estate at liternum on the coast south of roma behind massive walls with a colony of loyal veterans to protect him he withdrew from warfare politics and life heartbroken and bitter he fell ill and died at the age of fiftytwo and now within a year hannibal was also dead two giants hounded to death by lesser men muttered kaeso if you ask me scipio is well out of it said ennius romas become a bitter place the atmosphere is poison smallminded reactionaries like cato have gained the upper hand kaeso nodded peoples tastes have changed as well i see it in the theater no more comedies by plautus now we have tragedies by ennius people leave the theater in a somber mood to fit these somber days ennius grunted id be glad to write a comedy if i saw anything to laugh at how did we come to this when we finally brought down carthage do you remember the elation people felt the boundless sense of wellbeing and camaraderie then came our victories in the eastheady days with endless wealth and exciting new ideas flooding into roma but things changed too fast people grew uneasy men like cato manipulated their fears and the result was a very ugly backlash ennius sighed i suppose the worst manifestation of that backlash was the appalling suppression of the cult of bacchus kaeso stiffened he opened his mouth to change the subject but ennius had only begun to rant what horrid days those were the official inquiry the flimsy accusations of crimes and conspiracy against the state the cult and all its members outlawed thousands of men and women executed forced into exile driven to suicide the hatred unleashed against those poor people was sickening and absolutely nothing could be done to stop it say a word against the inquiry and you were branded a sympathizer and persecuted along with them i myself was never part of the cult but i knew men who were and even that tenuous association put me under suspicion for a while i was terrified and yet a remnant of the cult may yet survive theres been a new series of arrests only the other day i witnessed one just down the street the scene was all too familiar the accused man dazed trembling with fear being dragged from his home by stonefaced lictors meanwhile the household slave who betrayed the poor wretch stood off to one side trying not to look guilty a chilling sight kaeso could stand no more he abruptly rose and told ennius he must take his leave so soon i had hoped im afraid i have no time i merely wanted to hear scipios epitaph thank you but now i really must go im expecting callers at my house later today dinner guests not exactly back at home tired after the long walk kaeso sat alone in his study and gazed at the many scrolls that filled his library they were like old friends to whom he must bid a sad farewell he made sure his will was in the proper place though he could not read it he found the passage that he had instructed his secretary to underline that morning it mentioned the fascinum specifically and his desire that menenia should wear it on special occasions and when she did so that she should remember her loving grandfather kaeso removed the talisman from his neck and laid it atop the will he reached for a decanter and poured a cup of winea fine falernianand into the wine he stirred a powder holding the cup he knelt before the shrine of bacchus he kissed the statue of the god and waited it was not long before he heard a loud banging at the front door a few moments later cletus came running into the study armed men master theyre demanding entrance yes ive been expecting them master the color drained from cletuss face isnt this the hour at which you told them to come i overheard you talking to that fellow in the forum yesterday cletus why did you betray me there was the sound of a commotion from the vestibule the lictors were no longer waiting at the door cletus looked away unable to hide his guilt quickly kaeso drank the poison he would die with the taste of the gods favorite vintage on his lips friend of the gracchi bc daughter mother wife widow as she enunciated each word cornelia brought together a fingertip from each opposing handan orators gesture she had seen her father perform cornelia had been quite young when scipio died but he had made an immense impression on her nonetheless and many of his gestures and facial expressions and even some of his turns of phrase lived on in her she had also inherited her fathers famous beauty now in her late thirties cornelia was a strikingly handsome woman her chestnut hair gleamed red and gold as it reflected the bright dappled sunlight of the garden daughter mother wife widow she repeated which is a womans greatest role in life what do you think menenia i think her friend smiled a bit shyly menenia was the same age as cornelia and like cornelia a widow though not as beautiful she comported herself with such grace that heads were as likely to turn in her direction as in cornelias when the two entered a room together i think cornelia that you have left out a category what would that be lover with one hand menenia touched the talisman that hung from her neck an ancient fascinum inherited from her grandfather with her other hand she gently touched the arm of the man who sat next to her and the two exchanged a long meaningful look blossius was a philosopher an italian born in cumae with his long graying hair and neatly trimmed beard he exuded an air of dignity to match menenias cornelia was moved by the special spark between her dearest friend and the tutor of her children here were two mature adults long past the age of heady romance who had nonetheless found in each other not just a companion but a soul mate what prompts you to pose this question asked blossius as a pedagogue of the stoic school he tended to question a question rather than answer it cornelia shut her eyes and lifted her face to the warm sunlight it was a quiet day on the palatine she heard the music of birdsong from the rooftops idle musings i was thinking that menenia and i both lost our fathers at an early age and were both widows having married and buried husbands considerably older than ourselves after my fathers death relatives arranged for me to wed dear old tiberius gracchus and you were the second wife of lucius pinarius were you not third actually said menenia the old dear was looking more for a caretaker than a broodmare yet he gave you a wonderful son young lucius yes and tiberius gave you many children twelve to be exact each was precious to me alas that only three survived but what remarkable children those three are said menenia thanks in no small part to their instruction from blossius she squeezed her lovers arm your daughter sempronia is already happily married and the world expects great things of your sons tiberius and gaius cornelia nodded i think weve answered the question i posed at least regarding myself since i no longer have a living father or husbandand no time for a lovermotherhood is my highest role my achievement will be my sons i intend for them to do such great things that when my life is over people will say not that i was the daughter of scipio africanus but the mother of tiberius and gaius gracchus blossius pursed his lips a noble aspiration but must a woman exist only through the men in her lifefathers husbands sonslovers he cast an affectionate look at menenia stoicism teaches that each man is valuable in and of himself whatever his station in life citizen or slave consul or foot soldierall contain a unique spark of the divine essence but what of women do they not also possess intrinsic value above and beyond whatever role they play in relationship to the men in their lives cornelia laughed dear blossius only a stoic would dare to utter such a radical notion a generation ago you might have been exiled merely for proposing such an idea perhaps said blossius but a generation ago its unlikely that two women would have been allowed to sit alone and unchaperoned in a garden discussing ideas with a philosopher even nowadays many an oldfashioned roman would be appalled to overhear this conversation said menenia yet here we sit the world changes the world is always changing agreed blossius sometimes for the worse then it will be up to our children to change it for the better declared cornelia menenia smiled and which of your sons will do more to change the world hard to say theyre so different tiberius is so serious so earnest for an eighteenyearold mature beyond his years now that hes a soldier off fighting those poor carthaginians or whats left of them i hope his outlook doesnt become even more somber little gaius is only nine but what a different fellow he is i fear he may be rather too impulsive and hottempered but very sure of himself said blossius especially for a boy his age as their tutor i can say that both brothers are remarkably selfconfidenta trait i attribute to their mother while i attribute it to their grandfather though he was dead long before either was born how i wish the boys could have known him and that i could have known him longer than i did still ive done all i can to instill in the boys a deep respect for their grandfathers accomplishments they bear the name gracchus proudly and rightly so but they are also obliged to live up to the standards of scipio africanus menenia sighed well as for my lucius i only hope he comes back alive and unharmed from catos war this was the name which many in roma had given to the renewed campaign against carthage cato himself had not lived to see the outbreak of the war but he had never ceased to agitate for it for years no matter what the subjectroad building military commands sewer repairshe ended every speech in the senate with the same phrase and in conclusioncarthage must be destroyed men laughed at his dogged obsession but in the end from beyond the grave cato had prevailed it now seemed that his dream would be realized according to the most recent dispatches from africa roman forces were laying siege to carthage whose defenders could not hope to resist them for long cornelia blinked and shaded her eyes the garden had suddenly grown too hot and the sunlight too bright the singing birds had fallen silent they say its no longer a question of if carthage is destroyed but when said blossius and when that happens carthage shall be the second city in a matter of months to suffer such a fate at romas hands the philosopher resided in cornelias house and the two saw each other almost daily their thoughts often ran side by side like horses hitched together when general mummius captured corinth there was rejoicing in the streets of roma and weeping in the streets of corinth cornelia shook her head every male citizen killed every woman enslaved one of the most sophisticated and opulent cities in all greece obliterated by roman arms blossius raised an eyebrow an example to anyone who would dare to challenge our supremacy according to mummius temples were desecrated priceless works of art were destroyed by his rioting soldiers even the most antigreek reactionaries in roma were embarrassed by mummiuss barbarism cornelia abruptly fell silent she lifted one ear to the sky in place of birdsong another sound now floated on the air do you hear a commotion of some sort from the forum said menenia closer than that i think myron a young slave sitting on the ground nearby scrambled to his feet cornelia sent him to find out what was going on while they awaited his return the three of them sat silently sharing the same unease a commotion meant news of some sort news could be good or bad at last myron returned out of breath but smiling mistress tremendous news from africa carthage has been taken the war is over a ship landed at ostia this morning and the messengers have just arrived in roma thats all ive found out so far but if you wish i can run down to the forum menenia began to weep blossius put his arms around her the two seemed oblivious of cornelia watching them she suddenly felt very alone the heat of the garden made her feel faint the bright sunlight brought tears to her eyes yes myron go and see what else you can discover perhaps theres some word aboutroman casualties at once mistress myron spun about and abruptly collided with a man who was just stepping into the garden cornelia shielded her eyes from the sun she squinted at the newcomer then let out a cry nicomedes is it really you the man was one of tiberiuss slaves he had accompanied his master to carthage but nicomedes what are you doing here why arent you still with tiberius despite the heat cornelia shivered rather than speak for my master my master may speak for himself nicomedes smiled and produced a covered wax tablet from the pouch he carried a letter from tiberius inscribed by my own hand amid the smoking ruins of carthage as dictated by your son mistress who is not only alive and well but a hero of the roman legions a hero as you shall understand when you read his letter cornelia nodded she felt strangely calm myron go and fetch young gaius he should be present to hear his brothers letter read aloud blossius will you do it she handed him the tablet my hands are shaking and i dont think i could make sense of the letters a moment later gaius appeared running ahead of myron he was a handsome boy the very image of his grandfather is it true mother carthage is taken and theres a letter from tiberius yes gaius sit here beside me while blossius reads it the philosopher cleared his throat to my beloved mother daughter of the great africanus i write these words to you from the city my grandfather once conquered which has just been conquered again by roman arms it shall never be conquered a third time from this day forward carthage shall no longer exist along with this letter nicomedes also brings a memento from me it is the mural crown which i was awarded for having been the first soldier to scale the enemy walls from his pouch nicomedes produced a crown made of silver and molded to resemble a crenellated wall with towers such as might encircle a city he presented the crown to cornelia your son received it in a public ceremony before the troops and wore it at a place of honor at the victory feast he sent it home with me so that his mother might be the first in roma to see it the first to scale the walls whispered gaius gazing at the crown in his mothers hands the first roman inside carthage can you imagine how dangerous that must have been cornelia could well imagine and the thought made her lightheaded but she managed a smile and placed the crown atop gaiuss head it was too big for him and slipped over his eyes everyone laughed gaius angrily pushed the crown from his head it fell to the paving stones with a clatter thats not funny mother the crown wasnt meant for me hush gaius with a sigh cornelia bent down to retrieve the crown and placed it on her lap let us hear the rest of your brothers letter blossius please continue for your friend menenia i also have good news her son lucius fought bravely in the battle killed many of the enemy and sustained no injuries thank the gods cried menenia she reached for blossiuss hand but he was distracted by the letter he peered at it intently reading ahead his face was grim go on blossius said cornelia what else does tiberius write onlya bit of descriptionof the battle itself nothing of a personal nature very well lets hear it im not sure i should read this aloud in front of the boy or in front of you for that matter i suppose its a mark of tiberiuss deep respect for you that he should write to his mother as candidly as he might have written to his late father what were you just saying blossius about the worthiness of women its not a question of merit but ofdelicacy nonsense blossius if you wont read it aloud i will cornelia put aside the mural crown rose to her feet and took the tablet from him as for carthage she read the ghost of cato may finally rest the city which was as old as roma is now utterly destroyed the harbor is demolished the houses burned the altars for human sacrifice reduced to rubble the gardens have been uprooted the grand mosaics of the public squares have been flooded with pools of blood the men were slaughtered as long as we had strength to slaughter them the few who survive will become slaves so far as i know every woman was raped regardless of her age or status many were killed though they screamed for mercy such was the frenzy for destruction that overtook the victors the women and men who survived will be separated by sex and sold in slave markets hundreds of miles apart so that no carthaginian male and female may ever copulate again and thus the race will become extinct before they are sold their tongues will be removed so that their language and even the names of their gods will vanish from the earth the earth itself will be made barren salt is being plowed into the soil surrounding the city so that no crops can be grown for a generation salt was the precious substance that gave birth to roma long agoso blossius taught meso it is fitting that salt shall seal the burial of carthage when alexander conquered persia he chose to leave the city of babylon intact and to make its people his subjects for his clemency he was exalted by gods and men we have followed an older example that of the merciless greeks who sacked the city of troy and left only ruins behind the greek playwrights tell of many misfortunes that subsequently befell the victorious greeksajax ulysses agamemnon and the rest i pray the gods will favor what we have done to carthage and will grant a righteous destiny to the roman people who have done this fearful thing for the glory of jupiter her hands trembling cornelia put down the tablet if only i could have been there said gaius his eyes bright with excitement what a glorious day it must have been and now it shall never happen again because carthage is gone and i was too young to be there and therell never be another war with her i can hardly wait for tiberius to come home and tell me more about it menenia lowered her eyes war is the way of the world and always will be said blossius quietly clearly the gods of roma were greater than those of carthage for that we must be thankful and yeti am fearful for romas future how astute is tiberius when he points to the example of the greeks against troy i am reminded of the greek hero achilles who was very nearly invincible yet when he desecrated the corpse of the trojan hector the gods frowned upon his hubris and withdrew their protection and achilles died like any other mortal on the battlefield roma has entered a new era with the destruction of corinth the romans respect for greek culture degenerated to wanton looting with the destruction of carthage the romans are without rival in the mediterranean but how will roma bear the responsibilities of power and wealth unprecedented in the history of the world we must pray that the gods will give roma wise men to lead her into the futureand wise women to nurture those men as boys blossius menenia and cornelia each turned their eyes to young gaius inspired by visions of the carnage at carthage he had dared to pick up the mural crown and was testing its fit on his brow again oblivious of their scrutiny bc tiberius is headed for trouble mother serious trouble he has no idea of what hes up against i want nothing to do with it lucius pinarius who had the auburn hair and bright green eyes typical of many pinarii took a bite of boiled cabbage marinated in garum the dish served cold was a family favorite for a hot midsummer day blossius helped himself to a bit of the cabbage as well though it tended to give him indigestion though all cornelias children were now grown blossius still resided at her house but he spent much of his time here at house of menenia which was only a few steps away on the palatine it was unthinkable that menenia and blossiusa roman patrician and a philosopher from cumaeshould ever marry but their relationship had stood the test of time the widow and the stoic were growing gray together menenia ate none of the cabbage she had no appetite during hot weather it was her lament that during the entire month of sextilis she could eat nothing at all a slave behind her wafted a peacock fan to stir the languid air of the garden tiberius gracchus has always been your friend lucius she said you should be happy for him you might have looked upon his election to the tribunate as an opportunity for yourself instead over the last year youve deliberately avoided him what about this legislation he managed to enact setting up a commission to redistribute farmland you could have served on that commission if i wanted to end my career before its begun the whole thing will end in disaster not necessarily said blossius to be sure tiberius is taking a great gamble frankly his boldness astonishes me though it shouldnt hes the descendant of his grandfather after all and the son of his mother and the pupil of blossius snapped lucius you stoics are always claiming that the best form of government is not a republic but a just king youve put all sorts of dangerous ideas in tiberiuss head blossius held his temper but the cabbage began to rumble in his belly tiberius is a visionary if my teachings have inspired him i take pride in that accomplishment but will you suffer the consequences along with him when the whole enterprise collapses tiberius is the most beloved man in roma said blossius hes also the most hated man in roma countered lucius lucius blossius stop bickering the day is too hot for it menenia sighed now i want each of you to explain to me once again from your own point of view exactly what tiberius gracchus is attempting to do and why it holds the promise of such great successor failure blossius raised an eyebrow you feign ignorance my dear in an effort to make us defend our positions with logic rather than emotion you could summarize the situation as well as either of us menenia laughed if it will keep the two of you quiet i shall back in the days when our ancestors were conquering italy piece by piece roma acquired vast parcels of public land later on even more land was seized from the italian cities that went over to hannibal public policy has been to disburse this land to roman citizens and to allied italians as a reward for military service small farms keep the economy stable and they supply more soldiers since landowners are obliged to serve in the military to keep the holdings small and to make disbursements fair there have always been limits on how much land any single man can own but as the etruscan proverb goes money changes everything in my lifetime staggering amounts of gold and silver have poured into roma from conquered cities and provinces and as a result a very small group of citizens have become very very rich some of those men have found ways to circumvent the legal limits and have bought up vast tracts of public land along with slaves to work their enormous holdings as a consequence free men all over italy have been forced off the land and into the cities where they struggle to survive avoid raising families and have no obligation to serve in the army the situation benefits no one except a small number of enormously rich landholders the poor masses of italy are dispossessed of their land and the available manpower for the roman legions grows thin something must be done to take back the illegally acquired lands of the big owners and to redistribute that land to the people menenia looked pleased with herself there have i explained the general situation to the satisfaction of you both i couldnt have done it better myself said blossius though i might add that the ramifications of this situation go far beyond mere land management theres the current war in spaina gratuitous drawnout disastrous affairwhich has been repeatedly bungled by the ruling clique in the senate thats led to massive dissatisfaction in the ranks and the imposition of harsh and humiliating discipline im thinking of the instance when deserters from the spanish campaign were rounded up beaten and sold into slavery he looked longingly at the cabbage but decided to forgo another bite the huge influx of slaves has led to its own problems such as the massive revolt going on in sicily right now slaves are threatening to take over the entire island and this is only the latest and largest outbreak of violence by renegade slaves their numbers have grown to alarming proportions all over italy and many of them are terribly brutalized the situation grows more dangerous every day farmers pushed off the land too little respect and recompense for the common soldiery too many miserable desperate slaves the citizens of roma are demanding that something be doneand tiberius gracchus has declared that he is the man to do it only twentynine years old and already a tribune said menenia cornelia must be very proud lucius took this as a slight a smirk spoiled his handsome features having an important fatherinlaw helps appius claudius is probably the single most powerful man in the senate ah the claudii forever with us and their politics seem to grow more radical with each generation said blossius yes tiberius has a powerful ally in claudius but the big landholders will stop at nothing to hold on to their property weve seen how the game has played out so far tiberius put forward a proposal to redistribute land but it takes only one of the other nine tribunes to veto such a proposal and the landowners managed to persuade the tribune marcus octavius to do so lucius became increasingly agitated and now we come to the reason i want nothing to do with tiberius and his politics when octavius issued his veto tiberius called for octavius to be removed by popular vote and forced him from office but octavius refused to stand down whereupon one of tiberiuss freedmen forcibly dragged octavius from the speakers platform and in the scuffle that followed one of octaviuss servants was blinded now tiberiuss detractors are calling him an enemy of the people for having done what even coriolanus failed to do he forced a tribune from office tiberiuss action was entirely within the law whether the expulsion of octavius was legal or not i dont know what i do know is that tiberius resorted to violence yes he finally got his way his proposal became law to redistribute the land there must be a commission and whom does tiberius appoint to that powerful commission himself his fatherinlaw appius claudius and his younger brother gaius whos barely twentyone tiberius needed men he could trust insisted blossius it stinks of nepotism said lucius mother earlier you suggested that i might have secured a place on tiberiuss commission i assure you no power on earth could have persuaded me to do so and now we see tiberiuss latest gambit as you pointed out mother money changes everything king attalus of pergamum has died and his will leaves the whole of his kingdom to romathe lands that belonged to troy in ancient times will now belong to us the influx of wealth will be enormous normally all that gold and booty would go directly into the senates coffers but tiberius has a different idea he proposes that it should go directly to the people distributed along with the land allotments so as to pay for farm equipment and startup supplies his enemies call it public bribery on an unprecedented scale they accuse tiberius of aiming to make himself king never scoffed blossius at the very least tiberius is attempting a kind of revolution from the bottom up he challenges the supremacy of the senate by using the office of tribune to do things no tribune has ever done before i think its all terribly exciting said menenia why are you so convinced that tiberius will fail because mother his support grows weaker every day the common people whether it serves their interest or not have bought into the argument that tiberius impugned their sovereignty when he drove a rival tribune from office and if he thinks he can appropriate the wealth of pergamum for his own political purposes circumventing the senate hes truly playing with fire does tiberius want to be a king as his enemies say lucius turned his gaze to blossius he already holds court like one keeping a greek philosopher for an adviser blossius bristled my philosophy is greek but i am a nativeborn italian of noble campanian blood yes i was tiberiuss tutor when he was a boy if he still consults me as a man why not because roman magistrates do not consult greek philosophers about matters of statecraftunless they wish to look like greek tyrants i only repeat what tiberiuss enemies are saying they also ask when he arrived in roma to whom did the pergamene ambassador deliver the royal testament and the diadem and purple cloak of the late king attalus to the senate no he went straight to the house of tiberius not to anoint him king protested blossius the ambassador called on tiberius merely as a courtesy diplomatic ties between the gracchi and the house of attalus go back a generation it was thirty years ago that tiberiuss father headed a roman embassy to investigate charges of sedition against the late kings father and cleared him of all suspicion ever since then the royals of pergamum have maintained a special relationship with the gracchi whatever the explanation it looks suspicious blossius shook his head nonsense tiberiuss enemies will stoop to any slander to bring him down he stands up for the people and the landgrabbers say he wants to be the peoples king the voters should know better than to believe such lies well see what the voters think soon enough said lucius tiberius is running for a second term as tribune its clearly illegal for other magistrates to hold office two years in a row but not so for the tribunate said blossius there is a precedent for a standing tribune to remain in office if not enough new candidates stand for the ten positions in a given year is that what tiberius is plotting to keep his office by bribing or scaring away other candidates the others will stand down because the people will demand it lucius groaned with exasperation can you not see where all of this is headed if tiberius is allowed to stand for tribune again by invoking some technicality and if he wins his enemies will only grow more determined to stop him that means more violence if he loses hell lose the immunity of his office and his enemies will drag him into court on some trumpedup charge and send him into exile no matter what happens tiberius is in a very dangerous position a long silence followed finally broken by a sigh from lucius its not that i disagree with tiberiuss proposal to redistribute the land its a worthy objective it must be done and it will be doneeventually if only tiberius had taken a slower more gradual approach the greedy landholders would have opposed me just the same said a hoarse voice tiberius cried menenia she sprang up embraced the newcomer and gave him a kiss on the cheek where did you come from from speaking in the forum of course election day is coming i thought i might find blossius here tiberius gracchus had grown into a strikingly handsome man many who compared him to busts of his grandfather declared that he was even more goodlooking on this day he appeared a bit haggard the unceasing demands of his reelection campaign were taking a toll despite his fatigue he projected an aura that seemed larger than his physical presence that indefinable allure the greeks called kharisma the intimate setting of menenias garden seemed too small to contain him blossius rose and greeted him they exchanged a few hushed words then tiberius turned to lucius who had remained seated and silent i couldnt help but overhear some of your comments lucius ive grown accustomed to defending myself before my enemies perhaps i should spend more time explaining myself to my friends lucius stood and drew back his shoulders i meant no offense tiberius but here in my mothers house i make no secret of my misgivings i spoke freely in front of blossius and blossius defended me im sure but even blossius cant speak the words that come directly from my heart because even blossius has not experienced what i have experienced in the last year menenia might i have a little wine my throat is dry from speaking a slave brought him a cup at once tiberius drank thirstily but his voice was no less hoarse than before lucius a year ago when i began my first campaign for the tribunate i was little different from any other man running for the office i was looking for political advancement hoping to make a name for myself yes i believed in the speeches i was makingor should i say the speeches blossius wrote for meand the need for land reform better treatment of the soldiery and so on but the promotion of those goals was little more than a means to an end a way for me to find a constituency and began my ascent in the course of honor then i took a trip up and down the length of italy to see with my own eyes the situation in the countryside what i witnessed was appalling the rural areas have been virtually emptied of free men and their families its as if the whole peninsula was tilted by some titans hand and all those people went tumbling into roma and here they live piled on top of another you can hardly pass through the streets of the subura nowadays its become so crowded and after the countryside was depopulated of free men it was filled up againwith slaves tilling the rich farmland toiling in the vineyardswhole armies of foreignborn slaves working till they drop for the handful of rich men whove grabbed all the land i mean that quite literallythese slaves fall where they work and die there its not unusual to see a dead slave lying in a field while the others continue to work around him under the whip of a merciless foreman slaves have become so cheap so expendable theyre treated far worse than the livestock tiberius shook his head we all know this situation exists we all speak of the land problem in the abstract and worry over what might be done and argue points of policy but to see the reality firsthand traveling day after day through the countryside is a very different experience i was shaken to the core by what i saw but it was something else that truly changed me i said the countryside is depopulated of free men but thats not entirely true here and there you come across a small farmer whos somehow managed to hold on to his property tilling his fields the oldfashioned way the family members work side by side with a few slaves and everyone pulls together these little holdings have been surrounded by huge farms theyre like little islands of the roman countryside that once existed and because those small farmers acquired their land by military service or have sons currently enlisted in the legions youll often see a prized piece of armor or a replica of a legionary standard proudly displayed at the gate in a flash you see the connection between a thriving community of small farmers a strong army and a healthy vibrant roma passing such a small farm up in etruria i saw a placard mounted on the gate it said tiberius gracchus help us keep our land he smiled ruefully my name was misspelled and the letters were very crudely made but that sign sent a jolt sent through me and that was only the first sign i saw after that at every surviving small holding i passed even those far from the main roads i saw such placards tiberius gracchus restore public land to the poor tiberius gracchus stop the spread of slaves tiberius gracchus give us back our land and our work tiberius gracchus help us somehow news of my journey had spread from farm to farm mouth to mouth by the time i returned to roma tiberiuss voice was choked with emotion and had grown so hoarse that he could hardly continue to speak menenia brought him more wine he drank it and continued the mission ive undertaken is far greater than i am politicians come and go with their squabbling and slanders and shameless scrambling for advancement the destiny of roma is what matters and the fate of the roman people especially those who feed the city and fight for her who give their sweat and blood and the offspring of their loins for the glory of roma there followed a long silence at last blossius stepped forward there were tears in his eyes my dear boy i boast about having been your tutor but the student has far surpassed his teacher always you were clever always you were serious and disciplinedyet i never imagined that cornelias little boy would grow up to cast such a shadow over us all tiberius smiled wanly blossius i think youre slightly missing the point when i say that politicians come and go while the destiny of the people endures i mean just that i have no illusions about my importance or about my permanence except insofar as i may find a way to channel the power of the people for the benefit of the people and for the greater glory of roma of course well put blossius dabbed the sleeves of his tunic against his moist eyes but you say you came looking for me yes there are some purely practical matters i want to discuss appius claudius thinks i should propose shortening the term of military service ahead of the election he also thinks we should put forward the idea of allowing nonsenators to serve as judges this requires serious discussion perhaps at your mothers house of course menenia and lucius have put up with my ramblings long enough nonsense said menenia youre welcome in this house at any time tiberius you know i love to hear you speak but you must do something about that hoarseness an infusion of mint and honey in hot water can do wonders ill try it promised tiberius good day menenia and good day to you lucius he smiled but lucius merely nodded in response tiberius and blossius took their leave the garden suddenly seemed very quiet and still and somehow empty mother and son sat apart thinking their separate thoughts tiberiuss story of the placards in the countryside apparently so heartfelt left lucius unmoved to him it seemed that tiberius must be either a compulsive politician unable to stop emoting and speechifying even in a friends garden or else a genuine idealist blinded by visions of grandeur and indifferent to the terrible dangers ahead of him in either case tiberiuss passionate words made lucius feel more uneasy than ever menenia was thinking of her friend cornelia and how very differently their sons had turned out which was better to have a son who blazed a trail like a comet with all the brilliant uncertainty of celestial fire or to have a son as stolid and predictable as a lump of earth menenia had to admit that she envied cornelia at least for now but would she have reason to pity cornelia in the future if only the election for tribunes wasnt held in the middle of the summer complained tiberius thats precisely when my strongest supporters are away from roma searching for harvesting work in the countryside blossius do you think you could a fold of tiberiuss toga was refusing to hang correctly across one shoulder blossius straightened it its no accident that the elections take place when they do the philosopher observed the ruling families of roma have always arranged every aspect of every election in order to give themselves the greatest advantage and the common people the least but if the cause is just and the candidate is steadfast the will of the people will not be thwarted cornelia stepped into the room let me have a look at you tiberius her son obligingly stood back and struck a pose clutching the folds of his toga with one hand how splendid you look your father and grandfather would be very proud i only wish your little brother were here to see you gaius had been sent to scour the countryside for supporters and persuade them to return to roma for the election cornelia gave him a kiss on the cheek come along then the augur has arrived hes waiting for us in the garden stop rolling your eyes blossius i know what you think of religious formalities but this ritual must be observed for the sake of tradition tiberiuss father and grandfather would never have appeared before the voters on an election day without consulting an augur first in the garden the augur placed a cage with three chickens on the ground he circled the cage three times invoking the gods and the ancestors of tiberius gracchus he scattered grain on the ground some to the right and some to the left of the cage then opened the hatch the auspices would be determined by observing the motion of the birds whether they moved in a group or as individuals and in which direction to the right indicated the favor of the gods to the left indicated their disfavor but the chickens did not leave the cage they clucked and bumped against one another ignoring the open hatch the augur stamped his foot he made shooing motions eventually he gripped the top of the cage and gave it a good shaking finally one of the chickens emerged the bird ignored both scatterings of grain it lifted its left wing then turned around and scurried back into the cage the augur looked acutely embarrassed the auspicesare inconclusive he said cornelia frowned the left wing she whispered she felt a premonition of dread unfortunately said tiberius the science of augury is not as exact as we might wish a veil lies across the future the future shall arrive anyway mother and son exchanged a long look cornelia could see that tiberius was as uneasy as herself but she said nothing tiberius proceeded to the vestibule he paused to gaze at the images of his ancestors he touched the brow of the great africanus then nodded to the slave to open the door outside in the street a throng of supporters awaited him many had spent the night in front of the house taking turns sleeping and guarding the door in the final days of the campaign the rhetoric on both sides had grown so heated and the street scuffles between the factions so violent that many feared for tiberiuss safety there was a rumor that his enemies were conspiring to murder him before the election his opponents claimed that tiberius himself had started the rumor to whip up his supporters whatever the truth a great crowd awaited him in the street and when they saw him they erupted into cheering smiling broadly tiberius stepped forward he stumbled on the threshold and lost his balance staggering forward he stubbed the big toe of his left foot against a paving stone with such force that he thought he heard a bone crack at the very least the nail of the toe had been broken blood seeped through the front of his shoe and darkened the leather he felt faint and nauseated he reached for support found blossiuss arm and gripped it tightly youve hurt yourself whispered blossius did they see tiberius kept his face down and spoke through clenched teeth blossius scanned the cheering crowd no one seems to have noticed good then we shall go ahead as if it never happened but can you walk if i hold fast to your arm but first ill say a few words these men have been here all night waiting for this moment tiberius looked at the crowd and managed to smile he raised his hands for silence loyal supporters dear friends fellow romans the long night has passed and whatever mischief our enemies might have been planning we are all still alive this was met with a great deal of cheering and laughter you watched over me all through the night for that i thank you and in return in the second year of my tribunate i promise to do my very best to watch over all of youto restore to you the lands that are rightfully yours to protect you from the greedy landgrabbers and their vicious gangs and to make the roma of your children a fairer richer better place for all hardworking citizens to do all that i must win todays election and to win the election first and foremost i must stay alive the threat from our enemies is very real at any place and at any time i might be assaulted i dont fear a fight ive done my share of fighting i was the first to scale the walls of carthage and was awarded the mural crown i also fought in spain alongside many of you brave men but here in roma i am no longer a soldier but a private citizen i carry no weapons you must be my guardians without your protection i am defenseless well defend you cried a man in the front of the crowd if we have to well die for you tiberius gracchus he was joined by many others it will never come to that i pray to jupiter but if i should perceive an immediate threat and require a ring of brave men around me i may not be able to cry out to you my voice is hoarse and the din may be too great so this will be my signal tiberius raised both arms skyward then bent his elbows so that he pointed at his head with both hands the sign was unmistakable rally to the head the crowd began to clap and chant his name tiberius gripped blossiuss arm with one hand and waved with the other he walked forward trying not to wince at the pain perhaps its a good thing that i stumbled he whispered to blossius the auspices indicated a bad start now the bad start is behind me limping slightly despite blossiuss support tiberius set out for the capitoline where the voting would take place as he descended the palatine more supporters joined his retinue many more were waiting in the forum they opened a path for him cheering and reaching out to touch him as he passed by then joined the throng that followed behind him on the steps leading up to the capitoline tiberius paused before the arch of scipio africanus the monument was decorated with images of his grandfathers triumphs in both africa and asia scipio had survived the battle of cannae and shamed his fellow officers by his fortitude had lost the father whose life he had saved in battle and had matched wits with hannibal and beaten him tiberius laughed aloud at the absurdity that a stubbed toe should give him a moments pause he made a silent vow to ascend to the voting place without limping or leaning on blossius and to show no sign of pain he had passed under the arch and proceeded a short distance when he heard a noise from above screeching and beating their wings two ravens were fighting on the roof of a building next to the pathway to his left their altercation dislodged a roof tile the tile fell directly in front of tiberius and shattered with a loud noise tiberius flinched the augury the stumbleand now this he whispered one bad omen after another nonsense said blossius in his ear chickens behave like chickens people stub their toes every day ravens squabble tiberius if you start to see omens in every accident and happenstance you will indeed be putting on the airs of a king only a tyrant imagines the universe revolves around himself a raven dislodged a loose bit of tilenothing more tiberius nodded straightened his toga and continued the ascent the large open space before the temple of jupiter was already crowded when tiberius arrived with his retinue only plebeians could vote for the tribunes and they did so by first gathering into voting blocks called tribes even on the most peaceful of election days the polling officials were hardpressed to maintain order for their own protection and to hold back the unruly crowd they were allowed to carry spearshafts without metal points news of tiberiuss arrival was met with a tremendous uproar of mingled acclamation and jeering jostled this way and that some in the crowd retaliated by shoving back fistfights broke out the election officials scrambled to maintain order by brandishing their shafts over the centuries the assembly area had become so congested with shrines and statues and the number of voters had so increased that the simple procedure of assembling into tribes had become a logistical challenge elections could be won or lost depending on whether a candidates supporters were able to assemble when called on tiberiuss supporters had arrived early and in great numbers to claim the best spots for addressing the crowd and to maintain open pathways if the supporters of opposition candidates could be kept at the periphery of the voting area or excluded altogether tiberiuss chances would be increased with blossius at his side and surrounded by a cadre of his most ardent supporters tiberius was ushered through the crowd and escorted onto the steps of the temple of jupiter at the sight of him more cheering erupted from the center of the crowd and catcalls from the edges he had hoped to address the crowd but the unceasing din made doing so impossible he had never seen such a raucous election assembly the participants seemed to be in continuous motion shouting and gesturing scattered here and there especially around the periphery or in the tight spots where a statue or shrine made movement difficult skirmishes appeared to be taking place it was not unlike watching a battlefield some of the election officials growing exasperated were banging their shafts against the ground calling for order and demanding that the gathering of the tribes begin the voters were either unwilling to cooperate or unable to hear them the scene was chaotic a pathway opened in the crowd and one of tiberiuss supporters in the senate fulvius flaccus rushed toward him breathless with alarm tiberius ive just come from an emergency meeting of the senate all morning your enemies have been demanding that the consul scaevola declare todays election an illegal assembly illegal the people have the right to elect tribunes they claim the disorder is too great a menace to public safetyor worse worse your cousin scipio nasica says youre mustering a mob to bring down the state after you massacre your opponents in the senate youll declare yourself king nasica tiberius spat the word the two cousins both heirs to the bloodline of africanus despised each other there was no greater reactionary in the senate than nasica while tiberius had made himself the champion of the common people nasica made no secret of despising them even when he campaigned for their votes he could not resist insulting them i know better than you lot what is good for the state he had once shouted at an unruly crowd opponents joked that this was his idea of a campaign slogan and once shaking the horny palm of a farm laborer nasica had snidely commented how does one get such calluses do you walk on your hands blossius spoke up the consul scaevola is a good man indeed he is said flaccus hes refused to sanction any attempt to cancel the election but that hasnt stopped nasica if the consul wont act to save the state then private citizens must do sothats what nasica said he and a number of other senators gathered outside and then they were joined by a gang of cutthroatsthe roughest sort of men you can imagine armed with clubs they planned this ahead of time said blossius obviously said flaccus and now theyre coming this way with nasica leading them they mean to kill you tiberius they think theyre on a sacred missionthe senators have wrapped the red hem of their togas across their foreheads like priests about to carry out a sacrifice tiberiuss blood ran cold he stared at the unsuspecting crowd the signal cried blossius give the signal tiberius raised his arms in the air the movement drew the attention of the crowd with all eyes on him tiberius pointed to his head his supporters understood at once they seized the shafts carried by the election officials broke them in pieces and passed the fragments among themselves the longer sections could serve as cudgels and the splintered ends as daggers there were a number of benches throughout the assembly area they began to smash these as well to use the fragments as weapons tiberiuss opponents in the crowd took the signal to mean something else he points at his headhes demanding a crown men cried look at his followers gathering weaponsthey mean to take the capitoline by force theyll declare tiberius king amid the mounting chaos there was an even greater commotion at the entry to the assembly area nasica and his fellow senators with their gang of cutthroats had arrived a violent freeforall followed on the palatine and down in the forum and even on the far side of the tiber men could hear the sounds of combat atop the capitoline several of tiberiuss supporters ran to his side and offered him their weapons but he refused to take them instead he turned his back on the melee faced the temple of jupiter and raised his arms in prayer jupiter greatest of gods protector of my grandfather in battle blossius seized the folds of his toga and shouted at him go inside the temple run when they come for you claim jupiters protection blossius was struck across the belly by a club with the breath knocked out of him he fell to his knees hands converged on tiberius they grabbed his toga and pulled it off him wearing only his undertunic tiberius bolted up the steps of the temple limping because of his injured toe he tripped on a step and fell forward before he could get to his feet a cudgel struck his head and sent him reeling he blindly struggled to his feet and stood swaying for a moment another club swung with tremendous force struck his head and shattered his skull with a sickening crack blossius had just managed to get to his feet red gore and pale bits of brain spattered his robes he stood aghast and gaping at the bloody remains that lay crumpled on the steps one of the killers recognized him its the greek philosopherthe wouldbe kings adviser toss him from the tarpeian rock whooping and laughing they seized blossius by his hands and feet and carried him down the steps they headed toward the rock dodging clubs and hopping over corpses that littered the way they reached the precipice but instead of shoving him over they made sport of swinging him back and forth back and forth gaining momentum on the count of three onetwothree they released him and sent him hurtling into space for a brief moment blossius appeared to defy the earths pull he soared skyward then with a sickening twist in his gut he began to fall they had thrown him clear of the precipice under normal circumstances his downward plummet would have ended at the foot of the capitoline but many men had been pushed from the tarpeian rock before him a few of these men had managed to grab hold of the rock face and cling to the sheer cliff flailing frantically blossius grabbed the garments of one of these men and broke his fall almost at once he lost his grip and fell upon the next man down in such a manner grasping at one desperate man after another repeatedly breaking his fall and then falling again he descended the cliff more than once a man above him lost his grip and plummeted past him screaming at last drained of the last vestige of will overwhelmed with terror with nothing left to grasp blossius fell in earnest he landed not upon hard earth but upon a pile of bodies more bodies fell around him like hail dropping from the sky as night descended the killers gathered the bodies of the dead loaded them onto carts and wheeled them across the forum boarium to dump them in the tiber blossius gradually woke at first he imagined that he had been buried alive but the confining mass surrounding him was not earth but dead flesh the cart jerked and bumped beneath him sending a great throbbing soreness through every part of his body he would have groaned but he had no air in his lungs the pressure against his chest would not allow him to draw a breath from somewhere he heard muffled soundswomen sobbing and shrieking a woman cried out let me have my husbands body at least give me his body a harsh masculine voice ordered her back the cart came to a halt the world began to tilt the mass of flesh all around him shifted and gave way like a cliff disintegrating in a landslide he tumbled helplessly forward he was suddenly underwater the shock wrenched him to full consciousness sputtering flailing his arms he found the surface and sucked in a lungful of air the sky above was dark and full of stars the swiftly flowing current was littered with bodies in his dazed state he somehow sensed which was the farther shore and swam toward it again and again he collided with floating corpses one of them seemed to wrap its arms around him in a panic he struggled to free himself the man could not possibly be alive that was obvious from his smashed skull as blossius pulled free he glimpsed the dead mans face it was tiberius impulsively he reached for the body but it slipped away on the current its torso spinning its limbs bobbing as lifeless as a floating branch weary beyond hope and wracked with sobbing blossius pulled himself onto the riverbank and collapsed into oblivion if i had followed your advice dear motherif i had tied my fortunes to those of tiberiusjust imagine the consequences lucius pinarius nervously paced the garden now you must follow my advice drive this dangerous fool from our house he pointed at blossius who sat stripped to the waist patiently allowing menenia to tend to his many wounds with ointment and fresh bandages three days had passed since his brush with death but he was still badly shaken the entire city was reeling from the shock of the massacre on the capitoline at least three hundred men had been killed no man alive could remember anything like it for the first time since the fall of tarquinius and the precarious early years of the republic political strife had erupted in mass bloodshed with romans killing romans the careless desecration of the bodies was grossly offensive even to many who opposed tiberius and had caused widespread anger and resentment but the senatorial faction that had put an end to tiberius led by scipio nasica was unrepentant having gained the upper hand they had proceeded to order the arrest interrogation and execution without trial of anyone involved in what they called the gracchan sedition new names were constantly added to the list of suspects those arrested were tortured until they implicated others rumor and panic ruled the city the tiber was jammed with vessels taking men to ostia where they hoped to board ships to take them away from italy into exile blossius winced as menenia dabbed the stinging ointment onto a cut across his shoulder then he took her hand and kissed it your son is right he said i escaped the massacre on the capitoline and somehow so far nasicas henchmen have overlooked me but very soon theyll come for me there was a banging at the door blossius stiffened then stood and covered himself a troop of armed lictors came striding into the garden the senior of the lictors spared only a glance for lucius and his mother then glared at blossius here you are philosopher we went looking for you at the wouldbe kings house first isnt that your official address here in roma where you sponge off the daughter of africanus did you think you could escape us by hiding here or is this how you philosophers make a living going from the house of one lonely roman widow to another sucking up their wine and spilling your seed in their beds lucius bolted forward angrily but the lictor raised his club and lucius stepped back his mother was less timid she dabbed her fingertips in the jar of ointment then flicked them in the lictors face the man dropped his club and wiped the stinging unguent from his eyes bitch he shouted if you were anything but a woman that would count as an act of sedition and id see you stripped naked and flogged for it the man bent to retrieve his club rising up he struck blossius hard across the belly blossius bent double in pain a pair of lictors seized his arms and roughly escorted him from the garden menenia covered her face and began to weep the lictor leered at her are you going to miss the old stoic that much he looks a bit decrepit for stud service youre still a handsome enough mare surely you could find a strong young roman to mount you the man looked sidelong at lucius the insult was aimed as much at him as at his mother daring him to strike back lucius clenched his fists and bowed his head seething with outrage and shame as soon as the lictors had departed menenia gripped his arm follow them she pleaded do whatever you can for blossius mother theres nothing anyone can do then at least see where they take him and what they do to him i wont be able to stand it if he simply vanishes and i never know what happened please lucius i beg you unable to stand her sobbing lucius ran from the house his heart pounding he followed the lictors at a safe distance and watched as they entered house after house on the palatine arresting one man after another the prisoners were tied together and herded in single file down a winding path to the forum following the captives lucius witnessed a sight that seemed more appropriate to a nightmare than to the forum in broad daylight while a circle of welldressed men some of them senators looked on and jeered lictors forced a man in tattered bloody garments into a wooden box that was scarcely big enough to contain him before they closed the lid they emptied a jar full of writhing vipers inside even muffled by the box the mans screams echoed across the forum the circle of watchers banged on the box with sticks and laughed the captives were dragged before an openair tribunal lucius joined the crowd of spectators standing toward the back and trying not to draw attention the judges on the platform included scipio nasica who led the questioning blossius was the first prisoner to be interrogated you are blossius of cumae the stoic philosopher said nasica you know i am simply answer the question there is one protocol for questioning citizens and another for foreigners are you blossius of cumae i am you call me a foreigner but im a nativeborn italian italy is not roma nonetheless i am of noble campanian blood nasica raised an eyebrow yes the tribunal is well aware of your ancestors among the blossii who betrayed roma and induced their fellow campanians to take up arms with hannibal blossius sighed that was a very long time ago perhaps you come from cumae do you not yes as i said italy is not romaand cumae can scarcely be considered part of italy cumaeans speak greek they practice greek vices they send philosophers to spread polluted greek ideas here in roma when tiberius gracchus was a boy i taught him virtue not vice when he became a man i offered him counsel and guidance the tribunal has no interest in your dubious career we are investigating a very real sedition not your imaginary philosophy we are chiefly interested in learning what you know about the activities of the wouldbe king tiberius gracchus and his recent attempt to overthrow the state this is absurd there was no such attempt were you present when tiberius gracchus met with the pergamene ambassador who delivered the royal testament of the late king attalus i was and did you witness tiberius gracchus receive the diadem and purple cloak of the king yes but did he not put the diadem his head perhaps briefly as a sort of joke did you not at the behest of tiberius gracchus draw up a ledger for disbursing the treasure bequeathed to roma by king attalus that ledger was purely hypothetical and contingent upon i realize blossius that you are not used to answering questions with a simple yes or no how you philosophers love to hear yourselves speak perhaps to expedite this testimony i should order your tongue to be removed then you can answer by tapping your foot on the groundonce for yes twice for no blossius turned pale the spectators erupted in laughter standing among them lucius cringed and longed to make himself invisible as the interrogation continued it became clear that nasicas purpose was not so much to incriminate blossius as to bolster his own rationale for taking action against tiberius to one leading question after another he compelled blossius to answer yes or no from your answers i believe the tribunal must conclude that any and all crimes you committed against the roman state were carried out at the behest of tiberius gracchus is that correct blossius sighed how can i answer such a question i shall restate it any action you undertook affecting the roman state you undertook at the behest of tiberius gracchus yes or no yes very well one final question what if tiberius gracchus had ordered you to set fire to the capitoline would you have done so this is madness tiberius would never have given such an order answer the question blossius gritted his teeth if tiberius had ordered such a thing then it would have been the right thing to do because tiberius never gave an order that was not in the best interest of the people nasica sat back and crossed his arms making a great show of his disgust there you have itthe philosopher speaks and we can see just how corrupt and insidious his ideas truly are my questioning is done is there any man present who wishes to offer testimony on behalf of the accused he gazed at the spectators lucius lowered his face and hid himself in the crowd the judges on the platform conferred briefly then nasica rose and addressed the spectators we declare that blossius of cumae has testified freely and truthfully regarding the recent sedition perpetrated by tiberius gracchus we further declare that blossius has by his own words discredited himself his teachings and anyone who was ever his pupil if he were a citizen he would be put to death for treason but since he is merely a foreigner he will be exiled from the city for life he is free to depart from this tribunal he must leave roma before sunrise or else face immediate execution bring forth the next prisoner not a single question about my beliefs not a single accusation having anything to do with stoicism or the values i taught tiberius the arrogance of those men i blossius of cumae am too insignificant even to bother executing blossius had packed his belongings at the house of cornelia he had come to menenias house to say goodbye i should go with you theres nothing for me here menenias voice was dull and lifeless the terror of blossiuss arrest the relief that he had been set free and then the cruel news of his exile had utterly worn her out nonsense said blossius your son is here did we not conclude once upon a time that a womans greatest role is to be a mother that was cornelias conclusion not mine cornelia needs your friendship more than ever the loss of tiberius has devastated her menenia shook her head i should go with you no beloved exile is not for you lucius stood nearby saying nothing he had been right and here was the prooftiberiuss radical politics had ended in disaster for himself and all those associated with him but being right gave lucius no satisfaction he felt only shame and bitterness where will you go blossius asked menenia first ill take a boat downriver to ostia in the dead of night blossius grunted thats when traffic on the river is busiest these days i wont be the only man fleeing the city at ostia ill board the first ship heading east there must be some monarch somewhere in greece or asia wholl offer me asyluma man whos sympathetic to stoic teachingsa man whos unafraid of roma a fool you meanlike you thought lucius but he bit his tongue and said nothing bc lucius pinarius took the letter from his mothers trembling hand it was written in greek on parchment of the highest quality lucius read slowly paying careful attention to every word from blossius to menenia greetings and deepest affections what a comfort your letters are to me like salve on a wound any day that a messenger arrives with a missive from you is a day of celebration for me i am glad to hear that you and lucius are both in good health i am glad that your sons business prospers there must be much money to be made as a state contractor especially in the building trade thank you for sending news of cornelia that she remains in mourning three years after the death of tiberius is in my opinion entirely fitting the nature of her sons death the desecration of his body and the outrageous aftermath all justify a longer period of mourning than is customarily considered seemly but tiberiuss brother you say no longer wears black well gaius is a young man and must get on with his life i have mixed feelings about his apparent decision to withdraw completely from political life and to devote himself like lucius entirely to moneymaking in some ways gaiuss potential as a leader actually surpassed that of his brother what a waste that he should forgo the course of honor but after seeing what was done to tiberius who can blame him for pursuing a different destiny i wonder though whether gaius will not eventually find himself drawn back to public life the lure of politics is so strong in his blood as for my career i am proud to report that king aristonicus takes me deeper into his confidence every day yes i proudly call him king though the romans refuse to recognize his status and brand him a rebel the will of the late king attalus was rendered null and void when general aristonicus claimed the throne of pergamum by both force of arms and moral authority how peeved the roman senators must be to see their dreams of laying hands on the treasury of pergamum dashed their greed for that treasure was one of their reasons for murdering tiberius king aristonicus is a remarkable man i have every confidence that with my counsel he will attain the stoic ideal of a just king we speak often of the new capitol he dreams of foundingwe will call it heliopolis city of the sunin which all men of all classes including slaves shall be free aristonicus is also a military genius thank the gods he will boldly defend his claim to the throne of pergamum against roman arms when he is seen to prevail there is hope that other leaders across asia and greece will rise up and break the grip of roma and its corrupt republic the only hope for the rest of the world is to resist romas domination at every turn but here i am rattling on about politics forgive me my love without you beside me i have little else to think about my life is out of balance the part of me that is most essentially alivea corporeal man capable of love desire tears and laughteris shriveled and withered like a once sturdy vine ripped from the rich moist earth how i miss you your words your face the music of your voice the warmth of your body perhaps somedayin heliopoliswe shall be together again but that time is not yet alas as always i urge you to destroy this letter immediately after you read it resist any temptation to save my letters for sentimental reasons burn them i do the same with every letter i receive from you though afterward my tears fall among the ashes this is for your safety not mine we have seen to our sorrow just how ruthless the enemies of virtue have become and how they can turn the words of the virtuous against them all my love to you lucius lowered the parchment with a shudder he was not sure which offended him mostthe stoics snide backhanded compliment on luciuss moneymaking pursuits his typically selfsatisfied fawning over the upstart aristonicus or his salacious metaphors regarding himself and menenia a sturdy vine ripped from the rich moist earth indeed promise me mother that youve done exactly as hes instructed youthat youve destroyed every letter hes ever sent you menenia looked up at him with tears in her eyes she drew her eyebrows together she shrugged with one shoulder by hercules and hades you didnt burn them did you youve kept them not all only a few whispered menenia only the mostpersonal there was nothing in any of the letters ive saved that could possibly any letter from blossius is dangerous mother dont you understand we must destroy anything that establishes a continuing link between him and us since he left roma and especially since he joined with aristonicus the content doesnt matteralthough this latest letter could hardly be more damning where are the letters you saved fetch them now do it yourselfdont send a slave bring them here at once ill stoke the fire in the brazier left alone in the garden for a moment lucius bowed his head and allowed his arms to drop to his side his knees turned to water for a moment he thought he might collapse for his mothers sake he had put on a mask showing only anger concealing the panic that had been welling up inside him ever since he crossed the forum that morning and heard the news from pergamum aristonicus the pretender had been captured his forces were annihilated the kingdom of the late attalus and its immense treasury had been secured at last by roman arms the roman commander marcus perperna was already boasting of the triumph he would enjoy when he would parade aristonicus naked through roma publicly whip him till he begged to die then strangle him in the dank prison cell of the tullianum hearing the news lucius rushed home brusquely told his mother that aristonicus was defeated and demanded to see any scraps of correspondence from blossius he had not told her the news about blossius so far either because she was too shocked or too frightened to ask his mother had not inquired how lucius dreaded the moment menenia returned with a few pieces of parchment from their muchhandled condition lucius could see that she had reread them countless times sighing he took the letters from her youre certain these are all the letters every one yes lucius we must pray to the gods that blossius did as he told you and burned every one of your letters to him as well one by one lucius laid the letters upon the flames he and his mother watched them ignite and then crumple into ashes all his lettersall his wordsgone menenia whispered she braced herself and blossius blossius is dead mother he did the wise thing the dignified thing if they had captured him lucius quailed at uttering the words aloud torture humiliation lingering death he cleared his throat rather than face capture he killed himself he died like a roman he died like a stoic menenia closed her eyes the heat given off by the burning lettersthe last vestige of blossiuss existence on earthwarmed the tears on her cheeks lucius gazed at his mother whatever he had thought of blossius he was moved by her grief as on the day blossius left lucius felt no sense of vindication only deep shame and sorrow bc when i was a boy said gaius gracchus smiling at his listeners my old tutor blossius made me read every line of euripides dear old blossius not much of euripides has stayed with me im sorry to say except a few lines from his play the bacchae the gods have many guises the gods bring crises to climax while man surmises the end anticipated has not been consummated but god has found a way for what no man expected so ends the play well my dear friends the play is far from over its just beginning but already the gods have found a way for what no man expected nine years ago when my brother tiberius died who among us could possibly have foreseen this day gaius paused to allow these words to sink in silently he counted to ten the deliberate welltimed pause was an orators technique that tiberius had taught him you go too fast little brother stop now and then especially after youve said something clever or thoughtful catch a breathcount to tenallow your listeners to think and feel for a moment gaius was not in the forum haranguing a motley crowd of citizens but in the lamplit garden of his mothers house on the palatine addressing an intimate gathering of his most ardent supporters this was a victory celebration gaius gracchus who had sworn off politics forever after his brothers death had just been elected tribune of the plebs following in tiberiuss footsteps well maybe my mother could have foreseen it gaius nodded to cornelia who reclined on a couch nearby not a day of my childhood passed when i was not exhorted to live up to the example of my grandfather and yet its my mothers example that most inspires me that sets the greatest challenge for me was there ever a mortal of either sex who possessed such fortitude and courage all of you join me in saluting hercornelia daughter of africanus wife of tiberius gracchus who was twice consul and whose statue stands in the forum mother of tiberius the peoples martyr cornelia smiled so graciously that an observer might have thought she had never heard such words before in fact she had appeared alongside gaius countless times during the campaign all over roma and up and down the countryside playing the proud mother and beaming recipient of her sons extravagant tributes gaiuss supporters adored cornelia they adored gaius for adoring her in the final days of the campaign the crowds who came to hear gaius had increased beyond all expectations even tiberius at the peak of his popularity had never mustered such multitudes when election day arrived such a throng poured into roma to vote that the inns could not accommodate them men slept in trees by the roadside and on rooftops one result of the gracchan massacre had been a relocation of the voting area elections were no longer held atop the cramped capitoline but on the field of mars outside the city walls where there was plenty of room for the tribes to assemble structures resembling sheepfolds were built so that voters could pass through one at a time to cast their votes but even these new accommodations proved inadequate for the number of voters who turned out to support gaius more than once the crush had threatened to erupt in a riot but in the end the voting was concluded without bloodshed gaius had emerged a clear victor with a mandate to carry out a platform of reforms even more radical than those of his brother after saluting cornelia gaius turned his gaze to another who sat nearby and let us not forget my dear friend lucius pinarius not even he foresaw my return to politics yet when i decided to run for tribune this man devoted himself and his considerable fortune completely to my campaign lucius represents a powerful new force in this city the class of men we call equestrians after our forefathers tradition of rewarding their finest warriors with a charger at public expense these days men are admitted to the equestrian ranks by the censor and their distinction is not horsemanship or valor but the accumulation of wealth they are men of means who have chosen to forgo the course of honor and so they form an elite class distinct from the senate so fine a businessman is lucius pinarius that i swear commerce must be in his blood just as politics is in mine the equestrians of roma who work hard and risk their fortunes to make this a more prosperous city are the future the idle senators who consume more wealth than they createand who look down their noses at the rest of usrepresent the dead past lucius is a builder responsible for construction projects throughout the city he has a devoted wife and a young son and all the worldly success a man could wish for weve been business partners for many years lucius and i we know each other so well that we finish each others sentences quipped lucius indeed and yet when i decided to make the run for tribune no one was more surprised than lucius and no one was more surprised than i when lucius took the headlong plunge into politics right beside meor behind me i should say since he prefers to play the role of mover and shaker behind the scenes salute him with me all of youlucius pinarius distinguished equestrian friend financial supporter trusted confidante unlike cornelia lucius was unused to being praised in public he was now over forty but he blushed like a boy all the world knew gaiuss story the trauma of tiberiuss murder the withdrawal from the public arena the eventualnow triumphantreturn to politics but no one knew luciuss story except lucius himself he alone knew the tangled emotions that had led him to this night the shame of his inaction before and after tiberiuss murder had never ceased to gnaw at him his career had provided a lucrative distraction family life had brought many rewards his status as an equestrian had given him great satisfaction but all these accomplishments had done nothing to assuage his sense of failure he had found redemption only by following gaiuss lead throwing caution to the wind and thumbing his nose at the reactionary forces that had destroyed his mothers happiness and his own sense of selfworth beside lucius sits his mother the virtuous menenia beside her is my lovely wife licinia said gaius i thank both of you for sitting up with my mother on all those nights when i was late getting home after buying a round of wine for the voters his wife coyly cocked her head but gaius beloved did you have to buy a round every night for every voter in every tavern in roma this elicited genial laughter from the guests and calls for more wine my friends i could spend the whole night publicly acknowledging each one of you and thanking every voter by name but this is a victory party and you are going to hear a victory speech youve heard all my pledges already i know but heres the difference before you heard them from a mere candidate now youre hearing them from a newly elected tribune of the plebs gaius waited for the thunderous ovation to die down first regarding the military i propose that the state pay to clothe its soldiers instead of requiring them to do so at their own expense i further propose that no one under the age of seventeen should be required to serve most important new colonies must be established to provide fresh homesteads for our veterans brave men aimlessly wander the streets men who gave years of service and risked life and limb for the promise of a better life that promise must be fulfilled for the common good i propose that the state should set the price of grain im not saying that people should be given free grain as my opponents assert but grain at a reasonable price stabilized by subsidies from the treasury and the building of granaries in the city to stockpile a surplus if the state cannot make food affordable for a working citizen and his family then what is the state good for i propose a massive program of roadbuilding overseen by qualified equestrians and employing ablebodied citizens not slaves the treasury is bloated from foreign conquests why let that money sit idle when we can put it in the hands of the workers and get new better roads in return there must also be reform in the courts since time immemorial senators alone have held the right to sit in judgment over the rest of the citizenry they run the civil and the criminal courts they even judge themselves when a provincial governor is charged with extortion his fellow senators determine his innocence or guilt to the pool of three hundred senators eligible to serve as judges i propose adding three hundred equestrians the court system will receive a badly needed shakeup and perhaps we will begin to see true accountability this my friends sums up the program that was overwhelmingly endorsed by the voters today we shall win over the poorer citizens with the grain subsidy state employment and new colonies we shall win over the wealthy equestrians with lucrative public contracts and new judicial privileges pity the poor senatorsthey shall have nothing left but their dignity the guests warmly applauded someone shouted what about land reform gaius grimaced then forced a brittle smile yes what about land reform well over the last nine years much of the necessary redistribution of land has already been carried out ironic isnt it my brother tiberius saw the overwhelming need for land reform he bravely spoke for it pressed for itand for doing so he was murdered then his murderers realized that reform was inevitableeither that or a revolutionand the next thing you know the cynical vipers were paying lipservice to tiberiuss goals watering down his legislation and slapping their own names on it then patting themselves on the back and congratulating one another for saving the republic gaiuss voice had risen to a shrill pitch a servant standing behind him raised a pipe to his lips and blew a low note the tension in the room was replaced by laughter and scattered applause gaius visibly relaxed he smiled turned about and put his arm around the short balding pipe player you all know licinius hes one of my wifes freedmen licinius helps me practice an orators trick my brother taught me whenever i start to get a little out of handtoo emotional too heatedlicinius blows a note on his pipe and i rein myself in he has me well trained dont you think gaius gave the man a kiss on his bald pate the guests crowed with laughter well then back to my speech we come to the capstone the most ambitious project of all to extend full citizenship to all of romas allies throughout italy for years weve witnessed abuses by roman magistrates against the subject people of italy who pay taxes and fight in the legions alongside us but without the privileges of full citizenship give them that gift and roma will acquire a massive influx of loyal new citizensand those new voters will remember the tribune who gained their rights for them with such a power base that tribune could guide roma to her highest destiny gaius lowered his eyes when i was a boy blossius taught me about the golden age of athens and about the great leader who made that golden age possible a man of extraordinary vision called pericles roma for all her achievements has yet to enter her golden age but with this election i pray to the gods that roma has at last found her pericles lucius listening drew a sharp breath this was a new rhetorical flourish gaius had never before spoken of a golden age or compared himself to pericles this was heady stuff it hinted at ambitions far beyond those of tiberius listening to such talk lucius felt a thrill of excitement but also a tremor of apprehension glancing at the faces of his mother licinia and cornelia he saw the same mixed reaction gaius ended on a somber note everywhere i traveled in the campaign for tribune men asked me two questions what persuaded you to enter the campaign and do you not fear the same fate that befell your brother to those citizens and to you here tonight i give this answer it was a dream that stirred me to put aside fear and sloth and to stop hiding from the world in the dream tiberius called my name he said to me brother why do you tarry theres no escaping destiny one life and one death is appointed for us bothspend the one and meet the other and do both in the service of the people all the guests had heard this story before during the election campaign still hearing it again on this joyous occasion they broke into rapturous applause many shed tears his victory speech concluded gaius walked among the guests making a point to personally thank each one then he withdrew to a quiet corner with his mother his wife menenia and lucius how polished youve become said menenia do you know i think youre an even finer orator than your brother was if only blossius could hear you its sweet that you honor him in your speeches but it does give me a shiver said cornelia to hear that story about your dream of tiberius to speak so lightly of death its a great story mother you saw how they loved it i get that same reaction every time i tell it besides its true i really did have such a dream and it changed my life but to prophesy your own death theres no oracular vision involved of course ill die serving the people perhaps while making a speech in the forum perhaps while leading an army on the battlefield perhaps while sleeping in my bed perhaps tomorrow or perhaps in fifty years like tiberius im a patriot and a politician how else can i die except in the service of roma oh gaius such cynicism cornelia wrinkled her nose but she was clearly relieved by his glib answer lucius too was secretly relieved perhaps gaiuss cynicism was exactly the quality that would keep him alive bc but where is everyone lucius circled the peristyle gazing across the overgrown garden and into the various rooms surrounding it gaiuss new house in the subura was larger but not as lovely as the ancestral house of the gracchi on the palatine for his second consecutive term as tribune gaius had deliberately chosen to move away from his mother and away from the palatine with its opulent residences for his new home he had picked a rambling but ramshackle house in the downtrodden subura district so he could situate himself and his headquarters among the common citizens who most strongly supported him lucius understood his friends political motivation for the move but still he found the neighborhood depressing with prostitutes on every corner maimed war veterans begging in the streets and a miasma of unpleasant odors and why was the house so empty where were the state contractors and engineers the foreign ambassadors the magistrates soldiers and scholars who had typically thronged the house on the palatine during gaiuss first year as tribune when his relentless legislative program and unflagging energy established him as the most powerful force in the state theyll be back said gaius emerging from behind one of the columns of the peristyle he sounded uneasy and tired he had just returned from several weeks at the site of carthage where he had gone to lay the groundwork for a new roman colony a generation had passed since tiberius won the mural crown for scaling the enemy walls the salted fields around the razed city had become fertile again the new roman colony was to be called junonia how did things goat junonia lucius asked you sound a bit wary lucius what have you heard lucius shrugged rumors and not good ones ill wager gaius sighed i must confess the taking of the auspices at the foundation ceremony went badly high winds broke the standards and blew away the sacrifices on the altars that damned wind the priest said he could hear hannibals laughter in it andone hears that wolves ran off with the city boundary markers said lucius that is a downright lie put about by my enemies snapped gaius he shut his eyes and drew a breath where is licinius with that pipe of his to calm me the important thing is that despite all obstacles carthage is being reborn as a colony of roma he smiled therell be plenty of work for you down there lucius if you ever run out of roadbuilding projects here in italy what have you been up to while i was away lucius considered his reply glad for a change of subject then laughed out loud if you have something to laugh at said gaius then by hercules share it with me very well a few days ago i was down in the forum boarium there was a long line of men and women queued up with vouchers to purchase their share from the state grain supply who should i see standing patiently in the line but that old toad piso frugi piso frugi i dont believe it the very senator who argued most vehemently against establishing the grain subsidy i stood there gaping at him for a bit then i finally asked him how dare you benefit from a law you so bitterly opposed and what did he say the old miser blinked at me then turned up his nose if that thief gaius gracchus had stolen all my shoes and divided them among the citizenry and the only way to get back even a single shoe was to stand in line with everyone else id do so purely as a matter of principle instead he pilfers the treasury to buy grain for his minions so yes ill stand in this line because i intend to get back whatever share i can gaius shook his head unbelievable have you noticed how the men who argue most loudly against public benefits always elbow their way to the front of the line when those benefits are handed out my thought exactly what else has happened in roma while i was away gaius spoke lightly but the look in his eyes lent weight to the question when lucius hesitated to answer he grunted in exasperation come lucius tell me the worst its livius drusus isnt it what has that vile backstabber been up to the trouble with gaiuss fellow tribune had begun before gaius left for africa gaiuss departure should have been marked by a crowning achievement the popular assemblys approval of a law extending citizenship to romas italian allies but at the last moment the tribune livius drusus who had always supported gaiuss reforms held rallies against the legislation appealing in the basest way to the mobs selfinterest do you think its hard now finding a good spot at the theater he asked just wait until all the italians come to town to enjoy our festivals do you like standing in long lines at the public feasts or queuing for the grain subsidy then youll love it when all those italians slip ahead of you would you have every one of your privileges diluted just so gaius gracchus can curry favor with his new friends when drusus vetoed the legislation he did so with popular support it was a stinging defeat for gaius on the eve of his departure drusus hasnt been idle in your absence admitted lucius in fact hes been relentless in his efforts to undermine your support people say he outgracchuses gaius gracchus explain first he proposed establishing colonies for veterans on even more generous terms than those which you proposed then he accused you of exploiting the poor what because your laws charge the people rent if they wish to farm state land the rent is nominal it was a necessary concession to gain broader support for the law drusus proposes legislation that allows the poor to farm state land free of charge and what do the hidebound reactionaries in the senate say to that they support drusus at every turn dont you see drusus is their straw man by outgracchusing you he steals your supporters temporarily your enemies are willing to legislate against their own selfish interests to throw a few bones to the common people but once ive been neutralized theyll be free to spit in the peoples faces and proceed as before exactly sadly the common citizens seem unable to see through drususs facade theyve been won over by his blatant pandering gaiuss shoulders sagged he looked utterly exhausted in my first year as tribune nothing could go wrong in my second year nothing has gone right i can only hope that in my third year a third term as tribune gaius thats not possible you were allowed a second year only because of the legal technicality tiberius hoped to exploitnot enough men ran to fill all ten positions to pull that off required the cooperation of men who would normally have been your rivals and the same thing will happen again this year because the people will demand it lucius thought otherwise but held his tongue bc theyll goad me to violence if they can thats what they want to corner me dishonor me drive me to such desperation that ill strike back then they can destroy me and claim they did it for the sake of roma gaius nervously paced the pathway beneath the peristyle circling the overgrown garden of his house in the subura since failing to win a third term as tribune his position had grown increasingly precarious the election was a farce he said rife with illegalities this is old ground gaius weve covered it many times before the past cant be undone lucius who had never been one to pace was as still as the column he leaned against his fretting took place inside unseen when would gaius stop going on about the stolen election the hard fact was that his support had waned considerably by election day the undermining strategy of his enemies had worked just as they planned after the election during his final days in office gaiuss influence had continued to dwindle his frustration had given way to recklessness i admit it was a mistake a crucial mistake when i ordered my supporters to demolish the wooden seats erected for that gladiator match i had good reason to do so a paid seating area for the rich obscures the view of the poor but you resorted to violence property was damaged no one was hurt not seriously you incited a riot gaius you played into the hands of your enemies they call you a dangerous rabblerouser a violent demagogue lucius sighed they had been over this ground many times before now that gaius was out of office his enemies were systematically repealing the laws he had passed erasing his accomplishments today had brought the worst news yet the senate was scheduled to debate revoking the charter to establish junonia the colony that was to have been gaiuss most enduring monumentestablishing forever a link from his grandfather the conqueror of hannibal to his brother the first to scale the walls of carthage to himself the founder of junoniawas to be abandoned gaius was bitter he was also fearful he had become convinced that his enemies would settle for nothing less than his blood is it true what people are saying about corneliascharity said lucius what are you talking about your mother set up a program to bring unemployed reapers from the countryside into roma to look for work everyone knows that even piso frugi didnt object the reapers provide cheap labor some say the program is only a pretext a way to swell the number of your loyal supporters in the cityjust in case in case of what the violence that both sides are preparing for lucius looked over his shoulder some of the reapers were in gaiuss house at that very moment milling about restless armed with staves and scythes whats going to happen gaius whatever it is youre well out of it lucius you never share your plans with me anymore ever since you returned from junonia youve shut me out you hold meetings without me you demolished the stands at the gladiator match without a word to me i knew nothing in advance of cornelias program to help the reapers if ive shut you out of my counsels lucius ive done it for your own good people no longer speak of us in the same breath if youre lucky theyll forget that you were once my strongest supporter among the equestrians youre a businessman not a politician lucius youre outside the course of honor you pose no real threat to my enemies in the senate why should you suffer my fate im your friend gaius you were also tiberiuss friend yet you never raised a finger to help him or blossius for that matter lucius drew a sharp breath desperation brought out a petty spiteful side of gaiuss nature when fortuna favored you gaius i enjoyed the pleasures of your friendship fortuna may have turned her back on you but i never will gaius shrugged then come with me now where to the forum theres to be a protest against the motion to abandon junonia gaius seemed to receive a burst of fresh energy he strode about the house shouting and gathering his entourage everybody up on your feet what are we waiting for enough idleness lets head for the senate house on an impulse lucius stepped quickly into gaiuss study and reached for a wax tablet and a stylus gaius was still the greatest orator of his generation on this occasion he might utter something that should not be forgotten the metal stylus was a formidable instrument elegantly made but quite solid and heavy in luciuss hand and sharply pointed at one end the day was hot and oppressively humid with thunder in the air as gaius and his entourage approached the senate house they saw a tall angular man leaving by a side door carrying a shallow bowl the man was quintus antyllius a secretary to the consul opimius the bowl he carried was full of goat entrails before the start of each days business the senate witnessed a ritual sacrifice and the examination of the animals organs by an augur the augury was done antyllius was disposing of the entrails as he passed by antyllius smirked at gaius and his followers get out of my way street trash make way for a decent citizen the insult pricked at the outrage lucius normally held in check blood pounded in his temples his face turned hot who do you dare to call trash he demanded this piece of dung antyllius gestured at gaius using the bowl entrails sloshed out and spattered gaiuss toga gaius wrinkled his nose and gave a start which caused antyllius to shriek with laughter without thinking acting purely on impulse lucius sprang forward he plunged the metal stylus into antylliuss chest men gasped antyllius dropped the bowl entrails spattered everywhere causing the bystanders to scurry back antyllius clutched the stylus and tried to pull it from his chest but the polished metal was too slippery with blood the front of his toga turned red he convulsed and fell backward cracking his head on a paving stone gaius gaped at the dead body then at lucius unable to believe his eyes someone in the street had witnessed the murder and ran inside to tell the senators soon they came rushing out some from the main entrance some from the side door all converging on gaius and his entourage at their head was the consul opimius when he saw the body of antyllius his first expression was outrage this was quickly followed by a look of barely suppressed elation murderer he shouted glaring at gaius youve killed a servant of the senate while he was carrying out a sacred duty the man threw bloody entrails on a tribune of the plebs shouted gaius did you put him up to it youre not a tribune any longer youre just a madmanand a murderer men on both sides began to shout insults one of gaiuss men ran to bring his supporters who were mustering at the front of the senate house when those men began to arrive some of the senators thought they were being deliberately encircled they panicked fistfights broke out a flash of lightning illuminated the scene with a garish light gaius screamed at his men to remain peaceful but his words were swallowed by a deafening crack of thunder a moment later the sky opened hard rain pelted the crowd fierce winds whipped though the forum the rioters scattered and dispersed raised on history books lucius remembered a tale from the citys earliest days and felt a shiver of dread romulus the first king had vanished in a blinding storm gaius had been accused of wanting a crown and here was a storm the likes of which lucius had never seen before lucius did not know the role that a previous pinarius had played in the death of romulus but he knew that his mad impulsive act had sealed the fate of gaius gracchus the next day lucius did something he had done only once before he wore the family fascinum occasionally as a child he had seen his mother wear it when lucius became a father menenia had ceremoniously passed the heirloom on to him she explained its great antiquity and the little she knew of its origin and she spoke of its power as a talisman to ward off evil lucius wore it on the day he received it purely to please his mother then put it away and forgot about it but that night as the storm continued to rage the fascinum appeared in his dreams hovering before a great fire when lucius awoke he searched for it among a tangle of castoff adornments he kept in a strongbox he put the chain over his neck the gold talisman concealed beneath his tunic and toga was cold against his breast lucius was not a particularly religious man but if the fascinum possessed any protective powers whatsoever of all the days of his life this was surely the day to wear it to reach the house of gaius in the subura lucius had to cross the forum from the direction of the senate house he heard echoes of shouting and weeping a crowd was mourning quintus antyllius gaiuss house was more crowded than he had ever seen it the atmosphere was one of barely suppressed hysteria there was a surprisingly buoyant sprit among the men who rushed madly this way and that almost a sense of celebration the last time lucius had seen such a mixture of dread anticipation and camaraderie had been when he stood before the walls of carthage with tiberius just before the final siege there was a sense that a new world for better or worse was about to be born and the knowledge that many among them would not be alive the next day to see it gaius standing among a group of reapers with scythes saw him and waved him over you came by way of the forum yes but i stayed clear of the senate house i heard shouting but i didnt see never mind gaiuss tone was oddly aloof my surrogate eyes and ears run back and forth bringing me fresh reports every few minutes quintus antyllius has been laid on a bier before the rostra various senators are competing to see which of them can deliver the most sanctimonious eulogy the mourners weep and tear their hair meanwhile im afraid some of my more eager supporters have gathered on the periphery no violence yet only some namecalling whenever the mourners cry antyllius my men shout back tiberius of course the corpse of my brother was dragged through the streets and dumped in the river no one can accuse us of doing such a thing to antyllius gaius what i did yesterdayit was unforgivable and utterly out of character gaius smiled but his eyes were sad the furies themselves must have unleashed your ragewho knew you carried so much inside you well quintus antyllius is no great loss to the world of course opimius blames me for the murder even now hes haranguing his fellow senators with all sorts of wild allegations claiming that i intend to murder every one of them the gracchans are planning a bloodbath he cries curious how his sort accuses the opposition of the very crimes which they themselves are plotting will it come to that gaius a bloodbath ask opimius hes doing his best to whip the senators into a frenzy hes proposed a measure he calls the ultimate decree sounds menacing doesnt it it will allow the consuls to take all necessary measures to defend the state in other words theyll be empowered to kill any citizen on the spot without a trial gaius this cant be happening and yet the gods have allowed it a simpleminded fellow like opimius doesnt realize that something like this socalled ultimate decree will never be used only once theyre opening pandoras box allow the state to murder its citizens once and the same thing will happen again and again and again gaiuss glib tone suddenly gave way and his voice cracked alas lucius whats to become of our beloved republic our wretched tattered hopelessly lost republic he took lucius by the hands for a moment then pulled back and turned to address the reapers and the others nearby all of you gather whatever weapons you have philocrates bring me my sword im not going to wait for them to attack me in my home i shall go to the forum and say a prayer before the statue of my father licinia came running she clutched his toga no husband youre safe in this house where your supporters can protect you only the gods can protect me now go unarmed then if you go out armed with armed men around you therell surely be violence and theyll put the blame on you id rather die in battle than like a sheep offered for sacrifice he flashed a crooked smile gaius this is no joke the same men who killed tiberius are determined to murder you as well while i breathe im still a free citizen of roma i wont be a prisoner in my home gaius pulled away from her and moved toward the door licinia was wracked with sobs lucius attempted to put his arm around her but she shook him off refusing to be consoled as the last of gaiuss entourage disappeared from the vestibule lucius went running after them as gaius proceeded through the streets of the subura shutters flew opened men cheered him but few of them joined the entourage lucius looked about nervously where were the vast throngs who once had promised to defend gaius to the death they seemed to have melted away as the small band entered the forum idlers and bystanders gawked with curiosity then scattered sensing trouble and fleeing from it before the statue of his father gaius paused for a long time gazing up at the face of the elder tiberius his loyal young slave philocrates stood to his left lucius stood to his right gaius spoke in a dreamy voice my grandfather cast a long shadow men know me as the grandson of scipio africanus not the son of tiberius gracchus but my father was also a great roman his victories in spain established a peace that lasted twentyfive years his embassies to asia made him the confidante of kings he was twice elected consul twice awarded triumphs and served as censor my brother would have been as great if he had lived i had hoped that i might his voice broke tears fell from his eyes and streamed down his cheeks did we live and die for nothing lucius heard shouting from the direction of the senate house followed by the sounds of a street fight the noise came nearer gaius we must get back to your house there arent enough of us to take them on gaius gave a start he pricked up his ears then shook his head the fighting has moved between us and the subura we cant go back this is where ill make my stand this is where ill fall luciuss heart sank but he took a deep breath i wont desert you gaius youre a true friend lucius armed men appeared in the distance they spotted gaius gave a shout and ran toward him the entourage was vastly outnumbered men looked to gaius for orders but he stood as stiff and silent as his fathers statue some of his supporters panicked and began to flee in all directions at last gaius cried out in despair lucius philocrates all of you follow me he cast off his toga as did lucius and the others who were wearing them the better to run in his undertunic with the mob at their heels they raced from the forum they skirted the slope of the palatine and sprinted across the circus maximus in the narrow streets of the aventine they lost their pursuers near the crest of the hill they came to the temple of diana gaius ran into the temple the handful of supporters who followed watched him fall to his knees before the statue of the goddess queen of the hunt he cried gasping for breath daughter of jupiter sister of apollo accept this sacrifice he placed the pommel of his sword on the floor and pointed the blade toward his chest before he could fall on it two of his followers rushed to stop him one of them gripped his shoulders and pulled him back the other snatched the sword and handed it to philocrates gaius wept he beat his fists against the floor ungrateful treacherous romans i put a curse on you he shouted i pointed the way to freedom and you turned against me i risked everything for you and now you abandon me be slaves forever then to the murderers in the senate it seemed to lucius that a madness had come over his friend gaius had always been a brave man and a fighter yet now he seemed determined to die by his own hand without a struggle gaius had been utterly sure of his cause yet now he renounced it he had been utterly devoted to the common citizens of roma yet now he cursed them lucius was appalled but he could not judge gaius he himself had been seized by a madness the previous day when he struck antyllius dead without thinking a straggler ran into the temple theyre close behind me he shouted theyre coming this way lucius and philocrates pulled gaius to his feet they turned him toward the entrance in a daze he ran out into the street his pursuers saw him and shouted the chase resumed for lucius the headlong flight was like a nightmare the winding streets of the aventine the old fountain at the mouth of the appian aqueduct the salt warehouses along the tiber and the bustling markets of the forum boarium all these places were utterly familiar yet utterly strange seeing them pass by men laughed and cheered them on like spectators watching a footrace others jeered at the desperate little entourage and pelted them with radishes and turnips and bits of bones and hooves from the market at the bridge across the tiber some of the men stopped and turned about determined to make a stand they begged gaius to keep running vowing to hold the bridge as long as they could accompanied only by philocrates and lucius gaius reached the far side of the tiber just as his pursuers arrived at the bridge the sounds of battle echoed across the river the west bank of the tiber was largely wild and undeveloped the three of them left the road thinking to disappear amid the dense foliage a narrow pathway led them to a stand of tall trees the soft earth seemed to swallow the sound of their footsteps amid the leafy shadows a beam of sunlight fell upon a stone altar in a small clearing lucius felt more than ever that he was moving through a dream what place is this he whispered the grove of the furies said gaius in a hollow voice tisiphone megaera and allecto the vengeful sisters who punish sinful mortals with madness only black sheep can be sacrificed to them do you see their images on the altar they carry whips and torches their hair is made of snakes theyre older than jupiter they were born of the blood that was spilled when cronus the titan castrated his father uranusborn of a crime of a son against his father yet ive always honored my father and my grandfather why have the furies led me here he dropped to his knees before the altar shouts echoed amid the treetops their pursuers were drawing near philocrates do you have my sword the young slave quailed master please put an end to me philocrates at the temple of diana i lost my nerve i let them stop me do it for me philocrates do it now he threw back his head and raised his chest master i cant bear to do it i command you philocrates weeping and trembling the young slave turned the blade on himself and fell forward his cry of anguish reverberated though the woods the pursuers heard and shouted to one another they were very close gaius knelt over the slave he stroked the youths hair then pulled the sword from his chest he looked up at lucius and extended the hilt toward him this is what the furies want gaius whispered this is what they demand of you lucius you brought about this crisis when you slew antyllius now you must end it by doing the thing i least desire in all the world to do cried lucius would you allow me to be tortured and torn to pieces by my enemies lucius took the sword he could not look at gaiuss face he circled him knelt behind him and clutched him tightly with one arm he raised the blade to gaiuss throat with his last breath gaius hissed a curse let them be slaves of the senate forever lucius drew the blade across gaiuss throat gaius convulsed blood flowed warm and wet over luciuss encircling arm lucius drew back and staggered to his feet still twitching gaiuss body fell beside that of the dead slave lucius dropped the blade between them he stepped back into the shadows and hid himself amid the foliage just as the pursuers entered the little clearing numas balls dead already one of them shouted look at the two of themhe let the slave kill him then the slave killed himself the coward cheated us doesnt matter said another the bountys just as good no matter who killed him the consul opimius promised a fat reward for the head of each and every citizen on his list and the fattest reward of all is for the head of gaius gracchus i claim it beating back the others with a snarl the man raised his sword and hacked at gaiuss neck until the head came free he lifted it by the hair and swung the trophy in a circle over his head whooping with triumph blood and bits of gore spattered the onlookers and stained the altar a few drops penetrated the foliage and struck lucius in the face but he did not flinch what about the slave someone said giving the corpse a kick worthless leave it for now back to the city my friends where theres plenty more killing to do nauseated burning with anger paralyzed by fear lucius remained silent and unseen in the shadows after the men had gone he reached up to touch his breast and felt the fascinum beneath his tunic amazed that he was still alive he whispered a prayer to whatever power had seen fit to protect him in the days that followed under sanction of the ultimate decree more than three thousand roman citizens were put to death the gracchan movement was obliterated remarkably lucius survived the massacre unscathed for many days he remained secluded in his house waiting for a banging on the door that never came his name never appeared on the official list of enemies of the state he could not account for this omission to be sure toward the end his relationship with gaius had grown less public and more private for whatever reason gaiuss enemies overlooked him a stroke of good fortune over which lucius never ceased to puzzle it seemed to lucius there was no rhyme or reason to his destiny he had shunned tiberius and blossius and by doing so had survived their follies to his shame and regret he had boldly embraced the cause of gaius and yet had survived his downfall to even greater shame and regret lucius concluded that his was a charmed life curiously immune to ordinary reversals of fortune in the years that remained to him he turned his back on politics and devoted himself to his career which kept him very busy there were always more roads to be built he also became more religious each night before going to bed he said a prayer of thanksgiving to the god of the fascinum who had saved his life when death was very near it was in his bed that he died many years later a beloved husband and father an accomplished builder of roads and a much respected member of the equestrian order the consul opimius was eventually brought to trial for perpetrating the slaughter of roman citizens but he was acquitted the ultimate decree was upheld as a legal act and thus shielded him from punishment later in his career however he was convicted for taking bribes while serving as ambassador to king jugurtha of numidia opimius became a bitter and much hated man in his twilight years and he died in disgrace his legacy to roma was his authorship of the ultimate decree which as gaius had predicted was to be invoked repeatedly in the increasingly chaotic increasingly bloody years to come following the example of her father at the end of his life cornelia departed from roma and retired to a villa on the coast at a promontory called misenum taking menenia with her for companionship at misenum she entertained visiting dignitaries and philosophers and became legendary for her stoic fortitude in the face of so much tragedy to those who asked she was happy to share her memories of her father but she was even happier to talk about her sons she spoke of tiberius and gaius without grief or tears as if she were speaking of great men from the early days of the republic after her death a statue of her was placed in the city and became a beloved shrine for the women of roma cornelia had often expressed her desire to be remembered not as the daughter of africanus but as the mother of the gracchi so it came to pass in death the two brothers remained as fervently beloved and as viciously hated as they had been in life and the double tragedy of their deaths made them figures of legend like their mother they were immortalized with statues and shrines were established on the spots where they died either as exemplars of evil or paragons of virtue the names of tiberius and gaius gracchus would be invoked in speeches and debates for as long as the republic would endure heads in the forum bc how did it come to this muttered lucius pinarius talking to himself to keep up his courage as he hurried across the forum despite the mild spring weather he wore a hooded cloak he nervously fingered the fascinum that hung at his breasta family keepsake from his late grandfatherand whispered a prayer to the gods to keep him safe the lowering sun of late afternoon loomed bloodred above the rooftops casting long shadows quickening his pace lucius passed the rostra nowadays the beaks of captured ships were not the only trophies that adorned the speakers platform lucius tried not to look but despite himself he took a quick glance at the severed heads planted on the row of tall spikes that now encircled the platform some of the heads had been on the rostra for a month or more and were in an advanced state of decay the features no longer recognizable others dripping blood had been placed there so recently that their gaping mouths and wideopen eyes still expressed shock and horror lucius scanned the faces quickly he thanked the gods there was no one he recognized looming above and beyond the rostra high on a tall pedestal was the forums newest ornament a statue of a general on horseback the gilded statue gleamed with red fire in the light of the dying sun so brilliantly that it hurt luciuss eyes to look at it the sculptor had captured to perfection the confident posture and bold features of the dictator lucius cornelius sulla the statue appeared to be gazing out over the severed heads with a placid selfsatisfied smile above and beyond the statue of sulla loomed another reminder of the desperate pass to which roma had come the craggy summit of the capitoline hill upon which the ancient temples stood in charred ruins two years ago a great fire had swept across the capitoline destroying everything in its path including the ancient temple of jupiter the fire had been an ill omen portending the unspeakable terrors of civil war and the victors gruesome vengeance lucius turned away from the rostra he hurried on until he came to the posting wall a group of men had gathered to read the latest lists proscription lists they were called because they contained the names of those who had been officially denounced as enemies of the dictator sulla a proscribed man could be killed with impunity by anyone even in his own home his head was worth a bounty his property was summarily confiscated and auctioned by the state reading the new lists some of the men sighed with relief a few stifled cries of despair most kept their faces hidden lucius did likewise pulling the hood low across his brow as he made his way to the front of the crowd to scan the lists the name lucius dreaded to see that of his wifes younger brother was not there lucius touched the fascinum and whispered a prayer of relief whats this a man behind him leaned forward and squinted at the list over luciuss shoulder he spoke in an unnaturally loud voice can it be i see theyre posted the name of a certainlucius pinarius lucius spun about his heart pounding he recognized the speaker but only barelythe man was a friend of a friend whose name escaped him seeing the look on luciuss face the man let out a ghastly laugh im only joking he said its not funnynot funny at all snapped lucius his voice breaking to say such a thing even in jesti might have been killed you fool murdered where i stand before i could say a word it was true such atrocities occurred every day a man came to the posting board to read the latest list discovered to his horror that his name was on it gave himself away with a cry of dismay and then within moments was murdered by assassins who lurked nearby waiting for the opportunity to kill one of the dictators enemies and claim the bounty lucius elbowed his way out of the crowd and hurried across the forum walking as fast as he dared walking too fast might attract attention the straight steep path behind the temple of castor took him quickly to the crest of the palatine from there it was only a short walk to his house lucius turned down a narrow street he gave a start one of his neighbors was being dragged out of his house by a gang of roughlooking men the man clutched the doorframe clinging to it desperately with his fingernails until they pulled him clear and threw him down in the street from within the house came the screams of his family the few bystanders in the street turned and fled at once except for lucius who was too startled to move he watched in horror as the assassins proceeded to stab the man to death the sound of metal tearing flesh was nauseating the mans wife and children ran outside just in time to see the killers hack off his head the leader of the group held up the severed head lucius recognized the killer a notorious henchman of sullas named cornelius phagites can you believe it said phagites to his companions this ones been on the list for more than a month kept out of sight ever since until today when he dared to come home thought he could slip past phagites the stupid bastard theres a special premium for men whove been on the list that long this head will be worth a small fortune when we deliver it to sulla phagites grinned showing crooked teeth with a gap in the middle he saw lucius watching and curled his upper lip giving him a look of such malice that lucius thought he might loose control of his bladder what are you looking at citizen lucius said nothing and hurried on he arrived home badly shaken the slave who admitted him quickly barred the door behind him his wife stood in the atrium beyond the vestibule holding their newborn son to her breast a nursemaid stood nearby waiting to put the child to bed seeing lucius and the terrible look on his face julia pulled the baby from her breast she kissed the childs forehead then handed him to the slave she waited until the girl had disappeared before speaking its bad news isnt it please lucius tell me at once its not what you think he rushed to embrace her as much to comfort himself as to reassure her i saw somethingterribleon the way home terrible but the new list was gaius on the list or not julia pulled away from his embrace her fingers dug painfully into his arms no julia no calm yourself his name wasnt there not yet said a rasping voice from the shadows but they will post my name any day now so my informers tell me julia released her grip on lucius and hurried to the hunched figure in the shadows little brother what are you doing out of bed youre much too ill to be up gaius julius caesar was only eighteen but his face was haggard and he moved like an old man stiff and bent he was unshaven and his matted unkempt hair made a mockery of his name generations ago his branch of the julius family had taken the cognomen caesar meaning possessor of a fine head of hair im feeling much better sister really i am the fevers broken the chills are gone theyll be back thats how the quartan ague runs its course it comes and goes until its entirely spent are you my physician now as well as my sister julia kissed his forehead you are cooler than you were before do you think you could swallow some broth you must keep up your strength in the dining room lucius held up a small silver dish with both hands he bowed his head and intoned a prayer asylaeus we offer the best morsels of the meal to youyou who were especially worshipped by father romulus you patron of vagabonds fugitives and exiles you whose ancient altar on the capitoline offered a place of sanctuary to those who could find it nowhere else keep safe this cherished visitor in my home my brother by marriage young gaius grant him asylum here in the shelter of my house to you asylaeus i make this prayer asylaeus protect my brother said julia protect us all whispered gaius lucius reclined on the couch next to julia he picked at bits of roasted pork on a silver dish his stomach was empty but after the horrors he had seen that day the sight of charred flesh revolted him julia likewise had no appetite but gaius quickly finished one cup of broth and started on another gaius saw that lucius was staring at him he managed a weak smile you did a brave thing today brotherinlaw going down to the forum to read the new list i thank you for it lucius shrugged i did it for my own peace of mind as long as youre not officially on the list julia and i cant be punished for keeping a wanted man under our roof i shall move on tomorrow i promise nonsense said julia you can stay here for as long as you like lucius groaned inwardly but gaius spared him the awkwardness of objecting thank you sister but for my own safety i need to keep moving as soon as im able i must leave the city and get as far away from italy as i can if it werent for this damned ague id be gone already sulla wants me dead lucius shook his head how did it come to this in our grandfathers time gaius gracchus was beheaded and his killer collected a bounty and the bodies of the gracchi were thrown in the tiber without proper burial but decent romans were outraged now scores of heads are added every day to the display on the rostra and men do nothing the headless bodies of citizens are dumped in the river like refuse from the fish market without a thought did you hear the latest outrage sulla disinterred and then deliberately desecrated the body of your uncle marius the one man who might have stopped his madness he cut the corpse into pieces and smeared it with feces gouged the eyes from their sockets and cut out the tongue what an age we live in strong men no longer fear the gods wickedness has no limits gaius turned pale is it true about marius would even sulla commit such an abomination everyone is whispering about it why shouldnt it be true sulla will stop at nothing to punish his enemies he tortures them while they live now he desecrates their corpses after they die gaius stared into his cup of broth his expression was a blank but lucius knew that his brotherinlaw was deep in thought by nature young gaius was analytical and dispassionate brought low by sickness and finding himself in precarious circumstances he nonetheless held his emotions in check lucius envied his selfcontrol you ask how it came to this lucius you hint at the answer when you mention the gracchi in the days of our grandfathers the destiny of roma lay upon one of two pathsthe way of the gracchi or the way of their enemies their enemies won the wrong path was taken nothing has gone right since gaius gracchus attempted to expand the rights of common citizens and to extend those rights to our allies his selfish shortsighted enemies thwarted his legislation but the problems arising from injustice and inequity didnt go away instead a long bloody war erupted between us and our italian allies what the gracchi might have accomplished peacefully was instead settled by bloodshed and brute force what a waste because the gracchi saw a better future they were destroyed their enemies got away with murder and ever since men in power have never hesitated to use violence when the gracchi were killed people were shocked to see romans kill romans now weve suffered a fullscale civil war and a catastrophe that would have been unthinkable to our ancestorsa roman army laid siege to roma herself in retrospect the civil war of which gaius spoke had perhaps been inevitable romas expanding foreign wars led to the mustering of everlarger armies and the acquisition of evergreater wealth by her military commanders an era of conquest had given rise to a generation of warlords whose power grew to exceed that of the senate driven more by personal ambition and mutual suspicion than by politics the warlords turned on one another in the brief but ferocious civil war that resulted it was sulla surviving his rivals marius and cinna who emerged as the last man standing sulla had marched on roma laid siege to the city and then forced the senate to declare him dictator now the winner holds the city in his grip said gaius he piously vows to restore the republic and the lawful rule of the senate but not before he purges the state of all his enemies and potential enemies and divides their property among his henchmen gaius lowered his eyes and gazed into the cup of broth because marius had been his uncle and because gaius had recently married cornelia whose father cinna had been another of sullas rivals he was certain to be counted among sullas enemies that such a monster should rule over us is proof of our decadence declared julia the gods are angered they punish us in olden times dictator was a title of great honor and respect our ancestors were blessed to have a dictator like cincinnatus a man who rose up to save the state and then retired after sulla dictator shall forever be a dirty word a monster as you say muttered lucius nervously gnawing at his thumbnail a madman do you remember when the first proscription list was posted men gathered at the posting wall to read the names how shocked we were to see eighty names on the listeighty eighty citizens stripped of all protection eighty good romans reduced to animals fit to be hunted down and slaughtered we were outraged at sullas impunity appalled at such a number and then the next day there was an addendum to the listtwo hundred more names and the next day two hundred more on the fourth day sulla made a speech about restoring law and order someone dared to ask him just how many men he intended to proscribe his tone was almost apologetic like a magistrate whod fallen behind in his duties so far ive proscribed as many enemies as ive been able to remember but undoubtedly a few have escaped my recollection i promise you as soon as i can remember them ill proscribe those men as well he was making a joke said gaius ruefully you must admit sulla has a wicked wit hes as mad as cassandra said lucius the killing never stops every day theres a new list and anyone who gives shelter to a proscribed man is automatically proscribed as well even a mans parents the sons and grandsons of the proscribed are stripped of their citizenship and robbed of their property its happening not just in roma but in cities all over italy men are being murdered every minute of every day and every killer is given a reward even a slave who kills his master even a son who kills his father its madnessan insult to our ancestors a crime against the gods its a way for sulla and his friends to accumulate a vast amount of wealth said gaius the first men on the list were genuine enemies men whod fought against him in the civil war then we began to see other namesequestrians whod never taken an interest in politics or wealthy farmers who never even came to the city why were they proscribed so that sulla could seize their property the state sells the goods at public auctions but the dictators friends are the only men who dare to bid its as simple as that said lucius men are being murdered for their property men are being murdered by their properties said gaius i was down in alba the other day i rode by a beautiful country house with gardens and vineyards and the fellow with me said thats the estate that killed quintus aurelius julia groaned gaius that isnt funny then i dont suppose youll laugh when i tell you that men whove committed murder are arranging to have their victims inserted retroactively in the lists they say lucius sergius catilina pulled that off after he murdered his brotherinlaw the killing was not only made legal but catilina received a bounty for it the grim conversation lapsed for a while gaius drank more broth lucius pondered the untouched food before him julia finally spoke do you think we can take sulla at his word when he promises to lay down his dictatorship and retire to private life hell do so in a year he says or at most two years we can only pray that hes telling the truth said lucius glumly and what if he is said gaius what will have changed if sulla steps down elections will resume and the senate will be in charge againwith all mariuss men dead and sullas men taking their places but the state will still be crippled the things that were broken before the civil war will still be broken merely patched together with makeshift remedies gaius gracchus if hed had the chance might have sorted things out and breathed new life into the republic a petty vindictive tyrant like sulla is not the man to accomplish that it will take someone else to save roma someone who can combine the political vision of the gracchi the military genius of scipio africanus and a measure of sullas ruthlessness as well there was a faraway look in gaiuss eyes almost as if he were speaking of his own ambitions for the future that was absurd thought lucius the fever was giving his brotherinlaw delusions of grandeur gaius should worry about keeping his own head not daydream about saving the republic perhaps suggested lucius the man youre thinking of is pompeius magnus he referred to one of sullas protégés a military prodigy only six years older than gaius sulla who liked pet nameshe had dubbed himself felix luckyhad taken to addressing young gnaeus pompeius half in jest half in earnest as magnus the great the name had stuck pompeius gaius scoffed i hardly think so he doesnt have the strength of character to be a true leader well lucius raised an eyebrow he had no affection for pompeius but it seemed to him that gaius was hardly worldly enough to make such a scathing assessment gaius read his expression must i justify the comment very well i need cite only one example to show the fundamental weakness in pompeiuss character other than cutting off heads whats sullas most despotic behavior arranging marriages for those around him and not just innocent matchmaking against their will hes forced women to marry his favorites that action turns marriage into rape an offense to the gods hes even dissolved existing marriages forcing spouses to divorce each other and remarry new partners of his choosing another symptom of sullas madness said lucius perhaps but if pompeius thinks so the socalled great wasnt great enough to stand up to his master sulla told pompeius to divorce antistiaa devoted wife by all accountsand marry sullas stepdaughter aemilia even though aemilia was already pregnant by her husband and pompeius like the sycophant of some asian monarch obeyed without a whimper this is the man to lead roma out of the wilderness i hardly think so gaius shook his head i would never submit to such dishonorable disgraceful behavior to curry favor with another man no matter what the consequences never well said julia seeking to diffuse the tension in the room let us pray you never have to face such a dreadful choice may your marriage to cornelia be long and fruitful she smiled wanly when i think of a good marriage i think of our parents dont you gaius they always seemed so happy together if only the gods had not taken father so swiftly so suddenly julia and gaius had lost their father three years before to all appearance the elder gaius had been a healthy vigorous man in the prime of life but one day while putting on his shoes he gave a lurch and fell over dead his own father had also died young in a similarly sudden fashion the siblings had felt his loss deeply and had grown even closer in the years since he died gaius seeing the look of sadness on his sisters face leaned toward her and gently touched her shoulder suddenly there came a noise from the vestibule so loud that all three of them gave a start and leaped to their feet someone was not merely banging at the door but was trying to break it down there was a snap of splintering wood and the shriek of hinges giving way gaius turned to flee but managed only a few steps he was too weak to run he swayed and would have fallen had julia not rushed to his side a gang of armed men barged into the room lucius blanched when he recognized their leader cornelius phagites phagites smiled showing the gap between his crooked teeth ah theres the very one im looking foryoung caesar julia stood before gaius like a mother protecting her young though his knees trembled lucius stepped up to phagites who was much taller and raised his chin high youve made a mistake this is my wifes brother gaius julius caesar his name is not on the proscription lists phagites laughed name isnt on the list he said mockingly how often have we heard that one its true i checked the new lists myself this afternoon you saw me when i was coming back from the forum dont you remember phagites squinted at him wellif his names not on the list yet it can always be added later he said but in his voice there was a sliver of doubt lucius did his best to take advantage of it taking men on the list is one thing phagites taking men who arent on the list is another sooner or later by his own promise lucius cornelius sulla will resign his dictatorship hes granted himself immunity from prosecution for life but i doubt that hes given that sort of protection to you well has he phagites frowned no which means that some day there will be an accounting ofof mistakes that were made this is such a mistake phagites gaius julius caesar is not on the list hes a citizen with full rights not an enemy of the state you have no right to harm him phagites turned to one of his underlings who produced a scrap of parchment and together they pored over it for a moment whispering and sniping at one another at last phagites swaggered back he smirked and looked down his nose at lucius just how much are you willing to pay me to make sure i dont make anymistakes lucius bit his lip he thought for a long moment then whispered a sum phagites laughed i dont blame you for whispering you ought to be ashamed offering so little to make sure that nothing bad happens to your wifes darling brother make it four times that amount and ill consider your offer lucius swallowed a lump in his throat very well phagites nodded thats more like it now all you have to do is beg me to take the money and ill be on my way what beg me i have to have some sport tonight dont i go down on your knees citizen and beg me to accept your offering lucius glanced at julia who averted her face gaius seemed to have been drained of his last ounce of strength by the sudden panic and was hardly able to stand lucius dropped to his knees i implore you cornelius phagites take the money i offer and leave us in peace phagites laughed he mussed luciuss hair much better little man very well go fetch my money but youre striking a fools bargain your brotherinlaw will be dead before the next ides oh ill take your money now and let young caesar keep his head and later when i do take his head ill get a second payment from sulla i shall be paid twice for the same headon his shoulders and off lucius brought the money phagites and his men left without another word julia was too distraught to speak gaius staggered to his dining couch and collapsed on it lucius felt gaiuss forehead the young man was again burning with fever despite gaiuss illness later that night lucius and julia summoned a litter and took him to another hiding place if phagites had found gaius so might someone else the fact that his name was not yet among the proscribed clearly was no guarantee of safety in the days and nights that followed despite his lingering ague gaius moved from one refuge to another meanwhile the elders of the julii entered into frantic negotiations with members of sullas inner circle trying to remove gaius from danger lucius met with the julii daily hoping for good news the proscriptions continued new names were added daily lucius began to fear that he himself might be added to the lists he made sure that the door broken down by phagites and his men was repaired and made stronger than before he kept a dagger on his person at all times he purchased a quickacting poison from a dubious character on the waterfront and gave it to julia for safekeeping death by beheading would be grisly but swift he told himself but he shuddered to think of what might be done to julia once he was gone he wanted her to have a means of quick escape what times they lived in that a man should have to plan for such contingencies one day a visitor came to the house attended by many bodyguards he was a beautiful young man with a mane of golden hair lucius recognized him chrysogonus an actor who had become one of sullas favorites ever since he was young sulla had had a weakness for actors and especially for blonds chrysogonus was dressed in a tunic made of a sumptuous green fabric embroidered with silver stitching the garment must have cost a fortune lucius thought he wondered who had died so that sullas catamite could wear it i wont stay long said chrysogonus gazing about the vestibule with a practiced eye as if scrutinizing a property that might someday be his my friend felix sends you a message lucius could barely stifle his disgust at hearing a former slave and actor speak so familiarly of the most powerful man in roma chrysogonus sensing his disdain fixed him with a cold stare luciuss mouth turned dry what does sulla say your wifes brother will be spared youre certain julia who had remained out of sight rushed to luciuss side if you will allow me to finish chrysogonus raised an eyebrow gaius julius caesar will be sparedbut only on the condition that my friend felix is able to meet with him face to face so that he can see the boy beheaded with his own eyes snapped lucius chrysogonus gave him a baleful look the dictator will call on you tonight if he sincerely wishes to receive the dictators pardon the young caesar will be here with a theatrical flair chrysogonus spun about on his heel and departed surrounded by his bodyguards a festive retinue appeared in the street outside luciuss house that night chrysogonus was among them along with several other actors and mimes male and female they laughed and joked among themselves as if out for a carefree stroll by torchlight the bodyguards looked more like troubleloving street toughs than staid sober lictors sobriety was in short supply several members of the party were obviously drunk perusing the group through the peephole of his front door lucius shook his head sulla himself arrived in a curtained red litter carried by a phalanx of burly slaves one of them dropped to his hands and knees so that the dictator could use his back as a step to descend to the street seeing him lucius sucked in a breath appalled that the fate of the republic and its citizens should rest in the hands of such a decayed specimen once strappingly muscular the very image of a dashing roman general sulla had grown jowly and fat his complexion had always been splotchymulberries covered with oatmeal as some described itbut now a skein of spidery red veins had been added to his blemishes the dictator banged his fist against the door lucius stepped back and nodded to a slave to open it then stood straight to greet his visitor sulla stepped past him and entered the vestibule without a word alone bringing not a single bodyguard with him did he think himself invulnerable he had named himself felix after all gaius awaited him in the atrium physically the young man could not have presented a greater contrast to the dictator naturally slender with a long face gaius had been rendered even leaner by his illness and his bright eyes glittered with fever despite his weakness his bearing was fearless he stood with his shoulders back and his chin held high for the occasion he wore a toga borrowed from lucius even with julias nips and tucks it hung on him loosely while lucius stood to one side sulla gave gaius a long appraising look he stepped closer so this is young caesar he finally said i stare and you stare back at me i frown but you do not blanch who do you think you are young man i am gaius julius caesar i am the son of my father who was praetor i am the scion of the julii an ancient patrician house we trace our lineage back to venus herself maybe so but when i look at you young man i see another marius lucius held his breath his heart pounded in his chest did sulla intend to kill gaius with his bare hands the dictator laughed nonetheless i have decided to spare you and so i shallas long as my conditions are met lucius stepped forward dictator you requested that young caesar should meet you face and face and here he is what more first and foremost said sulla speaking to gaius you must divorce your wife cornelia and then never gaius stood still his face showed no emotion but his voice was adamant sulla raised an eyebrow his fleshy forehead was creased with furrows i repeat you must divorce cornelia in your marriage the houses of my enemies marius and cinna are combined i cannot have such a union i refuse you what i refuse even a dictator cannot make such a demand of a roman citizen sulla stared at him blankly his florid complexion became even redder he nodded slowly i see lucius braced himself he felt for the dagger under his toga and wondered if he would have the courage to use it what was gaius thinking to speak to sulla in such a way it had to be the fever making him delirious and then sulla laughed long and loudly at last he stopped laughing and spoke in a tone of wonderment is it marius i see in you young manor myself i wonder very well then you may keep your head and your wife but in return for this favor it seems only fair that some member of your family must remarry to please me sulla glanced over his shoulder for the first time since entering the house he looked directly at lucius what about you i dictator yes you what are you to this young man his brotherinlaw yes dictator and where is the boys sister your wife i suppose shes skulking nearby they usually are out with you woman step into the atrium where i can see you julia emerged from behind a corner looking very meek why shes the very image of her brother very well she can take her brothers place you and this fellow herewhats your name again lucius pinarius dictator you and lucius pinarius shall divorce at once since its a patrician marriage certain formalities must be observed i give you two days no more do you both understand dictator please whispered lucius i beg you after your marriage is dissolved i dont care what you do pinarius but you julia must remarry at once youre the niece of marius just as your brother is his nephew and i must keep a watch on all you julii but whom shall you marry let me think he tapped his forehead then snapped his fingers quintus pedius yes just the fellow i dont even know him said julia she was on the verge of tears well soon you shall know him very well indeed sulla smiled broadly there its settled young caesars name will be removed from the upcoming proscription lists even so id advise you to get out of town for a while accidents happen also young caesar may keep his wife meanwhile you two shall divorce dictator please call me felix lucius cornelius sullafelixi beg you to reconsider my wife and i are deeply devoted to one another our marriage is a he wanted to declare that their marriage was a love match but it seemed obscene to speak of love in front of sulla we have a young son hes still suckling at his mothers breast sulla shrugged then let the child stay with his mother you shall give up all claims to him let quintus pedius adopt him lucius gaped too stunned to speak julia began to sob gaius stepped forward unsteady on his feet he was the color of chalk dictator i see that i was wrong to oppose you i shall do as you asked i shall divorce cornelia you shall do no such thing dictator it was never my intention your intentions mean nothing here my will prevails your life is spared your marriage is preserved but your sister and her husband will divorce each other he turned to lucius either that or i shall see your name in the proscription lists pinarius and your head on a stake with a dramatic flourish worthy of chrysogonus sulla turned about and left the house his entourage welcomed him back with drunken cheers and laughter a slave quickly closed the door to shut out the raucous noises lucius stared at the floor after all our effortsall oursacrificesour sleepless nightsthe bribe i paid to phagitesthe humiliation brotherinlaw whispered gaius i never imagined dont call me that im your brotherinlaw no longer from the nursery the baby began to wail julia dropped to her knees weeping lucius glared at gaius its julia and i who must now pay the price for your pride to save your neck and preserve your precious dignity we must give up everything everything gaius opened his mouth but could find nothing to say you owe us for this cried lucius pointing his finger at gaius never forget never forget the debt you owe to my son and to his sons for as long as you live gradually as thousands died or fled into exile the frenzied pace of sullas proscriptions subsided but the dictator continued to rule roma with an iron grip his divorce left lucius pinarius a bitter and broken man no one blamed him for his misfortune friends many of whom had suffered terribly themselves did their best to comfort him and even praised his sacrifice you did what you had to to save another mans life they said you did it for the sake of your son and your wife had you disobeyed sulla would have proscribed you and your family would have been left destitute but no argument could alleviate luciuss anguish and regret to save his family he had lost his family to keep his head he had surrendered his dignity julias new husband quintus pedius did nothing to bar lucius from seeing his son or julia for that matter but lucius was ashamed to face them to bow before a dictator reduced a man to a status hardly better than a slave a roman without honor was not a roman at all it would be best he decided if his loved ones considered him a dead man let julia be as a widow who had remarried let his son be as an orphan how much better it would have been if lucius had died if only he had caught the quartan ague from gaius and died of that so like a dead man he prematurely bequeathed to his son a precious heirloom the golden fascinum which had been in the family for untold generations the amulet was very worn its shape hardly recognizable nonetheless lucius sent it to julia with a prayer that it might protect their son from such a disaster as had overtaken his father the talisman was passed to the next generation having no desire to remarry despondent and forlorn he lived alone in his house on the palatine as for gaius he took the advice of sulla and left roma as soon as he was able to travel he accepted a military posting on the aegean coast serving on the staff of the praetor minucius thermus lucius thought about gaius as little as possible but one day while crossing the forum he passed a group of men conversing and overheard a stranger mention gaiuss name lucius stopped to listen yes gaius julius caesar the man repeated the one whose father dropped dead a couple of years ago poor young fellow i suppose king nicomedes makes a dashing father figure but no roman should ever bend over to pleasure another man not even a king especially not a king this was followed by salacious laughter lucius stepped forward what are you talking about young caesars escapades in the east said one of the gossips the praetor thermus sent him on a mission to king nicomedes in bithynia once caesar got there he didnt want to leave it seems he hit it off with the king a little too well if you know what i mean all that high living in the royal court turned the boys headand nicomedes is a handsome fellow to judge by his coins meanwhile thermus is like a spurned husband sending messenger after messenger demanding that caesar return but caesar cant bear to leave the kings bed how could you possibly know such a thing snapped lucius if caesars detained on a mission there could be a hundred other explanations please the gossip rolled his eyes everyones talking about it did you hear the latest joke sulla let him keep his headbut nicomedes took his maidenhead there was a great deal of laughter lucius disgusted stalked away with his jaw tightly clenched he made his hands into fists tears welled in his eyes was it for this that he had sacrificed everything so that a fatuous young man could desert his military post to live in luxury in bithynia what sort of roman was caesar to speak admiringly of gaius gracchus and daydream about rebuilding the roman state and then to run off and play catamite to a bithynian monarch lucius should have let sulla take the young fool and do what he wanted with him bc belying the worst fears of his enemiesthose few who remained alivesulla made good on his promise to step down from the dictatorship after two years declaring that his work was done he restored full authority to the senate and magistrates in retirement he dictated his memoirs and proudly boasted that having rid roma of the worst of the troublemakers as he called those who opposed him he had instituted reforms that would return the republic to the golden days before the gracchi stirred the pot and threw everything into confusion but could even sulla could turn back time since the destruction of carthage roman politics had been driven by tremendous wealth and headlong expansion and the evergreater injustices and inequalities that resulted roma needed powerful generals to conquer new territories and enslave new populations how else could more wealth be accumulated but what was to be done when those generals grew jealous and suspicious of one another and a citizenry riven with greed and resentment was compelled to choose sides civil war had resulted once nothing in sullas reforms would stop such a war from happening again if anything his example was an encouragement to wouldbe warlords with dreams of absolute power sulla had shown that a man could ruthlessly exterminate all opposition declare his actions to be legitimate and legal and then retire to live out his days in comfort and peace beloved by the friends and supporters who had benefited from his largesse in the month of martius at his villa on the bay near neapolis at the age of sixty sulla died of natural causes but his death was not an easy one and in the revolting symptoms that plagued him some saw the hand of the goddess nemesis who restores balance to the natural order when injustice has been done the disease began with an ulceration of the bowels aggravated by excessive drinking and sumptuous living then the corruption spread and converted his flesh into worms day and night physicians picked the worms away but more worms appeared to take their place then the pores of his flesh discharged a vile flux in such quantities that his bed and his clothing were saturated with it no amount of bathing and scouring could stop the oozing discharge even in this wretched state sulla continued to conduct business on the last full day of his life he dictated the final chapter of his memoirs concluding with this boast when i was young a chaldean soothsayer foretold to me that i would lead an honorable upright life and end my days at the height of my prosperity the soothsayer was right sullas secretary then reminded him that he had been requested to settle the case of a local magistrate accused of embezzling public funds the magistrate who wished to defend himself was in the antechamber awaiting an interview sulla agreed to see him the magistrate entered before the man could say a word sulla ordered the slaves in the room to strangle him on the spot the slaves were sullas private servants not assassins when they hesitated sulla became furious and shouted at them the strain caused an abscess on his neck to rupture he began to bleed profusely in the resulting confusion the magistrate ran for his life physicians came to stanch the bleeding but sullas end had come he became confused and lost consciousness he survived the night but died the next morning some perverse but powerful inclinationthe wish to see a dreadful episode to its bitter end or the need to be absolutely certain that a terrifying creature is truly dead beyond any doubtdrove lucius pinarius out of his house and into the streets to witness sullas funeral the entire city turned out to watch the procession lucius found a spot with a good view and wondered at his luck until he realized why the spot was vacant a ragged beggar was standing nearby emitting such a foul odor that all others had been driven away lucius ignored the stench if he could stand the sight of sulla on his funeral bier he told himself then surely he could endure the smell of a fellow human being heading the procession was an image of sulla himself a duplicate of the equestrian statue in the forum as the effigy passed by it emitted an odor of spices that overwhelmed even the stench of the beggar the man looked at lucius and flashed a toothless grin they say that things made of frankincense and cinnamon and all sorts of other costly spices they took up a collection from all the rich women in roma to have it sculpted theyll burn it on the funeral pyre along with sulla the smoke from it will perfume the whole city lucius wrinkled his brow sullas to be cremated his ancestors among the cornelii were always interred maybe so said the beggar but the dictator specified in his will that his remains are to be burned to ashes such men free to spend their days eavesdropping and collecting gossip often knew what they were talking about you can imagine why can i think about it what happened to marius sullas rival after he was dead sulla opened the crypt and took a shit on his body there are those whod do the same to sulla to have their revenge never doubt it rather than give them the chance hes having himself cremated lucius looked sidelong at the beggar the man was missing his left hand and leaned on a crutch under his right arm there was a deep scar across his face and he appeared to be blind in one eye following the effigy came the consuls and the other magistrates and then the whole membership of the senate dressed in black the leading equestrians followed then the pontifex maximus and the vestal virgins then by the hundreds sullas veterans came marching by outfitted in their best armor and led by young pompeius magnus musicians and a chorus of professional funeral singers all women followed the musicians played a mournful tune on pipes and lyres to which the chorus sang a song in praise of sulla mimes followed breaking the somber mood with their buffoonery mimes were traditional at a wealthy mans funeral and among these were some of the most famous actors in roma members of sullas inner circle since the days of his youth the beggar felt obliged to point them out look theres roscius the comedian i saw him play the swaggering soldier once they say hes richer than most senators and thats old metrobius who always specialized in female roles played the leading lady in sullas bed for years they say until that prettyboy chrysogonus took his place getting on in years but he still looks good in a stola and of course that must be sorex playing the archmime today dressing up like sulla and impersonating the dead man hes got the walk and hand gestures down perfectly dont you think lets hope he doesnt start chopping off peoples heads the mimes were followed by the procession of sullas ancestors men wore the wax masks of the dead and dressed in the ceremonial robes they had worn in life they held aloft the garlands crowns and other military honors sulla had received in his long victorious career at last the honor guard approached carrying the funeral bier sullas body lay upon a couch of ivory decorated with gold ornaments draped with purple cloth and garlands of cypress his wife valeria and the children of his five marriages followed the procession appeared to be headed not toward the necropolis outside the esquiline gate but in the opposite direction where are they taking him muttered lucius didnt you know said the beggar sullas funeral pyre is out on the field of mars his monuments there as well theyve already put it up the field of mars only the kings were ever buried there the beggar shrugged even so sulla specified in his will that his monument should be on the field of mars the last of the procession passed by spectators fell in behind lucius grimly determined to see the burning of the corpse joined the crush the beggar did likewise staying close beside him forever after lucius would remember the mans stench whenever he thought of sullas funeral day as the multitude assembled on the field of mars storm clouds gathered the sky grew so dark that the men in charge of the pyre nervously conferred but as quickly as they gathered the black clouds dispersed a shaft of golden sunlight shone down on the bier atop the pyre you know what theyll say whispered the beggar drawing close to lucius his smell had cleared a way for them to stand at the front of the crowd theyll say his good luck followed sulla even to his funeral pyre fortuna herself drove the rain away speeches were made sulla was praised as the savior of the republic tales were recounted to demonstrate his virtue and genius the words were like the buzzing of locusts in luciuss ears the pyre was lit the flames reached higher and higher lucius was so close that the heat blasted his face and cinders swirled about him the beggar pointed at the monument nearby an imposing crypt the size of a small temple he said something but amid the crackle of flames lucius could not hear lucius frowned and shook his head the beggar spoke louder almost shouting what does it say the inscription across the pediment of the temple they say that sulla composed his own epitaph waves of heated air obscured the view but by squinting lucius could make out the letters he read aloud no friend ever did him a kindness and no enemy ever did him a wrong without being fully repaid the beggar cackled with laughter lucius stared at the man feeling pity and revulsion who are you he said me nobody everybody one of sullas enemies who received his full payment i suppose i was a soldier fought for cinna then for mariusalways against sulla though for no particular reason and look at me now sulla paid me back in full what about you citizen dressed in your fancy clothes looking spruce and sleek with all your limbs intact i suppose you were one of his friends did sulla give you your just deserts lucius was carrying a small coin purse he began to reach into it then thought better and gave the whole thing to the beggar before the man could thank him lucius disappeared into the crowd he made his way through the throng and back to the city the forum was empty his footsteps echoed as he hurried over the paving stones passing near the rostra he felt a sudden chill he looked up and saw the gilded statue of sulla in silhouette the sun behind the statues head gave it a scintillating halo even in death the dictator cast a cold shadow across his life bc the winter of that year was unusually harsh one storm after another dropped sleet and rain on the city on many mornings the valleys brimmed with a cold white mist like bowls filled with milk and the hills were glazed with frost making the winding paved streets that ran up and down the hillsides treacherous underfoot lucius pinarius contracted a cold early in the winter and could not shake it off the ailment moved from one part of his body to another but would not depart he ventured out seldom and received few visitors only belatedly from a talkative workman who came to repair a leak in his roof did he learn the news that every gossip in the forum already knew gaius julius caesar while traveling in the aegean had been kidnapped by pirates lucius had not seen julia or his son for many months his rare visits were too painful and awkward for all concerned but hearing of her brothers misfortune he knew that julia must be distraught and he felt compelled to see her coughing violently lucius put on a heavy woolen cloak a single slave accompanied him through the dank frosty streets to the far side of the palatine where julia lived with her husband quintus pedius the marriage had apparently worked out well for her in its early days however unhappy she might have been the prudent thing had been to make the best of it since there was no way of knowing how long sulla would reign as dictator julia had adapted quickly to her new circumstances like her brother she was a survivor thought lucius bitterly lucius too had adapted in his own fashion simply to keep from going mad early on he had banished from his thoughts any notion that julia might someday divorce pedius and remarry him after sullas death the notion occasionally entered his thoughts especially when his loneliness was most acute but the act of submitting to sulla had robbed him of his dignity as a roman without dignity he had neither the authority nor the will to take back what had been his it was useless to blame the gods or gaius or even sulla a man must endure his own fate a door slave admitted him to pediuss house looking surprised and not a little wary julia met him in a room off the garden where a brazier was blazing and shutters had been closed to keep out the cold the sight of her was like a knife in his heart even through the loose folds of her stola he could see that she was pregnant she saw him staring at her belly and lowered her eyes the phlegm rattled in his chest he fought against the need to cough i came because i heard the news about your brother julia drew a sharp breath what have you heard that he was kidnapped by pirates and only that julia wrinkled her brow this was old news he had alarmed her by making her think he knew something she did not and now she was peeved at him if theres anything i can do he said lamely thats kind of you lucius but quintus and i managed to raise the ransom it was sent some time ago all we can do now is wait i see a faint smile lit julias lips his captors must be illiterate if they had read what gaius says about them in his letters theyd never have allowed him to send them his letters thats how we found out about his situation dear sister i am held captive he wroteever so matteroffactly could you be so kind as to raise a bit of ransom for me then he went on to write the most scathing insults about his captors how uncouth they are how stupid to hear gaius tell it hes lording it over themordering them about demanding decent food and more comfortable sleeping quarters even trying to teach them some manners one must use a tone of authority with such creatures as one does with a dog as if the whole experience is simply a learning exercise for himthe proper way to handle a pirate crew she lowered her eyes of course his bravado may be an attempt to reassure me and to keep up his own spirits these men are thieves and murderers after all the things they do to peoplethe terrible stories one hears julia trembled and her voice broke it was all lucius could do not to rush to her and take her in his arms he resisted the impulse because he had no right to do so and because he could not bear it if she pushed him away gaius is a survivor said lucius like his sister he thought im sure hell be alright he coughed into his sleeve lucius youre unwell it sounds worse than it is i should go home now i merely came to offer he shrugged i dont know why i came julia gazed into the flames of the brazier did you want to see probably its best if i dont hes growing up very fast only six and able to read already he knows about his uncle he has bad dreams about pirates he looks just like you lucius felt a great weight on his chest as if a stone were crushing him it had been a mistake to come as he was turning to leave a slave rushed into the room the man clutched a scrap of parchment tightly rolled and tied and sealed with wax when julia saw it her eyes grew wide is it yes mistress from your brother julia snatched the letter and unrolled it she scanned the contents then began to weep lucius braced himself thinking it must be bad news then julia threw back her head and laughed hes free gaius is alive and well and free oh this is wonderful lucius you must listen to this dear sister for forty days i was held captive against my will thanks to the ransom you sent i was given my freedom the experience was most disagreeable but left me little the worse for wear have no anxieties about my wellbeing i cannot say the same about my captors as soon as i was freed i set about organizing a party to hunt down the pirates they provided little sport the simpleminded fools were eager to spend their illgotten gains and headed for the nearest port with a tavern and a brothel we captured them easily and recovered a considerable part of the ransom i shall return as much as i can to you now and the balance later as for the pirates we set up crosses on a hillside visible to all passing ships and crucified them during my captivity i warned them that i would see them come to a bad end and so i did i watched them die one by one by all means spread this news to everyone in roma between you and me i am quite proud of how this all turned out justice was done and roman dignity was upheld the episode shall make a splendid campaign story when it comes time for me to begin the course of honor julia laughed dear gaiusalways with an eye to the future i think he shall be consul someday dont you luciuss mouth was dry his chest ached from coughing perhaps hell be the next sulla he said lucius what a terrible thing to say or perhaps the next gracchusexcept that your brother will probably succeed where the gracchi failed before julia could respond to this their son came running into the room the boys elderly greek tutor followed looking flustered mistress i couldnt stop him words spread through the house that youve received a letter from your brother little lucius wants to know where is uncle gaius shouted the boy lucius noticed that he was wearing the fascinum of his ancestors the sight of the amulet both pleased and pained him where is uncle gaius do the pirates still have him julia took the boys face in her hand no they dont brave uncle gaius escaped from the pirates he escaped yes indeed and then do you know what he did he hunted them down and he killed them all the pirates yes every one uncle gaius nailed them to crosses and gave them the terrible deaths they deserved those awful pirates will never bother anyone ever again because uncle gaius killed them thats right so you must have no more bad dreams about them now theres someone here to whom you must say hello julia looked up but lucius had disappeared out in the street lucius coughed violently his breath formed streams of mist in the cold air he walked quickly aimlessly his thoughts a muddle his slave had to hurry to keep up with him his eyes welled with tears the tears felt hot running down his cheeks they blurred his vision he did not see the patch of ice on the paving stones ahead of him the slave saw and shouted a warning but too late lucius stepped on the ice limbs flailing he fell backward he struck his head on a stone he shuddered and twitched then lay very still blood ran from his skull seeing the empty look in his masters wideopen eyes and the peculiar way his neck was twisted the slave let out a scream but there was nothing to be done lucius was dead caesars heir bc it was the ides of februarius since the time of king romulus this was the day set aside for the ritual called the lupercalia the origin of the lupercaliathe boisterous occasion when young romulus and remus and their friend potitius ran about the hills of roma naked with their faces disguised by wolfskinswas long forgotten as were the origins of many roman holidays but above all else the romans honored the traditions that had been handed down by their ancestors paying scrupulous attention to the most minute details they continued to observe many arcane rituals sacrifices feasts holidays and propitiations to the gods long after the origins of these rites were lost the roman calendar was filled with such enigmatic observances and numerous priesthoods had been established to maintain them because religion determined or at least justified the actions of the state senatorial committees studied lists of precedents to determine the days when certain legislative procedures could and could not be performed why did the romans adhere so faithfully to tradition there was sound reasoning behind such devotion the ancestors had performed certain rituals and in return had been favored by the gods above all other people it only made sense that living romans the inheritors of their predecessors greatness should continue to perform those rituals precisely as handed down to them whether they understood them or not to do otherwise was to tempt the fates this logic was the bedrock of roman conservatism and so as their ancestors had done for many hundreds of years on the day of the lupercalia the magistrates of the city along with the youths of noble families stripped naked and ran through the streets of the city they carried thongs of goat hide and cracked them in the air like whips young women who were pregnant or desired to become so would purposely run toward them and offer their hands to be slapped by the thongs believing that this act would magically enhance their fertility and grant them an easy birth where this belief came from no one knew but it was part of the great compendium of beliefs that had come down to them and thus was worthy of observance presiding over the festivities seated on the rostra upon a golden throne arrayed in magnificent purple robes and attended by a devoted retinue of scribes bodyguards military officers and assorted sycophants sat gaius julius caesar at the age of fiftysix caesar was a handsome man he had a trim figure butironically given his cognomanhe had lost much of his hair especially at the crown and the temples the remainder he combed over his forehead in a vain attempt to hide his baldness the men around him hung on his every word the citizens gathered to watch the lupercalia gazed up at him with fear awe respect hatred and even love but never with indifference to all appearances caesar might have been a king presiding over his subjects except for the fact that he did not wear a crown a lifetime of political maneuvering and military conquests had brought caesar to this point early in his career he proved to be a master of political procedure no man could manipulate the senates convoluted rules as deftly as caesar and many were the occasions he thwarted his rivals by invoking some obscure point of order he had proven to be a military genius as well in less than ten years he had conquered all of gaul enslaving millions and accumulating a huge fortune for himself when his envious fearful enemies in the senate attempted to deprive him of his legions and his power caesar marched on roma itself a second civil war the great fear of every roman since the days of sulla commenced pompeius magnus who had sometimes been caesars ally led the coalition against him at the battle of pharsalus in greece pompeiuss forces were destroyed pompeius fled to egypt where the minions of the boyking ptolemy killed him they presented his head to caesar as a gift caesar had circled the mediterranean destroying all vestiges of opposition he set romas subject states in order confirming the loyalty of their rulers and making them accountable to him alone egypt the great grain producer of the world remained independent but caesar disposed of king ptolemy and put the boys slightly older sister cleopatra on the throne caesars relationship with the young queen was both political and personal cleopatra was said to have borne him a son at present she and the child were residing just outside roma on the far side of the tiber in a grand house suitable for a visiting head of state caesars authority was absolute like sulla before him he proudly assumed the title of dictator unlike sulla he showed no inclination ever to lay down his power to the contrary he publicly announced his intention to reign as dictator for life king was a forbidden word in roma but caesar was a king in everything but name he had done away with elections and appointed magistrates for several years to come his righthand man marcus antonius was serving as consul the ranks of the senate thinned by civil war had been filled with new members handpicked by caesar these new senators included to the outrage of many some gauls whose loyalty was more to caesar than to roma it was not clear what function the senate would serve from this time forward except to approve the decisions of caesar he had assigned control of the mint and the public treasury to his own slaves and freedmen all legislation and all currency were under his control his personal fortune acquired over many years of conquest was immense beyond imagining beside him romas richest men were paupers whatever his title it had become clear to everyone that caesars triumph signaled the death of the republic roma would no longer be ruled by a senate of competing equals but by one man with absolute power over all others including the power of life and death the long civil war had disrupted many traditions as all power now attached to the dictatorforlife it was up to him to oversee a return to normalcy and so on the ides of februarius caesar sat on a throne on the rostra and presided over the lupercalia among the runners assembled in the forum stretching their legs and getting ready was lucius pinarius his grandmother had been the late julia one of caesars sisters his grandfather had been lucius pinarius infelixthe unluckysocalled young lucius had been told because of his untimely death due to a fall on an icy street lucius was seventeen and had run in the lupercalia before but he was especially excited to be doing so on this day with his granduncle gaius presiding a burly man with a broad hairy chest and powerful limbs came swaggering up to him some men by the age of thirtysix begin to soften and turn fat but not marcus antonius he carried himself with immense confidence he appeared completely comfortable even pleased to be seen naked in public lucius still had a boys body slender and smooth and felt envious of antoniuss athletic physique lucius thought the man looked quite magnificent lucius was also fascinated by the consuls reputation for high living nobody could outgamble outdrink outbrawl or outwhore antonius but antonius was such a friendly fellow that lucius never felt selfconscious or shy around him as he often did with his uncle whats that antonius tapped the pendant that hung from a chain around luciuss neck a goodluck charm consul said lucius antonius snorted call me marcus please if i ever become so puffed up that my friends must call me by a title stick a pin in me lucius smiled very well marcus where did you get it said antonius referring to the pendant a gift from caesar oh no its an heirloom from my fathers side of the family he gave it to me on my toga day last year antonius peered at the amulet his eyes were a bit bloodshot from carousing the night before i cant make out the shape nobody can were not quite sure what it was father says its been worn away by time he says its very very old maybe from the time of the kings or even before antonius nodded from the time of the kingsthats what people say when they mean something is so far in the past its beyond imagining as if a time of kings could never come again he looked up at the rostra and nodded to caesar caesar nodded back then stood to address the crowd citizens cried caesar the single utterance hushed the crowd and gained him everyones attention among his other accomplishments caesar was one of the best orators in roma able to project his voice a great distance and to speak extemporaneously and with great eloquence on any subject on this occasion his speech was short and to the point citizens we are gathered to observe one of the most ancient and revered of all rituals the running of the lupercalia the highest servants of the state and the youths of our most ancient families will take part the lupercalia returns us to the pastoral days of our ancestors when romans lived close to the earth close to their flocks and close to the gods who gave to roma the gifts of fertility and abundance citizens in recent years because of the interruptions of war many rituals have been neglected or performed in a perfunctory manner the lupercalia has been run with a very scant contingent and with little joy but to neglect our religious obligations is to neglect our ancestors to perform our vital rituals with bare adequacy is to give merely adequate worship to the gods today i am pleased to say we have a very full and very robust gathering to run the lupercalia our beloved city has been depopulated by the misfortunes of war many fine men have been lost but with the snapping of their sacred thongs let these runners set in motion the repopulation of roma let every woman of childbearing age offer her wrist let there be rejoicing and abundance citizens the priests have observed the auspices for this day the auspices are good therefore with the raising of my hand i gaius julius caesar your dictator declare that the lupercalia may begin to a burst of applause from the crowd the runners set off their course would take them to various points all over the city and they would run the circuit three times in all lucius stayed close to antonius he liked the familiar way the man treated him as if they were old drinking companions or fellow warriors leaning in close to crack a joke about the sagging backside of one of the participating magistrates or to make lewd comments about the women gathered along the way at the sight of antonius women whispered and giggled teasing one another to step forward and present their wrists to be slapped how effortless it was for antonius to flirt with them when antonius saw that lucius hung back he encouraged him to put himself forward growl at themthey love that run a circle around them dont be afraid to look them straight in the eye and up and down imagine youre a wolf picking out the plumpest of the sheep but marcus im not sure i have the nonsense you heard your uncle young manthis is your religious duty just follow me and do as i do call for some courage from that amulet you wear lucius took a deep breath and did as he was told with antonius leading the way it was easy he felt the power of his legs as they carried him forward and the rush of breath in his lungs he saw the grinning faces of the girls gathered along the course and he grinned back at them he snapped his thong in the air threw back his head and howled a sense of euphoria came over him and the sacred nature of the ritual became manifest to him when he had run the lupercalia before he had performed his duty by rote without abandoning himself to the spirit of the occasion what was different about this day he was a man for one thing and antonius was beside him and his greatuncle gaius was the undisputed ruler of roma presiding over the worlds rebirth the great fountainhead of the earths fecundity which found expression in the lupercalia surged through lucius when he slapped the wrist of a giddy laughing girl with his thong he felt a connection to something divine such as he had never experienced before the sensation manifested itself physically as well from time to time he felt a pleasant stirring and a heaviness between his legs he stole a glance at antoniuss sex and saw that his friend was mildly excited as well antonius saw the change in lucius and laughed there you go young man thats the spirit they finished the first circuit and ran back through the forum where an even larger crowd had gathered before the rostra people wanted to be present for the end of the run and the public feast that would follow as the runners passed the rostra caesar remained seated on his throne but raised his arm in salute wait here for me said antonius to lucius he broke from the pack and mounted the rostra taking giant steps from somewherehe had not been carrying it beforehe produced a diadem made of gold and wrapped with laurel leaves he held the diadem aloft so that everyone in the crowd could see he knelt before caesar then rose and held the crown above caesars head the crowd reacted with surprise this was not a part of the ritual of lupercalia some laughed some cheered a few dared to jeer and groan with disapproval caesar suppressed a smile managing to look very grave he raised his hand and prevented antonius from placing the crown on his head the crowd applauded and cheered caesar sat motionless only his eyes moved scanning the crowd closely observing their reaction with his upraised hand he made a dismissive gesture indicating that antonius should continue the run what was that about said lucius when antonius rejoined the pack in one hand antonius still held the diadem in the other his goathide thong he shrugged the glare off your greatuncles bald spot was blinding me i thought it needed something to cover it marcus be serious to a man of caesars years there is nothing more serious than a bald spot marcus but antonius would say no more he growled and howled and leaped toward a group of young women who screamed with excitement lucius followed him anxious to regain the euphoria he had experienced during the first circuit when they ran through the forum to make the second pass before the rostra the crowd had grown even larger again antonius broke away and ran onto the platform again he displayed the diadem to the crowd a number of people began to chant crown him crown him others chanted never a king never a crown never a king never a crown like a mime on a stage antonius made a great show of trying to place the diadem on caesars brow again caesar gently refused it waving his hand as if to ward off a buzzing insect the crowds reaction was even more enthusiastic than before they cheered and stamped their feet antonius withdrew and rejoined the pack marcus what is going on said lucius antonius grunted caesar is my commander i was thinking that vulnerable bald spot could use a bit of strategic cover marcus this isnt funny antonius shook his head and laughed there is nothing as funny as your greatuncles bald spot he would say no more they completed the third and final circuit an immense crowd had gathered before the rostra made up not only of the pious and those who wished to take advantage of the feast but of many others for word of caesars refusal of a crown had spread through the city when antonius mounted the rostra the competing chants were deafening crown him crown him never a king never a crown never a king never a crown a third time antonius moved to place the diadem on caesars head a third time caesar refused it the applause was thunderous caesar rose to his feet he raised his hands for silence he took the diadem from antonius and held it high above his head the crowd watched in suspense for a moment it appeared that caesar might crown himself citizens he cried we romans know only one kingjupiter king of the gods marcus antonius take back this diadem and carry it to the temple of jupiter offer it to the god on behalf of gaius julius caesar and the people of roma the applause of the crowd was deafening caesar again raised his hands for silence i declare that the lupercalia has been well and truly run let the feasting begin amid the surging throng lucius stood before the rostra and looked up at his greatuncle he did not know what to think of the performance he had just witnessed nor what to make of the crowds reaction to it it seemed to him that those who chanted crown him had cheered the loudest when caesar refused the crown as if the very act of rejecting the symbol entitled him to the power it represented those who had chanted never a king never a crown had cheered as well were they so foolish as to believe that because caesar refused a diadem he was not in fact their king in politics appearance is everything antonius had once told him still it was all very confusing lucius was also not sure what to make of caesar every man woman and child in roma seemed either to revere or despise the man with great intensity but to lucius caesar had always been uncle gaius a bit larger than life to be sure yet all too human with his preoccupied air his combedover hair and his slightly absurd habit of speaking of himself in the third person caesar had loomed over lucius all his life yet he always seemed a bit distant and aloof indeed whenever the two of them had been alone together lucius had sensed an uneasiness in his greatuncles manner sometimes caesar averted his eyes rather than look lucius in the face why was that a few times luciuss father had made veiled references to a debt owed to the family by caesar but he had never explained lucius sensed that something tragic or shameful had occurred in the past the sort of thing that grownups never discuss in front of children he had an idea though he could not say why that it involved his grandparents julia and lucius the unlucky what had caesar done to them or failed to do probably money was involved or an insult to someones dignity or both whatever the lapse or transgression it was surely a very small matter when compared to the enslavement of gaul or the carnage of the civil war still lucius was curious now that he was a man would he be told what had happened in those mysterious longago days before he was born a month lateron the day before the ides of martiuslucius pinarius attended a dinner party at the house of marcus lepidus on the palatine lepidus had fought under caesar and was now serving as the dictators master of the horse caesar himself was in attendance as were marcus antonius and several other of caesars most trusted officers antonius drank more than anyone else he showed no obvious signs of inebriationhis speech was not slurred his gestures were controlledbut his eyes shone with a mischievous glimmer so commander what is this grand announcement youve assembled us to hear tonight caesar smiled he had kept them in suspense through the fish course and the game course but it seemed that antonius would not submit to eating the custard course without hearing what caesar had to say you become bored and impatient so quickly antonius well i suppose ive become a bit bored myself lately thats why i asked lepidus to invite this particular group for dinner some of you served me in gaul and saw the surrender of vercingetorix some of you served me at pharsalus where we took down pompeius some of you were in alexandria where we made peace among the bickering egyptians despite their treachery and their wiles and some of you were at thapsus where cato met his end youve all been tested by battleor you soon will be he smiled and glanced at lucius you are a select band the cream of romas warriors you are my most trusted men at arms thats why i wanted to meet with you all tonight ahead of the official announcement i shall make tomorrow yes whispered antonius this is about parthia said caesar who refused to let even antonius utter the word before him ive reached my decision regarding the feasibility of an invasion of parthia there was a stir of movement around the room everyone knew what caesar must be about to say but the magnitude of it was so great that it could not seem entirely real until the words were actually said aloud and said antonius fidgeting like a boy caesar laughed patience antonius patience the custard course is on its way we shall be enjoying tender bits of fowl and pork in an egg custard spiced with garumisnt that right lepidus lepidus has one of the finest cooks on the palatine commander please very well the custard will have to wait caesar cleared his throat i suppose i should stand up for this and all of you should reach for your cups my good friends tomorrow caesar shall put forward a request to the senateand the senate i feel certain will consent this elicited mild laughter caesar shall request a new command the specific purpose of this command will be a military campaign againstantonius you look fit to burst there was more laughter until at last caesar said the word they were waiting to hear parthia parthia they shouted raising their cups so the rumor was true thought lucius draining his cup with the rest his greatuncle not satisfied to have mastered the whole of the mediterranean world had set his sights on yet another conquest the land of the ancient persians which since its conquest by alexander had become the kingdom of parthia in all the known world parthia was the only power that could possibly rival roma when lucius was nine years old a man named marcus licinius crassus who was famous for putting down the great slave revolt led by spartacus led a roman army to engage the parthians using syria as his base of operations crassus had been the richest man in roma and the political equal of pompeius and caesar for a while the three of them formed the socalled triumvirate which temporarily stabilized the rivalry between them even as each plotted for a greater share of power crassuss bid for fortune had been his invasion of parthia he had hoped to accomplish there what caesar was already accomplishing in gaul reaping wealth and gloryexcept that the fabulous spoils of parthia would far exceed anything to be taken in gaul instead crassus met nemesis at the battle of carrhae his army was surrounded and subjected to a relentless barrage of armorpiercing parthian arrows leading a cavalry unit to try to break through the parthian lines crassuss son publius was killed his head was cut off and used to taunt his beleaguered father after the loss of twenty thousand roman soldiers and the capture of ten thousand more the parthians offered crassus a truce then betrayed him and killed him and beheaded him as they had his son the parthians celebrated their triumph over the invading romans with great pomp and presented the head of the crassus as a gift to their ally the king of armenia who reputedly used it in a production of euripides play the bacchae crassus had hoped to be head of the world instead his head became a stage prop the shadow of crassuss defeat had haunted the romans ever since the parthians loomed as the great unconquered enemy to the east now that civil war had settled the power struggle within the fractured republic it seemed only natural that the master of roma should turn his attention to parthia let me say outright that the military prowess of the parthians must not be discounted said caesar but nor should it be overestimated we must not be put off by the defeat of crassus to be candid as a commander he was not the equal of any man hereand i include you lucius untested as you are as a junior officer crassus served sulla well but he was always overshadowed by pompeius true he put down the slave revolt of spartacus but afterward the senate refused to reward him with a triumph and for good reason it would have been unseemly for a roman to celebrate a victory over an army of slaves the parthian campaign was crassuss desperate attempt to make his mark as a military man he overreached even so said antonius if were taking on the parthians i intend to make sure my will is in order the grim joke was typical of his humor especially when he was drinking antoniuss remark was greeted by goodnatured booing from the others but caesar dismissed their objections antonius speaks wisely my own will is kept safe by the vestal virgins a man must think ahead to the day when all that remains of him is his name as long as men speak his name his glory lives as for worldly possessions great or small a man should take steps to see that they are disbursed as he sees fit caesar glanced at lucius and then at antonius but the significance of his glances was hard to read what provisions might caesars will contain no one knew caesar was king in all but name but he was a king with no clear heir he had never acknowledged the son of cleopatra as his own rumors attested that marcus junius brutus who had fought against caesar and been pardoned by him was caesars bastard but caesar himself had never acknowledged the possibility caesars closest male relations were the offspring of his two sistershis nephew quintus pedius who had served him in gaul and his young grandnephews gaius octavius and lucius pinarius of the three only lucius was present at the dinner the other two were away from roma on military duties antonius took note of their absence a pity that your other two nephews couldnt be here tonight yes but all three shall have the opportunity to cover themselves with glory in the parthian campaign quintus is already battletested as for gaius caesars eyes lit up he was very fond of gaius octavius hes only eighteen but full of spirit he reminds me of myself at that age despite his misfortunes in the last yearillness and shipwreckhe managed to take part in the final push against the pompeian remnants in spain and he acquitted himself well he lost his father when he was only four i too lost my father when i was young so ive done my best to look after him hes not a bad orator either he had the best possible teacher said antonius caesar shook his head not i it comes to him naturally i still remember the eulogy he delivered at the funeral of his grandmother when he was only twelve and what of this fellow said antonius smiling at lucius for a moment lucius was afraid that the man would reach over and muss his hair as if he were still a boy listening to caesar praise his cousin gaius made lucius feel acutely aware of his own lack of accomplishments lucius is only beginning his career said caesar but i have my eye on him parthia will give him the chance to show the world what hes made of to the parthian campaign then said lucius impulsively seizing his cup and lifting it high to the parthian campaign said antonius he and the others joined the toast caesar nodded approvingly there was more food and more wine the conversation shifted lepidus remarked on the fact that caesar had seen fit to restore the statues of sulla and of pompeius which had been pulled down and smashed by the mob in the wake of caesars victory why had caesar put his enemies back on their pedestals lepidus you know that it has always been caesars policy to show clemency vindictiveness gains a man nothing in the long run sulla despite his crimes and pompeius despite his fatal mistakes were both great romans they deserve to be remembered and so by caesars order the gilded statue of sulla on horseback will soon be back on its pedestal near the rostra already the statue of pompeius has returned to its place of honor in the assembly room at the theater pompeius built on the field of mars thats where the senate will meet tomorrow the statue of pompeius shall witness my request for the parthian command he took a bite of custard and smiled it was good of pompeius to provide roma with its first permanent theater we shall remember him for that if for nothing else as for sulla he was a political dunce to give up his dictatorship but if he hadnt done so where would caesar be today where would we all be asked antonius who saw the occasion for another toast lucius at last felt sufficiently emboldened by wine and by the camaraderie of the others to join in the conversation uncle he said may one be so bold as to ask your intentions for roma what do you mean young man i mean your intentions for the city itself theres a rumor that you may move the capital to the ancient site of troy or even to alexandria caesar looked at him archly however do such rumors get started why troy i wonder lucius shrugged my tutors claim theres an ancient link between troy and roma long ago even before the days of romulus and remus the trojan warrior aeneas survived the fall of his city fled across the sea and settled near the tiber his bloodline flows in the blood of the romans and for that reason i should abandon the city of my birth and make my capital at troy said caesar to be sure its location on the coast of asia makes it a central point between east and west especially if our possessions are expanded into parthia and beyond but no i wont build a new capital at troy and why would i move the capital to alexandria the reason for that rumor is obvious i suppose between roma and egypt there now exists shall we say a special relationship you did place a statue of queen cleopatra in your new temple of venus right beside the goddess herself noted antonius i did it seemed to me an appropriate gesture to commemorate her state visit as for alexandria its a very old very sophisticated city a city founded by a conqueror and accustomed to the rule of kings said antonius nonetheless i have no intention of making it the worlds capital but you can see uncle said lucius why people become so upset by such rumors theyre afraid that if you take the treasury and the state bureaucracy elsewhere roma will be reduced to a provincial backwater and the senate will become little more than a city council caesar laughed amusing as that notion may be i have no intention of moving the capital i suppose i should make that clear in my address to the senators tomorrow to allay their worries the gods themselves decreed that roma should be the center of the world so it always shall be far from abandoning the city i have plans to enlarge and enrich it my engineers are working on a scheme to divert the course of the tiber and to build breakwaters along the coast so as to make ostia as great a harbor as carthage was think what a boon that will be for romas commerce and speaking of carthage said antonius caesar nodded yes already ive begun to build new colonies at carthage and at corinth the two great cities that our forefathers destroyed in a single year the greeks will praise the rebirth of corinth and the colony at carthage fulfills the old thwarted dream of gaius gracchus yes great plans are afoot great plans the conversation became looser as more wine flowed lucius noticed that caesar imbibed considerably less than the others and antonius considerably more it was lepidus who brought up the subject of death we all know how sulla died in bed of a horrible disease but to the very end he behaved like a cruel tyrant ordering the death of another crassus too met a wretched end after pharsalus pompeius sailed to egypt hoping to make a final stand but the minions of king ptolemy stabbed him to death before he could set foot on shore then delivered his head as a trophy to caesar after the battle of thapsus cato fell on his sword but his loyal servants found him and stitched him up he had to wait until they slept to tear out the stitches with his fingers and finish his own disembowelment and your point in recounting this grisly catalogue lepidus asked antonius death comes in many forms if a man could choose what would be the best death caesar spoke at once sudden and unexpected even if bloody and painful that would be much preferable to a lingering death of all the episodes you mention lepidus the death of pompeius was best the others all saw the shadow of death long before it reached them and must have contemplated it with dread but up to the very last pompeius still possessed hope however fragile and his end came as a surprise however shocking to be sure his body was defiled but when i came into possession of his remains i saw to it that they were purified and given the proper rites his ghost is at peace the dinner drew to an end the guests took their leave caesar declared his intention to walk alone with lucius to the house of his parents theres a private matter which i should like to discuss with my nephew he said looking at lucius and then averting his eyes alone just the two of you said antonius why not at least a few of us should go with you said antonius for your protection if you need privacy we can stay a few paces behind caesar shook his head toward what end has caesar done so much to please the people of roma with great public feasts and entertainments if not to make it safe for himself to walk across the city without a bodyguard thats a fine notion said antonius but in reality no antonius i wont walk the streets of my city in fear of my life a man dies only once the dread of death causes far more misery than the thing itself and i shall not submit to it its only a short walk from here to the house of lucius and an even shorter walk from there to my house i shall be perfectly safe antonius began to protest but caesar silenced him with a look as the two of them crossed the palatine hill alone under moonlight lucius as always felt a bit uncomfortable in his greatuncles presence and sensed that caesar felt uneasy as well several times caesar began to speak then fell silent the worlds greatest general and secondgreatest oratorfor even caesar ceded the highest place to the eloquent ciceroseemed unable to express himself to hades with this he finally muttered i shall say it as plainly as i can lucius your grandfather the one they call unlucky yes he did me a very great favor once he saved my life how did he do that uncle this is very difficult to talk about in fact ive never told this story to anyone but you deserve to know the truth about your grandparents lucius and the sacrifice they made for my sake this was during sullas dictatorship at the height of the proscriptions i was very young only a year or so older than you are now i was in great danger i was also very ill suffering from the quartan ague he looked up at the moon by its soft light lucius caught a glimpse of the youth caesar once had been maybe thats why i refuse to fear death now i had enough of fearing death when i was young anyway i was skulking from house to house hiding from sullas henchmen but at the home of your grandparents a fellow named phagites caught up with me he proceeded to tell lucius about the bribe that luciuss grandfather paid to save his life and later in the presence of sulla himself the extraordinary sacrifice that was required of julia and lucius the unluckythe dissolution of their marriage when caesar refused to divorce his wife at sullas whim your grandmother was heartbroken but she adapted swiftly that was her nature but your grandfather was never the same he was a broken man he had acted honorably yet he felt dishonored he saw no way to right the wrong that had been done to him if he had lived eventually i might have found some way to make recompense some means to help him regain his selfrespect but he died while he was still quite young and before i could make my mark on the world they had been strolling at a slow pace caesar abruptly halted do you know how he died he fell on a patch of ice yes do you know where lucius shrugged somewhere here on the palatine i think it was on the very spot where we now stand under the silver moonlight it was not hard to imagine the paving stones glazed with ice lucius shivered by your reckoning uncle his was a good deathswift and without warning perhaps the gods granted him an early death as a kind of mercy perhaps but the debt i owed to your grandfather has weighed upon me ever since not even the gods can change the past and the dead are beyond our reach but i can make certain that you lucius will have every opportunity to earn your own place of honor i would have done so anyway because youre my kin but i wanted you to know of your grandfathers sacrifice so that between the two of us there is an understanding of what came before i should be gratified to see you attain the dignity that your grandfather believed he had lost lucius considered this thank you for telling me uncle im not sure what else i can say silently he wondered about the words caesar had spoken with such gravity what did dignity and honor mean now in a world ruled by a king the ancient course of honor with each man competing against equals to become first man in the state had become meaningless caesar seemed to read his thoughts in the future the course of honor will not have quite the same significance as it did for our ancestors but ambitious men will still be able to earn romas gratitude along with personal wealth and glory on the battlefield shall i confide a secret to you lucius something i havent shared even with antonius he commenced walking again in the direction of luciuss house my military ambitionsmy ambitions for romaare even greater than antonius and the others assume the idea of conquering parthia greatly excites them as you saw but that is as far as their imaginations can reach caesars plans extend far beyond the conquest of parthia my dream is to take parthia yesand then to traverse the far side of the euxine sea and circle back conquer scythia and germania and all the lands that border them cross the channel to britannia and then return to italy by way of gaul ending where i began when caesar is finished romas dominion will comprise a true world empire bounded on every side by ocean lucius was awed by the grandeur of this vision he was flattered that caesar should confide in him but caesar was not finished no such empire has ever existed before even alexanders empire was not as farflung and of course upon his death the lands alexander conquered did not remain unified but were divided among his heirs with a great deal of confusion and bloodshed alexanders general ptolemy did the best when he took egypt queen cleopatra is his direct descendent but what will happen to romas empire when i die lucius will it be a single kingdom with a single ruler will it be carefully divided into many kingdoms all closely allied or will it be splintered into rival kingdoms each at war with the other might it not become a republic again uncle caesar smiled as if at a whimsical notion anything is possible i supposeeven that no man of my generation could find a way to make the republic work but perhaps men of a later day will be able to do so meanwhile i think ahead i do my best to shape the course of the future it may be that i will live to be very old and that i will work out a means to pass on my legacy intact or i may die tonight as my father and his father died struck down by the gods without warning at present my will provides for my heirs and of course you are among them lucius but if my power endures and if my plans come to fruition more complicated arrangements will be required i tell you all this lucius because it may be that the gods have in mind for you a very special destiny through your descent from the julii you are the offspring of venus no less than i myself through your fathers line you carry one of the oldest names in romas history the pinarii are very ancientbut you lucius are very young youve accomplished nothing as yet but neither have you made mistakes prepare yourself be loyal to me prove yourself in battle observe the conduct of other men adopt their virtues and avoid their vices im thinking specifically of antonius i know you feel close to him but you have it in you to become a far better man than he is lucius frowned you place great trust in antonius i do but im not blind to his faults having been taken so deeply into caesars confidence lucius felt emboldened to ask him about the incident a month earlier when antonius had three times offered caesar the diadem during the lupercalia you were there said caesar you saw all that took place what did you think i think you staged the incident like a play to test the citizens reaction to a crown when you saw that so many disapproved you reassured them that you had no desire to be their king caesar nodded in politics reality and appearance are of equal importance you cannot attend to one and neglect the other a man must determine both what he is and what others believe him to be its a tricky business this matter of crowns and titles shall i tell you another secret lucius nodded tomorrow before the debate regarding the parthian command one of my loyal senators will make an announcement regarding the sibylline books it appears that the priests in charge of interpreting the verses have discovered a most remarkable passage which indicates that the parthians can be conquered only by a king i refused the diadem that was offered to me by antonius at the lupercalia to the applause of the people but what if the senate should implore caesar to accept a royal title to ensure the conquest of parthia you will become a king then said lucius and this will happen tomorrow caesar smiled wryly this is the plan the senate will declare that caesar is king of all roman provinces outside italy with the right to wear a crown in any place other than italy on land or sea this technicality will satisfy both caesars need for authority and the need of the senate and the citizens to believe themselves free of a king caesar will be king of the rest of the world on romas behalf lucius frowned auguries and omens and the sibylline booksare they merely tools for men to use do they not truly express the will of the gods perhaps both propositions are true auguries and the rest are tools yes and the man who masters those tools does so because he is favored by the gods it is a remarkable thing how frequently divine will coincides with the designs of successful men caesar smiled of course not every omen is favorable if i listened to every warning i receive from every soothsayer on every street corner in roma i might never leave my house and i certainly would not venture out to address the senate tomorrow have you received a specific warning too many to relate shooting stars goats born twoheaded tears from statues letters mysteriously formed in the sandall sorts of portents have been brought to my attention in the last month some of these warnings specifically cite the ides of martius as a day of ill omen thats one reason antonius has been playing mother hen lately he thinks i should be surrounded by a bodyguard at all times but caesar has decided to ignore these socalled omens and do as he wishes their quiet conversation was abruptly interrupted by loud voices from a side street a group of men was heading straight toward them caesar seized luciuss arm and pulled him into a doorway the men began to sing loudly and badly out of tune they were obviously drunk one of them spotted the two figures in the shadows of the doorway and stepped closer peering at them numas balls if it isnt the spawn of venus himselfour beloved dictator who shouted one of his companions gaius julius caesar you liar no i swear come see for yourselves the men crowded around the doorway recognizing caesar they were briefly awed then began a buffoonish mime of bowing and prostrating themselves king caesar they cried all hail the king caesar showed no fear he smiled and graciously acknowledged their gestures with a nod one of them staggered back and flung out his arms miming a crucifixion look at me im a pirate oh great caesar have mercy on me another pulled his tunic up to hide his head look at me im pompeius after he landed in egypt merciful caesar give me back my head and im the queen of the nile said another mincing about and putting his fists inside his tunic to mime enormous breasts ravish me great caesar our baby will be the next king of egypt they continued with their buffoonery for a while then seemed to forget what they were doing waving goodbye they moved on and broke into another song only when they were out of sight did caesar relax his grip on luciuss arm lucius looked at his greatuncles face in the moonlight caesars eyes glittered with a peculiar excitement however briefly caesar had felt a moment of genuine fear its passing seemed to have left him neither angry nor shaken but exhilarated the next day was the ides of martius lucius awoke drenched with sweat his room was dark the faint blue light that precedes the dawn silhouetted the shutters drawn across his window somewhere in the distance a cock was crowing he had been experiencing one of those strange dreams in which the dreamer is both participant and observer aware that he is dreaming and yet unable to stop the dream in it caesar had died a great multitude had gathered to hear the reading of his will on the steps of a temple a vestal virgin produced a scroll and handed it to marcus antonius antonius unrolled the document and proceeded to read lucius stood at the front of the crowd but strain as he might he could not hear the names being read the roar of the crowd was too great he wanted to tell the others to be quiet but he could not open his mouth to speak he could not move at all antonius continued to read but lucius could not hear speak or move the dream was not exactly a nightmare yet he awoke feeling shaken and covered with sweat he staggered from his bed and opened the shutters the cock crowed again the view from his window showed a jumble of rooftops the irregular spires of cypress trees and a glimpse of the temple of jupiter atop the capitoline rebuilt since its destruction by fire in sullas time all was bathed in soft light the world might have been made of ancient weathered marble without color or sharp edges lucius filled his lungs with cool bracing air the glaze of sweat evaporated from his flesh and left him covered with goosebumps the dream had been oppressive and disturbing but now he was awake the world was just as he had left it and the first glimmer of sunlight across the rooftops marked the beginning of a day like any other and yet in a matter of hours caesar would receive the senates command to begin the conquest of parthia he would be declared king of all provinces beyond italy the age of the republic would end and a new age would begin anxious to leave his room and his uneasy dream behind lucius quickly dressed he put on his best tunic which was bright blue with a yellow hem and strapped on his best pair of shoes when the people began cheering caesars decision to wage war against parthia it would not do for caesars young kinsman to be seen wearing his secondbest he left the house and wandered aimlessly for a while watching the city awaken at the great houses on the palatine slaves opened front doors to air the vestibules extinguished the lamps that had burned all night and swept the thresholds between two houses lucius caught a distant view of the forum boarium and the tiber waterfront down in the marketplace merchants were setting up shop many had special displays of baskets stuffed with food customers were already lining up to buy the baskets lucius had forgotten that this was the feast day of anna perenna a holiday celebrated only by the plebeians anna perenna was the crone goddess always portrayed with gray hair a wrinkled face and a stooped back she wore a traveling cloak and carried baskets stuffed with food her legend dated to the early days of the republic when the plebeians staged their first socalled secession withdrawing en masse from the city to protest the special privileges of the patricians and to demand tribunes for their protection when the plebeians ran low on provisions an old woman calling herself anna perenna appeared among them with baskets of food no matter how much food people took from the baskets the baskets remained miraculously full and so the plebs never went hungry after the secession anna perenna vanished never to be seen again on the day sacred to her the ides of martius plebeian families left the city to picnic on the banks of the tiber they gathered their own baskets of food or bought readymade baskets at the market they pitched small tents and laid out blankets children played games with balls and sticks in the grass young couples courted in leafy bowers everyone ate and drank their fill then dozed on the banks of the river at sundown the plebeian families would stream back into the city in an informal procession singing songs of praise to anna perenna the holiday meant little to lucius being a patrician he had never taken part still strolling across the forum passing families on their way to the river carrying food baskets blankets and toys he found their festive mood infectious it further amused him to think that among all these carefree revelers he alone knew what a momentous and memorable day this would turn out to be thanks to the special requests that caesar would put before the senate thinking of caesar lucius walked to the area directly north of the ancient forum where a large tract of land had in recent years been cleared and rebuilt by his greatuncle and named after him the julian forum was surrounded by a vast rectangular portico of gleaming marble columns at one end stood the new temple dedicated to venus constructed of solid marble the fulfillment of a vow caesar had made to the goddess before his victory at pharsalus in front of the temple was a fountain adorned with nymphs dominating the open square was a magnificent statue of caesar armored for battle and sitting atop a white charger work on the forum was not finished when it was done the portico would open onto courtrooms and legal offices the comings and goings of scribes secretaries judges and advocates would make the julian forum one of the busiest spots in roma as it was on this morning lucius was the only person present he walked under the statue of caesar amused to see the very grave look on his greatuncles face then past the fountain which was full of water but not splashing its still face reflected the perfect proportions and dazzling marble facade of the temple of venus lucius mounted the steps a temple slave dozing beside the doorway stirred at his approach recognizing luciusthe dictators kinsmen were frequent visitors to the temple of their ancestressthe slave hastily opened the doors for him in luciuss opinion the inside of the temple was the most beautiful interior space in all of roma perhaps in all the world the floors walls ceiling and columns were made of solid marble in a staggering array of colors and newly finished so that every surface gleamed with a mirrorlike polish the facing walls of the short vestibule were decorated by two of the most famous paintings in the world the ajax and the medea by the renowned artist timomachus within the sanctuary displayed in six cabinets were the extraordinary collections of jewels and gemstones which caesar had acquired in his travels to lucius the most fascinating item was a savagelooking breastplate strung with tiny pearls from the island of britannia at the far end of the chamber magnificent upon her pedestal stood venus herself as captured in marble by arcesilaus the most highly paid sculptor in the world the goddess stood with one arm bent back to touch her shoulder and her other arm slightly extended one of her breasts was bare the molding of her serene features and the folds of her thin gown were extraordinarily delicate next to venus stood an equally impressive statue of cleopatra executed in bronze and covered with gold the queen was portrayed not in the outlandish garb of the pharaohs which the ptolemies had appropriated when they assumed the rule of egypt but in elegant greek dress more chastely covered than venus and wearing a simple diadem on her brow to luciuss eye cleopatra was not a particularly beautiful womancertainly not as beautiful as the idealized image of venus beside herbut the sculptor had nonetheless managed to capture that indefinable quality that had so captivated a man like caesar caesars decision to place her statue in the new temple of venus had sparked intense speculation about his intentions if the purpose of the temple was to honor his ancestress what place did the queen of egypt have there unless caesar intended to make her the mother of his own descendents lucius had met the queen only once when she first arrived in roma for her state visit during the feasting and entertainments lucius had been briefly introduced to her as one of caesars young relatives the queen had been gracious but aloof lucius had been completely tonguetied since then caesar had installed cleopatra at a sumptuous garden estate on the farther bank of the tiber where the queen had hosted a number of lavish dinners to introduce herself to the citys elite staring up at her statue lucius felt a sudden impulse to pay her a visit why not caesars overtures to him the previous night emboldened him lucius was not just one of the great mans heirs he was caesars confidante he had as much right to pay a social call on the queen of egypt as any other roman to be sure he was not formally outfitted in his toga but he was wearing his best tunic he turned about left the temple and headed for the bridge across the tiber passing through the marketplace in the forum boarium he was surrounded by plebeians on their way to celebrate the feast of anna perenna there were so many of them heading out of the city that there was a queue to cross the bridge on the other side the picnickers drifted toward the public grounds along the riverbank but lucius pressed further on toward the grand private estates that fronted the most desirable stretch of the tiber here the wealthy of roma had their second homes outside the city where they could relax in their gardens pursue the fashionable hobby of beekeeping and go boating and swimming in the river at one of the grandest of these houses owned by caesar cleopatra had taken up residence when lucius knocked at the gate an egyptian slave his eyes outlined with kohl peered at him through the peephole lucius announced himselflucius pinarius greatnephew of gaius julius caesarand a few moments later the slave opened the gate the big man peered beyond him only you he said in greek lucius laughed i suppose the queen has very few visitors who arrive without an entourage and on foot but yes its only me my uncle is otherwise engaged today as the queen probably knows he was conducted to a sunny garden with a view of the river the garden was formally laid out with manicured shrubs gravel paths and carefully pruned rose bushes tucked amid the shrubbery were quaint pieces of greek statuary lucius noticed one of a winged eros kneeling down to touch a butterfly and another of a young boy absorbed in pulling a thorn from his foot lucius sat on a stone bench and gazed at the sparkles of morning sunlight on the river youre as pretty as a statue lucius stood and turned to see the queen standing nearby please remain seated she said i was enjoying the sight of you you looked like another statue in the garden roman boy contemplating the tiber im not a boy your majesty said lucius bristling slightly i would have worn my toga but roman men and their togas im afraid they always look slightly ridiculous to me the men or the togas cleopatra smiled youre a sharp one she said and of course youre not a boy i didnt mean to offend you i know how vexing it can be when one is young but determined to be taken seriously cleopatra herself was no more than twentyfive her statue in the temple made her look older lucius thought as had her royal raiment when he first met her on this day she wore a simple sleeveless linen gown tied at the waist with a goldthreaded sash her hair usually pinned atop her head hung down on either side of her face she wore no diadem the day was early and the queen was not yet dressed for formal visitors its good of you to receive me said lucius i could hardly turn away caesars kinsman is there a celebration my sentinels tell me that all sorts of people are out enjoying themselves along the river does it have something to do with caesars pronouncement to the senate lucius smiled at her mistake the feast of anna perenna is an ancient plebeian holiday it has nothing to do with me or with caesar he wont be speaking to the senate until later this morning i see i have a great deal to learn about roman customs perhaps you could instruct me i your majesty by rights the task should fall to caesar when he was in alexandria i educated him about egyptian court protocol but caesar is much too busy and there are so few people in the city i can trust but youve met many people since you arrived all the best people come to the dinner parties here at your villa yes and they all go away utterly charmed by the queen of egyptor pretending to be so to curry favor with caesar occasionally i receive word of their true reaction that fellow cicero for example to my face the famous advocate was all smiles and flattery behind my back he wrote a letter to a friend complaining that he could hardly stand to be in the same room with me how do you know this she shrugged one didnt survive as a princess in alexandria without learning how to discover the truth frankly i dont see why caesar allows that man to keep his head didnt cicero oppose him in the civil war and fight for pompeius yes brutus opposed him as well but after pharsalus caesar forgave them both caesar is famous for his clemency the queen narrowed her eyes i suppose operating in a republic clemency was a tool of statecraft caesar will learn new ways to deal with his enemies when he finally puts the last vestiges of this primitive form of government behind him primitive lucius drew back his shoulders more than ever he wished he had worn his toga it gave a man a sense of authority roma is much much older than alexandria and i believe the roman republic predates the establishment of your dynasty by almost two hundred years perhaps but when my ancestor ptolemy inherited control of egypt from alexander he assumed the title the royal insignia and the divine status of the pharaohs who preceded him their dynasties can be traced back thousands of years to the very beginning of time by comparison the civilization of the romans is very young infantile in fact the great pyramids were built many centuries before the greeks laid siege to troy and roma was founded hundreds of years after troy fell she frowned the other day i hosted a group of roman scholars to discuss the holdings of the library of alexandria we fell to talking about the origins of roma and they put forward a very novel theory they said that a trojan warrior aeneas escaped the sack of the city sailed to the shores of italy and settled near the tiber and thus the blood of troy survives in the romans but when i asked for evidence they had none i have to wonder whether your scholars are taking a bit of license when they speak of this link between roma and troy there are those admitted lucius who say that historians invent the past cleopatra smiled i would rather invent the future she strolled to a place which afforded a better view of the water downriver tiny in the distance figures could be seen lounging on the bank we know so little of our ancestors really even we who can name them going back many generations i suppose the pinarii are an ancient family there was a pinarius in roma when hercules appeared and killed the monster cacus and the julii must be just as ancient caesar says the line was begun by a union with venus which makes caesar almost as divine as myself he certainly behaves like a god she smiled then frowned while they are on earth the gods do great things but after they leave the earth they fall as silent as dead mortals i frequently pray to the first ptolemy who was most certainly a god i speak but he never speaks back he fought beside alexander bathed beside him ate beside him there are a thousand questions i would like to ask himwhat did alexanders laughter sound like did he snore what did he smell likebut to those questions there are no answers and there never will be the dead are all dust the past is as unknowable as the future when caesar and i are dust will men of the future know only our names and nothing else about us lucius could think of nothing to say he had never heard a woman or a man for that matter speak in such a fashion even caesar tended to ruminate more about troop movements than about matters of eternity cleopatra smiled its curious that im so young and caesar is so oldmore than twice my agewhile the relative ages of our kingdoms are reversed egypt is like a mature queen wealthy worldly covered with jewels sophisticated to her fingertips roma is a brawny brash brawling upstart the two need not be at odds in some ways theyre natural allies as caesar and i are natural allies is that what you are allies to conquer parthia caesar will need the assistance of egypt but surely theres more between you than that watching her graceful movements listening to her speak lucius had begun to see the attraction cleopatra must hold for caesar he had also glimpsed the qualities that must have been so repellent to a man like cicero who believed in the staid silent matronly virtues of roman womanhood for the first time it seemed possible to lucius even likely that caesar intended to divorce his roman wife caesar had a viable excuse calpurnia had failed to give him a son if the king of roma married the queen of egypt would parthia be a gift to their son what would become of caesars other heirs a childish squeal erupted from the far side of the garden two handmaidens appeared looking slightly chagrinned between them stood a tiny boy with upraised arms the women held him by his hands or more precisely restrained him for he was eager to break from them and run to his mother cleopatra laughed and clapped her hands come to me caesarion the child ran toward her a few times lucius thought he would fall but caesarion remained upright for the entire distance he threw himself against his mother and clutched her legs then looked up at lucius shyly he seemed no different from any other child how old is he said lucius three years he looks big for his age good he needs to grow up fast the queen gestured to the handmaidens who came to fetch caesarion and then set about amusing him in the garden now you must excuse me lucius pinarius caesar will call on me later today after his pronouncement to the senate i must prepare myself im glad you came to visit you and i should know one another better lucius headed back to the city he chose a path that led him through the grove of the furies the secluded holy place was deserted and quiet except for the distant singing of revelers along the riverbank passing by the altar lucius recalled the story of gaius gracchus and the terrible fate he had met in this very spot chased to ground by his enemies and killed by a trusted slave who then slew himself luciuss greatgreatgrandfather had been a friend of gaius gracchus or so lucius had been told of the two mens actual dealings with one another lucius knew nothing he recalled something that cleopatra had said we know so little of our ancestors really even we who can name them going back many generations it was true what did lucius know about those who had come before him he knew their names from the lists kept by his family of marriages and offspring and from the official records that listed the magistrates of the republic about some of them he had heard an anecdote or two although the details often differed depending upon who told the story in the vestibule of his fathers house there were wax images of some of the ancestors so that lucius had an idea of what they had looked like but of the men and women themselvestheir dreams and passions their failures and triumphshe knew virtually nothing his ancestors were strangers to him until the previous night he had not even known of the terrible sacrifice made by his grandparents to save caesars life how much more did he not know the magnitude of this ignorance overwhelmed himso many lives so full of incident and feeling lost to his knowledge completely and forever what had cleopatra said the past is as unknowable as the future he suddenly perceived his existence as a tiny point illuminated by the thinnest crack of lightthe nowpoised between two infinities of darknessbefore and after he left the grove crossed the bridge and wandered across the forum boarium close by the temple of hercules stood the ara maxima the most ancient altar in all of roma dedicated to hercules who had saved the people from cacus had there really been a hercules and a cacus a hero and a monster so the priests declared and the historians agreed so the monument attested if the story was true there had been a pinarius among the romans even then and the pinarii up until the early days of the republic had been assigned the sacred duty of maintaining the ara maxima and celebrating the feast of hercules they had shared this duty with a family called the potitii which no longer existed why had the pinarii abandoned the duty what had become of the potitii lucius did not know from the temple of hercules he heard a man calling shoo shoo a temple slave appeared at the open doorway wielding a horsetail whisk to drive a fly from the sanctuary everyone knew that flies were forbidden to enter the temple because flies had swarmed about hercules and confounded him when he fought against cacus nor could dogs come near because the dog of hercules had failed to warn him of the monsters approach these things must have occurred or else why did rituals exist to commemorate them many lifetimes later lucius recalled the story of the romans trapped by the gauls atop the capitoline the geese raised the alarm while the dogs failed to bark to commemorate that event each year a dog was impaled on a stake and paraded through the city along with one of junos sacred geese carried in a litter the first time lucius had witnessed this spectacle as a child he had been puzzled and revolted by it until his father had explained its meaning now when he saw the ritual each year lucius found it reassuring a reminder both of the citys past and of his own childhood and the first time he had seen the procession thinking of all the many rituals that took place during the year and all the traditions of the ancestors which had been so scrupulously preserved over the centuries lucius felt comforted religion existed to honor and placate the gods but did it not also make the past and the future a little less mysterious and therefore less frightening lost in thought lucius wandered homeward turning a corner he realized that he was very near the house of brutus an impulse had caused lucius to call upon cleopatra an equally spontaneous impulse now prompted him to pay a visit to brutus who according to rumor was another of caesars possible heirs everyone knew that caesar had been the lover of brutuss mother servilia the fact had come out before lucius was born and on the floor of the senate of all places servilia was the halfsister of cato grandson of the famous cato who had called for the destruction of carthage cato had been one of caesars bitterest enemies twenty years ago during a heated debate in the senate regarding an alleged conspiracy by the populist catilina caesar had been seen to receive a note from a messenger cato suspecting it might implicate caesar in the plot insisted that he read the note aloud caesar refused cato grew more suspicious and more vehement until finally caesar relented and read the message aloud it was a love note from servilia catos sister cato was humiliated caesar was much amused from that day his affair with servilia was public knowledge and the speculation began that he might be the father of her son marcus junius brutus the special regard in which caesar had always held brutus even when brutus sided with pompeius had further fueled this speculation whatever their relationship brutus was among the men whom caesar had chosen to fill various posts when he began rebuilding the government currently brutus was praetor in charge of the city but in the coming year he would leave for macedonia to serve as provincial governor because caesars parthian campaign might keep the dictator from roma for an indefinite period all such appointments had been made not for the usual one year but for five years brutus was also a key member of the senate and it occurred to lucius that he might already have left home heading for the field of mars and the meeting of the senate at the assembly hall in the theater of pompeius but evidently brutus was still at home for as lucius drew nearer to brutuss house he saw several men in redbordered senatorial togas being admitted at the front door lucius assumed they must be gathering before heading off in a group to the assembly hall clearly it was not a good time for lucius to pay a visit nonetheless he continued in the same direction toward brutuss house suddenly he heard the sound of many footsteps behind him a large group of men caught up with him and swept past him lucius saw a blur of togas and glimpsed several familiar faces some of the senators must surely have recognized him but not one of them uttered a greeting they averted their eyes from him as they hurried on whispering among themselves he thought he heard them speak his name it was very strange the senators reached the house of brutus rapped on the door and disappeared inside lucius arrived at the threshold and stared dumbly at the door what was going on in the house of brutus something was not right it occurred to him that the senators might have been bringing bad newssomething to do with caesar perhaps lucius gathered his nerve and rapped on the door a peephole opened lucius gave his name he was perused by a pair of unblinking eyes the peephole closed lucius was left waiting for so long that he decided he had been forgotten and was about to leave then the door opened a grimlooking slave admitted him to the vestibule wait here said the slave and disappeared lucius slowly paced back and forth he looked at the busts of the ancestors in their niches paying only scant attention until he saw one that was clearly honored above all the others placed in a special niche with votive candles in sconces at either side the mask looked very very old it was a famous face known to every roman from public statues all over the city thats only a copy of course said a voice wax masks dont last forever and more than one branch of the family lay claim to him so there had to be duplicates still that mask is very ancient and very sacred as you can imagine the candles are kept lit always day and night brutus stood before him curious to see if he could detect a resemblance lucius looked from the face of brutus to the face of his famous ancestor and namesakethe man who had been the nephew of the last king tarquinius who had revenged the rape of lucretia who had helped to overthrow the monarchy and had become first consul who had watched his own sons be put to death for betraying the republic lucius frowned you dont look anything alike as far as i can see no even so i think we may share a similar destiny at any rate his example inspires me especially today was brutus feverish it seemed to lucius that the mans eyes glittered unnaturally why have you come said brutus im not sure i happened to be passing i saw your visitors arriving it seemed to me that somethingthat perhaps something was wrong his voice trailed away as another man appeared behind brutus gaius cassius longinus was brutuss brotherinlaw married to his sister he was one of the senators who had swept past lucius in the street lucius nodded to him good day to you cassius cassius did not return the greeting he whispered in brutuss ear he looked tense and pale the two exchanged more whispers and cast furtive glances at lucius they appeared to be arguing and trying to come to some decision lucius began to find their scrutiny unnerving brutus gripped cassiuss arm and pulled him to the far side of the room but his whisper was so loud that lucius overheard no we agreed alreadycaesar and only caesar no one else otherwise we show ourselves to be no better than cassius cast a cold gaze at lucius silenced brutus with a hiss and pulled him into the next room if they were still whispering lucius could not hear his heartbeat was suddenly so loud in his ears that he could hear nothing else he looked toward the front door it was blocked by the grimfaced slave from the atrium more slaves appeared followed by brutus dont harm him brutus shouted i only want him restrained well hold him here until there was no time to think a thrill of panic ran through lucius and he acted purely by instinct he bolted toward the door but hands on his arms and shoulders held him back he tried to shrug them off but the hands gripped him more firmly with all his strength he pulled free turned around and swung his fists his knuckles connected with the hard jaw of one of the slaves and sent a painful shock through his arm the slave took a swing at him in return and struck a glancing blow across his shoulder lucius struck the man square in the face the slave staggered back blood pouring from his nose now only the slave barring the door stood in his way lucius ran toward him lowered his head and butted the man in the stomach the slave cried out in pain and bent forward clutching his belly lucius pushed him out of the way and managed to slip through the doorway into the street he meant to run in the direction of caesars house but there were already men in the street blocking his way he turned about and ran in opposite direction away from the forum away from the field of mars and the theater of pompeius lucius was young and quick and he knew the streets of the palatine well he gained a good lead on his pursuers he rounded a corner and then another and could not see them behind him at all but he was growing weary he needed refuge he realized that he was near the house of publius servilius casca surely he could trust casca who was deeply indebted to caesar the rotund redcheeked bumbling casca was something of a buffoon it was impossible to imagine him as a menace to anyone lucius paused for a moment to get his bearings then sprinted to the end of the street and rounded a corner there was cascas houseand casca himself standing in the open doorway evidently on his way out but pausing to make sure he hadnt forgotten anything he was reaching into the folds of his voluminous toga searching for something and looking befuddled exhilarated by the run and by his narrow escape lucius drew a deep lungful of air casca startled by his sudden approach gave a jerk and stumbled against the doorjamb casca what are you looking for said lucius gasping if you can hide me half as well even as lucius spoke casca produced the thing he had been searching for in his fist he held a short but very sharp dagger the look in his eyes raised the hackles on luciuss neck lucius heard shouts behind him he had not escaped his pursuers after all he bolted but casca grabbed his arm the man was stronger than he looked he called for slaves to come and help him lucius struggled as he sprang free he felt a searing pain across one forearm cascas blade had scraped him just deeply enough to drawn a line of blood lucius felt sick but he did not dare to stop running the flight continued across the valley of the circus maximus and up the winding streets of the aventine near the temple of juno lucius was sure he had lost them he hid in a doorway his heart pounding and his lungs on fire the trail of blood had thickened on his forearm the shallow wound burned as if he had been seared by a brand where was caesar he must be on his way to the meeting of the senate by now antonius would be with him surely along with others who would defend him but could even antonius be trusted and what if caesar insisted on leaving his bodyguards behind lucius thought of the risk the two of them had taken the previous night walking alone across the palatine and trembled he must reach caesar and warn him but how lucius was a fast runner but even if he sprouted wings and flew caesar would almost certainly arrive at the theater of pompeius ahead of him and if brutus and the rest were already waiting for him lucius had to try he took a deep breath and began to run again down the aventine he ran around the fountain of the appian aqueduct and past the ara maxima he was suddenly very weary his legs turned to lead and his chest seemed to have a tight band of iron across it there were blisters on his feet the shoes he had put on that morning were not good for running still he ran faster than he had thought possible at last the massive facade of the theater loomed before him to avoid accusations of decadence pompeius had dedicated the complex not as a theater but as a temple by a clever architectural trick the rows of theater seats also served as steps leading up to a sanctuary of venus at the summit branching off from the theater itself were several porticos decorated with hundreds of statues these arcades housed shrines gardens shops and public chambers including the large assembly room where the senate was to meet the public square and the broad steps leading up to the main portico were empty lucius had hoped to see the area awash with red and white here the senators in their crimsonbordered togas were accustomed to mill about before going inside they had gone inside already but nonot quite all of them were inside yet lucius spied two figures on the steps near the top they stood close together apparently engaged in a serious conversation lucius hurried across the square and reached the bottom of the steps looking up he could see that one of the men was antonius the other was a senator he vaguely recognized a man named trebonius lucius bounded up the steps the men saw him approaching and broke off their conversation lucius drew near dizzy and gasping for breath he staggered antonius seized his arm to steady him by hercules you look a fright antonius smiled he seemed more amused than alarmed by luciuss appearance whats the matter young man lucius was so out of breath it was difficult to speak caesar he managed to say inside along with everyone else said antonius but whywhy are you not with him antonius raised an eyebrow trebonius here drew me aside to discuss an important matterprivately trebonius gave lucius a stern threatening look but were done with that arent we trebonius we really should go in they havent shut the doors yet have they antonius looked over his shoulder toward the entrance to the assembly hall in front of the massive bronze doors which stood open priests were clearing blood and organs from the stone altar where auspices were taken before the start of each days business antonius whose buoyant mood seemed unshakable smiled and laughed you wouldnt believe the slaughter that just went on over there he said to lucius one poor creature after another sacrificed and cut open to take the omens the first chicken had no heart which rather alarmed the priests caesar ordered another sacrifice and another but the priests kept telling him that the entrails were twisted and all the omens were contrary he finally told them to hades with this nonsense the omens before the battle of pharsalus were just as bad let the senate get on with its business antonius grinned why was he in such a jovial mood lucius stepped back from the two men could even antonius be trusted lucius felt faint spots swam before his eyes the moment seemed unreal and dreamlike he stared at the nearby altar where a priest was mopping up remains the sight of the rag saturated with blood and dripping gore sent a thrill of panic through him he pushed past the two men and raced toward the entrance the hall was an ovalshaped well with seats on either side descending in tiers to the main floor the session had not yet commenced there was a low hubbub of conversation most of the senators had taken their seats but others were milling about on the main floor in front of the chair of stateno one yet dared to call it a throneon which caesar was seated how serene caesar looked how confident in one hand he held a stylus for marking documents he turned the stylus this way and that with nimble fingers the only sign of the nervous excitement he must be feeling on such a momentous day one of the senators tillius cimber stepped toward him bowing slightly as if importuning caesar for a favor caesar apparently found the request inappropriate he shook his head and waved his stylus dismissively instead of withdrawing cimber stepped closer and clutched caesars toga near his shoulder no lucius shouted his voice rang out high and shrill like a boys heads turned toward him caesar looked up saw him and frowned then immediately returned his attention to cimber caesar spoke through clenched teeth take your hand off me cimber instead cimber yanked at the toga so forcefully that caesar was almost pulled from his chair his toga was askew the naked flesh of his shoulder was bared holding fast to caesars toga cimber looked at the others nearby as caesar tried to pull free cimbers expression became frantic what are you all waiting for cried cimber do it do it now the portly casca stepped forward his forehead was beaded with sweat a grimace bared his gums he raised his dagger high in the air the sight elicited gasps and exclamations from all over the hall only caesar appeared not to realize what was about to happen he was still staring at cimber looking angry and confused he turned his head just as casca plunged the dagger downward his face registered shock as the blade struck the exposed skin below his neck there was a sickening sound of metal cutting into flesh caesar let out a roar he seized cascas wrist with one hand with the other he stabbed his stylus deep into cascas forearm casca bleated in pain withdrew his bloody dagger and scurried back others stepped forward baring their daggers caesar jerked free from cimbers grip his toga was in such disarray that he tripped on it he was bleeding profusely from the wound at his neck the look on his face was of outrage and disbelief even then lucius thought that disaster might be averted caesar was wounded but on his feet he had a weapon of sortshis stylus if he could hold the wouldbe assassins at bay long enough for the other senators to rush to his assistance all might be well if only lucius had a weapon and where was antonius lucius looked back toward the entrance antonius had just appeared he stood in the doorway with a puzzled look on his face realizing from the sudden uproar that something was terribly wrong lucius called to him antonius hurry come quickly but when lucius looked back toward caesar he lost all hope the assassins had converged on their victim caesar had dropped his stylus he held up both arms desperately trying to fend off his attackers they stabbed him again and again in all the confusion a few of them appeared to have stabbed one another by accident blood was everywhere caesars toga was drenched with it and the togas of the assassins were spotted with red there was so much blood on the floor that casca slipped and fell amid the flashing daggers lucius caught a glimpse of caesar his face was barely recognizable contorted with agony he let out a scream that seemed to come from an animal not a man the sound chilled lucius to the marrow caesar broke free from the men surrounding him he reeled backward tripping on his toga and stamping his feet as he staggered past the chair of state toward the wall where a statue of the halls founder stood in a place of honor caesar fell against the pedestal of pompeiuss statue he slid downward smearing the inscription with blood he ended up slumped on the floor his back against the pedestal his legs outstretched his disarray was indecent his undertunic was twisted and pulled aside so as to bare a patch of flesh where his thigh met his groin jerking like a spastic flailing grotesquely he seemed to be trying with one hand to cover his face with a fold of his toga and with the other to cover his nakedness caesar was dying yet he still sought to preserve his dignity some of the assassins looked horrified at what they had done others looked exhilarated even jubilant among the latter was cassius who was covered with blood he strode toward brutus who stood at the edge of the group and had not a drop of blood on him nor was there any blood on the dagger in his hand you too brutus said cassius brutus looked numb he seemed unable to move you have to do it insisted cassius each of us must strike a blow twentythree brave men twentythree blows for freedom do it brutus stepped slowly toward the twitching bloody figure at the base of pompeiuss statue he seemed horrified by caesars appearance he swallowed hard clutched his dagger and knelt beside him with blood spilling from his mouth and running over his chin caesar managed one last utterance you toomy child brutus appeared emboldened by the words he gritted his teeth pulled back his dagger and plunged it into the exposed place where caesars thigh met his groin caesar thrashed and convulsed blood bubbled from his lips he stiffened uttered a final grunt and did not move again lucius watching from a distance saw everything he was transfixed with horror oblivious to the stampede of senators rushing to the exit he felt a hand on his shoulder and gave a start it was antonius the mans face was ashen his voice trembled come with me lucius youre not safe here lucius shook his head he was rooted to the spot unable to move he had come to warn caesar he had failed brutus walked slowly and calmly toward them the feverish glimmer had left his eyes his held his shoulders back his chin up he had the look of a man who had done a difficult thing and done it well no one will harm you lucius pinarius you have nothing to fear neither do you antonius as long as you dont raise your sword against us the chamber was almost empty the only senators who remained were those too old to run brutus shook his head in disgust this wasnt the reaction we anticipated i meant to give a speech after it was done to explain ourselves to the others but theyve all run off like frightened geese a speech said antonius incredulous brutus reached into his toga and produced a scrap of parchment his fingers smudged the document with blood he frowned displeased that he had marred it i was up all night working on it well if not today then ill deliver it tomorrow when the senate resumes normal business normal business antonius shook his head in disbelief yes the normal business of the senate of roma freed from the rule of a tyrant the republic has been restored the people will rejoice five hundred years ago my ancestor brutus freed roma from a wicked king today we followed his example give your speech to somebody else shouted lucius he shoved brutus aside and ran toward the exit weeping antonius caught up with him come with me lucius no matter what brutus says were not safe my house has strong doors high walls they were on the steps descending to the public square there was not a person in sight buthis body said lucius what if they throw him in the tiber as they did the gracchi that will not happen said antonius grimly i wont let such a thing happen caesar will have a proper funeral on my honor as a roman i promise you that when he was annoyed gaius octaviuss voice could become quite shrill he needed oratorical training to overcome the defect thought lucius in the days since caesars assassination and gaius octaviuss return to roma lucius had grown very tired of hearing that shrill note in his cousins voice from this day forward antonius you will address me as caesar said octavius sounding even more shrill and annoyed than usual i dont ask it of you i demand it demand it you make a demand of me antonius leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms he wrinkled his nose in the first place young man this is my house here i give the orders i used to take orders from caesar because he was my commander but caesar is dead he was the last man ill ever take orders from i certainly wont take orders from his nieces bratand i wont call you by his name as long as were discussing titles perhaps you should address me as consul as im the only one of the three of us here in this room who actually holds a magistracy only because caesar saw fit to appoint youas he saw fit to name me his son and heir snapped octavius antonius bristled this is my house octavius you are my guest lucius rose to his feet marcus cousin gaius does this meeting have to be so contentious the whole city is a vipers nest if i want to be subjected to vicious arguments and hateful words i have only to step outside the door can the three of us not speak to one another with some degree of decorum a good idea cousin said octavius decorum begins with addressing a man by his rightful name caesars will made me his son by adoption and i have taken his name i am now gaius julius caesar octavianus i understand said lucius but if antonius happens to address you by your old name why not allow it octavius an honorable name a patrician name and he honors you and your ancestors when he speaks it antonius is our friend cousin we need him he is the shield between us and the men who murdered our uncle are we not allies do we not share a common purpose are the three of us not close enough to call each other by first name or family name or whatever name we wish can you not simply drop the point for now cousin gaius the question at hand isnt what we call each other or yet another discussion of caesars will but how to keep our heads for the moment octavius was silenced and so was antonius it still surprised lucius that he could command their attention and argue with such selfconfidence almost overnight after the initial shock of caesars assassination had passed lucius had felt himself transformed he was no longer a callow youth who hesitated to assert himself in conversation with his elders he was one of caesars heirs engaged in a desperate struggle for the future when it came down to it octavius was only a couple of years older and only slightly more experienced than himself true octavius had seen a bit of battle but not enough to prove himself a gifted strategist much less a hero his overbearing pride sprang from vanity not accomplishments in some ways at least in luciuss opinion his cousin was quite deficient to begin with octaviuss oratorical skills were not at all impressive no matter what caesar had thought antonius was a far more polished and persuasive speaker as he had shown when he delivered caesars funeral oration before a huge crowd the speech had been intensely dramatic yet remarkably subtle antonius never said a word against the killers but by praising caesar he moved his listeners to tears of grief and cries of outrage without directly saying so he made the case that roma had been defiled by the murder of a great leader not liberated by the assassination of a tyrant antonius had also revealed one of the terms of caesars will from his vast personal fortune caesar had decreed a generous disbursement of seventyfive attic drachmas to every citizen living in roma this had done much to sway the crowd against caesars assassins but antonius too had his faults as lucius had become all too aware in recent days for one thing he drank too much in happier times the mans appetite for debauchery had impressed and even awed lucius now it struck him as foolhardy the jeopardy in which they found themselves demanded clear thinking antonius also had a streak of pettiness his refusal to address octavius as caesar was perhaps understandable because it raised a sore point octavius was the chief benefactor of caesars will while antonius to everyones surprise had been left out of the will entirely nonetheless antoniuss repeated and deliberate baiting of octavius served no ones purpose the will was the crux of the matter in it caesar posthumously adopted octavius as his son and bequeathed to him half his estate the other half he divided equally between his nephew quintus pedius who was still away from the city and his greatnephew lucius pinarius so much for the special debt that caesar had owed to lucius on account of his grandfathers sacrifice octavius had merited adoption but not lucius lucius had his own reasons to be resentful of octavius but he was determined to move past them the will had made no mention of caesarion cleopatras son immediately after the assassination the egyptian queen vacated caesars villa and sailed back to alexandria politically it was left to caesars longtime subordinates antonius and lepidus to uphold his edicts and maintain the order he had imposed on the state but without the benefit of his dictatorial powers the cooperation of caesars heirs was vital to their cause each of the three cousins had inherited an enormous fortune and each could exert a tremendous sentimental appeal to those who had supported caesar and now mourned him in return the heirs needed the protection and experienced advice that lepidus and especially antonius could provide driven by necessity this alliance had been uneasy from the start rife with mutual suspicions and resentments especially between octavius and antonius in the aftermath of caesars assassination roma had become a cauldron of intrigue the conspirators against caesar numbered at least sixty men some had taken part in the actual killing while others had only lent support should those men be declared criminals and brought to trial or applauded as saviors of the republic three days after the ides of martius the senate voted an amnesty for the assassins drafted in careful language that neither acknowledged their guilt nor praised their patriotism despite the senates amnesty fierce partisans on both sides had resorted to violence an innocent tribune named cinna unlucky enough to be mistaken for one of the conspirators had literally been torn apart by an angry mob pieces of his body were scattered across the forum after gangs threatened to burn down the houses of cassius and brutus both men left roma to prematurely claim the provincial governorships that caesar had scheduled for them this raised a further question were caesars appointments still valid brutus and cassius argued that caesar was a tyrant and usurper if that were so how could any of his decrees be legally valid including their own provincial appointments the legitimacy of every act by every magistrate was now routinely called into question by partisans of one side or the other who possessed legal authority and by what right those who had hoped that caesars death would result in a quick and harmonious restoration of senatorial power were bitterly disappointed roma was poised on a swords edge ready to fall into chaos after so many years of death and destruction the outbreak of another civil war was an almost unbearable prospect yet increasingly it seemed inevitable the future was fraught with uncertainty the future was what lucius and his cousin had come to the house of antonius to discuss yet the discussion seemed to circle back endlessly to recriminations about things already past it was octavius who broke the strained silence the conspirators should have been dealt with at once immediately following the murder you antonius as consul had the power to arrest them you could have invoked the ultimate decree there were no senators left in the chamber to vote on such a proposal even so if instead of fleeing to your house you had taken immediate action against the men who killed my father if you think it would have been as easy as that young man then youre even more naive than i thought and you are certainly not caesars son enough said lucius you both need to stop this squabbling and return to the matter at hand namely the need to deal with cassius and brutus it may or may not be possible to convince the senate to declare that caesars murder was a criminal act most of the senators seem inclined to mimic cicero theyll avoid taking sides as long as possible until they see how things fall out for now the senates amnesty protects the assassins however it seems to me that the premature seizures by cassius and brutus of their provinces were unquestionably illegal those actions could be construed as hostile acts against the state and thus lay them open to military action by you antonius acting as consul if any military action is taken caesar must take part as well said octavius adopting his greatuncles habit of referring to himself in the third personto antoniuss disgust as evidenced by the gritting of his teeth its caesars fortune that can raise the troops its caesars name to which his veterans will swear loyalty and if i am to command troops in the field i must be given full consular authority impossible said antonius youre far too young by what reckoning my greatuncle appointed men to magistracies who were under the required age thus there is legal precedent an important point cousin said lucius we must be seen to follow the law any military action must be perceived as just and necessary there must be no grounds for anyone to assert that we have initiatedhe hesitated even to say the wordsthat we have initiated a civil war for personal gain or private revenge we must win the support of the senate the legions and the people but how its the sort of challenge at which uncle gaius excelled so brilliantly lucius took a deep breath he looked from one man to the other he had no illusions that he could assume caesars mantle of leadership but increasingly it seemed to him that neither antonius nor octavius was fit to do so either no matter that one had been caesars righthand man and the other was his adopted son they were barely able to keep peace between themselves as if to prove him right both men began to speak at the same time neither would yield instead they raised their voices lucius clapped his hands over his ears marcus cousin gaius be quiet and listen to what i have to say youre both ambitious men you both have a craving to rule the state good for you the gods admire ambition especially in a roman but my ambitionmy only ambitionis to avenge caesars death all the assassins must be declared outlaws they must be hunted down they must be killed brutus and cassius are our foremost concern im eager to take up arms against them put a sword in my hand and ill readily serve under either of youyou gaius or you marcus i dont care which but i dont believe either of you can see the task to completion without the other i beg of you stop this bickering and bend your wills to the common purpose he stared at antonius who finally shrugged and nodded he stared at octavius his cousin raised an eyebrow youre right of course thank you cousin lucius such a clearsighted sense of purpose is just what we need to keep us on course well antonius shall we get back to business the discussion that followed was fruitful lucius was glad to have spoken out but as he looked from octavius to antonius he knew his words had not been entirely truthful he had said he didnt care which man he served under but in his heart there was no question which of them he preferred the hotblooded plainspoken pleasureloving sometimes crude antonius partly this was because of the affection the man had shown him partly it was because his cousin gaius was so vain and coldblooded antonius he could serve with enthusiasm octavius he would serve if he must lucius prayed to the gods he would never be forced to choose between them bc lucius pinarius dreamed an old recurring dream it was a nightmare he had first experienced on the ides of martius long ago when he was young in the dream he was both participant and observer aware he was dreaming and yet unable to stop the dream caesar had died a great multitude had gathered to hear the reading of his will a vestal virgin produced a scroll marcus antonius unrolled the document and proceeded to read though lucius stood at the front of the crowd he could not hear the names being read he heard only the roar of the crowd in his ears like the crashing of waves he wanted to tell the others to be quiet but he could not open his mouth to speak he could not move at all antonius continued to read but lucius could not hear speak or move with a start and a shiver he woke from the dream he was trembling and covered with sweat the dream was like an old enemy still hounding him after all these years taunting him with memories of his youth and of the bright promises that had been shattered by caesars death but the dream had been visiting him for so many years it had almost become an old friend where else but in the dream could he see again the face of antonius alive and in his prime lucius wiped the sleep from his eyes slowly he came to his senses the dream faded against all odds lucius pinarius had become an old man he was sixty so many men of his generation had died in the civil wars that followed caesars death if they survived the wars accident or illness had eventually taken them off to hades but lucius was still alive he rose from his bed relieved himself in the chamber pot and slipped into a tunic later he would put on his senatorial toga for this was an important day but for now a tunic would do the cook prepared for him a simple breakfast of farina cooked with a little milk and water and sweetened with a dab of honey lucius still had strong teeth but his digestion was not what it used to be nowadays the blander the food the better chewing a mouthful of mush he thought back to the days of endless feasting in alexandria wines from greece dates from parthia crocodile eggs from the nile serving girls from nubia dancers from ethiopia courtesans from antioch whatever else people said about antonius and cleopatra no one could deny that those two had known how to mount a banquetespecially in their final months and days as the end drew near for them it was the dreams fault that he should be thinking of antonius remembering made lucius sad the mush turned bitter in his mouth but today was not about the past today was about the future his grandson was coming even as he thought about the boy the door slave announced that young lucius pinarius had just arrived and was waiting in the vestibule already said lucius hes early ah well he can spend a few minutes contemplating the effigies of his ancestors while i force a bit more of this mush down my gullet meanwhile order the bearers to bring a litter around to the front door which litter master oh the fancy one i should think with the yellow curtains and embroidered pillows and all those brass baubles hanging off it today is a special day once upon a timebefore this blasted stiffness in my kneesid have walked to the baths of agrippa no matter that theyre all the way out on the field of mars but here we are two roman males taking a litter through the streets i blush to think of what our ancestors would have thought of such an indulgence lucius smiled at his grandson who sat beside him and seemed to be enjoying the ride the boy leaned forward and turned his head this way and that peering at the passing sights with the insatiable curiosity of a tenyearold ideally lucius would have waited until his grandsons toga day for this occasion but that was years away lucius might not live to see it better to tend to his duty now while he still had his wits and a pulse why do they call this the field of mars grandfather let me think very very long ago i believe it must have been called the field of mavors because that was the ancient name for mars i suppose someone built an altar to the god so naturally they named the whole area for mars yes but why is it called a field theres no field here all i can see are streets and buildings ah i see what you mean yes its all built up now but it wasnt always so i can remember a time when the field of mars or at least a large portion of it was still open to the sky a place for soldiers to drill and for large groups to assemble now the citys spread outward to fill up every patch of land between the ancient walls and the tiber i see were passing by pompeiuss theater now i was about your age when that opened luciuss eyes followed the steps leading to the main portico he never passed the theater without remembering what he had witnessed there but he was not in a mood to speak of it and was grateful that the boy did not question him about it up ahead is the pantheon of course which was built by the emperors righthand man marcus agrippa and near the pantheon are the baths which agrippa built at the same time when the baths opened twenty years ago it was quite an event because there had never been anything like them in roma before once the baths were open all sorts of shops and arcades were built in the vicinity the boy furrowed his brow if the baths of agrippa were the first baths built in roma did no one ever bathe before that lucius smiled at least the boy was curious about the past so many people nowadays seemed oblivious of all that had come before as if roma had always been at peace and ruled by an emperoras if there had never been a republic or a series of civil wars or a man named antonius there he went thinking of antonius again the baths of agrippa werent the first baths in roma but they were much bigger and much more beautiful than any of the previous baths they were also the first to be open to everyone and free of chargea gift from the emperor to the peoplewhich made them very popular half the reason for going to the baths is to see and be seen and to mingle outside ones class economic and social disparities between citizens tend to dissolve when everyone is naked and wet young lucius laughed you say the funniest things grandfather i try speaking of the baths here we are lucius enjoyed the morning immensely time spent with his grandson was always precious and the diversions offered by the baths were among the greatest pleasures of city life the day began with a shave from his most trusted slave young lucius watched the procedure with great interest his father wore a beard these days so the boy was not used to seeing the skillful application of a sharp blade to a mans face after the shave they went outside to the openair poola manmade lake some called it on account of its sizewhere the two of them swam a few laps side by side the boys stroke was choppy but his breathing technique was good wherever life might take him young lucius would surely have occasion to travel by ship and it would behoove him to know how to swim how many of antoniuss soldiers had drowned at the decisive naval battle at actium not because their armor pulled them under but because they simply did not know how to swim again he found himself thinking of antonius a gymnasiarch organized a series of competitions on the long racing track beside the pool lucius encouraged his grandson to take part he was delighted to see the boy win his first two heats young lucius was beaten in the third race but only by a nose his grandson was a strong runner another gymnasiarch organized a series of wrestling matches the competitors were all older and bigger than young lucius who sat with his grandfather among the spectators the wrestlers competed in greek fashion naked and with their bodies oiled such a diversion like being carried in a litter struck lucius as slightly decadent what would his ancestors think true romans preferred to watch gladiators fight to the death lucius recalled how the emperor in his heated propaganda war against antonius and cleopatra had railed against the dangerous influx of foreign vices saying the greekblooded queen had corrupted antonius with the appetites of the luxurious east yet once he triumphed over his rivals the emperor had made roma a more cosmopolitan city than ever before he allowed agrippa to build the baths he imported the worship of exotic gods he catered at every turn to the citizens appetite for entertainment and pleasure finished with their morning exercise lucius and the boy bathed they began by scraping the sweat from their bodies using strigils they did so in the shadow of the famous statue by lysippus which depicted a naked athlete doing exactly the same thing bending back one muscular arm to run his strigil over the other arm which was extended before him agrippa had installed the statue at the baths with great fanfare lysippus had been the court sculptor to alexander the great though many copies had been made of the apoxyomenos as the scraper was known in greek the original bronze was of incalculable value the statue was yet another lavish gift from the emperor to the people of roma lucius and the boy went back and forth between pools of varying temperature the coolest was quite bracing after their exercise the hottest was obscured by a curtain of steam and required a gradual process of immersion even the floors were heated by water piped beneath the tiles the walls were of marble and even in the wettest areas agrippas decorators had found means to adorn them with paintings infusing dyes into beeswax then fixing and hardening the images with heat the paintings depicted gods goddesses and heroes scenes of legend appeared to hover in the mist after bathing they wrapped themselves in linen cloths and took a light meal in an adjoining arcade the boy ate pieces of bread slathered with garum lucius abstained from the spicy garum and ate figpaste instead they discussed the boys studies he was currently reading the aeneid by the late virgil who had been the emperors favorite poet when the emperor asked virgil to create a roman epic to match the iliad and the odyssey of the greeks the aeneid was the result the long poem about the adventures of aeneas celebrated the trojan warrior as the son of venus and the founder of the roman race aeneas it turned out was the ancestor not only of the emperor and his uncle the divine julius but also of romulus and remus if lucius had doubts about the historical validity of the aeneid he did not express them to the boy there was no denying that virgil had created a work of art that greatly pleased the emperor after eating they rested a few old friends and colleagues stopped to say hello and lucius was delighted to introduce his grandson the talk turned to foreign imports the cost of slaves the advantages and disadvantages of transport by land or by sea and who had been awarded contracts for various construction projects in the city as you can see my boy remarked lucius these days more business is done here in the baths than in the forum in the old days of course all the talk would have been about politics and war nowadays war was an activity on the distant frontier that might or might not affect trade and politicstrue politics as their forefathers had understood the word with everyone freely arguing and shouting to make themselves heardno longer existed one might speculate about intrigues within the imperial family or conjecture about the relative influence wielded by members of the emperors immediate circlebut only in whispers exercised bathed and fed the two retired to the dressing room young lucius slipped into the tunic he had worn earlier but his grandfather assisted by the slave who had shaved him put on his toga while the boy watched he pontificated on the proper wearing of the toga a man isnt simply wrapped in his toga he explained he carries it as he carries himself with a show of dignity and pride shoulders back head up and the drapes should fall just so too few folds and you look as if someone threw a sheet over you too many folds and you look as if youre carrying a bundle of laundry to the fuller the boys laughter delighted lucius it meant that his grandson was paying attention he was watching listening learning the slave handed his master a shiny trinket on a golden chain lucius slipped the necklace over his head and tucked it beneath his toga whats that grandfather an amulet of some sort not just any amulet my boy its very old and very important and today is the very last day i shall ever wear it but well talk of it later for now i want to show you a bit of the city there are some places i should like you to see through my eyes shall i summon the litter asked the slave actually i think not the hot plunge has so loosened my knees that i think i might be up for a bit of walking but you must be patient young lucius and not run ahead of me i shall stay by your side grandfather lucius nodded how polite the boy was always respectful and wellmannered he was studious as well and very clean and neat the boy was a product of his times the world had become a much more orderly peaceful settled place than it was in the old days of the civil wars his ancestors would be proud of young lucius they would be proud of the harmonious world that their descendents through much bloodshed and toil had finally achieved as they headed out from the baths a flash of excitement crossed young luciuss face then he bit his lower lip nervously what is it my boy i was thinking grandfather as long as were taking a walk and were so closebut father says its something you dont like to talk about only he says you were actually there when it happened ah yes i think i know what youre trying to say yes that will be our first stop but i have to warn you theres nothing to see nothing as you shall observe they strolled to the theater of pompeius lucius took the steps slowly but not on account of his knees as they reached the top he could feel his heart pounding in his chest his skin prickled and his breath grew short even after all these years he felt a sense of dread as they drew near to the spot they came to a brick wall it was here he said this is the place where the divine julius your greatgreatgranduncle met the end of his mortal life the boy frowned i thought it happened in some sort of assembly hall at the foot of pompeiuss statue yes the entrance to the hall was here and the place where caesar fell was perhaps fifty paces from this spot but the hall has been sealed some years ago the emperor decreedor rather the senate voted at the emperors behestthat this place should be declared an accursed site never to be seen or set foot upon the statue of pompeius was removed and placed elsewhere in the theater complex the entrance to the hall was walled up like a tomb the ides of martius was declared a day of infamy and it was forbidden that the senate should ever again meet on that date as i told you theres nothing to see but its true grandfather that you were here that you saw it happen yes i saw the assassins strike i saw caesar fall i heard his final words to the infamous brutus antonius was here too though he arrived after i did they purposely detained him outside partly to prevent him from shielding caesar but also i think because they didnt wish to kill him the assassins did possess a certain sense of honor they truly believed that what they were doing was for the good of roma but how can that be they were bloodthirsty killers yes they were that as well the boy frowned and antonius i thought he was but let us speak no more of this said lucius theres so much more i want to show you they walked toward the older parts of the city in the forum boarium lucius showed the boy the ara maxima and informed him of the role once played by the pinarii in maintaining the cult of hercules long ago that religious role had been abandoned by the family but it marked the first appearance of the pinarii in history and so was never to be forgotten they had shared the duty with another family but the potitii were long extinct as were a number of the original patrician families whose names now existed only in annals and inscriptions they ascended the palatine walking slowly up the ancient stairs of cacus which took them by a recess in the stone reputed to have been the very cave where the monster once dwelled they paused beneath the shade of the fig tree said to be a descendent of the legendary ruminalis beneath which acca larentia had suckled the infants romulus and remus they visited the hut of romulus which even the boy could see was too new to be the actual hut where the founder had lived the civic landmark had been rebuilt many times over the centuries they descended to the forum which in recent years had become even more crowded with monuments and temples once upon a time all of this was a lake or so they say remarked lucius hard to believe isnt it the first temples were made of wood everything i can see is made of marble said the boy lucius nodded the emperors proud boast i found roma a city of bricks but i shall leave it a city of marble during his reign a great many buildings have been restored refurbished even rebuilt from the foundations up the quaint shrines have been dusted the ancient glories have been burnished everything has been made bigger and more beautiful than before the emperor has given us peace and prosperity the emperor has made roma the most resplendent of all the cities that ever existed the undisputed center of the world they came to a statue of the emperor one of many in the city this one depicted him as a young warrior handsome and virile and armed for battle the inscription referred to his great victory at philippi in macedonia when he was only twentyone years old i sent into exile the murderers of my father and when they made war on the republic i defeated them in battle it seemed to lucius that the statue flattered his cousin octavius had never been quite that handsome and he certainly had not been that muscular and broadshouldered the boy gazed up at the statue with a less critical eye father tells me that you were at philippi too grandfather when the assassins brutus and cassius were brought to justice he says you fought right alongside the emperor lucius raised an eyebrow not exactly octavius as he recalled had been sick in bed for most of the battle except for the time he spent hiding in a marsh after his camp was overrun by brutus i myself inflicted no bloodshed at philippi i was in charge of supply lines for the legions led by marcus antonius antonius the boy frowned but he was the emperors enemy wasnt he he became the willing slave of the egyptian whore lucius winced that happened later much later at philippi octavius and antonius octavius i misspoke octavius was the name that the emperor received at birth later of course he was adopted by the divine julius and was called caesar from that time forward later he took the majestic title of augustus and so we call him caesar augustus but i digress as i was saying at philippi the emperor and marcus antonius were allies they fought together to avenge the divine julius cassius and brutus were defeated and they killed themselves but philippi was only the beginning some sixty senators took part in the conspiracy against caesar within a few years every one of them was dead some died by shipwreck some in battle some took their own lives using the same dagger with which they had stabbed caesar even some who had not plotted against caesar were dead like cicero he made an enemy of antonius and he lost his head and his hands for it his hands cicero made vile speeches against antonius so when antonius ordered him killed he commanded that ciceros hands should be cut off along with his head for having written such offensive words there is no denying that antonius had a vindictive nature was that why the emperor killed antonius because he murdered cicero no lucius sighed the truth was so very complicated especially when large parts of it were not to be spoken aloud the two of them remained friendswell alliesfor a number of years then antonius threw in his lot with cleopatra and some thought that antonius and cleopatra would rule egypt and the east and the emperor would rule roma and the west butso philosophers tell usjust as the heavens are one under the rule of jupiter so the earth naturally desires to be united under one emperor antoniuss dreams came to ruin because of the egyptian whore again lucius winced come with me young man theres something else i want you to see they made their way to the julian forum left unfinished by caesar the arcades for courtrooms and offices had been completed by the emperor still dominating the open square was the magnificent statue of caesar sitting atop a charger how much more at home in his armor the divine julius looked than did his successor thought lucius the square was crowded with men going to and fro talking to one another and carrying documents under the emperor the legal codes had grown more complicated than ever and lawyers were kept even busier than they had been under the republic settling private disputes adjudicating bankruptcies and negotiating contracts lucius and the boy walked past the splashing fountain and into the temple of venus lucius still considered it the most beautiful interior in all of roma unsurpassed even by the emperors most lavish projects here were the famous paintings of ajax and medea by timomachus here were the cabinets containing the fabulous jewels and gemstones that caesar had collected in his travels holding the boys hand lucius strode before the two statues at the far end of the sanctuary the venus of arcesilaus remained unsurpassed and beside the venus despite the misfortunes that had befallen the fleshandblood original stood the gilded statue of queen cleopatra last of the long line of the ptolemies who had ruled egypt since the time of alexander the great some had thought that the emperor would remove the statue but here it remained where julius caesar himself had installed it despite what you may have heard she was not a whore said lucius quietly as far as i know she slept with only two men in her entire life the divine julius and marcus antonius to both she gave children the emperor in his wisdom saw fit to execute caesarion but he spared her children by antonius but everyone says that she what everyone says is not always the truth it served the emperors purposes to call her a whore and a seducer but she was far more than that she considered herself a goddess for better or for worse she behaved like one the boy frowned and when she lured antonius to join her you sided with the emperor to fight against them no not in the beginning at the start of the war between them i fought for antonius for antonius with cleopatra against the emperor the boy was incredulous antonius was my friend he was my protector when i was very young in the perilous days after caesar was murdered he had always been loyal to caesar i felt obliged to be loyal to him so i served under him at philippi and i remained in his service afterward even when another civil war broke out and the emperor declared him the enemy of roma antonius posted me to the city of cyrene to watch his west flank do you know where cyrene is the boy frowned not exactly its on the libyan coast west of alexandria which was cleopatras capital if she and antonius had won my boy alexandrianot romawould have become the capital of the world roma might have become nothing more than a provincial backwater impossible yes youre right i once heard the divine julius himself declare that the gods chose roma to rule the world how could i forget but back in those heady days when i was young and antonius and cleopatra were riding the serpents tail anything seemed possible anything he sighed at any event there i was in cyrene i was to be antoniuss watchdog should his enemies attempt to sail toward egypt hugging the libyan coastline in the meantime while i watched and waited and drilled my soldiers i minted coins for antonius to pay his debts war is expensive that reminds me i have a silver denarius for you one of the coins i minted for antonius lucius reached into his toga theyre rather rare these days many of them were melted down and recast with the image of the emperor the boy accepted the heavy coin and gazed at it with great interest i recognize victory barebreasted in profile with her wings behind her and carrying a wreathbut theres something else i cant make out a palm frond says lucius palms grow wild along the nile the boy turned the coin over but who is this fellow with the flowing beard none other than the king of gods jupiter but he has rams horns thats because this is jupiter ammon his egyptian manifestation who is called zeus ammon by the alexandrians who speak greek alexander the great worshiped zeus ammon so did his general ptolemy who inherited egypt it was ptolemy who founded the dynasty that ruled egypt for almost three hundred years until the royal house ended with cleopatra andshe was not a whore the boy remained dubious her enemies in roma alleged that she was while she lived everyone seems to believe so now long after shes dead but caesar didnt think so nor did antonius cleopatra considered herself the manifestation of the goddess isis a woman tends to take procreation rather seriously when she thinks that carnal union might result in a god or goddess springing out of her womb whatever she was she lost everything didnt she and she took down antonius along with her lucius nodded antonius and cleopatra gathered a great navy and sailed off to greece to meet the emperor in battle i stayed behind in cyrene and waited for news the sea battle took place at actium the navy of the emperor under the command of marcus agrippa destroyed the navy of antonius and cleopatra it was all over then and everyone knew it antonius sent me a desperate message saying he was coming to collect my troops and then what happened luciuss face grew dark i killed the messengers i sent word to antonius that he would not be welcome in cyrene i finally came to my senses you see i saw that the gods had sided with the emperor that they had sided with him all along and only an ungodly man would continue to stand against him the boy nodded gravely as at the outcome of a moral tale satisfied that his grandfather had at last seen reason but the look on luciuss face was grim antonius and cleopatra retreated to alexandria to await the end some say they spent those final months indulging in every possible vice squeezing life for the last vestiges of pleasure perhaps that tale is only another slander against them but to me it has the ring of truth how those two loved to drink and carouse cleopatra also set about testing various poisons on her slaves to determine which caused the least painful death when the emperor and his legions arrived in egypt and all hope was gone antonius fell on his sword but cleopatra yes grandfather what happened to cleopatra the boy studied his grandfathers face his eyes grew wide were you there grandfather were you there in alexandria when yes i was there octaviusthe emperorinsisted that i accompany him he was determined to take cleopatra alive he wanted to bring her back to roma and parade her in his triumph but the queen had other plans how much should he tell the boy certainly not all of the story he had never told that to anyone antonius was dead cleopatras army had vanished like smoke on the wind occupied by octaviuss forces the city of alexandria held its breath the queen remained in the royal palace holed up with two handmaidens in a sealed chamber that could be entered only by climbing a rope through a trapdoor from below she could not flee but nor could she be taken by force on a terrace of the palace with a splendid view of the harbor and the famous lighthouse lucius was summoned before octavius the commander dispensed with greetings and got straight to the point you have a long association with the queen she knows you cousin she trusts you not anymore i betrayed her even so you stand a better chance of coaxing her out of her lair than i do i want cleopatra alive not dead go to her talk about antonius and the good old days and what might have been flatter her cajole her when youve regained her trust say whatever you have to say to convince her to surrender to me assure her that i intend to treat her with all the respect due to her rank and lineage she will appear in my triumphal procession but she will not be mistreated is that the truth octavius laughed of course not i intend to see her completely broken and humiliated before she dies roma demands nothing less than the complete destruction of the egyptian whore shell be raped and beaten kept in chains starved and tortured when people see her crawling naked behind my chariot theyll wonder how such a wretched hag ever seduced a man like antonius then shell be strangled in the tullianum but not before she sees the boy caesarion killed before her eyes hes only fourteen said lucius and he shall never be fifteen lucius had no choice he agreed to act as octaviuss emissary through the trapdoor in whispers he negotiated with the queens handmaidens charmion and iras cleopatra agreed to see him the following day but only if he arrived alone with no other roman in sight the next day lucius arrived at the appointed time he brought a gift for the queen she had expressed a craving for figs the basket that lucius lifted up through the opening was full of plump ripe figs nestled atop a bed of fig leaves iras accepted the basket a little later charmion lowered a rope and lucius was allowed to climb up he had expected to find the three women cowering in a squalid little room but the chamber was magnificent small openings high in the walls admitted beams of sunlight the floor was black marble the columns were red granite the walls were painted in dazzling colors cleopatra sat on a magnificent throne in the shape of a vulture with its wings spread ornamented with gold silver and lapis she wore a cobraheaded diadem and a robe encrusted with jewels iras sat at her feet with the basket of figs will you not change your mind your majesty said lucius too late for that said cleopatra in one hand she held a fig on her wrist were two puncture marksthe bite of the asp which lucius himself had obtained from one of the queens agents and hidden beneath the fig leaves thank you lucius pinarius when i see antonius in elysium i will tell him of the great favor you did me her eyelids fluttered and closed her head fell to one side the fig dropped from her hand luciuss eyes filled with tears was this a fitting end was this worthy of your mistress he demanded of the handmaidens iras was silent she had already joined her mistress in death charmion beginning to stagger and sway was using her final moments to straighten the queens crown so that in death her appearance would be perfect it was very worthy she whispered as befits the last of all the pharaohs lucius wept but only briefly he braced himself to deliver the bad news to octavius to his grandson lucius merely said the queen submitted to the bite of an asp the emperor wanted her for his triumph but she cheated him of that victory at least but even so they say it was the greatest triumph of all time said the boy so it was a very great triumph indeed on that day my cousin gaius who had been born octavius but had become caesar took the name augustus to celebrate his elevation to divinity the whole world was made to see that the emperor was worthy of worshipnot just a king but a god on earth lucius gazed at the statue of cleopatra for a long moment then reached for the boys hand and led him away as they were leaving the temple of venus there was a stir of excitement in the square the emperor the emperor men shouted a litter appeared splendidly appointed with purple and gold and surrounded by a veritable army of attendants onlookers fell back in awe within the litter augustus could clearly be seen reclining on purple cushions to lucius despite the jowls and wrinkles and all the other ravages of age octavius still looked like the callow boy who boldly laid claim to caesars legacy rode the whirlwind to greatness annihilated every rival and never looked back the ways of the gods were capricious and impossible to predict thought lucius and their methods were often maddeningly obscure and yet surely steadily the story of mankind progressed after many convulsions the world had at last attained a state of stability and peace perhaps even of perfection one empire ever expanding to be ruled by one emperor from one city roma men like romulus or alexander or caesar could seemingly arise from nowhere and change everything if men could become gods anything was possible might the older gods like men someday perish altogether who could say what might be occurring at that very moment somewhere else in the worldperhaps in some obscure backwater at the empires edgewhere the birth of a certain man or movement might alter the worlds destiny once again perhaps jupiter himself might be thrown down to be replaced by another king of heaven not only one empire and one emperor but one god might such a world not represent an even greater state of perfection lucius banished the blasphemous thought and concentrated instead on the earthly splendor of the receding retinue of caesar augustus emperor of roma surely the greatest of all men who had ever lived or ever would live on earth but lucius had almost forgotten the most important thing he reached inside his toga and removed the necklace he was wearing this is for you my boy i should have liked to wait until your toga day to present it to you but i think youre ready for it what is it grandfather the boy gazed at the amulet in his hand its origin is uncertain i dont even know the name of the god it represents but when i received it i was told that this talisman is older than roma itself its been handed down in our family for many generations since before the days of romulus young lucius peered at the object curiously unable to discern what it was meant to represent after so many years and so many wearers the details of the winged phallus had worn away in outline the shape appeared to be little more than a simple crossnot dissimilar the boy thought to the crucifixes upon which the romans executed criminals as it was handed down to me said his grandfather so i now hand it down to you my namesake you must vow to do the same thing yourself in a future generation the boy gazed at the pendant then solemnly placed the necklace over his head authors note the origins and early development of rome represent one of the most exciting areas of historical study in the world today through most of the twentieth century it was fashionable to dismiss the foundation accounts of the ancient sources as fabrications but recent archaeological discoveries have given fresh credence to stories once dismissed as legends thus the epigram from alexandre grandazzis the foundation of rome myth and history that opens this book legend is historical just as history is legendary i began my research for roma by reading and rereading t j cornells the beginnings of rome italy and rome from the bronze age to the punic wars c to bc routledge if you want to know the specific sources for this period and to understand the state of current roman studies read cornells book in its opening pages i was struck by the authors comment that all history contains an element of fiction and his observation that ancient historians as opposed to their modern counterparts openly practiced certain techniques in common with modern historical novelists in the historical novel cornell notes and in premodern historiographywriters are permitted to reconstruct from their own imaginations the feelings aspirations and motives of persons and groups to conjure up plausible sceneson the battlefield on the streets or in the bedroomand even to put their own words into the mouths of persons in the drama these conventions were accepted without question in antiquity when history was at least in part a rhetorical exercise r m ogilvie as quoted by betty radice in her introduction to livy the war with hannibal explicitly compares the great roman historian to a writer of fiction like a novelist livy subordinated historical precision to the demands of character and plot he indulged freely in invention and imagination in order to present a living picture even so as radice wryly notes livy never falls into the error of trying to create atmosphere by lifting pages from baedekergeorge eliot and lord lytton earnestly did their best with florence and pompeii but the dead stones never speak instead he keeps descriptions to a minimum and recreates the spirit of rome by entering into the feelings of the people of the time titus livius known in english as livy lived in the reign of augustus his monumental history ab urbe condita from the founding of the city is our principal source for the first several hundred years of roman history from its mythic origins to the beginnings of its mediterranean empire for sheer pleasure and escape reading livy straight through is an experience comparable to reading tolkien tolstoy or gibbon in other words it is one of the great reading experiences of a lifetime other ancient sources for early roman history include the biographies of plutarch ciceros de republica the geography of strabo the histories of dionysius of halicarnassus diodorus siculus cassius dio and polybius the plays of plautus and the fasti of ovid a lesserknown work by the great latin poet that gives fascinating details about the practice and origin of various roman customs and religious rites our sources for the later republic include the history of appian and suetoniuss biography of julius caesar books by modern authors which i found especially stimulating included augusto fraschettis the foundation of rome edinburgh university press first published in italy as romolo ii fondatore in t p wisemans remus a roman myth cambridge university press jacques heurgons the rise of rome to bc university of california press nigel bagnalls the punic wars bc osprey and keith richardsons daggers in the forum the revolutionary lives and violent deaths of the gracchus brothers cassell i also found inspiration in thomas babington macaulays lays of ancient rome an imaginative nineteenthcentury reconstruction of ancient roman ballads shakespeares tragedy coriolanus and shakespeares long narrative poem the rape of lucrece william smiths dictionary of greek and roman antiquities i own a copy of the edition as well as smiths threevolume dictionary of greek and roman biography and mythology from and samuel ball platners a topographical dictionary of ancient rome mine is the edition were my daily companions both books can be found online along with many other texts maps and additional information at a web site called lacuscurtius maintained by bill thayer during the research and writing of roma my visits to this extraordinary horn of plenty were too numerous to count when i needed to borrow a real book i visited the libraries at the university of california at berkeley readers who want to know the precise location of monuments and landmarks should consult the book mapping augustan rome journal of roman archaeology supplementary series largely produced by scholars at the university of pennsylvania the largescale maps that accompany their book are works of prodigious research and exquisite design for sheer pleasure readers may want to have a look at the map roma arcaica a publication of the museo della civilità romana available from the american classical league a birdseye view of the city as it might have appeared in the early days of the roman republic this novel has been the largest and most complicated project ive ever undertaken and im grateful to those whove helped me along the way the earliest origin of roma can be traced to nick robinson of constable my publisher in the uk who proposed that i should attempt a novel beyond the scope of my roma sub rosa series it was at nicks flat in london that i first put forth the idea that became this book it was during a walk along barton creek in austin texas that i further discussed the idea with my editor at st martins press keith kahla who understood at once what i was attempting to do a few years and roughly words later i gratefully received keiths insightful comments on the first draft krystyna green my editor at constable in the uk also played an active role in following the books development im also grateful to gaylan dubose teacher of latin and author of farrago latina who read the galleys and gave me valuable feedback special thanks as always to my partner rick solomon and to my agent alan nevins both of whom never fail to buoy me up when i need it the sometimes uncannily familiar political struggles and partisan machinations in roma are not my invention nor have i done much to modernize the terms of the debates the long tug of war between the patricians and the plebeians the cynical tactic of the warmongering ruling class to exploit religious rhetoric and fear of outside threats to their own advantage the political shift of the descendents of appius claudius from far right to far left the witchhunt that eradicated the subversive cult of bacchus the appeal of the highborn gracchi to the disenfranchised rabbleeach of these incidents is given to us in explicit detail by the sources the republic of the romans endured almost twice as long as has our own so far and they confronted the paradoxes and paradigms of class struggle long before we did whether the american republic will end with the rise of an allpowerful executive as did that of the romans remains to be seen was fascinus the first deity of the romans as recounted in roma according to plinys natural history fascinus was the name of a god worshipped by the vestal virgins who placed his image a fascinum or phallus amulet under the chariot of those who triumphed as a protection against fascination what we would call the evil eye varro tells us that phallic amulets were often hung around the necks of roman children to protect them they were also placed in gardens and on hearths and forges anyone who visits pompeii will notice phallic graffiti and sculptures but few may realize that an image that may appear obscene to the modern eye was sacred to the ancients the mystical phallus that rises from a hearthfire appears in the origin myth of the roman king servius tullius and even earlier in a variant of the origin story of romulus as related by the historian promathion early greek authors like promathion were the first to speculate on the beginnings of rome upon which they tended to superimpose their own myths eventually the romans themselves would link the foundation of their city with a greek legend the fall of troy the subject of the aeneid by virgil what is extraordinary about promathion as t p wiseman notes in remus is that this early greek author evidently reported a native roman story the phantom phallus is a totally ungreek concept greek gods do not manifest themselves in such a way if promathions depiction of the divine phallus is drawn from an authentic and very early roman myth and if this phallus from the hearth is the same deity that later became known as fascinus then it may indeed be that fascinus was the first roman god livy i suspect would understand my reasons for making it so
