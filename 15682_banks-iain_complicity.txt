complicity by iain banks chapter independent deterrent you hear the car after an hour and a half during that time youve been here in the darkness sitting on the small telephone seat near the front door waiting you only moved once after half an hour when you went back through to the kitchen to check on the maid she was still there eyes white in the halfdarkness there was a strange sharp smell in the air and you thought of cats though you know he doesnt have cats then you realised the maid had pissed herself you felt a moment of disgust and then a little guilt she whimpered behind the black maskingtape when you approached you tested the tape securing her to the little kitchen chair and the rope holding it against the stillwarm aga the tape looked just as youd left it either she hadnt been struggling or she had but it had had no effect the rope was good and taut you glanced at the shaded windows then shone your torch at her hands taped to the rear legs of the chair her fingers looked all right it was a little difficult to tell because of her dark olive filipino skin but you didnt think youd cut off her circulation you looked at her feet tiny in the lowheeled black slippers they appeared healthy too a drop of urine fell and joined a pool on the tiled floor beneath the chair she was quivering with fear when you looked into her face you knew you looked terrifying in the dark balaclava but there was nothing you could do about that you patted her shoulder as reassuringly as you could then you went back to the telephone seat by the front door there were three phone calls you listened to the answermachine intercept them you know what to do his scratchily recorded voice said to each caller his voice is quick clipped and vaguely upperclass do it after the beep tobias old chap how the devil are you geoff wondering how youre fixed next saturday fancy a foursome out at sunny sunningdale give me a tinkle bye beep ah yes ahh sir toby mark bain again ah i rang earlier and the last couple of days umm well id still very much like to interview you as ive said sir toby but well i know you dont usually give interviews but i do assure you ive no axe to grind and i do very much appreciate as a fellow professional what youve achieved and would genuinely like to find out more about your views anyway clearly it is up to you of course and i do respect that ill ah ill try your office in the morning thank you thank you very much good evening beep you abrupt old bastard tobes give me a ring about that diary story im still not happy and get that bloody car phone repaired you smiled at that one that rough colonial voice its commanding tone contrasting with the harrovian chumminess of the first message and the whining workingclass midland entreaties of the middle one the proprietor now there was a man youd like to meet you glanced up into the darkness towards the wall at the foot of the stairs where there are various framed photographs there is one of sir toby bissett with mrs thatcher both smiling you smiled too then you just sat there breathing carefully thinking keeping calm you took the gun out once reaching round under your thin canvas jacket to the small of your back and easing it from between shirt and jeans the browning felt warm through your thin leather gloves you snicked the magazine out and back in again a couple of times and ran your thumb over the safety catch making sure it was on you put the gun back again then you reached down pulled up the right leg of your jeans and slipped the marttiini out of its lightly oiled sheath the knifes slim blade refused to glint until you tipped it just so and it reflected the little flashing red light on the answermachine there was a small greasy smudge on the steel blade you blew on it and rubbed it with one gloved finger then inspected it again satisfied you slid the knife back into its leather sheath and rolled the denim back down and waited until the jaguar drew up outside engine idling in the quiet square bringing you back to the present you stand up and look through the spyhole in the broad wooden door you see the dark square outside distorted by the lens you can see the steps down to the pavement the railings on either side of the steps the parked cars sitting at the kerb and the dark masses of the trees in the centre of the square the jag is right outside beyond the cars at the kerb street lights reflect orange on the cars door as it swings open a man and a woman get out hes not alone you watch the woman straighten the skirt of her suit as the man says something to the driver and then closes the jaguars door shit you whisper your heart is pounding the man and the woman walk towards the steps the man is holding a briefcase its him sir toby bissett the man with the quick clipped voice on the answermachine as he and the woman reach the pavement and make for the steps he takes the womans right elbow in his hand shepherding her towards the door youre looking through shit you whisper again and glance back down the side of the stairs towards the hall and the kitchen where the maid is and where the window through which you entered is still half open you hear their footsteps on the pavement the skin on your forehead prickles beneath the balaclava he lets go of the womans elbow switches the briefcase to his other hand and reaches into a trouser pocket they are halfway up the steps you start to panic and stare at the heavy chain hanging at the side of the door by the bulky chubb then you hear the sound of his key in the lock startlingly close and hear him say something and hear the womans nervous laugh and you know that its too late and you become calm standing away from the door until your back is against the coats on the coatstand and you slide your hand into the pocket of the canvas jacket and it closes round the thick weight of the shotfilled leather cosh the door opens towards you you hear the jags engine purring away the hall light comes on he says here we are then the door closes and they are there in front of you and in that instant you see him turned slightly away putting his briefcase down on the table beside the answermachine the girl blonde tan midtwenties holding a slim briefcase glances at you she does a doubletake you are smiling behind the mask putting one finger up to your lips she hesitates you hear the answermachine spin back squeaking as the girl starts to open her mouth you step forward behind him you swing the cosh and hit him very hard across the back of the head a hands width above his jacket collar he collapses instantly falling against the wall and down over the table dislodging the answermachine as you turn to the girl she opens her mouth watching the man crumple to the carpet she looks at you and you think shes going to scream and you tense ready to punch her then she drops the slim briefcase and holds her shaking hands out in front of her glancing down once at the man lying still on the floor her jaw is trembling look she says just dont do anything to me her voice is steadier than her hands or her jaw she glances down at the man on the carpet i dont know who she gulps eyelids fluttering nervously you watch her trying to speak through a dry mouth who you are but i dont want anything just dont do anything to me ive got money you can have it but this isnt anything to do with me right just dont do anything to me okay please she has a refined voice a sloane voice a roedean voice you halfdespise her attitude halfadmire it you glance down at the man he looks very still the answermachine lying on the carpet clicks to a stop at the end of the tape you look back to her and nod slowly you move your head to indicate the kitchen she looks that way hesitating you point towards the kitchen with the cosh okay she says okay she walks backwards down the hall hands still in front of her she backs into the kitchen door swinging it fully open you follow her through and turn on the light she keeps walking backwards and you hold up one hand to make her stop she sees the maid in the chair tied to the stove you motion her to another of the red kitchen chairs she glances at the wideeyed maid again and then seems to come to a decision and sits you move away from her towards the working surface where the roll of black maskingtape sits you cover her with the gun as you push the balaclava away from your mouth and pull out a length of tape with your teeth she looks calmly steadily at the gun some of the colour gone from her face you keep the gun pressed into her waist as you loop the tape round her slim goldbraceleted wrists you keep glancing through the doorway down the length of the hall to the dark shape crumpled at the front door knowing you are taking an extra unnecessary risk then you put the gun away and secure her darkstockinged ankles she smells of paris you put a tencentimetre strip across her mouth and leave the kitchen putting the light out and closing the door you go back to sir toby he hasnt moved you remove the balaclava and stuff it in a jacket pocket lift your crash helmet from behind the coatstand and put it on then take him under the armpits and haul him upstairs past the framed photographs his heels bump on each step your breath sounds loud inside the helmet hes heavier than you expected he smells of something expensive you cant identify a strand of his long grey hair falls to one side onto his shoulder you drag him into the sitting room on the first floor shouldering the door to the hall closed as you enter the room is lit only by the street lights outside and in the semidarkness you stumble and almost fall over a coffee table something falls and breaks shit you whisper but keep pulling him towards the tall french windows looking out over a small balcony onto the square you prop him against the wall by the side of the windows and look outside a couple pass on the street you give them two minutes to leave the square and wait for a couple of cars to pass then you open the windows and step outside into the warm belgravia night the square seems quiet the city is a faint background roar in the orange darkness beyond you look down at the marble steps leading to the front door and the tall black spiked railings on either side of them then you go back in take him under the armpits again lift him through the windows and prop him against the stone parapet of the waisthigh balcony a last glance around a car passes across the top of the square you hoist him up so that hes sitting on the parapet his head tips back and he moans sweat dribbles into your eyes you feel him move weakly in your arms as you manoeuvre him into the right position glancing down at the railings three or four metres below then you tip him backwards over the edge he falls onto the railings hitting with his head hip and leg there is a surprisingly dry cracking crunching noise his head twists to one side and one of the railing spikes appears through the socket of his right eye his body sags arms hanging to each side of the railings over the marble steps and the stairwell leading to the basement flat beneath his right leg hangs over the steps there is another faint crunching noise as the body spasms once and then goes limp blood spreads blackly from his mouth over the collar of his white shirt and starts to drip onto the pale marble of the steps you back away from the parapet glancing from side to side some people walk into the far end of the square maybe forty metres away approaching you turn and go back into the sitting room locking the windows and avoiding the coffee table and the broken vase lying on the carpet you go downstairs and walk through the kitchen where the two women sit tied to their chairs you leave via the same window you entered by walking calmly through the small back garden into the mews where the motorbike is parked you hear the first faint distant screams just as you take the bikes key from your pocket you feel suddenly elated youre glad you didnt have to hurt the women its a clear cold october day fresh and bright with a few puffy little clouds scudding above the mountains on the chilly breeze i look through the binoculars towards the shallow slant of helensburghs gridpattern streets then move the view up to the slopes and woods behind then track left across the hills on the far side of the loch and the mountains beyond further round still towards the head of the loch i can make out the gantries jetties and buildings of the naval base there are some distant shouts and the noise of hooters over the buzz of boat and helicopter engines i look down to the little spit of shingle straight across from me where a few hundred demonstrators and locals are gathered stamping their feet and waving banners a chopper clatters overhead i look out into the firth where another three helicopters are circling above the black mass of the submarine the tug escorting police launches and circling inflatables move slowly into the mass of cnd boats a jet ski cuts across the view on a wall of spray i put the glasses down and let them hang from my neck while i light another silk cut im standing on the roof of an empty freight container on a bit of waste ground near the shore in a village called roseneath looking out over the gare loch watching the vanguard arrive i lift the binoculars again and look out at the submarine it fills the view now black and almost featureless though i can just make out the different textures of the hulls sloped and upper surfaces the protesters inflatables buzz round the perimeter of the subs satellite system of escorting boats trying to find a way through the mod inflatables are larger than the cnd boats and they have bigger engines the servicemen wear black berets and dark overalls while the cnd people wear bright jackets and wave big yellow flags the huge submarine in the centre moves forward in their midst ploughing sedately towards the narrows the rn tug is leading the submarine in though not towing it a grey fisheries patrol boat follows the flotilla the big helicopters bark overhead hi you give us a hand up ya bastart i look over to the edge of the container and see the head and arms of iain garnet he waves following our lead as usual eh iain i ask him hauling him up from the top of the same oildrum id used fuck off colley garnet says amiably bending to dust off the knees of his trousers iain works for our glaswegian competitor the dispatch hes late thirties getting heavy round the waist and thin on top hes wearing what looks like a lateseventies skiing jacket over his crumpled grey suit he nods at the cigarette in my mouth can i take a fag i offer him one his face wrinkles with disdain when he sees the packet but he takes one anyway jeez cameron really silk cut the cigarette for people who like to think theyre giving up i had you down as one of the last of the serious lung abusers what happened to the marlboros theyre for cowboys like you i tell him lighting his cigarette what happened to your fags left them in the car he says we both turn and stand there looking out across the blueglittering waves at the small armada surrounding the giant submarine the vanguard is even bigger than id expected huge fat and black like the biggest blackest slug in all the world with a few thin fins stuck here and there as an afterthought it looks too big to fit through the narrows in front of us some fuckin beast eh iain says half a billion quids worth sixteen thousand tonnes aye aye iain says wearily and long as two football pitches you got anything original though but i shrug not telling you read the article big wean he looks around wheres your man with the instamatic and the dodgy modelrelease forms i nod towards a small speedboat waiting near the entrance to the narrows getting a fisheye view what about yours two iain says one here somewhere the other one sharing a chopper with the beeb we both look into the sky i count four navy sea kings iain and i look at each other cutting it a bit fine with the helicopter arent they i ask he shrugs probably arguing about who tips the pilot we both stare out at the sub again the protesters boats are constantly charging in towards the vanguard only to be headed off each time by the mod boats bulging rubber hulls bumping off each other and then bouncing over the chopping waves preceded by the tug the trident subs bulbous nose moves smoothly towards the narrows ratings wearing yellow lifejackets stand at ease on the deck of the huge ship some in front of the tall conning tower some behind the people on the spit of land across from us are shouting and jeering a few might be cheering give us a shot of your binocs iain says i hand him the glasses and he squints through them as the navy tug leading the sub moves slowly through the narrows roisterer says its nameplate hows things at the caley these days anyway iain asks oh same as usual wow he says taking his eyes away from the glasses and looking shocked steady now sure you want to say that were still on the record you know youll be on the fucking record you hack you eastcoast boys are just jealous of our computer system because ours works oh sure we watch the long grossly phallic shape slide into the narrows its tall hull obscuring the crowd of people on the spit of land across from us little capped heads sticking out of the top of the conning tower look over and down at us i wave one of them waves back i feel a strange guilty happiness the helicopters are noisy overhead the swirling pattern of cnd and mod boats is compressed by the narrows the inflatables dance and bob around each other bumping together it looks a bit like spastics trying to dance an eightsome reel but that isnt an image id use in the article some demo down in london yesterday eh iain says handing me back the binoculars i nod last night i watched television pictures of the drenched crowds as they wound slowly through the london streets protesting against the mine closures yeah i say i grind the cigarette out on the containers rusting roof six years too late to do any good people realise scargill was right aye hes still a bumptious cunt though but doesnt matter he was right thats what i said a right bumptious cunt garnet grins at me i shake my head and nod at the fisheries boat tailing the small fleet squeezing its way through the narrows what do you think would you say that boats bringing up the rear or bringing up the stern i mean we are talking nautical here iain squints at the ship as the huge bulk of the submarine continues to slide past us i can see him trying to think of a remark thinking there must be something on the lines of no its bringing up its dinner or something equally strained about a nautical remark but theyre both poorquality leads and he obviously realises this because he just shrugs and takes out his notebook and says search me pal he starts scribbling squiggles garnet must be one of the last of the shorthanders few people of our generation trust in pitman any more preferring to rely on olympus pearlcorders you still offdiary this weather then cameron yeah a roving newshound without portfolio thats me uhhuh hear youve got a tame blemish on the face of the body public feeding you morsels these days that right cameron garnet says quietly not looking up from his shorthand notation i look at him what a massive harbour breakwater he says grinning toothily at me i stare at him a facial blemish he says a breakwater a small insectivorous subterranean furry animal no get it he shakes his head at the grossness of my ignorance a mole he says patiently oh i say hoping i appear suitably mystified he looks hurt so is it true what that youve got some mole in the security services or something equally hushhush feeding you tasty stuff about some big story in the offing i shake my head no i tell him he looks disappointed who told you this anyway i ask him was it frank his brows go up his mouth makes an o and he draws in a breath sorry cameron cant reveal my sources i give him a pained look then we both turn to watch the submarine there is a faint distant cheer as one of the cnd inflatables finally manages to break through the encircling military boats evades the police launches and speeds in to bump into the sloping black stern of the trident submarine sliding briefly up onto its rump like a gnat trying to mount an elephant before being chased away again a tv crew capture the moment i grin feeling vicariously pleased for the protesters after a while the tall grey shape of the patrol boat orkney hums past following the huge submarine orkney garnet says thoughtfully orkney i can almost hear his brain working trying to make a connection with tomorrows big home news event when the report into the orkney childabuse fiasco will be published knowing garnet a comment involving seamen is far from out of the question i keep quiet trying not to encourage him he throws his cigarette butt away perhaps misinterpreting the gesture somebody at the stern of the orkney waves at us iain waves cheerily back aye get yer coxn lads he calls not loud enough for anyone on the boat to hear he sounds pleased with himself how amusing iain i say stepping to the edge of the container fancy a pint later i jump down via the oildrum going already are you iain says then na got to interview the faslane commander and get back to the office yeah im heading for the base too i tell him see you there i turn and walk across the waste ground towards the car dont give us a hand down then ya snobby edinburgh bastart he calls i hold up one hand as i walk away okay i pass the submarine a minute later as i drive out of the village and towards the head of the loch and the naval base on the far side the submarine looks oddly menacingly beautiful in the bright sunshine a blackly gleaming hole in the scape of land and water i shake my head twelve billion quid to take out some probably already empty silos and incinerate a few tens of millions of russian men women and children except they arent our enemies any more so what was always obscene and definitively deliberately useless becomes pointless even more of a waste i park the car for a while on an elevated stretch of the road past garelochhead looking down the loch and watching the submarine approach the dock there are a few other cars parked and groups of people watching come to try and get some of their taxmoneys worth i light a cigarette winding the window down so i can blow all that unhealthy smoke away my eyes are smarting with tiredness i was up most of last night working on a story and playing despot on the computer i look around to make sure nobodys watching feel inside my north cape jacket and take out the little bag of speed i dip a moistened finger in the white powder in one corner and then suck the finger smiling and sighing as the tip of my tongue goes numb i put the bag away again and continue smoking unless of course you counted the trident systems use in geopolitical economic terms as part of the wests vast arms buildup the buildup that broke the communist bank finally devastating a soviet system no longer able to compete it bankrupted the us too turning the worlds greatest creditor nation into the worlds grossest debtor in two easy presidential terms but a lot of dividends had been paid out in the meantime and the debt was something for the next few generations to worry about so fuck em so as communism disappeared and the threat of total global holocaust evaporated and just left us with everything else to worry about and as those enticing eastern markets opened juicily up and the old ethnic hatreds pressured into solution under the comrades bubbled and frothed themselves up to full bursting pressure maybe this giant black slug this potentially cityfucking countryfucking planetfucking prick sliding up between the thighs of the loch could take some of the credit hell yes i start the car feeling charged and alert and justified again fully firing on all cylinders and just fizzing with the good great goddamn gonzo juice of the determination to get down to that there nuclear submarine missile base and cover the story as the blessed st hunter would say at the base past the peace camp where protesters wave placards past the densemeshed fences topped with rolls of razorwire and through the tankstopping gates after showing my press accreditation and being directed to the relevant building for the press briefing and typing part of the story into the laptop while waiting for everybody else to arrive the naval officers answering the questions look fresh and fit and seem decent and polite and somehow regretfully but steadfastly sure that they are doing something thats still important and relevant later the protesters in the peace camp outside most wearing layers of droopily grubby cardigans and ancient combat jackets and sporting dreadlocks or sideshaves seem just the same i drive back to edinburgh listening to gold mother with the speed wearing off fast tailing away like an engine losing revs all the way along the m the news room of the caledonian is busy as usual crowded with desks and shelves partitions bookcases terminals plants piles of papers printouts photographs and files i thread my way through the maze nodding and saying hello to my accomplice hacks cameron frank scare says looking up from his terminal frank is fifty with bouffant white hair and a complexion that succeeds in being moderately ruddy and childishly smooth at the same time he talks with a singsong voice and after lunch usually a slight lisp he likes to remind me what my name is whenever he sees me some mornings this helps frank i say sitting at my desk and squinting at the little yellow notes decorating the side of the terminal screen frank sticks his head and shoulders round the other side of the screen providing an unambiguous visual cue to the fact that he still thinks coloured shirts with white collars are neat so hows the latest component of britains vital and totally independent deterrent then he asks seems to work it floats i tell him logging onto the system franks biro taps delicately at the topmost of the little yellow notes your mole rang again he says another wildgoose chase i glance at the note mr archer will phone me again in an hour i look at my watch about now probably i agree i check my olympus pearlcorder has a blank tape in it the recorder lives beside the phone and gets to listen in on any potentially exciting calls youre not moonlighting are you cameron frank says bushy white brows furrowing at me what i say putting my jacket over the back of the chair you havent got two jobs and this mole is your excuse for getting out of the office have you is it frank asks trying to look innocent his biro continues to tap against the side of the terminal screen i take hold of the end of the biro and gently push it away directing frank back towards his own seat frank i tell him with the imagination youve got you should work for the sun he sniffs and sits down i scroll through the email and the wires for a bit then frown and stand up looking over the terminal at frank whos sitting with his slim fingers poised over the keyboard chuckling at something on the screen what did you tell iain garnet about this socalled mole did you know frank says sounding mischievous that yetts o muckart becomes yetis o muscat under the spellcheck he grins up at me then his expression becomes serious pardon you heard what about iain he asks did you see him there today how is he what did you tell him about this mole i peel the note off the screen and wave it at frank he looks innocent amnt i supposed to say anything well i didnt know he protests i was talking to him on the phone the other day must just have come up in conversation terribly sorry im about to say something when the phone rings with an outside call frank smiles and makes a lobbing pointing motion with his biro that might be your mr archer now he says i sit down lift the receiver the line is terrible mr colley the voice is machinelike synthesisedsounding i dont doubt its mr archer but i could believe im talking to stephen hawking i switch the pearlcorder on stick its earpiece in my ear and put the microphone attachment over the telephone earpiece speaking i say mr archer yes listen i have something new on this thing well i hope so mr archer i tell him im getting i cant speak for long not on your phone the mechanicalsounding voice continues go to the following location i grab a pencil and a pad mr archer this had better not be another langholm bruntshiel road phone box usual time mr archer thats langholm bruntshiel road phone box usual time the voice repeats mr arch i have another name for you this time mr colley says the voice what the line goes dead i look at the phone then peel off the microphone attachment as franks smiling face appears round the side of the screen he taps his biro absently on my keyboard our friend he inquires i tear the sheet off the pad and stick it in my shirt pocket yep i say i log off the system gather up the pearlcorder and pull my jacket on again frank smiles radiantly when he sees me doing this and clicks something on his watch off so soon well done cameron he says i think thats a new record tell eddie ill phone in the story on your head my boy no doubt i head for the door i do a very little medicinal powder in the gents then having so girded my septum bloodstream and hemispheres in the magic powder i take the down to langholm deep in the western borders i compose the rest of the vanguard article in my head as i drive its a sunday so getting out of the city is easy but the roads in the countryside beyond are full of crap drivers mainly little old guys wearing bunnets and staring intently through the steering wheel i can remember when they all drove marinas and allegros but nowadays they seem to be issued with escort orions rover s or volvo s all apparently fitted with governors limiting their speed to thirtynine and a half miles per hour i get stuck in a line of traffic and after a couple of hairy overtakes which result in various people flashing their headlights at me and which are purely the result of the speed i decide to slow down stop shouting at people accept my lot and enjoy the scenery the trees and hills look sharp and vivid in the slanting lateafternoon light slopes and trunks coated yelloworange or standing in their own shadows crowded house provide the sound track the sky fades to deep violet before five and the headlights of oncoming cars start to hurt my eyes obviously i was too conservative with that last medicinal blast i stop in a layby just past hawick for a booster shot langholm is a quiet little town near the border i dont have a map of the place but finding bruntshiel road takes only five minutes of driving around i check out the phone box at one end of the street and park the car alongside theres a hotel two minutes walk away time for a drink the lounge bar is dustily ramshackle and has yet to suffer the atmospherebypass operation brewers call remodelling its moderately busy with a mixture of people a double whisky doesnt take too long to knock back and keeps the system in equilibrium what with the speed aboard ive been economising ever since i got my new pc so its a grouse instead of a single malt but it does the job my mobile goes while im finishing the whisky its the paper reminding me its nearly deadline time i turn away from the inquisitive stares of the locals and mutter into the cellphone saying ill be phoning in real soon now honest i buy some cigarettes have a pee and return to the car i mate the tosh to the cigarette lighter in the dash and type out the rest of the vanguard piece by the light of the street lamp above the phone box im yawning but i resist the pull of the little plastic bag i finish the story then take out the modem and call the story into the paper back in the car theres still ten minutes until mr archer calls hes usually prompt i nip back to the hotel for a quick single whisky the phone in the box is ringing when i get back i run in grab it and fiddle with the olympus clicking it on and untangling the wires cursing under my breath hello i shout who is that says the calm mechanical voice i get the recorder working and take a deep breath cameron colley mr archer mr colley i will have to ring you back later but the first name i have for you is ares what who the name i have for you is ares ares you will remember the other names i have already given you yes wood ben ares is the name of the project they were working on when they died i have to go now but i will call back in an hour or so i will have some more information then goodbye mr archer dead dead is also what the people mr archer has been calling me about are they were all men their names were wood harrison bennet aramphahal and isaacs mr archer gave me the names the first time he brought me on one of these tourofscotland telephonic rendezvous mr archer does not trust mobiles cant say i blame him the names sounded vaguely familiar at the time and seemed to have a weird implicit seriality about them plus as soon as he mentioned them i suddenly thought of the lake district without knowing why mr archer gave me the names and rang off before i could ask him anything else about them i still have this tetchy pride about remembering things myself but in the office the following morning i logged into profile and let it do the hard work profile is just a staggeringly gigantic database that probably knows your maternal greatgrandfathers insideleg measurement and how many sugars his wife took in her tea almost anything mentioned in a broadsheet over the last ten years will be there as will stuff from us european and far eastern newspapers plus whole oceans of information from a zillion other sources the names posed it no problems the five dead geezers all expired between six and four years ago and they were all connected with either the nuclear industry or the security services each death looked like suicide but all of them could have been murders there was speculation in the press at the time that something murky was going on but nobody seemed to get anywhere so far all mr archers added to what i could find in the papers library is some detail about exactly how the men died and tonight that project name ares i sit in the car for a while tinkering with the whisky article ive been working on for a while and wondering who or what ares is a few people use the phone box i play some rather pathetic lowlevel games on the tosh wishing i had a decent colour machine with the speed and the ram and the hard disk to run despot i roll a joint and smoke that listening to the radio and then to my kdlang tape but its too soporific and i turn the radio on but its too inane so i scrabble in the glovebox until i find trompe le monde by the pixies and that keeps me awake better than speed though the tapes stretched a bit because ive played it so much and so the sound comes and goes a bit but thats cool im running through the woods at strathspeld on a bright summers day im thirteen years old and while im running im also looking at myself from outside as though im watching all this on a screen ive been here many times before and i know how to turn away from this place i know how to escape from it im just about to do that when i hear a bell i wake up and the phone is ringing it takes me a second to realise ive been asleep and another second to remember where i am i leap out of the car and into the box just ahead of an old man walking his dog who is that says the voice cameron colley again mr archer look there is one other person who knows about the ones who died mr colley the gobetween i do not know his real name yet when i find out i will tell you what his codename is jemmel i will spell that for you the stephen hawking voice says it does so got that mr archer but who goodbye mr colley take care mr but mr archer rings off shit i shout i forgot to record the call too i sit in the car for a while entering the name jemmel into the tosh it means nothing to me i head back to the hotel for a piss and a last drink another double one for the road now that the first ones probably out of my system i havent eaten since this morning but i dont feel hungry i force myself to eat some dried peanuts and have a half of murphys to wash them down and for the iron i used to drink guinness but ive been boycotting the stuff since those bastards lied about moving their hq to scotland in the car i suck a little speed purely in the interests of road safety itll keep me awake then smoke a joint as i drive away just to keep things balanced theres a radio scotland programme on at midnight which sometimes does a tomorrows headlines bit right at the end i listen to it and sure enough they mention our headline tomorrow but were leading with the manoeuvring in the tory party on the runup to the maastricht vote i feel let down but then they mention that the photograph on our front page is of the vanguard arriving at faslane so i know my storys there and with any luck at all itll be alongside the photo on the front page rather than buried inside i experience a modest thrill of newsfix a dose of journobuzz this is a kind of hit unique to the profession nearinstant inprint gratification i suppose if youre a standup comic a live musician or an actor the reward is similar and even quicker but if what youre into is the printed word and the dubious authority of onthepage blackandwhite then this is entirely the biz the best fix of all comes from a frontpage splash but a page lead on an oddnumbered page provides a pretty sublime high and only getting a basement piece on an even page produces any sensation of letdown i have another joint to celebrate but it makes me a little drowsy and it takes a definitelylastofthenight microlick of speed and another fix of trompe le monde to even things up again chapter chill filter im very tempted to call in at the paper and pick up a copy fresh off the presses which will be rumbling away now shaking the whole building the smell of ink and the greasy feel of the print always powerfully reinforce the newsfix buzz plus id like to check my vanguard story to see what violence the subeditors have succeeded in inflicting on it but as i drive down nicolson street suddenly the idea of subs cutting a story about a sub seems wildly amusing and i find myself giggling uncontrollably making me sniff and sneeze and bringing tears to my eyes i decide that im too wasted to be able to put on a sober face for the printroom boys so i head home instead i get back to cheyne street about one oclock and have the usual enforced tour of stockbridge by night looking for a parking place before finding one only a minute from the flat im tired but not sleepy so i have a nightcap spliff and a twofingers of tescos single malt during the next couple of hours i listen to the radio and watch allnight tv out of the corner of my eye and tinker with the whisky story on the pc and then deliberately do not play despot because i know id only go and get involved and be up until dawn and sleep all day and not be up in time for tomorrows job i have an appointment with a distillery manager at noon so instead i go back to xerium and play that recreational play in other words not serious stuff a game to wind down to not get wound up by xerium is an old favourite almost like a pal and even though there are still a few bits of it i havent cracked ive never looked for hints or cheats in the magazines because i want to get there myself which isnt like me and anyway its fun just flying around and adding to the map you gradually build up of the island continent the games set on finally i crash the good ship speculator trying as usual to find a probably nonexistent route between the peaks of the mountains of zound i swear ive tried every gap in those damn hills hell ive even tried flying straight through the mountains thinking one of them is supposed to be a hologram or something but i crash every time there just doesnt seem to be any way of getting through or of gaining enough height to fly over the damn things there is supposed to be a way into the rectangular territory the mountains enclose somehow but im fucked if i can work out what it is not tonight anyway i pass on another attempt and load the slower of my two asteroids programs and obliterate a few zillion rocks in glorious wireframe monochrome until my fingers ache and my eyes are smarting again and its time for some decaff and bed i get up bright and fresh and after a good fiveminute cough and a shower the only wakemeup i have is some freshly ground arabica i munch some muesli and suck on a quartered orange while i look through the whisky story which is due in today so this is really my final chance to work on it apart from any lastminute thoughts after seeing the distillery at lunchtime i sneak a look at my current status in despot too but resist firing the program up i stare accusingly at the toshs nicads which i forgot to charge up last night then transfer the tinkeredwith whisky article to disk and search out some clean clothes from the pile on one side of the bed where i dumped them after last weeks laundry run leaving the clothes on the bed can sometimes make you think theres somebody in there with you when there isnt which can be comforting but is distinctly sad you havent had a fuck for well over a week this pile of clean clothes on the duvet is telling me still im seeing y in a couple of days so even if nothing else turns up theres always that to look forward to theres some mail junk and bills mostly ignore for now take the bleeper mobile tosh nicads and slotin radio down to the the car has not been broken into or scratched helps not to wash the pug set the nicads charging from the cigarette lighter take off into a cool bluewhiter sunshine and clouds stop along the road for papers scan headlines make sure that no latebreaking story displaced the vanguard piece and that its intact ninetyfive per cent a satisfyingly high score check out doonesbury in the grauniad then away over the roadbridge and fast through fife once up to cruising speed needle in that to region the jamsandwich boys ignore unless theyre particularly bored or in a really bad mood steer with knees while rolling spliff feeling good in a childish way and laughing at myself and thinking dont try doing this at home kids leave number aside to smoke later turn left at perth the drive to the distillery takes me along part of the route to strathspeld i havent been to see the goulds for so long and i half wish id started out earlier so i could drop in but i know it isnt really them i want to see its the place strathspeld itself our longlost paradise with all the aching poisonsweet memories it holds though of course maybe its andy i really remember and miss maybe i just want to see my old soulmate my surrogate brother my other me maybe id go straight there if he was at home but he isnt hes way far north and being reclusive and i must visit him too someday i pass through gilmerton a wee village just outside crieff where id turn off for strathspeld if i was heading that way used to be there was a collection of three identical little blue fiat s sitting facing the road here outside one of the houses they were there for years and years and i always meant to stop off here and find the owner and ask him why have you had these three little blue fiat s sitting outside your house for the last decade because i wanted to know and besides it might have made a decent story and over the years there must have been millions of people whove passed this way and wondered the same thing but i never did get around to it always in a hurry rushing past anxious to get to the tainted paradise that strathspelds always been to me anyway the three little blue fiat s disappeared recently so theres no point guy seems to be collecting transit vans these days i felt hurt almost grieved when i first saw that house without the three little cars outside it was like a death in the family like some distant but friendly uncle had copped it i play some old stuff from uncle warren for the same nostalgic reasons i came this way deep in the glens at lix toll theres another automotive roadside attraction standing outside the garage there a bright yellow land rover about ten foot tall facing the road not on wheels but on four black triangular tracks like the bastard cross of a landy and a caterpillar earthmover been there a few years now leave it another few and i might go in and ask them why have you sweep past in a hurry the distillery is just outside dorluinan hidden in the trees off the oban road across the rail line and up a narrow lane through the forest the manager is a mr baine i go to his office and we do the usual distillery tour through the damp halfenticing smells and the kiln heat and past the gleaming stills past the gushing glass cupboard of the spirit safe until we end up in the chill darkness of one of the warehouses standing looking out over rows of broadbacked barrels gloomily lit from above few small grimy armoured skylights the roof is low supported by thick gnarled wooden struts resting on widely spaced iron columns the floor is compacted earth hard as concrete after a centuries of use mr baine looks worried when i tell him about the article hes a bulky droopyfaced highlander in a dark suit with a technicolor tie that makes me glad im facing him here in the soft darkness of the warehouse not outside in the sunlight well basically just the facts im saying grinning at mr baine that back in the twenties the yanks objected to their whisky and brandy going cloudy when they added ice to it so they told the distillers to fix what they regarded as a problem the french being the french told them what to do with their ice cubes while the scots being british said certainly heres what well do mr baines woundedspaniel looks take on an extra tier of unhappiness as i tell him all this i know i shouldnt have taken that microlick of powder while we were going through earlier but i couldnt resist it there was an irresistibly appealing gettingawaywithit promissory glee about sticking my finger in my mouth then my pocket then my mouth again and as mr baine talked and i looked interested while my tongue went numb and the chemical taste thickened in my throat and this firingly chargingly addictive illegal drug did its business while we walked round this perfectly legal governmentfinancing drug facto so im gibbering but its good but mr colley so the distillers brought in chillfiltering lowering the the temperature of the whisky until the oils that cause the cloudiness come out of solution and then straining the stuff through asbestos to remove the oil only that removes a lot of the taste as well which you cant put back and the colour which you can put back using caramel isnt that right mr baine has a hangdog look ah well broadly he says clearing his throat and looking out over the ordered sea of barrelbacks disappearing into the gloom but ah is this going to be um a whatdoyoucallit an expose mr colley i thought you just wanted you thought i just wanted to do yet another article on what a grand beautiful country we live in and how lucky we are to produce this worldrenowned dollarearning drink and isnt it lifeenhancing used in moderation and just generally great well well its up to you what you write mr colley mr baine says i have raised a smile but ah i feel you might be misleading people by emphasising things like well the asbestos for example people might think theres asbestos in the product i look at mr baine product did i hear him say product but im not going to be suggesting that at all mr baine this will be a straight factual article aye aye but facts can be misleading out of context uhhuh you see im not sure about the tone but mr baine i thought you were in sympathy with the tone of this article thats why im here today i was told youre thinking about producing a real whisky with no chillfiltering and no colouring a premium brand using the cloudiness and the oils that are left in as a selling point basing the ads on it even well mr baine says looking uncomfortable the marketing people are still looking into that mr baine come on we both know the demands there the smws does a roaring trade caddenheads shop in the royal mile well its not that simple mr baine says looking even more uncomfortable now look mr colley can we talk you know without you reporting it you want to talk off the record aye off the record all right i nod mr baine clasps his hands under his suitclad belly and nods in a serious manner look ah cameron he says dropping his voice ill be honest with you we have thought about testmarketing this premium brand youre talking about and using the lack of chillfiltering as a unique selling point but you see cameron we couldnt survive on that alone even if it did work not for the foreseeable future at any rate weve got other considerations to take into account well probably always have to sell the vast majority of our product for blending thats our business thats our livelihood and as such we rely on the goodwill of the firms we sell to firms much much larger than we are youre saying youve been told not to rock the boat no no no mr baine looks distressed at being imperfectly understood but you have to realise that a great deal of the success of whisky has to do with its mystique the the image the customer has of it as a unique highvalue product its almost mythical cameron its the uisgebeatha the water of life as they say its a very strong image and a very important one for the scottish export drive and national economy if we as frankly a very junior player in all this do anything that conflicts with that image such as putting the idea into the publics head that all the other whiskies they can buy are chillfiltered andor caramelcoloured well yes then youll rock the boat i say so youve been told to shelve the new premium brand or forget about ever selling whisky for blending again and so going out of business no no no mr baine says again but as we stand there in the chilly gloom of the spiritfragrant warehouse surrounded by enough maturing hootch to float a trident submarine i can see that the real answer even off the record is yes yes yes and im thinking yay a conspiracy a coverup armtwisting blackmail corporate pressure on the little guy this could be an even better story you enter through the back door using a crowbar the door and the lock are both heavy but the frame has rotted beneath its layers of paint over the years as soon as youre in you take the elvis presley mask from your daypack and slip it on then pull the surgeons gloves from your pocket and snap those on too the house feels warm from the afternoon it faces south and has an uninterrupted view out over the links of the golf course towards the estuary so it catches a lot of sun you dont think theres anybody in yet but you arent sure there wasnt time to watch the place all day it feels and somehow sounds empty you slip from room to room feeling sweaty beneath the slick latex of the mask the late evening sun has turned the faint high clouds over the sea pink and the light falls into every room filling them with rose and shadows the stairs and a lot of the floorboards creak the rooms look clean but the furniture is oldfashioned and mismatched castoff you satisfy yourself theres nobody in ending up in the main bedroom of the house youre not very happy with the bed its a divan you inspect it in that reddening gloaming then heave the mattress off leaving it propped against the wall still no good you go through to the other front bedroom which also looks out over the course and the sea the room smells unlivedin even slightly damp this bed is better this one has an iron frame you pull the bedding off and start to tear the sheets into strips you look out of the window as you do this watching a couple of military jets over the sea in the distance to the right beyond the railway line you can see the curve of beach leading out to the wooded point and catch a glimpse of the lighthouse there rising above the trees then you see mrs jamieson coming though the gate from the road and up the garden path and you duck down walking quickly to the door and the top landing you listen to the front door opening mrs jamieson comes in and goes through to the kitchen you remember the creaking stairs you hesitate for a second then walk normally to the stairs and go down them with a fairly quick heavy tread whistling the steps creak murray mrs jamiesons voice calls from the kitchen murray i didnt see the car you reach the foot of the stairs mrs jamiesons whitehaired head appears beyond the banister rails to your right her face turning to you you swing round seeing her start to react mouth dropping you already know what youre going to do how youre going to play this so you punch her knocking her down she collapses to the floor making little flustered birdlike noises you hope you didnt hit her too hard you haul her up and keep your hand over her mouth as you drag her upstairs you pin her on the divan base and stuff a handkerchief in her mouth using the handle of the stanley knife then pull a pair of her tights over her head tie them round her neck and mouth and put her inside the old heavy wardrobe in the main bedroom pulling out the few clothes hanging there and handcuffing her to the rail she whimpers and cries but the gag muffles everything you pull the tights shes wearing down and tie her ankles together above her sensible brown brogues then you close the wardrobe doors you sit on the divan base pull off the mask and sit there breathing hard and sweating you cool off then put the mask back on and open the door again mrs jamieson stands trembling her eyes through the dark grey mesh of the tights looking bright and wide you shut the door then close the curtains in that bedroom and the one with the ironframe bed her husband arrives half an hour later parking the car in the drive he comes in by the front door and youre waiting behind the kitchen door as he walks through you make a noise he turns and you punch him sending him clattering back against the kitchen cabinet producing an avalanche of willowpattern plates he tries to get up so you hit him again hes very old and youre quite surprised it takes two punches to lay him out though hes still a decent weight you stuff a pair of his wifes panties in his mouth and do the same trick with the tights over the head and tied round the neck then drag him upstairs to the second bedroom you can smell hes been drinking recently g ts probably some cigarettesmoke smell too youre sweating again by the time you get him onto the bed with the iron frame you tie him to the bed face down hes starting to come round when hes secured you take out the stanley knife he was carrying a light windcheater which you left in the kitchen and hes wearing a blue pringle sweater with a knickerbockered golfer depicted on the front a marks spencers check shirt and a light string vest you cut his clothes off flinging them into one corner his fawn slacks scatter golf tees when you throw them aside his socks are bright red his yfronts white his golf shoes are brown and white heavily spiked and with elaborate tongues and tasselled laces you take off your daypack you get the pillows from the main bedroom and stuff them and those from this bed under the old mans torso raising his body from the bed hes making spluttering shouting noises now and moving weakly you use a couple of rolledup blankets to bring his rump up further then go back to the daypack and sort out the things youll need he struggles as though wrestling with a pinned invisible opponent hes making a noise like hes choking but you dont do anything yet you take the top off the cream theres a spitting hacking noise and he must get at least some of the gag out of his mouth because he splutters stop this stop this i say not the gruff homecounties voice you recall from the television more highpitched and strained but thats hardly surprising in the circumstances he sounds less frightened than you expected though look he says in something more like his normal voice deep and nononsense i dont know what you want but just take it and get out theres no need for this no need at all you squirt some of the cream onto the vibrator i think youre making a mistake he says trying to twist his head round to see you seriously we dont live here this is a holiday home its rented theres nothing of value here at all he struggles some more you kneel on the bed behind him inside the inverted v of his scrawny varicosed legs there are broken veins on his back and upper arms his shanks look grey and withered his buttocks are very pale almost yellowish and the skin on his thighs below the level shorts would come to has a grainy mottled appearance his balls hang like old fruit surrounded by wiry grey hair his cock looks slightly engorged thats interesting he feels you get up onto the bed and shouts look i dont think you know what youre doing this is aggravated burglary young man you ah youve put the creamsmeared tip of the vibrator against his anus greypink and pursed between his spread buttocks the cream must feel cold what he shouts voice muffled by the gag stop what dyou think youre doing you start to work the creamy plastic dildo into him twisting it from side to side and watching the skin round his anus stretch and whiten as the ivorycoloured plastic slides in a thin collar of white cream builds up there ah ah stop all right i know what youre doing i know what this is about all right so you know who i am but this is no way to ah ah stop stop all right youve made your point those women look all right i may have said things i regretted later but you werent there you didnt hear all the evidence i did you didnt hear the men who were accused you couldnt form an opinion of their character the same with the women ah ah ah stop please youre hurting youre hurting you have the vibrator about a third of the way in not quite up to its maximum girth you press harder pleased at how much grip the surgeons gloves give you but halfwishing you could say something though you know you cant which is a pity ah ah jesus christ for gods sake man are you trying to kill me look i have money i can ah ah you filthy bastard he moans and farts at the same time you have to turn your head away from the smell but you push the vibrator in further you can hear seagulls crying outside beyond the closed curtains stop just stop this he shouts this isnt justice you dont know all the facts about those cases some of them were dressed like whores dammit theyd let any man have them they were no better than whores ah fuck fuck you filthy blackguard bastard you filthy fucking queer bastard ah he pulls and bucks rattling the bed and pulling the knotted sheetstrips tighter you bastard he splutters youll pay for this you wont get away with this theyll catch you theyll catch you and ill make damn fucking sure they give you a lesson in the cells youll never forget dyou hear me do you you leave the vibrator in there and switch it on he heaves and pulls again but it doesnt do any good oh for gods sake man he moans im seventysix what sort of monster are you he starts sobbing and my wife he says coughing what have you done with my wife you get off the bed and take out the little wooden box from the zipped pocket of your shellsuit carefully slide the lid off and tease apart the nest of toilet tissue inside the wad of tissue holds a tiny vial of blood and a needle its a dirty disposable syringe needle a little thing barely a centimetre long with a cone of ribbed orange plastic at the end that would fit onto the body of the syringe you listen to him as he curses you and threatens you and you are still unsure you couldnt decide when you were planning this whether to infect him with hivpositive blood or not you couldnt make up your mind whether he really deserved it and so youve left it until now to make your decision sweat runs into your eyes as you stand there dyou get a thrill from this do you is that it he spits closet queer are you he coughs then twists his head trying to look back at you are you still there are you what are you doing now having a wank eh are you you smile behind the mask and fold the toilet tissue back over the vial and the needle leaving them in the box you slide the lid shut again and put it back in your jacket pocket you take a couple of steps back towards the door where he can see you you filthy bastard he spits you filthy fucking bastard i served the best i could for thirty years youve no right to do this this doesnt prove anything dyou understand it doesnt prove anything id do it all just the same if i had my time again all of it i wouldnt change one sentence you fucking little cunt you rather admire the old fellows attitude you slip through to the other room to make sure his wife is all right shes still trembling you leave her hanging there in the mothballscented darkness of the old wardrobe you go downstairs pack the elvis mask back into the daypack with the rest of the stuff and leave by the back door you arrived through its still light and the evening is only just starting to turn chilly as you walk down the back path beneath a deep blue sky ridged with high dark clouds a cool wind comes in off the sea and you pull your jacket collar tight your hands still smell of rubber from the gloves i turn in the whisky story with a teaser paragraph at the end promising further revelations concerning armtwisting moves being made by the big corporate boozebarons to silence the brave little whisky wizards meanwhile i try to work out whats going on in the longrunning mole story the ares story ares the god of massacre according to the mythology dictionary in the papers library i throw jemmel at the databases but they draw a blank even profile throws up its silicon hands in defeat cameron its yourself frank informs me indubitably so you thought youd put in an appearance well well hey guess what the spellcheck thinks colonsay should be no idea frank colonic hilarious and carnoustie hmm carousing he laughs carousing even funnier by the way eddie wants to see you oh eddie the ed is a wee wizened sandyhaired man of fiftyfive or so who wears halfmoon glasses on his pointy nose and always looks like hes just briefly tasted something extremely sour but is finding it actually quite amusing because he knows youre about to taste it too soon and for longer technically eddie is only acting editor while our real great helmsman sir andrew is away for an indefinite period recovering from a heart attack presumably brought on by that common editorial affliction of having too much heart our resident cynic in the sports section pointed out that sir andrews heart attack occurred only a short decent interval after the murder of sir toby bissett back in august and hazarded that it was a kind of preemptive strike to take him off the target list of what a few editors at the time halfsuspected was some editoroffing loony whose next target was them personally well blame a host of guilty consciences and the confusion caused when the ira apparently claimed responsibility for tobes murder and then retracted it no other editors were spiked though at least that showed our assassin had a sense of humour and anyway eddie seems not to worry about such threats to his temporarily elevated position the editors office of the caledonian probably has one of the best views in all newspaperdom looking out over princes street gardens to the new town the river forth and the fields and hills of fife beyond with a sidewindow view of the castles best profile thrown in just in case the occupant ever gets bored with the frontal aspect i have kind of a bad association with this room after an unsuccessful foreign trip last year which resulted in a visit here to see sir andrew i left with my ears singed if displaying editorial outrage was an olympic sport sir andrew would undoubtedly be on the british team and saddled with the crushing burden of being a medal hope id have resigned there and then except i got the impression that was just what he wanted me to do cameron come in sit down eddie says sir andrew is into furniture politics eddie is sitting on no housed within a throne of a chair all black carved wood and buttoned red leather and looking like its supported more than one royal rear im perched on the class equivalent of an honest artisan one fabriccovered step up from stackable plastic prole eddie did have the decency to look uncomfortable in this piece of powerseating when he first took over the job last month but i get the impression hes grown to like it eddie leafs through a printout on his desk the desk isnt quite as impressive as the chair only singlebed size rather than the kingsize i suspect sir andrew and maybe eddie would prefer but it still looks fairly impressive theres a terminal on its surface but eddie only uses that to spy on people watching the system as we type notes input a story fax outside or email insults to each other eddie sits back in his chair taking off the halfmoon glasses and tapping them against the knuckles of one hand im not sure about this whisky story cameron he says in the perpetually pained tones of kelvinsidemorningside refined oh whats wrong with it the tone cameron the tone eddie says frowning its a tad too combative you know what i mean too critical well im just sticking to aye the facts eddie says smiling tolerantly and sharing what he thinks is a private joke including the fact that you obviously dont like some of the larger distilling concerns by the sound of it he slips his glasses back on and peers at the printout well i wouldnt say thats how it comes across i say hating myself for feeling defensive youre bringing the fact that you know me to this eddie i dont think somebody coming cold to i mean eddie says slicing through my waffle like a steak knife all this about the distillers company and the guinness takeover is that strictly necessary its old news cameron but its still relevant i insist its in there to show the way big business works theyll promise anything to get what they want and then renege on it without a second thought theyre professional liars its only the bottom line that matters only the shareholders profits nothing else not tradition or the life of communities or the people whove worked all their lives in eddie sits back laughing there you go he says youre writing an article about whisky the adulteration of whisky and youve got stuff in here basically saying what a lying wee shite ernest saunders is lying big shite hes cameron eddie says annoyed taking off the halfmoons again and tapping the printout with them the point is that even if this wasnt very possibly libellous but nobody recovers from senile dementia it doesnt matter cameron it has no place in an article about whisky adulteration i add sullenly there you go again eddie says standing and heading to the middle of the three big windows behind him he halfsits on the windowledge hands on the wood my god laddie youre a terrible one for getting bees in your bonnet so you are god i hate it when eddie calls me laddie are you going to print it or not i ask him certainly not as it stands this is supposed to grace the front of the saturday supplement cameron its for hungover people in their dressinggowns to scatter their croissant crumbs across the way it reads at the moment youd be lucky to get it into the back of private eye i glare cameron cameron eddie says looking pained at my expression and rubbing his chin with one hand he looks tired youre a good journalist you write well you meet deadlines and i know youve had offers to go down south with an even wider brief and extra money and both andrew and i give you more leeway than some people here think you deserve but if you ask to do a saturday special on whisky we do rather expect it to have something to do with the cratur itself rather than read like a manifesto for class war its as bad as that television piece you did last year at least he hasnt mentioned the results of my little foreign trip he leans over and peers at the printout i mean look at this forcing ernest saunders to drink so much whisky his brain deteriorates to the bovinely spongy state he claimed it was in at the end of the guinness trial thats it was a joke i protest it reads like incitement what are you trying to youd let muriel gray away with it not the way youve put it i wouldnt well get it legalled then the lawyers im not going to get it legalled cameron because im not going to run it eddie shakes his head cameron he sighs quitting the window to resume his throne again you simply have to cultivate a sense of proportion what happens now i say ignoring this and nodding at the printout eddie sighs rewrite cameron try to dilute the vitriol instead of harping on about this asbestos filtering i sit and stare at the printout this means well lose the slot doesnt it yes eddie says im moving the national trust series forward a week the whisky piece will just have to wait i purse my lips then shrug okay give me till i look at my watch six i can have it redone by then if i work right through we can still make the no cameron eddie says exasperatedly i dont want a quick rehash with a few of the expletives deleted i want you to rethink the whole thing approach it from a different angle i mean get your criticism on the moral corrosion of late capitalism in implicitly if you must but make it implicit keep it subtle i know you we both know you can do it and that youre more effective when youre wielding the stiletto rather than the chainsaw take advantage of that for goodness sake im not mollified but i make a halfsmile and give a grudgingly confirmatory grunt agreed eddie asks okay i say nodding agreed good eddie says sitting back anyway hows everything else going liked that piece on the submarine incidentally nicely balanced just hovering on the brink of editorialising but never quite going over good stuff good stuff by the by i hear rumours you might have something interesting coming up involving a government mole that true i fix eddie with my best steely look it seems to bounce off whats frank been saying i ask i didnt say i heard it through frank eddie says looking all innocent and open too innocent and open a few people have mentioned you seem to have something on the go something youre not telling anybody about im not prying i dont want to know anything about it yet i just wondered if these rumours are true well they are i say hating having to admit it i eddie begins then his phone rings he looks annoyed as he answers it morag i thought he says then his expression changes to one of sour resignation yes all right just a second he presses the mute button and looks apologetically at me cameron sorry this bloody fettesgate thing highaltitude leaning going on got to field all this stuff nice talking to you see you later i leave the office feeling like ive just been to see the headmaster retreat to toilets for nosetonose with auntie crystal thank fuck for drugs andy and clare and i walked through the strathspeld estate from the house across the lawn and the terrace and through the shrub garden and the forest down into the glen and out again up to the wooded hill beyond and the densely overgrown dip where the old airshaft chimney was the chimney was one of two on the hill the old railway line ran directly underneath the line had been closed for thirty years and the tunnel entrances had been first boarded up and then filled in with rubble the viaduct over the speld a halfmile away had been demolished so that only the piers were still visible in the rushing waters the tracks themselves had been torn up leaving a long flatfloored canyon curving under the trees of the estate the two airshaft chimneys squat dark cylinders of undressed stone a couple of metres across and a little over half that high each capped with an iron grating had vented the steam and smoke from the trains in the tunnel you could climb up onto them and sit on the rusting iron grid afraid it would give way but afraid to admit you were afraid and look down into that utter blackness and sometimes catch the cold dead scent of the abandoned tunnel rising up around you like some remorseless chilly breath from there too you could let stones fall into the darkness to land with a distant hardly heard thud on the floor of the tunnel thirty or forty metres below once andy and i had come here with old newspapers and a box of matches and dropped the lit twisted papers into the hole and watched them slowly fall flaming spiralling silently downwards into the blackness until they hit the tunnel floor andy was eleven clare ten and i was nine we were there for a ceremony andy was slightly plump at the time clare agreeably normal i was everybody agreed wiry but id probably fill out like my dad had blimey clare said dark in here isnt it it was dark in high summer the outrageously tangled bushes around the chimney grew fast and green and blocking starving the hollow of light wed had to fight our way in here to the little oasis of calm clarity around the forgotten chimney itself now that we were here in its little green cave the light seemed dim and clotted clare shivered and clung to andy face puckering in pretended terror argh help andy grinned putting an arm round her never fear sis do the dreadful deed she cried making a face at me you first andy said handing the packet to me i took the box extracted a cigarette from it and put it in my mouth andy fumbled with the match lit it then quickly put it to the cigarette i sucked hard eyes narrowed i inhaled a smell of sulphur coughed immediately turned appropriately green and nearly threw up andy and his sister laughed themselves hoarse while i kept on coughing they each tried smoking too and pronounced it utterly foul quite disgusting what did people see in it adults were mad andy said but it looked good had we ever seen casablanca with humphrey bogart there was a film and who could imagine rick without a cigarette in his hand if not hanging from his mouth clare and i could as we mugged to each other hell id seen that film a couple of christmases ago hadnt i it was a marx brothers movie and there was nobody called humphrey bogart in it i could remember we tried another cigarette and by then id maybe instinctively sussed how to handle it i was getting a hit from the stuff i really toked on that second fag andy and clare just sipped at it took it into their mouths but not their lungs not their beings didnt accept it into their own personal ecospheres just giggled childishly peripheral not me i sucked that smoke in and made it part of me joined mystically with the universe right at that point said yes to drugs forever just by the unique hit i got from that one packet of fags andy liberated from his dad it was a revelation an epiphany a sudden realisation that it was possible for matter something there in front of you in your hand in your lungs in your pocket to take your brain apart and reassemble it in ways you hadnt thought of previously this was better than religion or this was what people always meant by religion the whole point was that this worked people said believe in god or be good or do well at school or buy this or vote for me or whatever but nothing actually worked the way substances worked nothing fucking well delivered like they did they were truth everything else was falsehood i became a semijunkie that day that afternoon that hour that secondfaglength moment in that first virginal rush of toxins to the brain i believe i started to become my later self i finally had my internal eyes opened to my true being truth and revelation what is actually going on what is literally the case what really works there you are the journo catechism the truthtellers tale written in any damn scrip or script you care to choose to denominate elect to go for or designate what fucking works i rest my case we threw the burnedout fagbutts down the chimney into the darkness without further ceremony we walked back towards the house and while andy was ahead of us he suddenly announced a race so we yelled protesting and darted off after him over the last hundred metres sprinting across the lawn and the gravel to the porch breathless in the main hall all pronounced the experiment at the old chimney a failure but in my heart i knew different chapter despot despot is a worldbuilder game from the headcrash brothers the same team that brought us brits raj and reich its their latest biggest and best its byzantinely complicated baroquely beautiful spectacularly immoral and utterly utterly addictive its only been out for two months and ive played it practically every day since the muggy monday morning in late august when i first stepped out of the virgin games shop on castle street clutching my shrinkwrapped copy and scuttled back to the office reading the outside of the pack like some sixties tenyearold with the latest airfix model im sat in the flat in cheyne street playing the game when i should be working on a story the trouble is that the game and the machine go together so well the headcrash team designed despot so that it takes advantage of whatever configuration of system its being played on with the maximum on a pc being a sx running at mhz with at least mb of ram and mb of harddisk space free plus an sbased graphics card fitted the game will run on anything down to an atari st and still work but it wont look remotely as good run so fast or have all the interactive features and obviously itll look just as good and do everything on a betterthanmaximum machine but it just so happens that the above spec is exactly what ive got on my machine this is purely a coincidence of course its not fate not karma not anything except a fortuitous accident but dammit its just so neat no waste no fat just exactly the right most elegantly ecooptimum system as near to stateoftheart as i could afford at the time barely a year ago and im still paying the now quite superseded bastard off to run this stunningly machiavellian turboscreamer of a game an instant classic easily a year ahead of its time and just possibly better than sex im playing despot but im thinking about sex im definitely seeing y tomorrow and i cant stop thinking about sex ive got an erection and im sitting here in front of the machine in the darkness crouched here in the box room of the flat with the light off and the radio on and the computer screen awash with the seductive gently scrolling graphics of despot and the light from the screen blue ochre red green throws the shadow of my cock onto my belly and the damn things getting in the way all the time so that i keep putting it under the desk where it rubs hard up against the metal strut at the front of the desk until that gets cold and uncomfortable and i have to push back in the chair and let the thick bobbing weight of it rest against the edge of the chipboard its big purple head and one little slitmoutheye staring dumbly questioningly up at me like some mute warm little puppy distracting me and i keep thinking i ought to have a wank but i dont want to because i want to save it all for y not because y particularly desires that or it affects my performance but because it just seems important part of the correct precoital ritual maybe i should just put some pants on and control the thing but i kind of like sitting here in the nude and feeling the gentle breeze of warm air from the fan heater in the corner blowing over my skin so the big wee man is throbbing looking forward to a welcome in the hillsides a homecoming in the glen even if its prepared to be palmed off with less but meanwhile the game is there to be played and threatens to play with itself if i do the same because despot is interactive despot will go on building your world for you even if you leave it alone because it actually watches you it learns your playing style it knows you it will actually try its little damnedest to become you all worldbuilder games emulating life or at least some aspect of it develop and change according to their programmed rules if you leave them running alone but despot is the only one that with a bit of coaching will actually attempt to emulate you i light another silk cut and sip a little whisky im staying off the speed for now but when i get to the next eralevel in the game and im hovering within a few gnp points of it at the moment im going to roll a number i draw hard on the silk cut filling my lungs with the fumes ive smoked a packet since six this evening when i started working and then turned to the game half a bottle of whiskys gone too and the inside of my mouths got that rough granular feel it gets when ive been drinking the stuff i gag on the smoke this happens sometimes when ive been smoking too much i grind the fag out in the ashtray and cough a bit and then look at the cigarette packet ive been meaning to give up for a while i keep thinking what is the point of using this drug the only cigarettes i ever get any actual hit from are the ones i have first thing in the morning when im barely halfawake anyway and in no state to enjoy it and my chests usually hurting from the morning cough and sometimes the first one after ive had a few drinks oh and the one i have after ive given up for a few days or hours i take the packet up in my hand my fist almost closes in fact it seems to me that i do actually see my hand close see the packet crumple and contract almost as though ive actually done it but then i think shit theres only five fags out of the box i ought to smoke those first it would be a waste not to i take out another cigarette light it and draw deeply i gag again coughing and hacking and feeling the whisky and the can of export i had earlier slosh around inside me almost coming up my eyes are watering what a stupid drug what a completely useless fucking drug no real hit after the first drag highly addictive and lethal in all sorts of ways and even if the lung cancer or the heart disease doesnt get you you can look forward to gangrenous legs in your old age bits of your body just rotting away still attached and dying in instalments for you rotting and stinking while youre still alive and then they have to cut them off and you wake up after the operation wheezing and burning with pain and gasping for a fag meanwhile the tobacco companies sponsor sport and fight off advertising bans and look forward to all the new markets in the east and the far east and more women taking up the weed to show that they can be brainless fucks too and suits with wormshit in their brains go on television and say well nobodys actually proved how tobacco causes cancer you know and you sit there seething and then you find thatcher is taking half a million from philip morris for a threeyear consultancy and you swear never to buy any of their products ever again but at the end of the day you still light another cigarette and suck in the smoke like you enjoyed it and make more profits for those evil fucks okay ive worked myself up enough i crush the packet it doesnt crumple very satisfactorily because there are so many fags still inside it but i persevere and use two hands and get it down to about half its earlier volume and then take it to the toilet and tear it open and empty the broken folded cigarettes into the pan and pull the handle and watch most of them just float and swirl in the churning water and get so annoyed at them for not all just flushing away out of my life like i want them to that i get down on my knees and put my hands into the water and one by one push their broken bodies and the rest of the paper and tobacco debris down into the water and back round the ubend so that they float up on the other side and i cant see them then i wash my hands and dry them and by that time the cisterns full again and i flush it and this time the waters clear at the end and i can breathe at last i open the skylight in the toilet and the one in the box room to get a through draught and stand there shivering until i pull on my dressinggown feeling mightily pleased with myself i sit down at the computer to find that my erarating in despot has slipped back a bit while all this has been going on but i dont care i feel righteous i suck the cold night air in and laugh snapping the mouse around the desk surface like a wild thing while the little hand sprite on the screen flashes from control surface to display grabbing icons and throwing them about my empire like thunderbolts building roads dredging ports burning forests digging mines and using the very ironic icon icon opening more temples to myself a horde of barbarians from the unexplored steppes to the south tries to invade and i lose an hour fighting the bastards off and have to rebuild the great wall before i can get back to the court display and continue my longterm strategy of weakening the power of the regional lords and the church by making the palace so luxuriantly sumptuously steeped in the ways of the flesh that the barons and the bishops become hopelessly decadent voluptuaries and hence ripe for the picking while my merchant classes prosper and i encourage cautious technological development i have another whisky and a bowl of coco pops with lots of milk my hand keeps reaching for the place where the cigarette packet would normally be but im coping with the cravings and surviving so far i really want some speed but i know if i have any ill want a cigarette afterwards so i leave it alone i have a brainwave and get my secret police to go down to the bazaar and find some drug dealers bingo the dealers are introduced to the court and soon most of the people ive been working on are thoroughly hooked it occurs to me this might actually be a better way of controlling things than just bumping people off which is what the secret police are usually best at i call it a day at am and only feel slightly jittery as i head for bed i cant get to sleep and i keep thinking about y after half an hour i give in and have a wank and fall gratefully asleep afterwards the building is warm and smells of dog you pull him through the door and lock it the hounds are already yelping and barking you turn on the light the kennels block is about the size of a double garage its breezeblock walls are bare striplights hang from the ceiling there is a broad central corridor between two rows of pens also made from breeze blocks the internal walls extend to just over head height and are open at the top the pens are floored with straw over concrete and the front of each pen is formed by a gate made from light angleiron and chicken wire so far everything has gone well you came across the fields and through the wood just after sunset checking the place out with the night sight and finding the big house dark and empty the alarm box high up on one gable wall glowed soft red you had already decided not to attempt breaking in you went down the drive the gatehouse was dark too the gamekeeper would be back after the pub in the village closed far enough up the drive so that it wouldnt be seen from the main road you felled a small tree with the handsaw then sat down to wait the range rover came growling up the drive two hours later he was alone still wearing his city suit you coshed him while he was standing looking down at the tree the cars idling motor covered any noise you made and he didnt even turn round you just drove the range rover right over the tree his arms move weakly as you haul him across the concrete and prop him against the gate of one of two unoccupied pens the dogs barks change as they see their master you put your daypack down on the concrete take out some plastic ties and hold them in your mouth as you try to haul him to his feet but hes too heavy his eyelids are flickering you let him slump back again so that hes sitting against the chickenwire gate and when his eyes start to open you pull his head forward by the hair and cosh him again he falls to the side you put the plastic ties back in your pocket youre thinking the foxhounds continue barking and yelping you find a hose attached to a tap beside the doors you remove the hose throw one end over the breezeblock lintel of the empty pen pull it through the chicken wire and tie it under his armpits he makes a moaning noise as the hose tightens round his chest you start to haul him upright but the hose breaks and he falls back against the gate shit you say to yourself eventually you have an idea you lift the gate off its hinges and lay it down on the floor beside him then you roll him over onto it he makes a noise somewhere between a moan and a snore you secure his wrists and ankles to the chicken wire with the plastic ties using two at each point youve tested the ties yourself they look flimsy but you couldnt burst one when you tried and youve seen us police on television use similar devices instead of handcuffs only youre not sure how strong the chicken wire is so using two on each wrist and ankle and tying them round different hexagons in the wire seems a sensible precaution the hounds are still barking intermittently but theyre making less fuss than they were you use a length of the hose to tie his waist to the angleiron strut that makes a zshape through the gate you undo his belt and pull his trousers down he has a deep tan from a holiday in antigua last month fading now you haul and scrape the gate over to the wall of the empty pen then you squat behind the top of the gate and heave it and him up sucking in your breath and grunting and then pulling the gate up still further and then letting the top edge of the gate rest against the wall of the pen you took the gate from the gate rests there at an angle of about sixty degrees hes starting to come round you change your mind about letting him talk and take the electrical tape from your daypack and bind it round his mouth and the back of his neck through the wire so that his head is held tight too there is some blood leaking from under his long fair hair it trickles down the nape of his neck and onto the collar of his shirt then while hes still making moaning noises through his nose you take the two cutout bits of newspaper and the little tube of glue from your daypack and stick the articles onto the breezeblock wall straight across from him one on either side of the gate the dogs inside leap up and snarl at you as you do this shaking the chicken wire the headline of the first article reads exminister in iran arms deal row and in smaller writing underneath it says it was my judgement that the interests of the west would best be served if the iraniraq war went on for as long as possible the headline of the second article reads persimmon defends closure plans primary concern shareholders and underneath are the words jobs go after only five years as grant runs out you wait for him to come round but hes taking a while you were impressed by how far the house is from any others and decide that rather than the silenced browning you brought you will risk using the shotgun he was carrying in the back of the range rover you go back out to the car and fetch the gun and a box of cartridges you lock the door behind you again hes awake though his eyes look glazed and uncoordinated you nod to him as you walk up and stand in front of him slotting a couple of the brownred cartridges into the gun his eyes move oddly as he tries to focus on you you are wearing dark blue overalls and a skiing balaclava similar to the one you used in london the gloves youre wearing are black skisilks the rt hon edwin persimmon mp is mumbling behind the tape and still trying to focus on you you wonder if you hit him too hard with the cosh and whether you ought not just to do it with the gun here and now and forget about the rest because it will be quicker and less dangerous for you but you decide to stick to the plan its important it shows that you are not just some nutter and the extra risk lifts you onto another plane of chance and luck you turn and go to the pen full of foxhounds they start barking again you work both barrels of the gun into one of the chickenwire hexagons at about waist height until the gun fits then you angle it downwards bend slightly so that your shoulder is firm behind the stock of the gun and fire both barrels into the mass of snarling dogs the gun kicks against your shoulder the noise is stupendous in the breezeblock space smoke rolls through the pen where one dog lies blown in half two more are lying prone and whimpering on the concrete and the rest are barking madly several of them are running round furiously in tight circles scattering straw you break the gun the cartridges pop out and one of them hits mr persimmon in the chest his eyes are wide and he is shaking the chickenwire gate hes tied to with all the might he can muster you reload the gun without taking it out of the mesh then aim more carefully and fire a barrel at a time killing two more of the dogs outright and wounding three or four the smoke is thick for a moment and tastes acrid in your throat the dogs sound frenzied now howling high and anguished one of the animals is still running round all the time but it keeps slipping on the blood you reload and fire again killing another two of the foxhounds leaving maybe half a dozen of them still leaping up at the walls and barking the one running round in a circle is bleeding from one back leg but hasnt slowed down you turn to mr persimmon and pull the bottom of the balaclava up over your mouth and above the squeals and the howls and the barks you shout they enjoy it really you know and wink at him then you reload the gun and blast another couple of them you avoid the one running round in circles because youve decided you like that one the smoke makes you cough you put the gun down and take the marttiini out from the sheath in your right sock you go over to mr persimmon who is still shaking the gate hes tied to as best he can it starts to slide down the wall with a scraping grating noise and you haul it upright again his eyes are very wide there is a lot of sweat on his face you feel quite sweaty too its a warm evening youve left the bottom of the balaclava up so he can see your mouth you go close to him so that he can watch you only through his left eye and over the whimpers and whines and the few weak hoarse barks from the pen opposite you say in tehran in the main cemetery they had a red fountain a fountain of blood to the martyrs who died in the war you stare at him and hear him trying to say or shout something the noises coming down his nose sounding clogged and distant youre not sure whether hes swearing at you or pleading with you those found guilty of capital offences during the later stages of the war werent shot or hung you continue they were made to contribute to the war effort too you hold the knife up so he can see it his eyes cant go any wider they bled them to death you tell him you crouch down in front of him and make a deep downward incision into his left thigh opening the artery to the air the scream comes down his nose as he shakes the chickenwire frame the bright blood pumps out and up spattering onto your gloved hand and jetting upwards in a pink spray that soaks his underpants and rises as high as his face freckling it with red you alter your grip on the knife to cut into the other leg hes rattling the chickenwire gate for all hes worth but everything holds and the gate cant slide forward because youre squatting there in front of it blocking it with your boots his blood spurts fiercely shining in the overhead lights it runs down both his legs and drips off his underpants it runs down to the trousers round his ankles and soaks into them you stand up reach forward and take the neatly folded handkerchief out of the breast pocket of his jacket flick it open and wipe the blade of the marttiini on it until the knife is clean the knife comes from finland thats why its name has such a strange spelling it hasnt occurred to you before but its nationality seems appropriate now and even funny in a grim sort of way its finnish and youve used it to finish mr persimmon the blood is slowing now his eyes are still wide but they look glazed again he has stopped struggling his body hangs limply though hes breathing hard you think he might be crying but maybe its just sweat on his face which is very pale now you actually feel rather sorry for him because hes become just another dying man and so you shrug and say oh come on it could have been worse you turn and pack your stuff away and leave him there the blood only dribbling now his skin very white beneath the tan some of his blood has gathered on the concrete in front of him and joins with the pool slowly spreading from the cage full of dead or whimpering dogs you put the lights out and hold the browning up at your shoulder as you open the door and then check the grounds outside with the night sight i want to weep im with y but shes brought her husband along they turned up together at the paper but when reception rang through they just said that she was there so i went skipping down the stairs like a kid on a promise and then i saw them together in reception standing looking at the display showing staff photographers most recent efforts and my heart sank into my shoes yvonne tall and lithe and sveltely muscular in a dark skirt and jacket silk shirt black hair short trimmed to the nape in a new even more severe haircut but jutting peaked over her forehead she turned to me just as my face was completing its fall she smiled apologetically and william turning too broad handsome face bursting into a grin when he sees me william blond as yvonne is dark built like an olympic oarsman perfect teeth and a handshake like a gorilla cameron good to see you been too long how are you okay fine fine i said smiling as sincerely as i could nodding up at him william is high as well as broad he towers over me and im a shade over six foot yvonne put her hands on my shoulders and kissed my cheek shes almost my height in her heels heels she prefers flatties and only wears heels because they bring her ass up to the right level when im taking her from behind as she brushed her lips across my cheek i smelled her perfume cinnabar my favourite i exchanged pleasantries thinking so much for taking the afternoon off right william clapped his hands together and rubbed them together where are we going to go well i was thinking of just popping down to viva mexico i said and almost added as usual looking plaintively at yvonnes bright red lips na william said grimacing i fancy some oysters lets go to the cafe royal what dyou say i said umm i thought oysters our treat yvonne said taking her husbands arm and smiling i met yvonne and william at university back in the cusp of these times our years at stirling neatly bracketing thatchers first and second victories they were doing businessstudies courses he was from birmingham though his parents were scottish she was from bearsden outside glasgow they met in the first week and were an item when i bumped into them in the sports pavilion a term later one saturday afternoon when william was about to play rugby and yvonne was looking for a squash partner id been waiting for my opponent a guy from my mediastudies course to show for half an hour and was about to give up and head for the bar when yvonne suggested we played each other she thrashed me we must have played a couple of hundred games over the years since then and ive beaten her exactly seven times usually when shes been about to go down with or is just recovering from a cold or some other ailment i blame the drugs and the fact that apart from the occasional athletic sex session with yvonne a fortnightly game of squash is about the only exercise i get yvonne and i were just pals until she and william moved to edinburgh three years ago and one time when william was away she and i met to go and see of all things dangerous liaisons but never made it to the film because we just got drunk in the pub instead and somehow started kissing and then in the taxi on the way back to cheyne street had to be told to cool it by the driver because we were practically fucking on the back seat we got half a metre inside the front door of the flat then it was knickers down trousers down and a knee trembler against the wall her head forced forward by the gas meter and my backside getting cold from the draught coming in through the letterbox we usually make it to the bed these days but its been an interesting and varied physical relationship and yvonne swears she does things with me shed never even mention to william whose predilections seem to begin and end with quite liking his wife to wear a basque and stockings considering he looks like such a broth of a boy its slightly disappointing to be told hes squeamish about blow jobs and quite horrified however politely and apologetically at the idea of going down on yvonne so that plus wrestling covered in baby oil eating icecream from her vulva pretend rape and bondage sodomy are all treats reserved for me apparently so were sitting in the cafe royal after a breezy walk down north bridge and william has slipped a dozen live oysters down his throat yvonne and i had chowder and were talking computers because i use them and im interested in them and william works for a company that makes them their scottish manufacturing base is in south queensferry but the companys hq is in maryland in the states he was due to fly out there today but just as he was about to kiss the lovely yvonne goodbye this morning and leave their delightful triplegaraged splitlevel lounged saunad jacuzzid executive villa with ensuite facilities and satellite dish set in an exclusive walled prestige development amongst mature trees with a residentsonly country clubhouse restaurant pool nautilus gym squash and tennis courts he got a phone call telling him the trip had been postponed for a few days were sitting at a table in a corner of the restaurant william and yvonne sit sidebyside on a green leather bench seat opposite and im on an ordinary chair directly across from yvonne shes playing footsie with me under the table her shoe off her black nylon foot stroking my right calf im assuming the starched white tablecloth is long enough to hide this meanwhile im talking about s and clockdoublers and the upcoming p chip and cdrom and there are at least three things going on in my head because part of my brains busy handling my conversation with william another part is revelling in the sensations being produced by his wifes foot sliding up to my knee giving me a monstrous erection under my napkin and a third part is sort of sitting back listening to me talk to this cheery affable man im cuckolding and its thinking what a cool bastard i am and how chatty informed and charming im being while suffering this delicious hidden public prickengorging distraction were talking about multitasking and i almost want to say to him you want to know about multitasking im doing it right now pal yvonne is looking just a little bored with all this computer talk which is probably why she started fondling my leg in the first place shes not into computers shes into bankruptcy management straight from university she joined a small firm specialising in easing the death throes of failing businesses shes been all over britain doing this stuff and last year they made her a director its not a small firm any more growth industry she delicately stifles a yawn and sits back in her seat and i take a sudden breath which i have to disguise with a cough as her foot suddenly slides up between my legs i foolishly lift my napkin to dab my lips after the pretend cough and christ theres her foot resting on the front of my seat her stockinged toes flexing forward to stroke my cock through the material of my trousers i put my napkin down again quickly and return to the subject of fullmotion video from cdrom hoping nobody saw her foot i dont think so could have been embarrassing if thered been a waiter nearby i surreptitiously pull the tablecloth over my lap and her foot as well shes sitting back in her seat grinning slightly at me toes curling and uncurling as they stroke me i lift my champagne flute nodding wisely at something william has just said anyway must dash for a slash he says rising yvonnes foot tenses against my crotch but she doesnt take it away yvonne and i watch him go then we lean over the table towards each other at the same time god you look fuckable i tell her mmhmm she says she shrugs sorry about all this never mind god you look fuckable want to meet up the day he goes yes i gulp yes yes yes take off your shoe and get your foot up between my legs she says quietly im not wearing any knickers oh christ an hour later and im standing in the gents toilet back at the paper with my right sock wrapped round my dick masturbating the smell of the sock clings to the skin around my nose before i wrapped it round my cock i sat sniffing it hauling its scent deep into my lungs this is the second wank ive had i really was about to come as i sat there eating my lobster with yvonnes foot stroking my crotch and my foot up her skirt i had to excuse myself withdraw my foot get my shoe back on and walk awkwardly down to the gents in the cafe royal to pull myself off before i disgraced myself at the table barely had to touch the thing this is taking only a little longer the sock reeks with a fiercely erotic womanscent thank god we were eating seafood yvonne ah here we go cameron you all right fine frank you look a bit pale feel all right good carse of gowrie pardon carse of gowrie you know near perth guess what the spellcheck prefers i give in curse of gorily stop it youll make me cry theres a better one look frank ive really got to do some research i tell him grabbing a notebook and heading for the library hell i have to work with the guy better to stage a tactical retreat in the face of the utterly unamusing spellcheck runningjape than lose the rag and tell frank where to stick his software the caley still has a library where the cuttings are kept when you start getting into a story the first step is usually getting the cuts up and this is where they come from i suppose in a few years absolutely everything will be stored in databases and youll be able to do this sort of thing from anywhere in the world by modem but for now theres a real place you have to come to if you want to look up the more obscure reference books the papers precomputer files and back issues of the caledonian itself though even these are held on microfiche rather than actual newsprint the caleys library is housed in a single cavernous room deep inside the building two floors below the reception area it has no windows you cant hear any traffic or trains and its actually pretty restful unless the presses are running i exchange a few words with joanie our head librarian then settle in and start exploring apart from confirming that ares is the god of massacre which may or may not have any relevance to anything i cant find much theres no reference to anybody or anything called jemmel i find myself leafing through the stuff ive already discovered about wood bennet harrison aramphahal and isaacs wood and isaacs worked for british nuclear fuels ltd bennet for the nuclear inspectorate aramphahal was a cryptography expert at gchq and harrison was a dti guy with rumoured links to mi aramphahal went down to the railway track that ran at the bottom of his garden near gloucester tied a rope round his neck secured the other end to a tree on one side of the track and himself to a trunk on the opposite side and waited for an express wood lived in egremont a small village in cumbria he took a bath with an electric drill not the batterypowered type bennet was found drowned in a farm cesspit near oxford isaacs tied an ancient and very heavy typewriter to his feet and threw himself into derwent water and harrison sat in a hotel room in windermere and swallowed the two liquids which react together to make cavitywall insulation foam choked to death they all seemed to know each other and they all had very hazy work records with long gaps in them when nobody seemed to know where theyd been and none of them had any close colleagues or at least none whod admit to being close to them it all looked suspicious as hell and i know people on a couple of the london broadsheets who were trying to find out if this was more than a series of coincidences but nobody ever got anywhere there was a question asked in parliament and a police investigation was launched but it promptly submerged and didnt discover anything either or if it did it was kept very quiet according to mr archer the five dead men all had one thing in common an injection mark on the arm andor a contusion on the back of their skull where theyd been hit the implication was that none of them had been conscious when theyd supposedly killed themselves mr archer claimed to have seen copies of the original forensic records that proved this but i like other hacks had checked with the relevant local cops and coroners and discovered nothing untoward though admittedly the old guy in cumbria whod done the pms on isaacs wood and harrison had died of a coronary shortly after the police investigation began which was either a coincidence or not but unprovable either way especially as hed been cremated like the other five had im shaking my head at all this conspiracytheory stuff and just starting to wonder whether the sensation at the back of my eyes is the start of a headache or not when the library extension rings joanie calls me over its for me cameron its frank yes i say through my teeth this had better not be another spellcheckism your mr archers on the phone shall i put him through ahha oh why not there are a few clicks while i think shit i cant record this call either and then the stephen hawking voice mr colley speaking mr archer i have more what jemmels real name still eludes me but i know the name of the agent the sales representative for the enduser uhhuh his name is smout he spells it for me okay i say thinking the name sounds familiar and hes the one they dont talk about in baghdad but but the line goes dead there are a couple of clicks a sequence of faraway noises like touchtones and a faint barely audible echo they dont talk about in baghdad but i put the phone down feeling just a little dizzy still somewhat tipsily drunk from lunch cocksore from two heavily frustrated wanks and mind reeling with the implications of what mr archers just told me not to mention the heavy hint that even if i wasnt able to somebody somewhere was recording it all the thing is i know who smout is i did an article on him the forgotten hostage the man who like mr archer says they dont talk about daniel smout is or was a mediumranking arms dealer whos been in prison in baghdad for the last five years charged at first with spying and then convicted of drug smuggling he was sentenced to death but that was commuted to life imprisonment hmg has always shown a marked reluctance to have anything to do with him and the last time any diplomatic representative saw him was three years ago but theres been a persistent rumour that he was an agent for the west working on something so sensitive that nobody involved wanted the press or anybody else to know anything about it and the reason hes been banged up is to stop him talking after whatever deal he was working on finally fell through so were talking about a project with the codename of the god of massacre involving iraq a very secret deal and five dead men including at least three who had access to nuclear intelligence and two to physical nuclear product plutonium in the place where theyve managed to lose more weapongrade material than your average nukeambitious thirdworld dictator has ever had wet dreams of acquiring british nuclear fuels limited general communications headquarters the nuclear inspectorate the department of trade and industry and an agent a sales rep for the enduser mr archer called him in baghdad dear holy shit i hit the news room to show my face and just as i get to my desk my phone goes and i jump and grab it and its mr archer again i get the pearlcorder working this time mr colley i cannot talk now but if i can call you at home on friday night i hope to give you something more then what i say putting a hand through my hair at home this is a departure all right my number i have your home number goodbye goodbye i say to the silent receiver everything all right frank asks eyebrows arched in concern fine i say grinning wildly and probably unconvincingly just fine retreat to toilets again claiming dodgy ingredient in lunchtime chowder and snort some speed then take a walk out to salisbury crags and sit on rock looking out over the city smoking a spliff and thinking oh mr archer whatever are we involved in chapter injection uh hi andy is that you uh yeah who is this the voice is slow sleepysounding what do you mean who is this you rang me its cameron the man who left a message on your answeringmachine all of ten minutes ago cameron andy for christs sake its me cameron childhood buddy your best fucking friend remember me wake up i cant believe andy sounds so sleepy okay it is midnight but andy never used to hit the hay much before two at the earliest oh yeah cameron i thought i recognised that number how you doing im all right yourself oh you know yeah yeah im all right im fine you sound stoned well you know look if its too late ill call some other time no no thats all right im sitting in the box room of the flat tv on sound off the machine on and the despot statusscreen showing its a friday night and i should be out enjoying myself but im waiting for mr archer to call and besides im frightened if i do anything too enjoyable ill want a fag so thats another reason for staying in and watching tv and playing games but just then i started to think about ares and those five dead guys and the lad in the clink in baghdad and suddenly i thought cameron you are definitely dealing with something from the desk of pearl frotwithe here and got scared and wanted to hear another human voice so i rang andy because i owe him a call and ive hardly spoken to him since he was here for a weekend during the summer but got his answermachine there in the dark hotel only a couple of hundred kilometres away though he still sounds faint and distant i think i can hear his voice echoing in the spaces of that quiet cold place so been doing anything exciting i ask him nothing much bit of fishing been up on the hill you know you oh the usual fucking about covering the story hey ive given up fags again no finally right you still fucking that married piece fraid so i say and am glad that he cant see the grimace i make when i say this this is awkward because andy knows yvonne and william from our stirling days he used to be really friendly with william and though they seem to have gone their separate ways since i dont want andy to know about me and yvonne i always worry hell guess its her yeah what was her name again i dont think i ever told you i tell him laughing and sitting back in the chair frightened ill tell somebody he says sounding amused yeah i live in perpetual fear our enormous circle of mutual friends will find out huh but you should find yourself your own lady yeah i say imitating a stonedout drawl gotta find ma own chick like maan well you never did take my advice keep trying one day you ever go the other way these days eh you know with guys what good grief no i mean i look at the receiver in my hand no i say hey i just wondered why do you i ask and then regret the tone because it sounds like im at least disapproving if not actually homophobic na andy says na i dont i kind of you know i lost interest in all that stuff he chuckles and i imagine again that i can hear the noise echoing in the dark hotel its just you know old habits die hard but they do die i tell him dont they i guess so usually shit i say leaning forwards and starting despot running on the screen because i need to be doing something and normally at this point id be reaching for the cigarettes i was thinking about coming up there sometime soon and dropping in on you youre not going weird on me are you gould cabin fever man highland angst he laughs again no you come on up let me know like first but yeah be great to see you look forward to it been too long well soon then i use the mouse to check the games geoupdate you done anything with that fucking mansion eh oh the place yeah the place no nothing nothings changed get any of the leaks fixed no oh what tell a lie you have fixed the leaks no i forgot things have changed what well a couple of the ceilings fell down ahha well its wet up here nobody hurt though hurt how could anybody be hurt theres only me here of course so theres plenty of room if i want to come and stay but i should bring a golf umbrella or a waterproof sleeping bag or a tent or something right no there are dry rooms here too come on okay i dont know when ill be coming up but well before the end of the year why not come up like next week or something ah i say thinking hell i could it all depends whats happening with the various stories im involved with but theoretically i could i need time off i need a change of scene okay why not just for a couple of days probably but yeah pencil me in great when you going to arrive um say thursday or friday ill confirm okay we talk a bit more reliving old times before i sign off i put the phone down and sit there with despot running but im not really paying attention im thinking about my old friend the icechild our wunderkind archetypal eighties player and then victim i was always jealous of him always somehow yearning for what he had even when i knew i didnt really want it and andy always seemed to be elsewhere and more involved two years before i went to stirling hed started at st andrews on an armysponsored course and by the time the falklands war began he was a lieutenant in the angus rifles he yomped from san carlos to tumbledown was wounded in a botched attack on an argentinian position and awarded a dso he sent the decoration back when the officer whod been in charge of the attack was kicked upstairs instead of being courtmartialled andy left the army the following year joined a big london advertising company did well there he dreamt up ibms insist on perfection we do campaign and guinnesss pint taken slogan and then suddenly left to start the gadget shop in covent garden neither andy nor his partner another exadagency man had any retail experience whatsoever but they had lots of ideas and a degree of luck plus they used their contacts in the media me for one to produce a huge free advertising campaign in the shape of articles about themselves and the business the shop and its mailorder catalogue were an immediate success in less than five years andy and his partner opened another twenty branches made a modest fortune and then sold out for an immodest one to a big retail chain a couple of months before the stockmarket crash of andy took six months off went on a world trip travelling first class toured america on a harley and cruised round the caribbean in a yacht he was on a transsaharan trip when his sister clare died after the funeral he mooched around the family estate at strathspeld for a few months then spent some time in london doing nothing much except seeing old friends and clubbing after that he seemed to lose it somehow he became quiet then reclusive and bought a big old decaying hotel in the western highlands and retired to live there alone practically broke apparently and still not really doing anything apart from drinking too much getting wrecked most nights going a bit hippy i mean like man fishing from his dinghy walking in the hills and just lying in bed sleeping while the hotel in a quiet dark village that was busy once before they built a new road and the ferry service stopped crumbles quietly around him cameron kirkton of bourtie whats that frank its a wee village near inverurie where never mind guess what give in kickoff of blurted ha ha ha stop i cant breathe ive taken the weekend off and spent it detoxing myself laying off the powder and drinking nothing more deleterious to the system than strong tea this regime has had the added advantage of helping to keep my tobacco cravings in check ive played despot a lot ramping my eralevel into something resembling the beginnings of an industrial revolution before my nobles revolted the barbarians from the south and west struck together and there was a major earthquake which resulted in a plague by the time ive finished dealing with that lot id dropped back to an eralevel comparable to rome after the schism with the eastern empire and there was even a danger that the southern barbarians werent so barbaric after all maybe they were more civilised than my lot this could be shaping up to a strategic defeat my empire licked its wounds and i took great delight in ordering the ceremonial execution of several generals meanwhile my coughs getting worse and i think im coming down with a cold and mr bloody archer never did call but on the other hand the creditcard company wrote to me being nice for a change and hiked my limit so ive got a bit more money to play with think that nice mr majors going to get away with the maastricht vote frank asks his big ruddy face appearing round the side of my screen like the moon from behind a hill easily i tell him his backbenchers are a bunch of spineless brownnoses and even if there was any danger those asshole libdemsll save the tories skins as usual care to make a small wager frank twinkles on the result on the size of uncle johns majority twenty says the margins into double figures frank thinks about this he nods youre on ive been back on naval stuff again today interviewing people at rosyth dockyard which may or may not be closed soon putting another six thousand on the local dole queue a lot depends on whether they get the contract to service the trident subs or not im a few hundred words into the story when the phone goes hello cameron colley cameron oh cameron oh thank goodness youre there i was sure id got the time difference wrong again convinced i really was cameron its ridiculous i mean it really is im just at my wits end i really am i just cant talk to him hes impossible i dont know why i married him i really dont hes mad i mean literally mad i wouldnt mind so much but i think hes driving me mad too i wish youd talk to him i wish youd say something i really do i mean im sure he wont listen to you either but but but well at least he might listen to you hello mum i say wearily and reach for my jacket pocket where the cigarette packet ought to be cameron what am i to do just tell me that just tell me what on earth anybodys supposed to do with such an impossible man i swear hes getting worse he really is i wish it was just my imagination but it isnt i swear it isnt hes getting worse he really is its not me its him i mean my friends agree hell be the whats the problem mum i lift a pencil from the desk and start gnawing the end my stupid husband havent you been listening yes but what he wants to buy a farm a farm at his age what is it a sheep farm i ask because shes phoning from new zealand and i understand they arent short of a sheep or two out there no its for angoras angora goats or rabbits or whatever it is they get the stuff from cameron hes just getting impossible i know hes not actually your father but you seem to get on all right and i think he listens to you look sweetheart could you come out and try and talk some sense into him because come out there mum for goodness sake its cameron hes driving me up the wall look mum just calm down and so begins another of my mothers marathon phone calls in which she complains at length depth and breadth about some potential new business venture of my stepfathers she is certain is about to ruin them both my stepfather bill is a rotundly fit quietly amusing wellingtonian who retired from the usedcar business he met my mother on a caribbean cruise three years ago and she moved out to new zealand a year later they live perfectly well off pensions and investments but bill does occasionally express a hankering for getting involved in a business again these schemes never come to anything and usually turn out not even to be serious commercial propositions in the first place as a rule bill just says something quite innocent like oh look you can pick up a fastfood franchise in auckland for fifty thousand and my mother instantly assumes he plans to do just that and then lose the lot she gibbers on while i browse the wires on the terminal idly scrolling reuters and pa to check on whats happening this is pretty much an instinctive journoreaction and fully compatible with the equally programmed dutifulson hmms and mmms im feeding my mum at intervals during her monologue i get her off the phone eventually reassuring her that bill is not about to sink all their savings into some decrepit hill farm and that as ever the answer is to talk to him about it i promise to come and visit next year probably it takes a few attempts to say goodbye mother is one of those people wholl wish you well say goodbye thank you for calling or for being there when she called say goodbye again and then suddenly tear into some whole new conversational seam but i get the final goodbye in at last and connect handset with desk unit without actually cutting her off i sit back take it that was the mater was it frank calls jovially from the far side of my screen before i can reply the phone rings again i jump grabbing the device and dreading it being her again remembering something she forgot to say yes i squeak hello civilisation calling says a slightly plummy english voice what cameron its neil you wanted to talk oh neil hi neil is an excolleague who went to london to work in fleet street when fleet street wasnt full of japanese banks his father served in the intelligence corps during the korean war where he met sir andrew our ed and recovering coronary patient neil is the coolest fogy i know smokes opium and believes utterly in the royal family despises socialism and thatcher almost equally and votes liberal because the family always has since liberals were called whigs shoots stags and hooks salmon hurtles down the cresta run each year drives a bentley s they could have invented the word urbane just for him these days he freelances in intelligence matters occasionally for the broadsheets though mostly for corporate clients how are you i say frowning towards my screen just then however frank stands up and saunters off biro between his teeth well and busy neil drawls what can i do for you you can tell me what you found out about those five guys who popped their clogs in such suspicious circumstances between and you know the guys who all have connections with sellascale or winfield or dunnukin or whatever theyre calling it these days there is a pause oh neil says and i can hear him lighting a cigarette my mouth waters you lucky bastard that old thing yeah i say putting my feet up on the desk that old thing that reads like a spy novel and nobody ever came up with a decent explanation for no case to answer boy wonder he sighs an unfortunate sequence of coincidences sounds like a long involved explanation no neil laughs recalling our acronymic private code from the year we worked together no its the totally reliable utterly trustworthy damn what was the last word hint i tell him grinning we never did come up with a better alternative indeed well thats what it is a fucking actualite cameron tovarisch you serious i say trying not to laugh all these guys who just happened to be connected with bnfl or gchq or military intelligence and just happened to croak violently within twenty months of each other i mean really cameron i do realise your menshevik soul cries out for there to be a perfectly irrational fascist conspiracy behind all this but the boring truth is that there isnt or if there is its far far too well run for it to be the work of any intelligence service ive ever encountered theres never been any reliable hint it was anybody on our side mossad arguably the only people capable of carrying out such a consistently successful campaign without leaving the scene scattered with their agencyissue trenchcoats sporting name rank and serial number sewn into the collars had no discernible motive and we can be even more sure of our friends in moscow given that since the unfortunate demise of the workers state exkgb bods have been positively falling over each other in the rush to beat the breast and confess their past sins and not one of them has even mentioned those five deceased sons of cumbria and environs six if you count the doc who did the pms on the three cumbrian stiffs neil sighs even so im thinking this could be a fairly important decision im making here do i tell neil about mr archer and daniel smout or do i keep quiet about it christ this story could just be the biggest fucking thing since watergate a plot if im reading the hints right involving the west or just her majestys government or at the very least a bunch of people who were in positions to pull it off to arm our oncestaunchallyagainstthefiendishmullahs now numberone hate figure saddam hussein with nukes back when the iraniraq war wasnt all going his way you know neil sighs again i have the most terrible feeling im going to regret asking this question but what leads you to make this enquiry unless its the simple explanation that news of these five sad deaths has only just arrived in caledonia well i say playing with the telephone cord what neil says in that whyareyouwastingmyvaluabletime voice ive had a call from somebody who claims to know about this whos saying that theres another couple of names involved and who would they be ive only got one of the names so far i take a deep breath ill do a mr archer ill give him it a bit at a time smout i tell neil daniel smout our man in baghdad neil is silent for a few seconds then i hear him exhale smout a pause i see another pause so he says slowly and thoughtfully if iraq was involved its not impossible mossad would take an interest though of course one of our serial selfterminators was himself of the semitic persuasion so was vanunu indeed hmm interesting you do realise though that your informant is probably a crank probably have they been reliable before no new source as far as i can tell and all theyve come up with is a sequence of names so it could easily be a crank very easily in fact probably i mean wouldnt you say dont you think it probably is im gibbering i suddenly feel rather stupid and a little nervous you said there was a sixth name neil says calmly any hints there well ive got what my guy says is a codename for him and that is neil says patiently well ah cameron i swear i shant try to scoop you if thats what youre worried about of course not i say i know that its just that it could be nothing very possibly but look neil id like to talk to somebody how do you mean somebody in the business you know somebody in the business neil says evenly christ i wish i had a cigarette yeah i say somebody in the business somebody in the service somebody wholl look me in the eye and tell me mi or whoever had got nothing to do with all this somebody i can give this to hmm i let him think for a bit eventually neil says well there are always people one can talk to certainly look ill suggest this to some contacts i have see what their reaction is but i know that if i do suggest it before they decide what to do theyll want to know who it is theyre dealing with theyll want to know your name i thought they might thats okay you can tell them right you are then ill report back what the reaction is fair enough fair enough good to tell the truth ill be fairly interested in seeing it myself assuming this isnt a crank were dealing with okay i say looking over my screen and trying to peer over my bookcase wondering who i can scrounge a fag off well thats good of you neil i appreciate this not at all now when are you next coming up to town or do you picts have to apply for a travel warrant or something you arrive at mr olivers home in leyton at nine as agreed when you saw him in his shop in soho during the afternoon he will have had time to get back from the shop have his evening meal watch one of his favourite soap operas and take a shower the maisonette is part of a brickbuilt terrace over a row of shops restaurants and offices you press the entryphone button hello mr oliver its mr mellin here mr mellin from this afternoon yeah right the door buzzes inside behind the sturdy heavily secured door the stairwell is richly carpeted and the walls are decorated with expensive regencystyle wallpaper ornately framed victorian landscape paintings look down from the stairwell walls mr oliver appears at the top of the stairs he is a plump little man with sallow skin and very black hair you suspect is dyed he wears a cashmere cardigan over his waistcoat and trousers his shirt is raw silk cravat slippers he smells strongly of polo good evening you say yeah hello the second word actually sounds more like allow but you know what he means he stands back as you reach the top of the stairs and puts out one pudgy hand while looking you up and down you wish the light from a miniature chandelier in the hall was a little less bright the moustache prickles under your nose you shake hands mr olivers grip is damp quite strong his gaze drops to the fat briefcase youre holding he waves one hand come in the lounge is a little ostentatious mr oliver favours thick white rugs black leather furniture chromeandglass tables and a tv video and hifi unit which takes up most of one wall sit down like a drink mr oliver says it actually sounds like sidahn loya dring but again you understand you sit on the edge of a leather seat hunched up and looking nervous the briefcase on your knees youre wearing a cheap suit and you still have your gloves on um well ah yes please you say trying to sound nervous and unsure of yourself of course you are nervous but not in the way youre implying mr oliver goes to a chromeandsmokedglass drinks cabinet what would you like um do you have any orange juice mr oliver looks at you orange juice he says and bends to look in a small fridge set into the drinks cabinet he fixes himself a vodka and coke and sits down on the couch to your left you think hes looking at you slightly strangely and you worry that perhaps your disguise isnt fooling him you cough nervously so mr mellin he says what is it youve got for me well you say looking round you watched the place all through the afternoon and youre fairly sure theres nobody else in here but youre not absolutely certain as i said um in the shop its something a bit a bit special something i understand there is a demand for what sort of special we talking here wwwwell well its of a shall we say um a violent nature quite a violent nature in fact and involves ah and involves ah chchchchildren i was told that you you can you can that you deal in that sort of um item mr oliver purses his lips well youd have to be a bit of an idiot to just tell people that wouldnt you i mean you wouldnt want to confess to something like that to a stranger know what i mean oh you say sounding crestfallen you mean you dont na im not saying nothing am i im just saying you got to be careful know what i mean ah you say nodding yes yes of course of course one does have to be careful i see i see what you mean why dont you show me what youve brought eh well take a little look and then well see eh yes yes right of course ah right what ive brought um well its just part of it to show you but i think it amply demonstrates video yeah yes thats correct on video you unclip the catches on the briefcase take out a plain vhs cassette and put the briefcase on the floor to one side as you stand up handing the video to him ta he takes it and goes to the video machine you remain standing the cassette wont load properly you can hear the vcr mechanism whining mr oliver bends to look more closely at the machine you come up behind him um is there a problem you ask yeah doesnt seem to be the cassette will not load because you glued the hinged tapecover down mr oliver does not get to complete his sentence you cosh him across the back of the head however he had started to move his head as you swung at him and you only land a glancing blow he falls to one side one hand trying to find purchase on the wall of hifi components shifting the cd player and amp back on their shelves what he says you smack the cosh hard into his face breaking his nose then stamp on his crotch as he falls back he doubles up on the floor lying on his side snorting and gasping youre staring wildly round the room waiting for some burly minder to come charging in swinging a baseball bat your other hand in the pocket of your suit where the browning is but nobody appears you lean forward and cosh mr oliver across the back of the head he goes limp you handcuff his arms behind his back and go to the briefcase to get the things you will need once you have everything ready and the camcorder is set up you have to wait for him to wake up you go down to the street door and lock and chain it then pad round the maisonette making quite sure there is nobody else in mr olivers bedroom is all wood brass furs and red velvet a glass cabinet houses a militaria collection specialising in the waffen ss a bookcase holds numerous books about nazi germany and hitler mr olivers private videos are stored in a repro teakandwalnut wardrobe there is a large combination floorsafe under the persian carpet you bring what looks like a representative selection of the videos down to the lounge where mr oliver is sitting still unconscious and sagging slightly handcuffed and tied in a chromeandleather chair you brought down from the second bedroom you have gagged him with a sock and a silk scarf you brought from his bedroom his right arm is firmly tied to the leatherpadded arm of the chair you have removed his cardigan and rolled his shirt sleeve up while you wait for mr oliver to regain consciousness you look at the videos you brought down from the bedroom some feature the gangbuggerings of children mostly male and mostly asian or south american others show women being mounted by donkeys and other animals in what looks like a prison the men watching all have moustaches and wear military dress these look like second or thirdgeneration recordings and the definition is not quite precise enough for you to be sure but you think those might be iraqi army uniforms there are a couple of videos which may come from the same source and show people men women children being tortured with irons hairdriers curling tongs and so on there is no actual snuff material here but you wonder what the floorsafe you discovered contains mr oliver starts to moan behind his gag and you put on your gorilla mask you wait for his eyes to open then start the little sony camcorder running you take the gas cylinder from the briefcase turn the valve on and suck mr oliver you say in a high absurdly babyish voice welcome back he stares wideeyed at you then at the video camera sitting on its miniature tripod on the coffee table you take another suck on the helium youre going to star in your own video isnt that funny he shakes in the seat roaring behind the gag you go to the briefcase and bring out a widemouthed medicine bottle clingfilm over the top of it is secured with elastic bands you shake the bottle then lift the syringe from the briefcase mr oliver screams when he sees these you suck on the helium again then hold the dumpy medicine bottle up and show him the thicklooking offwhite liquid inside can you guess what this is you ask him in the voice of a manic baby the syringe is a big mother not like those dinky little disposable plastic things medics and junkies use this device is made from stainless steel and glass it has two hookshaped fingergrips on either side of the barrel and it holds a fifth of a litre you hold the medicine bottle sealed with clingfilm upside down and slip the slanted tip of the big syringe needle into the clottedcreamcoloured liquid inside the bottle mr oliver is still screaming behind the gag you suck on the gas again and tell him what youre going to do to him his muffled screams rise in pitch until they sound like hes been breathing helium too the next day i scrounge a lambert butler off rose in the foreign news section smoke it at my desk and get a real hit off it then feel disgusted with myself and vow thats the last one im going to smoke i really mean it this time and decide to reward myself by using my increased creditcard limit to buy myself something the car needs a service i could use a new suit and the carpet in the flat is getting threadbare but as candidates for expenditure none of those has very high selfreward status minimal feelgood factors there my mouth goes a little dry as i sit staring at the whisky story which im reworking very slowly and think of what i could buy with the extra dosh doshtosh hmm i pull open a drawer and dig out a computer magazine five hundred glossy fullcolour pages plus a free software disk for less than two quid its the november issue but the prices might be out of date by now usually with computers they go down but this time they might have gone up because now were out of the erm and the pounds sinking against the dollar the price of components bought abroad is sure to increase i leaf through looking at the laptop adverts shit i can afford one of these i can afford a colour one at last one thatll play despot especially as i can write it off against tax ill use it for work after all and even more especially as im giving up smoking thats twenty quid a week at least ill save even if i dont stop doing speed the price of laptops has fallen quickly recently and colour screens are no longer luxuries in the portable market yo before the more sensible bits of my brain can start coming up with convincing arguments for doing anything else with the money i call up a manufacturer in cumbernauld ive heard good things about and talk to one of the salespeople i discuss what i want with him and we agree i might as well go for a this means spending a little more money than id been thinking of but itll be worth it in the end a decentsized hard disk is a necessity too and a spare battery naturally plus ill need cabling to transfer data between the pc at home and the laptop and of course for a little extra i can have a removable hard disk which not only makes my data more secure but allows for easy upgrading of the disk unit if it ever proves too small this is a quality machine after all and i wont need to change it for years its worth the little extra to futureproof it they dont do partexchange but the salesman cant imagine me having any problems selling a toshiba even an old one they do have a good name after all we settle on the exact specification they have one in stock i can pick it up today tomorrow whenever or they can deliver within fortyeight hours for a tenner i decide ill go and get it i give them my creditcard number for the deposit and agree to show up at the factory within the next couple of hours ill have to buy the blighter on credit the manufacturers have a deal with a financing company that sounds reasonable im close to the limit of my bank overdraft even though its nearly time for my salary to lift my bank account briefly into the black before it settles comfortably and familiarly back into the red for the rest of the month there are bills to pay but they can wait im so excited i finish the whisky story in half an hour right frank i tell him pulling on my jacket im off to cumbernauld ah you mean cumbered what spellcheck cumbered ha ha oh yeah ha ha will we be seeing you later doubtful i circle the room breathing quick and deep she swivels following me facing me her body glistening im breathing hard too chest heaving hands out in front of me feet squeaking on the tiles im conscious of my cock swinging between my legs she gives a halfgrunt half laugh and jumps towards the bath i catch her ankle as her leap turns into a feint and she darts the other way hauling the door open her oiled skin slides through my fingers as i stagger and almost fall into the jacuzzi banging a knee on its tiled platform while she disappears through the doorway slamming the door behind her i quickly rub my knee where i banged it then pull the door open and race through the dressing room to the dimly lit bedroom no sign i stand there rubbing my knee breathing through my mouth to make less noise so that ill hear her the bed is kingsize still rumpled its mahogany foot and headboards shining lustrously in the glow from the concealed lighting behind the bedside cabinets and shelving system i pad over to the bedside glance back to the dressingroom door then squat slowly feeling my prick slide caught between my calves with a delicious anticipatory thrill i pull up the covers fallen over the side of the bed and glance quickly underneath theres a hint of sudden noise behind me and i start to turn and rise thinking she was in the dressingroom wardrobe but its too late she crashes into my back and side knocking the wind out of me and bowling me over onto the bed landing me on my face on the creased black satin sheets and trapping my dick painfully back between my thighs before i can do much shes straddling me slim hard legs slipping oiled over my flanks while her taut little bum crunches down into the middle of my back winding me further she grabs my right arm twists it until i shout breathlessly in pain and hauls it up my back towards my neck pinning it there about a centimetre below where it would hurt unbearably and only a few more further down from where the humerus would break serves me right for playing this sort of game with a woman who ran a selfdefence course for female students still regularly thrashes me at squash with technique or power depending on what sort of mood shes in and does serious weights i slap the slick black sheets with my other hand all right you win she grunts then pushes my arm that extra centimetre until i yelp in pain i said all right i shout ill do anything she lets go rolls off me and lies there beside me panting laughing through each breath her breasts rising and falling and jiggling all at once and her flat belly gently shaking i lever myself up and throw myself on top of her but shes rolling away and i thump onto the sheets as she pulls one leg from beneath me and stands arms on her hips at the side of the bed looking down at me her feet are planted a metre apart and i stare at her black v of pubic hair moaning softly patience she says taking a deeper breath and sliding a hand through her short slicked hair she turns and moves off across the creamy pile of the carpet balanced on the balls of her feet like a dancer she reaches stretching up to a hinged cupboard above a builtin wardrobe and i moan dramatically again watching the muscles in her calves and buttocks clench and the dimples in the small of her back hollow and lengthen and the shadow of her breasts move across the polished ash of the wardrobe doors to one side while her reflection extends naked and achingly beautiful in the mirrors on the other side shes on her toes feeling inside the cupboard the fleshy mound of her sex shows dark between her legs a glimpsed precious succulent fruit i collapse back on the bed unable to bear it ten minutes later im kneeling on the bed stretched backwards with my legs apart and my wrists tied to my ankles with silk scarves and my cock so hard its sore sticking way out in front of me totally rampant but bizarrely vulnerable too and im breathing hard and my muscles are aching and i feel so close to coming if theres a draught across my cock thatll probably be enough and she pulls the last unnecessary scarf tight and then slides round past me in front of me so leanly voluptuous fit and hard and moist and soft together im past moaning any more and just have to laugh casting my gaze to the ceiling and feeling the engorged weight of my cock waggle as i laugh and then she slips off the bed grabs the remote control and announces shes going to watch eldorado and im bellowing and shes laughing as the trinitron clicks on and she turns the sound up to drown me out and im left here in what is starting to become some pain while she sits lotuslike giggling now and again and pretending to be involved in this crap soap opera and i have to try and work my way back up the bed waddling painfully on my knees and ankles until i finally make the metre or so back to the pillows and the headboard so at least i can support my aching shoulders and take some weight off well just about every other muscle in my body it feels like trapped there watching this shit and after five minutes even my cock is giving up just starting to droop but then she turns and gives it a quick nicking lick with her tongue and i beg her to suck me off but she just turns away and watches the tv on the other side of the room again and i struggle and strain but shes tied me too tight and my knees are really sore now and i try to reason with her and say look this really is starting to hurt but she ignores me apart from checking on the state of my erection every few minutes and giving me quick incredibly hot and frustrating halflicks halfsucks every now and again or a single salivamoistened fingerandthumb flick and im roaring in frustration and desire and pain in about equal and immense amounts and finally finally thank fuck the anglospanish crap ends and the tune tinkles and the credits roll and she clicks the box to mtv and its still not over the teasing tantalising bitch gets off the bed and goes out the door and im so stunned i cant speak im left there with my mouth hanging open and my cock sticking out and im so fucking angry im looking from side to side at the bedside units to see what i can roll over and smash to produce an edge i can cut the scarves on and im just deciding on the crystal glass on her side that still holds some dark dregs of rioja when she comes back again carrying a glittering glass in one hand and a steaming mug in the other and smirking and i know what shes going to do and i say no please just let me go my legs my arms my knees i may never walk again please please please but it doesnt do any good she kneels in front of me and puts the glass to her lips and slips an ice cube into her mouth looking at me and grinning and then lowering her mouth onto my cock then its the hot coffee from the mug but only briefly its not enough then the ice again then the coffee then the ice and im crying now actually crying with pain and lust and the unbearable frustration of it crying and begging pleading with her to stop until finally she spits the last ice cube out and puts the glass and the mug down beside the wine glass and comes forward and straddles me slipping me quickly easily deep inside her and she feels hotter than the coffee hot enough to scald hot enough to burn and i give a small shocked ah as she moves up and down on me and puts her fingers to my neck and the other hand down behind her to my balls and suddenly im coming still crying and sobbing now as the spasms shake me and she goes suddenly very still whispering baby baby to me as i jerk and pump and the motions make the pain in my legs and arms and joints worse and better at the same time the scarves have gone too tight to undo she has to cut them with the gleaming weight of the hunting knife she keeps under her side of the mattress in case any rapist ever breaks in i lie cradled in her arms panting spent exhausted the agony in my muscles and bones and sockets gradually easing and the tears on my face drying and she says softly how was that and i whisper fucking brilliant next morning i arrive at the paper bright and early toting my new machine all happy after my sprint through to cumbernauld via the building society and back and then my evening with y she was disappointingly unimpressed with the supersexy new machine but i guess not everybodys into computers and fuck it given the choice of it or her on my lap id take her after which i returned to cheyne street y likes me to leave before it gets too late worried that her neighbours in the exec development will talk i was so tired that even though i was just dying to get the new laptop going and make sure despot runs all right portable at last the screaming orgasmic joy of it i fell asleep on the couch instead and somehow transferred myself to the bed at some point and so had a good nights sleep for a change i get up with the dawn or not long after anyway make it into the office slightly early for once and franks there in reception when i come in and im about to show off the new machine when he looks worriedly at me draws me to one side away from the receptionists desk and the smallads and backissues counter until were standing in a corner and says cameron eddie wants to see you hes got a couple of policemen in with him whats this i ask grinning fettesgate again fettesgate is a minor scandal involving the lothian police force a gay guy who felt he was being victimised broke into the cop hq out at fettes with embarrassing ease and found and copied lots of sensitive papers no frank says nothing to do with that apparently theyre asking for you me yes you quite specifically know their names no hmm i know quite a few cops some fairly high up just like i know lawyers advocates doctors politicians civil servants and people in a variety of agencies no big deal cant imagine why i shrug whats it about any idea frank looks uncomfortable he glances at the commissionaire behind his desk nearby and turns away from him he leans his head close to mine and says quietly well morag overheard something of what they were saying on the intercom i put my hand over my mouth and do a stagesnigger i thought eddies secretary eavesdropped on him i didnt know until now she confided in frank cameron frank says dropping his voice still further apparently theyre investigating some murders chapter naked flame the mercedes estate comes grumbling down the drive splashing in dark puddles under the dripping trees car draws up by the blank gable end of the dark cottage as the headlights are switched off you turn the night sight on he gets out of the car carrying a large leather flight and walks to the front of the cottage he is balding and of medium build though with a paunch and rather a fat face you watch unlock the front door to the cottage he enters turning on the light and closing the door you hear the alarm delay beep briefly before he turns it off the rain patters down in front of you heavier drops from the overhanging trees plop all around a light comes on at the back of the cottage in the kitchen you give him a couple of minutes while you put the night sight away and take out a pair of thick wirerimmed glasses then you go to the front porch put the glasses on and bang urgently on the solid wooden door you take the bottle and the sanitary towel from your pocket the towels loops over your fingers soak the towel with the liquid in the bottle then put the bottle away again holding the reeking towel closed in your fist you hammer on the door again sir rufus you call when you hear noise behind the door sir rufus ivor owen here from down the road you are modestly pleased with your gruff welsh accent quick sir rufus its your car you hear an english voice saying what and then a bolt slides you let the door open mr carter is holding a shotgun but it is pointing downwards you cant tell whether he has his finger inside the trigger guard or not but you have no choice you dart forward punching him hard in the stomach he goes oof and starts to fold at the waist and knees the gun drops from his hand as you jump to one side and clamp the sanitary towel over his mouth then get behind him and lock your other arm round his neck he manages to fling you back against one wall and your glasses come off but you hold onto him he is still winded struggling for breath and the ether works quickly he sags and collapses you go with him to the floor keeping the towel tight over his face he moves once more weakly then goes still the keys to the cottage are in his trouser pockets you put him in the recovery position and go to the door you put out the hall light take the night sight from your daypack and look around it looks peaceful enough you close the door and lock it but leave the alarm system off you take off your moustache and wig pick up the cracked glasses from the floor and stuff them all in the daypack from it you take your black ski balaclava and slip it on you have a look in the kitchen but its a slate floor you drag him into the living room put more ether on the towel and leave it over his face then you roll back the carpet you take the nail gun out of the daypack and use it to nail him to the floor through his clothes pinning each leg of his trousers and arm of his jacket and shirt to the thick boards in five or six places its a noisy business you take the sanitary towel off his face and pry his mouth open with the nail gun to make sure he hasnt swallowed his tongue you turn his face to the side sir rufus caius st leger carter to give him his full wonderfully english title dribbles saliva onto the dusty boards you take off one of his shoes and a sock then shove the balled sock into his mouth and seal his lips with maskingtape you hesitate then you put the barrel of the nail gun onto the right cuff of his jacket over the point where his upper wrist joins the bones of the arm the place to put nails where they cant be torn out youre not sure whether to do this or not the nails through his clothes will hold him trapped like an armanisuited gulliver you dont need the nails through his arms and it seems more elegant to use the nail gun and yet not do the obvious thing you shake your head and put the nail gun aside he moans then his eyes open slowly and he sees you and tries to move but cant he screams down his nose you are becoming familiar with men making this noise now you leave him shaking and screaming and go through to the store room off the kitchen where there are a couple of calorgas cylinders near the back door one bottle is empty waiting to be picked up after running the cottages stove and centralheating system the other cylinder feels full you roll its chilly bulk through to where sir rufus is still making a racket on the livingroom floor hes sweating despite the chill a corner of the tape over his mouth has come off hes trying to shout something but you cant tell what it is you pull an easy chair over to where he can see it near the cold dark stone hearth you roll the calorgas bottle over to the chair then haul the cylinder up and onto the chair until it rolls down the arms resting against the back of the seat the chair threatens to tip over backwards and you push it against the stones and slates of the fireplace so it cant move sir rufus is still trying to work the gag off you look in your daypack and pull out the valve with the length of rubber pipe and the brass nozzle attached you secure it to the top of the calorgas bottle there is a hacking spitting noise from behind you look for christs sake what is this stop im rich i can you go over to him plant one foot on his head and soak the sanitary towel again ah look i can get money christ no you clamp the towel over his face again he struggles for a while before he goes limp you put another bigger strip of tape across his mouth it takes a while to get the nozzle set just so on the seat of the easy chair then as you are testing the gasflow you hear a whistling retching noise and turn in time to see twin streams of vomit spurting from sir rufuss nostrils and spattering over the floorboards shit you say and go quickly over to him tearing the tape off his mouth he gasps and splutters almost choking more of the vomit comes up rolling out of his mouth and onto the floor you smell garlic he coughs some more then breathes more easily when you are sure he isnt going to drown on his vomit and hes starting to make semicomprehensible noises again you hold the wispy hair at the back of his head and wind a length of tape right round his head a couple of times sealing his mouth again you put your stuff away in the daypack as he lies there moving weakly then more powerfully the noises coming down his nose faint then strong moans followed by what would be shouts if he could open his mouth you squat down by the side of the easy chair where the rubber hose from the calorgas bottle loops down and round and up before it ends in the brass nozzle sitting on the cushion of the easy chair looking black and incongruous is the iron grate from the livingroom fire you have tied the brass nozzle to the grate with wire pointing it up at the scuffed red wall of the gas cylinder about fifteen centimetres above sir rufuss head is about a metre and a half from the easy chair he has a good view of it well sir rufus you say tugging a pretend forelock and still imitating the singsong of a welsh accent you tap the wall of the cylinder i suppose you know what a blevey is dont you his eyes look like theyre coming out of their sockets his voice coming down his nose sounds strangled of course you do you say smiling behind the mask and nodding that ship that lpg carrier of yours well your companys did just that in the bombay docks didnt it you nod again a sort of floating bobbing nod you somehow associate with the welsh thousand dead wasnt it mind you theyre only indians eh still fighting it in the courts are you shame these things always take so long really isnt it of course altering the corporate structure like that making the ship the only asset of the company that makes life a bit easier for you doesnt it not nearly so much compensation to fork out i suppose he coughs down his nose then sneezes and seems to be trying to shout something terrifying things bleveys they say you tell him shaking your head ever wondered what one looks like close up have you you nod again i know i have well you turn and pat the cold fat shoulder of the gas cylinder heres one i prepared earlier you turn the knurled wheel on the valve the gas hisses gently you take a cigarette lighter from your pocket and hold it to the mouth of the little brass nozzle tied to the grate you flick the lighter and the gas ignites a small flickering yellow and blue flame blowing up towards the gas cylinder oh you say that looks a bit tentative wouldnt you say sir rufus you could be here all night you turn the valve wheel slowly until the jet is roaring and the fierce yellowblue flame licks around the curved cylinder wall thats better sir rufus is screaming quite hard now and his face is very red you hope he doesnt have a heart attack before the blevey that would be well just what youd expect from a man like sir rufus getting out of something through a loophole sadly you cant hang around to make sure you take a quick look from the front door with the night sight your hands shaking as you listen to the distant roaring sound coming from the living room even though you know it will take a while yet and the faint almost childish screams its still raining you close the door and lock it and walk quickly off into the night five minutes later as youre about to start the bike and beginning to worry that it hasnt worked that hes got free somehow or the gas jet has blown itself out or his mistress got here earlier than expected and had a key or something else has gone wrong the explosion bursts suddenly fabulously into the night lighting up the whole rainswept valley and the clouds above and producing a small mushroom cloud of incandescent gas climbing and rolling into the darkness you start the engine with the noise still rumbling down between the welsh hills right mr colley id better tell you whats happening here suits me i say with only slightly more bravado than i feel detective inspector mcdunn and detective sergeant flavell are sitting across the boardroom table from me the caleys boardroom is directly above the editors office set into the slope of the buildings castellated roof its an impressively raftered room containing a massive venerablelooking table and seats that look like smaller versions of the one in the eds office the walls are oak panels they support dully formal paintings of former editors stern faces glaring down to remind you this is one of the oldest newspapers in the world being a floor higher than the eds office the view is even better but despite the fact i havent visited here before im not spending too much time looking out the window the di is a dark heavyset man with an accent that sounds half glaswegian and half english he wears a dark suit and hes carrying a black coat young sergeant flavell whos in charge of a cheaplooking briefcase looks a little like richard gere with a thin moustache but spoils the effect by wearing a blue quilted anorak over his suit still at least hes warm i left my jacket hanging over the back of my seat in the news room and its cold up here eddie suggested we used the boardroom after i went to his office was introduced to the two cops and told they wanted a word with me the di looks round the room i suppose its all right to smoke in here he asks me i suppose so sergeant flavell spots an ashtray on a windowledge and goes to get it the inspector lights a bh smoke he asks me seeing me watching him i shake my head no thanks right mr colley inspector mcdunn says in a gettingdowntobusiness sort of way were carrying out an investigation into a number of serious assaults and murders plus related crimes we think you might be able to help and wed like to ask you a few questions if you dont mind not at all i say breathing deeply as the cloud of smoke from mcdunns cigarette rolls over the table towards me smells good sergeant could you mcdunn says the sergeant takes an a manila envelope from his briefcase and hands it to the inspector who takes out a single sheet of paper he hands it over to me i assume you recognise this its a photocopy of a piece of tv criticism i did for the paper about fifteen months ago not exactly my speciality but the regular guy had come down with an eye infection and i welcomed the opportunity to editorialise a bit yeah i wrote this i say grinning hell my names at the top of the piece beside the headline radical equaliser inspector mcdunn smiles thinly i read the piece while the boys in blue well black and blue look on as i read and remember i feel the hairs on the back of my neck prickle this hasnt happened for twenty years or so i hand it back so i ask the inspector looks at the a sheet for a moment perhaps he quotes from it somebody should make one of these programmes for those of us whore fed up seeing the usual suspects get theirs corrupt landlords substanceabusing youths and of course the inevitable drug dealers reprehensible villains all no doubt but too predictable too safe and introduce a real avenger a radical equaliser wholl take on some alternative hatefigures somebody wholl give people like james anderton judge jamieson and sir toby bissett a taste of their own medicine somebody wholl attack the asset strippers and the arms smugglers ministers of hmg included listening mr persimmon somebody wholl stand up against the tycoons who put their profits before others safety like sir rufus carter somebody wholl punish the captains of industry who parrot that timehonoured phrase about their shareholders interests coming first as they close down profitable factories and throw thousands out of work just so that their already comfortable investors in the home counties and marbella can make that little bit extra that always comes in so handy darling when youre thinking about trading up to a series beamer or moving the ginpalace to a more expensive mooring the detective inspector smiles briefly humourlessly at me you did write that mr colley guilty i say then give a small laugh neither man laughs uproariously slaps his thigh or has to wipe tears from his eyes i clear my throat how is that nice mr anderton anyway enjoying his retirement i sit back in my seat feeling the carved wood against my back im cold well mr colley the detective inspector says slipping the photocopy of the article into the envelope and handing it back to the sergeant hes all right i believe mcdunn clasps his hands on the table but judge jamieson and his wife were assaulted while on holiday in carnoustie during the summer sir toby bissett was murdered outside his home in london in august as im sure youre aware and mr persimmon was murdered last month at his house in sussex im aware my eyes are bulging what but i didnt know theres been nothing about persimmon he was supposed to have died peacefully at home there was a security aspect to mr persimmons murder as im sure youll appreciate mr colley but you kept it quiet for a month needed a dnotice on one of the london papers the sergeant says smirking but they were cooperative and it never got round the journo junglenetwork shit must have been the telegraph and then on friday night there somebody blew up sir rufus carter at his cottage in wales burned to a cinder he was they only just identified the body i dont react for a moment oh my god ah sorry what he tells me again then asks mind if we ask what you were doing on friday night mr colley what ah i stayed in sergeant flavell looks significantly at the inspector who doesnt return the look hes watching me he makes a strange sucking noise with his teeth like hes straining something through them i dont think hes aware hes doing it all night he asks ah im a bit distracted yes all night i was working i can see he spotted the hesitation and playing computer games i look from the detective inspector to the detective sergeant theres no law against playing computer games is there christ this is awful i feel like im a child again like im up before the headmaster like im back being castigated by sir andrew for that botched gulf trip that was bad enough but this is ghastly i cant believe theyre actually asking me this sort of stuff they cant really think im a murderer can they im a journalist cynical and hardbitten and all that shit and i do drugs and i drive too fast and i hate the tories and all their accomplices but im not a fucking murderer for christs sake the sergeant takes out a notebook and starts making notes you didnt see anybody else that evening mcdunn asks look i was here in edinburgh i wasnt in wales how on earth am i supposed to get from here to wales were not accusing you of anything mr colley the di says sounding mildly aggrieved did you see anybody else that evening no i stayed in you live alone mr colley yes i did some work then i played a game called despot nobody called round nobody saw you no they didnt i try to remember what happened that evening i had a phone call about what time would that be midnight and who was that from i hesitate look i say am i being charged with anything because i mean if i am this is just ludicrous but i want a lawyer youre not being charged with anything mr colley the inspector says sounding reasonable and slightly offended these are enquiries thats all youre not under arrest you dont have to tell us anything and certainly you may have a lawyer present sure and if i dont cooperate they might arrest me or at least get a search warrant for the flat gulp theres a couple of quarters of dope some speed and at least one ancient tab of acid in there well its just im a journalist you know i have to protect my sources if oh was this midnight phone call on a professional matter then mr colley the inspector asks ah shit decision time now what what do i do fuck it andy wont mind hell back me up no i tell the inspector no it was a friend a friend his names andy gould i have to spell his surname for the sergeant then give them the phone number for andys decrepit hotel and he called you the inspector says yes well no i called him left a message on his answermachine and then he called me back a few minutes later i see the inspector says and this was on your home phone correct yes the one that comes with your flat yes not on my mobile if thats what youre driving at mmhmm the inspector says he folds the last three centimetres of his cigarette carefully into the ashtray and takes out a little notebook and flips it open to where the page is held by an elastic band he looks from the notebook to me and what about october the twentyfifth and september the fourth and august the sixth and july the fifteenth i almost laugh are you serious i mean are you asking me do i have alibis wed just like to know what you were doing on those dates well i was here i mean i havent left scotland i havent been anywhere near london or i havent been down south for nearly a year the inspector smiles thinly okay look i say id have to check in my diary could you fetch your diary mr colley well i say my diary its in my laptop my computer ah so you do have one of those is that in the building yeah its downstairs i just got a new one but all the files are transferred ill i start to stand but the inspector holds up one hand let sergeant flavell do that eh all right i sit down again and nod its on my desk i tell the sergeant as he goes to the door the inspector sits back in his seat and takes out his bh packet he sees me watching him again and waves the packet at me sure you wont he asks um yeah i will thanks i say reaching out to take the cigarette and hating myself as i do it but thinking christ these are exceptional circumstances here i need all the help i can get every prop counts the inspector lights my cigarette and then stands up and walks to the windows facing out towards princes street i turn in my seat to watch him its a blustery day cloudshadows and patches of golden sunshine slide quickly over the face of the city turning the buildings to dark then shining grey lovely view from here isnt it the inspector says yeah great i say im getting a fairly decent hit from the cigarette i should give up more often dare say they dont use this room much no no i dont think they do shame really yes funny thing you know the inspector says peering out over the city to the distant fields of fife greygreen under heavier clouds on the far side of the river the night sir toby was killed and the morning after mr persimmon was found somebody rang up the times and claimed they were ira attacks the inspector turns to look at me face wreathed in smoke yes well i say i heard the ira claimed they killed sir toby but then retracted yes the inspector says looking seemingly puzzled at his cigarette whoever it was used the same ira codeword both times oh yes thats whats funny you see mr colley you and me we both know there are codewords the ira use when they phone in a bomb warning or take responsibility for a murder or some other crime you have to have these codes or otherwise any tom dick or paddy could call in and claim they were the ira close down london they could first time but our murderer he knew one of the codewords a recent one uhhuh im feeling cold again i can see where this is leading brazen it out so what i say pulling on my fag eyes narrowing you suspect an expoliceman yeah i am favoured with the inspectors thin smile again he makes that funny sucking noise with his saliva and moves towards me and i have to lean to one side to make way for him he reaches past me flicking some ash into the ashtray then steps back to the window thats right mr colley we did think of a policeman serving or not the di looks like he is thinking or a telephone operator i suppose he says as though surprising himself or a journalist i suggest raising my eyebrows or a journalist the inspector agrees blandly leaning back against the windowframe silhouetted by the bright gleam of rushing cloud outside you wouldnt happen to know those codes would you mr colley not off the top of my head no i say theyre kept on the papers computer system these days protected by a password but i do write on defence and security matters amongst other things and i do know the password so i have got access to the codes i cant prove i dont know what they are if thats what youre getting at not really getting at anything mr colley its just interesting look detective inspector i say sighing and putting out my cigarette im a single man i live alone i do a lot of work from home and from all over scotland i phone it into the paper ill be honest with you i really have no idea whether ive got alibis for all those dates or not quite possibly i do i have a lot of professional lunches and dinners and just general meetings keeping in contact with people people whose word i think youd take like police top brass and lawyers and advocates it never does any harm to remind an inquisitive cop you know people like those but come on i laugh lightly holding my arms out i mean anyway do i look like a murderer the detective inspector laughs too no you dont mr colley he draws on the cigarette no he says he brings the cigarette carefully over to the table leans past me to fold the stub into the ashtray and says i helped interview dennis nilsen remember him mr colley guy that killed all those blokes i nod as the di returns to the window i dont like the way were going here young men lots of young men under his floorboards buried in the garden bloody football team of stiffs he had he looks out the window again away from me he shakes his head he didnt look like a murderer either the door opens and sergeant flavell comes in with my new laptop suddenly i have a bad feeling about all this im in the bar of the cafe royal through the wall from the restaurant where i had lunch with y and william last week above the noise of the bars chattering patrons i can hear the distant clanking and clattering of cutlery and crockery coming over the tall partition wall and echoing off the places high ornate ceiling im staring at the gallery of the island bar while my pal al is away having a pee and im experiencing an optical illusion or something because things are not right i can see those bottles on the gallery ahead of me and i can see their reflections behind them but i cant see me i cant see my own reflection al comes back through the throng politely elbows his way between a couple of people lifts his coat off his bar stool and leans on the bar beside me drinking his pint help me al i say im going crazy or ive become a fucking vampire or something al looks at me hes older than me fortytwo i think mousy hair teacupsized bald patch a couple of fetching parallel scars above his nose that make him look like hes frowning all the time but usually hes laughing actually bit smaller than me engineering consultant met him at one of these stupid paintballgunsinthewoods boys games that management tend to think are such a teamspiritbuilding hoot what are you talking about you incredible cretin colley i nod at the gallery ahead of me i can see people there behind the bottles just as i can see people behind me i swear theyre the same people and i ought to be between them and the mirror behind the bottles but i still cant see myself i nod again hoping that the movement will show up in the mirror but it doesnt look i say look in the mirror it is a mirror isnt it i stare glass shelves brass supports bottle of stoly red facing me and its back visible in the mirror likewise a bottle of blue smirnoff label facing me and the plain white back of the label visible through the bottle and the vodka inside same with the bottle of bacardi alongside i can see the little label on the back of the bottle in the mirror and see it through the bottle from the front of course its a mirror al moves his head so that his chin is on my shoulder he peers forwards he takes a pair of glasses i know hes a little sensitive about from his jacket pocket and puts them on what he says sounding exasperated a bar person gets in the way pulling a pint and then turning to the optics above where im looking and i have to move my head trying to see but i cant until she moves away cameron what are you gibbering about al says he turns looking at me i look in the mirror again christ i cant see him either maybe its all those southern comforts we had earlier drinking to bushs defeat by clinton thank fuck we didnt have buds like al suggested how could he even think about polluting our bodies with a brewedintheuk copy of a beer thats basically just fizzy piss even in its original incarnation and they have the nerve to advertise it here as the genuine article another one of those great lies in advertising aimed at the braindead of essex their grey matter irretrievably compromised by years of reading the sun and drinking skol the bastards i point getting a funny look from a bar person passing at the time as i almost poke her in the eye im invisible i squawk youre pissed al says going back to his pint one of the people in the mirror is looking at me i realise im still pointing i turn and look behind me but theres just a whole load of backs and bodies nobody looking at me i turn back and stare at the mirror just as the bar person i almost assaulted reaches up and takes the bottle of bacardi down from the shelf i stare its reflection is still there even more amazing the man who was looking at me is still looking at me then it occurs to me i can see a bit of a tile mural on the wall above him i turn round and look above the people behind me there is still a fair bit of light coming in through the tall engraved windows no mural i turn back again as the bar person puts the bacardi bottle back on the shelf it is not quite straight and slightly out of position one of the older male bar staff passes by reaches up and sets the bottle in exactly the right position again to maintain the mirror illusion before going to a pump and rilling a couple of pint glasses with shilling i glare at him as he comes towards me the complete bastard then i pull back afraid as he comes right up and puts the glasses down in front of al and me i look down at my own glass and see its empty just as the bar man takes it away and accepts the money from al who pours the last few millimetres from his old glass into his new one i shake my head no man i say sighing and looking up at the ceiling i cant handle all this what al says frowning i cant handle this todays just been you look like shit cameron al tells me he nods past me look theres a couple of proper seats lets sit down okay lets get some fags eh no youre giving up remember yeah but its been a difficult day al just head for those seats okay i forget my coat but al remembers it we sit at the end of one of the bars ribbed green leather semicircular benches pints on the oval table do i really look like shit cam you look shafted fuck off you uncivil bastard just calling it the way i see it ive had a traumatic day i tell him pulling my drizabone about me grilled by the fuzz sounds painful certainly thanks for coming for a drink al i tell him looking into his eyes with drunken sincerity and punching him lightly on the forearm ouch will you stop that he rubs his arm but anyway think comparatively little of it al you got any fags on you at all al no i still havent oh oh well but i really appreciate you coming for this drink really al youre my only pal who isnt another fucking hack well apart from andy and well anyway i really appreciate being able to tell you all this shit and share it with the rest of the bar if i didnt keep telling you to shut up yeah but you wouldnt believe what theyre getting at i mean you wouldnt believe what theyre trying to fucking pin on me a badge that says nil by mouth perhaps i wave this away and bend closer to him im serious they think ive been murdering people al sighs deeply what a gift for dramatic hyperbole you possess cameron its true no al says calmly i think if it was true they wouldnt have let you go cameron youd be in a cell youd be looking at bars not trying to drink one dry but i havent got an alibi i whisper angrily i havent got any fucking alibis some cunts trying to set me up im not kidding theyre trying to set me up they call me on the phone and get me to go to some lonely spot and wait for a phone call on a public box or get me to stay home all night meanwhile theyre offing some fucker i mean by the sound of it every one of the bastards deserved to die though actually he hasnt killed them all just seriously assaulted some of them whatever the hell they mean by that wouldnt tell me but i didnt do it and the police are fucking crazy man they think i had enough time to get to the fucking airport get down south or wherever and kill these tory fuckwits christ they took my new computer my laptop heinous bastards theyve even told me to keep them informed of my movements can you believe that ive got to report in to the local police if i go anywhere what a nerve i tried ringing some of the cops i know topbrass types to find out what they knew about all this but they were all out or at meetings suspicious as fuck i glance at my watch i got to get home al i have to flush all my stuff down the toilet or eat it or something i drink some of my pint spilling a little on my chin but im being set up im not kidding some bastard rings up calling himself mr archer al sighs i stare at him i cant believe this how do you know i screech because this is about the fifth time youve told me this shit i think about this do you think i might be getting drunk oh shut up and drink your beer good idea you got any fags on you at all al an hour later and als made me return a packet of fags i bought and taken one slim panatella from my lips just as i was about to light it at the bar and taken me round to the burger king and made me eat a cheeseburger and drink a large milk and i seem to have sobered up a bit except now my balance has gone and im having trouble standing al has to help me and insists we get a taxi and refuses to drive or let me drive and i accuse him of being scared because of his record im heading for the hills im telling you i tell him as we make it out through the door and into the open air sound thinking al says its always worked for me yeah i say nodding emphatically and gazing up at the sky its sunset and the air is cold we head west along princes street im heading for the hills getting out of town i tell him im going to ditch all the gear in my flat first but then

with my mr archer or daniel smout i really dont like the sound of all this i lie down again and try to sleep but i cant and i cant stop thinking about guys tied to trees with nooses round their necks waiting for a train or jerking around in baths while a drill sparks and bubbles under the water or drowning in farm cesspits i try to stop thinking about that sort of gory ghastly stuff and think about y for a while instead and have a wank and still dont sleep and eventually after a lot more notsleeping im dying for a cigarette and so i get up and go out but i must have slept after all because its half two in the morning all of a sudden and theres nowhere open and by now my heads sore but i really need some tobacco so i hoof it uphill through royal circus and up howe street until finally a cab stops and i get him to take me through the quiet streets to the cowgate where the kasbars still open god bless the awful dive that it is and at last i can buy some fags regal because thats all they have behind the bar and the machines not working but it doesnt matter ive got a cigarette in my mouth and a pint in my hand medicinal and anyway i dont think they serve perrier in the kasbar and even if they did some sevenfoot biker would probably push a glass in your face just on general principles and then drag you screaming into the gents and shove your head down an unflushed toilet but hey im not complaining thats part of the character of the place and im happy now i leave at four walking from the cowgate up to hunter square where the waisthigh glasstiled roof of the underground toilets glows with hundreds of little blue marbles one of the lux europae exhibits i head down fleshmarket close forgetting the station is still closed at this time in the morning so detour up waverley bridge and stroll along princes street beneath more abstract light sculptures watching a streetcleaning machine as it trundles growling along the road brushing and sucking at the gutters im home by five and up again by eleven when theres a phone call thats more than ordinarily interesting that changes my plans and so i go into work and have to pay frank milltown of towie give in molten of toil his twenty quid because the tories scraped through the maastricht vote with less of a margin that id anticipated and i try to phone neil to make sure i didnt dream that call last night but hes out chapter exocet deck i drive the car up the little singletrack road leading towards the low hills the headlights create a deep channel of illumination between the hedges im dressed in black jeans black boots and a dark blue poloneck over a navy shirt and two vests ive wearing thin black leather gloves i find a track leading off the road into a stand of trees i take the car up as far as it will go then turn the lights out the clock on the dash says its i wait a minute no traffic passes so i guess i havent been seen my heart is thudding already the night is cold when i get out of the car theres a halfmoon but its obscured ninety per cent of the time by a lot of low fastmoving cloud producing occasional freezing gusts of rain the wind is loud in the leafbare branches overhead i head down the track to the road then look back to the car its almost fully hidden i cross the tarmac and climb a fence then take the skimask from my trouser pocket and pull it over my head i follow the line of the hedge along the side of the road ducking once as a car drives past on the road its headlights sweep along the hedge above me the car carries on into the night i start breathing again i get to the fence leading downhill and follow it stumbling now and again on the rocks and stones left at the side of the field my eyes are still adjusting to the darkness the ground underfoot is fairly firm not too muddy at the hedge marking the foot of the field i have to look for a minute to find a way through finally i have to crawl through and underneath it snagging my poloneck trees heard but barely seen in the darkness make a great rushing crackling sound above me i scramble down a muddy leaflittered bank and into a chilly stream at the bottom it flows over one boot and i whisper shit and squelch up the far bank holding onto the cold branches of bushes and the mudslimy roots of trees i force my way through some bushes at the top i can see street lights ahead and the geometric shapes of darkened houses i keep crouched and make my way through the low bushes heading diagonally through the wood towards the estate i trip over a log and fall but dont hurt myself i come to the twometrehigh brick wall which surrounds the estate and feel my way along it stumbling over piles of earth and building debris until i get to the corner i measure sixty paces along the wall and then walk away from it to the nearest tree a patch of moonlight means i have to wait nearly five minutes for the clouds to cover the moon again before i can climb the tree i get far enough up to see the house and identify it by its position and the garden furniture then i climb back down go to the wall and jump up catching hold of the concrete ridge tiles on top of the wall and pulling myself up i rest on the top of the wall my hands shaking my heart pumping hard i look at the dark house in front of me and the screens of tall shrubs and young trees on either side concealing the two neighbouring villas the moon threatens to come out from behind the clouds again and i have to jump down to the paving stones of the patio beneath there is a small wall beside the greenhouse which rises to within a metre of the top of the estate wall thats my escape route there are infraredsensing security lights on the wall of the house and if they go on then the whole things off im up and over the wall and back into the woods and away i walk quietly over the patio onto the grass and towards the house just waiting for the blaze of light from the security lamps it doesnt happen i reach the lower patio where the garden furniture stands by the side of the tarpaulincovered pool and crouch down by the ghostly perforated shape of the castiron bench i feel up inside the overhang where the back of the bench joins the arm the leather of my gloves catching on rough splinters of metal i cant feel enough i take my glove off and try again the metal cold and edges sharp against my skin i feel the putty then the embedded key and its short length of string i take hold of the string and pull gently the key comes out clinking quietly once i put my glove back on i walk carefully past the conservatory to the back door of the house slide the key into the lock and turn it the door opens silently the house is warm inside and smells of washing powder i lock the door as i move away from it a small faint red light comes on with a tiny clinking noise high up in one far corner of the room the sensor doesnt set the alarm off the system isnt armed i move very slowly through the utility room and into the kitchen another little red light clicks on my boots squelch and squeak on the tiles i hesitate then kneel and quickly take the boots off leaving them by the dishwasher when i stand up i see the wooden block full of knives on the work surface just visible by moonlight next to the gently gleaming stainless steel of the sinks i pull out the largest of the knives then turn and leave the kitchen heading down the corridor past the dining room and the study to the stairs beyond and to the side is the splitlevel lounge a shaft of orange street light sifting through the trees round the front garden shows leather settees chairs bookcases full of videos cds and books a couple of coffee tables and a big metal hood over a raised central fireplace another sensor high in one corner glows red as i move towards the foot of the stairs the carpet on the stairs is thick and deep and i make no noise as i climb to the top then pad along towards the master bedroom tripping one more sensor the bedroom door opens with only the softest of creaks at the head of the wide double bed there is a weak green glow as i move round i see the numerals of a digital clock the limecoloured light spills faintly out onto white sheets and a single sleeping face i go closer very slowly the knife held in front of me i watch her breathe one of her arms lies outside the covers hanging out pale and naked over the edge of the bed she has short dark hair and a slim slightly boyish face thin dark brows thin nose pale lips with the hint of a pout and a sharp triangular chin matching sharp high cheekbones i creep closer she stirs i reach forward the knife in one hand the other glove touching then gathering and balling a fistful of duvet and then pulling it sharply throwing it away behind me as i leap forward seeing her pale nakedness in the same instant as i slap my hand over her mouth her eyes open wide and she starts trying to push up i force her back down into the bed hand still over her mouth i raise the knife so she can see it she struggles eyes widening further but i pin her to the sheets with my weight and keep the glove firmly over her mouth even though she isnt making any noise i rest the blade of the knife against her throat and she goes still make a noise and youre dead understand i say she seems not to hear staring up at me understand i say again and this time she nods quickly warning you i tell her as i slowly take my hand away from her mouth she doesnt call out i push myself up still keeping the knife near her throat i undo the zip on my jeans im not wearing any underpants and my cock falls out already hard shes staring into my eyes i see her swallow a pulse beats at the top of her long white neck under her chin her hand is creeping to the side of the bed i look at it and it stops her eyes look terrified now i put the blade of the knife against her neck again and look down to the edge of the mattress shes trembling i feel under the edge of the mattress above the wooden frame of the huge bed i feel a wooden handle i pull out a teninch hunting knife with a serrated blade i whistle softly then throw it across the carpets towards the windows shes staring at me on your front i tell her on your knees like a dog now she starts to breathe raggedly mouth open her whole body is trembling do it i hiss she rolls over onto her front then gets up onto her knees taking the weight of her upper body on her hands face on the sheets i tell her hands up here she rests her face on the sheet and puts her hands behind her i take the handcuffs from my pocket and snap them over her wrists i stop to put a condom on then climb onto the bed behind her put the knife onto the sheets just within reach grip her hips with both hands and pull her onto my cock she shouts as i enter her shes soaking wet and within a few thrusts im ready to come and shes panting then grunting then calling out oh fuck yes and then its all over and i collapse over her and then fall off her and almost cut my ear on the cool blade of the kitchen knife lying on the sheet she lies there on her side facing me watching me still panting hands still trapped behind her back a strange charged expression on her face and after a bit she says is that it i breathe deeply and say no i haul her roughly back up onto her knees with her face down on the sheets again and spread her buttocks and stick an index finger into her anus sliding it quickly half into her she gasps i position my head above her backside and let some spit fall down onto where the knuckle is caught on the ring of muscle then push my finger fully into her she gasps again i start to move the finger in and out stroking her clitoris with my other hand i use two fingers after a while then im hard again i pull the first condom off and put on another one then i spit onto my rubbersheathed prick and guiding it with my fingers ease it slowly into her rectum she comes screaming i dont think im going to but then i do we collapse together onto the bed breathing in time i pull myself out of her there is a faint smell of shit i undo the handcuffs and lie there holding her she pulls the skimask from my head where are your shoes she whispers after a while in the kitchen i tell her they were muddy didnt want to make a mess she laughs quietly in the darkness but i was in control she says over the noise of the streaming water as she soaps my shoulders and back all i had to say was your name and it was all over thats what we agreed i trust you but whats the difference i ask her trying to see her over my shoulder anybody watching that would have said i was a rapist and you were being raped but we knew different but is that all it is i mean just thinking that what if it had been a real rapist what if it had been the wrong house i checked the furniture and you were just you you moved like you spoke like you smelled like you but look i enjoyed it she says soaping the small of my back and my buttocks i dont think i want to do it again but it was interesting to live it out but what about you how did you feel about it nervous as fuck i was certain i wouldnt be able to get it up i mean just certain especially as im still feeling the effects from getting pissed yesterday and then well aroused i suppose when when i realised you were uhhuh not before no no i mean i felt awful for long enough i felt like a rapist but you werent she slides her hand between the cheeks of my bum then soaps my thighs and down my legs you were doing something id always fantasised about oh great so that old fuck jamieson was right and all women secretly want to be raped yvonne slaps my calves dont be stupid nobody wants to be raped but some people have fantasies about it the control isnt some detail cameron knowing its somebody you can trust isnt just bytheway its everything hmm i say unconvinced men like jamieson hate women cameron or maybe they just hate women who arent totally in awe of men women who arent under their control she runs her hands up my legs to my buttocks again sliding her fingers between my cheeks touching my anus and making me go up on the balls of my feet then her hand runs back down my legs maybe men like that should have it happen to them she says rape assault see how they like it yeah i say shivering suddenly despite the heat because were getting into dodgy territory here all those wigs and garters and funny gowns fuckin askin for it int they know wot i mean the steam gets to my throat and i cough im wondering whether i should say anything to her about the police and about the retired judge jamieson being assaulted whatever that means after my drunken afternoon with al i dont feel the same need to offload as i did before and i cant decide whether i ought to involve yvonne or not she washes my feet or maybe she says the greers and the dworkins are right and the pickleses and the jamiesons are right too and all men are rapists and all women want to be raped bullshit mmhmm but i still didnt like being made to feel like i was a rapist well we wont do that again and i still find the idea of you wanting me to do it unsettling shes silent for a while then says the other day shes soaping the front of my legs now from behind when you had to sit through eldorado in that really uncomfortable position you enjoyed that didnt you shes smoothing her sappled hands up and down my thighs well eventually i concede but if that had been somebody else doing that to you she says softly so that i can hardly hear her over the quiet thunder of the shower shes soaping my balls now gently palping them massaging them somebody you didnt know male or female tying you up leaving you helpless somewhere where shouting couldnt help you and there was a big sharp knife under the bed how would you have felt then she stands up and rubs her body up against me stroking my still mostly limp cock i gaze out through the steam and the rivulets of water running down the glass of the shower cabinet im looking out at the moodily lit bathroom and wondering what i would do if i suddenly saw william appear out there flight bags in hand a surprise honey im home look on his face petrified i admit id be scared stiff well scared soft shes gently pulling on my prick it doesnt really want to and i find it difficult to believe and im not sure i want to because i feel so fucking drained and sore but the things actually responding fattening and firming and rising in her kneading soapslick hands she puts her chin on my shoulder and a sharp fingernail against my jugular turn round bitchboy she hisses oh habloodyha yvonne wakes me up after an hours sleep and tells me i have to leave i turn over and pretend im still asleep but she pulls the duvet off me and switches the lights on i have to dress in my sweaty dirty clothes and go back down to the kitchen grumbling while she makes me a coffee and i complain about my wet boots and she gives me a fresh pair of williams socks to wear and i put them on and drink my coffee and whine about never being allowed to spend the night and tell her how just once id like to wake up here in the morning and have a nice civilised breakfast with her sitting on the sunny balcony outside the bedroom windows but she makes me sit down while she laces my boots up then takes my coffee cup off me and sends me out the back door and says ive got two minutes before she arms the alarm and puts the infrared lights on standby so i have to go back the way i came over the estate wall and through the wood and down into the stream where i get both feet wet and cold and i fall going up the bank and get all muddy and eventually drag myself up and through the hedge scratching my cheek and tearing my poloneck and then trudging across the field through heavy rain and more mud and finally getting to the car and panicking when i cant find the car keys before remembering i put them in the buttondown back pocket of the jeans for safety instead of the side pocket like i usually do and then having to put some dead branches under the front wheels because the fucking cars stuck and finally getting away and home and even in the street light i can see what a mess of the pale upholstery my muddy clothes have made i feel too tired to sleep so i play some despot when i get home but my hearts not in it and the empire is still in a tatteredlooking state after all the earlier disasters and im almost wondering if i should start again but that would mean going back to the fucking dawn of civilisation and the temptation in despot is always to swap pov which people who dont know the game always think sounds sort of innocent like some detail but it isnt youre not just swapping point of view youre swapping your current despotic power level for something less even if its a regional lord or other king or a general or royal relation close to the throne and it is not to be done lightly because as soon as you renounce the current despots pov the computer takes over and its a smart fucking piece of software try to swap too late hold on too long and you get assassinated and thats it thats you back to the cave with twenty other fleabitten reducedstatures and the bright idea of bringing some fire into the cave swap too soon and the program takes over and performs some miracle that pulls the ass of the despot you just abandoned out of the fire and next thing you know the secret police are banging down the doors and hauling you and your family off into the night and oblivion the machine thereupon promptly declares itself the winner and its back to that fucking cave again i give up after an hour of civilisational watertreading hit store and slope off to bed ive smoked six fags without really meaning to im still heading for the hills i get up bright and late i phone andy and confirm its still all right to visit then i ring eddie and get the next three days off tell the cops theyre based at fettes though the di has gone back down to london and no theyre still not giving me back my new portable yet and after ive cleaned the car up a bit head out of the city and across the grey bridge in a day of squally buffeting rain that has the bridges limit signs on highsided vehicles banned and the dancing its dunlops sideways as the gusts hit then its up the m skirting perth and heading northwards on the a with its frustrating mix of dual and single carriageways and its direwarning signs about unmarked police cars before the fun begins at dalwhinnie nirvana michelle shocked crowded house and carter usm provide the sound track the rain eases as i head west i catch the last of a wide bloodylooking sunset over skye and the kyles and the floodlights turning eilean donans grey stones green i make it to strome in four hours twenty minutes from home arriving just as the stars are coming out above in the purple spaces between the dark heavy clouds you total bastard you total utter and complete bastard thats how you fucking do it bastard compensation and redemption education even im in the dark hotel at the side of the black loch and its close to midnight and im drunk but not stoned and sos andy and his pal howie and im sitting in the old ballroom on the lower ground floor looking out over the waters to where grey ghostly moonlit mountains rise tops glowing softly capped with snow and im playing computer games in fact im playing xerium of all things and blow me down blow me up if i havent just found out how to get over the mountains of zound at long long last its easy but sneaky you ferry a dump of fuel shielding a nuke and a missile load up on fuel and a nuke fly out and up eight clicks drop the nuke at the foot of the mountains powerdive back down to base load the shielding fuel to the max with just one missile aboard meanwhile the nuke explodes shaking the ground you dont want to be fueling at this point then you climb like fuck get to ceiling and then hover in the air above the rising mushroom cloud the cloud comes up beneath you and carries you up with it over your normal ceiling the shielding protects you though you still need to do some fancy flying to stay stable within the radioactive thermals then as the cloud dissipates you cut out and down across the mountains they look tiny swoop across the closed valley loose the missile when the bases defence radar picks you up and use the last of your fuel to escape over the far side while the missile takes out the base simple bastard i say gliding the ship down to a fueldump and a gentle landing i shake my head riding the fucking mushroom cloud never even occurred to me youre not gungho enough andy tells me refilling my whisky glass aye youve got to be a real man to play this game howie says winking and taking up his glass hes a brawny highland lad from one of the nearby villages one of andys drinking partners a bit rough and ready and with a highly incorrect attitude to women but amusing in a raw kind of way a mans man you have to be slightly crazy to play xerium andy says sitting back in his seat you have to be just crazy enough aye howie says draining his whisky glass no no thanks drew he says as andy goes to refill his dram too id better be away he says standing cant be late for my last day with the forestry nice to meet you he says to me maybe see you later he shakes my hand serious grip right andy says standing too ill see you out howie thanks for coming round not at all not at all good to see you again wee goingaway party tomorrow night aye why not they wend off across the dully shining floor of the ballroom heading approximately for the stairs i shake my head at the amiga screen riding the fucking mushroom cloud i say to myself then i get up out of the creaking seat and stretch my legs taking my glass over to the floortoceiling windows which form one wall of the ballroom and look out over the gardens to the railway line and the shore of the loch the clouds have shrunk to wisps and the moon stands somewhere overhead filling the view with silver a few lights burn further down the loch to the right but the mass of mountains on the far side rises dark into the starry sky grey becoming white at their snowdusted summits the ballroom smells damp it is illuminated only by the light shining from the stairwell and the desk lamp on the old trestle table which holds the computer torn bleachedlooking curtains hang at the sides of the six tall window bays my breath smokes in front of me and mists on the cold glass all the panes are dirty and some are cracked a couple have been replaced with hardboard in two of the window bays there are buckets to catch drips but one of them has overflowed and caused a puddle to form around it discolouring and springing the parquet flooring which looks burned in other places striped faded wallpaper has unrolled down the walls in places to hang like giant shavings off a piece of planed wood the ballroom is scattered with cheap wooden chairs tables rolls of ancient mouldysmelling carpets a couple of old motorbikes and lots of bits of motorbikes standing or lying on oilstained sheets and what looks and smells like an industrialstandard deepfat frier with the associated hoods filters fan housing and ducting the hotel lies at the foot of a steep road which leads down through the trees from the main road with the hill and the dark masses of the trees behind it to the south the place doesnt get any sunlight in winter and not that much even in summer the main road used to come here and the ferry took you over to the north side of the loch but then they upgraded the way round the loch from a track to a road and the ferry stopped the invernesskyle railway still runs past and the train still halts if anyone requests it but with the ferry gone and the road traffic diverted the place has gone to seed there are a few houses a craft shop the railway platform a wharf and an abandoned compound owned by marconi and the hotel thats it theres a sign at the top of the road thats been there for years ever since they opened the new road and it says strome ferry no ferry and that just says it all a door closes in the distance somewhere overhead i drink my whisky and look out at the inky loch i dont think andy ever meant to do anything with this place like the rest of his friends i assumed he was going to run it put money into it develop it we all imagined he had some secret new moneyspinning idea and soon wed all be amazed at what hed done to the place and coming here to marvel at the crowds hed managed to attract but i dont think he was ever looking for a site for some viable business venture i think he was just looking for somewhere suited to his burnedout fedup pissedoff mood right andy says in the background he comes in from the stairwell and closes the double doors fancy some narcotics oh you have some yeah well andy says coming to stand near me and look out over the water hes about my height but hes filled out a bit since he came here and he has a kind of stoop now which makes him look smaller and older than he is hes wearing thick old cords worn smooth at the bum and knee but goodquality once and what looks like a load of shirts and holey jumpers and cardigans hes got a weeks growth of beard which seems to be permanent judging from the times ive seen him in the past howies like a lot of them up here he says they like a drink but they have a weird attitude to anything else he shrugs and takes a silver cigarette case from a pocket in one of his cardigans there are a few travellers live in the area theyre cool hey i say remembering did the police call you yeah he says opening the cigarette case to reveal a dozen or so neatly rolled spliffs somebody called flavell asked about when i called you back the other night i told him right i think im supposed to go and report to the local polizei tomorrow yeah yeah its a fucking police state he says tiredly offering the spliff case to me anyway fancy a blow yeah i shrug well i dont normally you understand i take one of the js thanks i shiver im wearing my jacket and my drizabone but i still feel freezing but can we go somewhere warm andy the iceboy smiles we sit in the lounge off his bedroom on the top floor of the hotel smoking js and drinking whisky i know im going to suffer for this tomorrow later today but i dont care i tell him about the whisky story and the chillfiltering and the colouring but he already seems to know it all the lounge is moderately spacious and somewhere between shabby and cosy scuffed velvet curtains heavy old wooden furniture lots of plump embroidered cushions and on a massive table in one corner an ancient ibm pc it has an external disk drive and a modem connected and the casing is sitting slightly askew an epson printer sits alongside were sitting round a real fire burning logs and a fan heaters whining away in the centre of the rooms dark threadbare carpet im warm at last andy sits in an ancient bulging armchair its fake brown leather rubbed through to the fabric net underneath in places and burnished to a deep black shine on the arms he nurses his whisky and looks into the fire most of the time his concession to the warmth of the room has been to take off his topmost cardigan yeah hes saying we were the blankcheque generation i remember thinking in that it was time to really go for something to finally try something different to be radical it seemed like ever since the sixties there had been just one brand of government in two slightly different packages and nothing much ever changed there was this feeling that after the burst of energy in the earlymidsixties everything had been going downhill the whole country was constipated bound up with rules and regulations and restrictive practices and just general endemic infectious ennui i never could decide who was right socialists even revolutionaries or the archcapitalists and it seemed wed never find out in britain because whatever way the popular vote went it never really brought any real change of direction heath wasnt particularly good for business and callaghan wasnt particularly good for the working class i didnt think you ever thought much of revolution i tell him sipping my whisky i thought you were always a devout capitalist andy shrugs i just wanted change it seemed like what was needed it didnt really matter which direction it came from i never said much because i wanted to keep my options open id already decided i wanted to go into the army and it wouldnt have been a good idea to have anything on my record about supporting some leftwing group but it had occurred to me that if there was ever any well i dont know armed revolt popular uprising he laughs lightly i can remember when that didnt seem so unlikely and i thought well if anything like that does ever happen and theyre right and the establishment is wrong then it wouldnt do any harm for there to be people like me in the army who were basically in sympathy with the movement whatever he shakes his head still staring at the fire though i guess that sounds pretty dumb now doesnt it i shrug dont ask me youre talking to somebody who thought the way to make the world a better place was to become a journalist marks me down as a prime strategic thinker and no mistake nothing wrong with the idea andy says but if youre disillusioned now its partly because of what im talking about the radicalism of thatcher that seemed so fresh that promise that lean trimmeddown fitness we could all look forward to here was the chance to follow one dynamic plan pushed by somebody who wasnt going to chicken out halfway through stripping away all the inefficiencies the cosy deals the featherbedding the smothering worst of the nannystate it was a breath of clean new air it was a crusade something we could all take part in all be a part of if you were rich to start with or determined to be a bigger bastard than your mates andy shakes his head youve always hated the tories too much to see any of that clearly but the point is it doesnt matter who was right and even less who would have been right all that matters is what people felt because thats what produced the new ethos of the age consensus had led to impasse care to sterility so deliver a shock to the system take the sort of radical risk with the country that you have to take with a business at least once in its history if its to succeed go for growth take the monetarist shilling he sighs takes out the cigarette case again and holds it out to me i take a spliff and i was one of those who did he says lighting the j with his zippo i was a loyal trooper in the childrens crusade to recover the lost citadel of british economic power he watches the fire while i smoke the spliff though of course before that id already done my bit i was one of our lads i was an expeditionary part of the task force that recaptured maggies surrendered popularity i dont know what to say and in a recently introduced policy initiative that has come with my advancing years i dont say anything well here we are andy says sitting forward and slapping his hands on his knees then taking the j when i tap him on the elbow thanks he tokes on the spliff here we are and weve had our experiment theres been one party one dominant idea one fully followed plan one strong leader and her grey shadow and its all turned to shit and ashes industrial base cut so close to the bone the marrows leaking out the old vaguely socialist inefficiencies replaced with more rabid capitalist ones power centralised corruption institutionalised and a generation created whichll never have any skills beyond opening a car with a coat hanger and knowing which solvents give you the best buzz with a plastic bag over your head before you throw up or pass out he sucks hard on the number before holding it out to me yeah i say taking it but its not like it was all your fault you did your bit but islagiatt yeah it seemed like a good idea at the time christ man i didnt think any of you guys should have been out there but i dont think i could have done what you did in the falklands i mean even if there had been some war i did believe worth fighting if id been called up or something im a coward im just not physically capable you were you did it fuck the rights and wrongs of the war once youre in there under fire and your mates are getting blown away around you you have to be able to function at least you did im not sure i could so what he says looking at me so im more of a fucking man because i learned how to kill people and did no i just mean anyway he says looking away again a lot of good any of that did when we had a captain who couldnt fucking hack it didnt have the guts to admit it and had to send good men into a fucking killing ground to prove how fucking brave he really was andy lifts a log from the hearth and puts it on the fire hitting the other logs with it and making them spark and blaze yeah i say well i cant and youre wrong he says getting out of his seat and going to the corner of the room theres a halfopen hatch there leading into what looks like a deep oddly cubeshaped cupboard its a dumb waiter he pulls the top part of the metal cover further up and the lower half sinks at the same time he reaches in and gathers an armful of logs bringing them over to the hearth we all have responsibility cameron you cant escape it chayzuz gould you take a hard line man so ye dae i say trying to lighten things up but sounding pretty pathetic even to myself andy sits takes the offered spliff and arranges the logs neatly round the edge of the hearth to dry he glances at me yeah and a long memory i still havent forgiven you for not trying to rescue me on the ice that time he takes a long draw on the j while i sit there thinking oh shit then he hands the number back to me again with a big grin on his face only kidding he says ive been outmachoing men and bedding women with that story for twenty years andy shows me to my room a floor down at about four in the morning it has a fan heater and an electric blanket on the single bed before i go to sleep i wonder about whether i should have said anything to him about mr archer and his phone calls and ares i came up here thinking i would i assumed id need to offload on somebody but somehow it never seemed to be the right time to introduce the subject never mind it feels good just to have had a talk as i drift off i have the start of the runningthroughthewoods dream again but i get away from it and dont remember thing else the next day while andys still asleep i take a some painkillers and b the car into kyle of lochalsh to tell the local police im here driving into the town i spot an escort with a blue light or roof and pull up behind it a sergeant appears from what a plate beside the door indicates is the dentists and i go up to him and tell him my name and that ive been told to report my movement detective inspector mcdunn the gaunt greyhaired sergeant fixes me with a studiously suspicious look and takes a note of my name and the time i get the impression he thinks im a harmless crank anyway he doesnt say much maybe his mouth is still sore from his visit to the dentists i cant wait around to try and engage him in further conversation because my bowels suddenly decide they want to wake up too and i have to make a dash for the nearest bar and the toilets god i hate it when my shit smells of whisky andy has a party that night partly for me and partly because his pal howie is leaving for a job on the rigs the following day we go for a walk up into the hills in the afternoon me puffing and panting and coughing after andy as he strides quickly easily up the rutted forest tracks back at the hotel i help him clear up the lounge bar which still bears the debris from andys last party a few months earlier the bar is still stocked though there is no draught beer only cans andy seems to be assuming hell be providing all the booze for the party so i gather hes not quite as skint as ive heard maybe a couple of dozen people show up for the party about half locals mostly men though theres one married couple and a pair of single girls and half travellers new age hippies from various scattered buses and vans parked in laybys and the highway equivalent of oxbows where corners or short twisty lengths of old roads have been replaced with more direct stretches in terms of people mixing its a party that at best emulsifies rather than combines theres a hostility between some of the highland lads cleanshaven shorthaired and the travellers the opposite that gets worse as everybody gets more drunk i get the impression the indigenous locals know the travelling people keep disappearing to have some blow and resent it andy seems not to notice talking to everybody regardless i do my best to mix as well at first i get on best with the highland laddies matching them dram for dram and can for can taking their cigarettes and suffering their remarks on the lines of no i still smoke when i offer them my silk cuts but gradually as we get drunker i start to feel uncomfortable with their attitude to the travellers and even more so to women and howie the guy i met last night talks about how he used to slap the wife around and now the bitch is in one of these fucking womens refuges and if he ever finds her hell fucking kick seven kinds of shit out of her the others suggest this isnt such a good idea but i get the impression they think this mainly because hed only end up in prison i find myself gravitating towards the travellers at one point i see andy standing staring out the windows of the lounge towards the dark loch his eyes wide you all right i ask him he takes a moment to answer were ten metres above mean sealevel here he says nodding out to the shore you dont say i light a cigarette the deck on the qe on that level we called the exocet deck because thats the height the missile rides at ah falklands lore well i say peering out at the darkness and the far side of the loch unless you have an irate neighbour with particularly good contacts in the arms trade the only thing i ever have nightmares about andy says his gaze still directed at the unseeable loch his eyes still wide isnt that ridiculous nightmares about being blown to fuck by a missile ten years ago i wasnt even on that deck we were billeted two up from there he shrugs drinks and turns to me smiling you see your mum much eh i say confused at this sudden change in direction no not recently shes still in new zealand how about you been back to strathspeld he shakes his head and i get a shiver remembering just that gesture of his repeated and repeated so that it became like a nervous tic after a while back in strathspeld after clares funeral in a gesture of disbelief refusal nonacceptance you should go he tells me you should go and see them theyd appreciate that well see i say a gust of wind throws rain against the window and shakes the frame its loud and surprising and i flinch but he just turns slowly and looks out into the darkness with what could almost be contempt before laughing and putting an arm round my shoulder and suggesting we have another drink later a storm breaks over the hotel lightning flares above the mountains across the loch and the windows rattle as the thunder booms theres a power cut the lights go out and we light candles and gas lamps and end up a hard core of seven of us andy me howie another two local lads and a couple of the traveller boys down in the snooker room where theres a beatup looking table and a leak in the ceiling that turns the whole of the stained greenbaize surface into a millimetreshallow marsh water dripping from each pocket and dribbling down the bulky legs to the sopping carpet and we play snooker by the light of the hissing gas lamps having to hit the white ball really hard even for delicate shots because of the extra rolling resistance the water causes and the balls make a zizzing ripping noise as they race across the table and sometimes you can see spray curving up behind them and im feeling really drunk and a bit stoned from a couple of strong js smoked out in the garden earlier with the travellers but i think this dimly lit waterhazard snooker is just hilarious and im laughing maniacally at it all and i put an arm round andys neck at one point and say you know i love you old buddy and isnt friendship and love whats its really all about and why cant people just see that and just be nice to each other except there are just so many complete bastards in the world but andy just shakes his head and i try to kiss him and he gently fends me off and steadies me against one wall and props me up with a snooker cue against my chest and i think this is really funny for some reason and laugh so much i fall over and have distinct problems getting up again and get carried to my room by andy and one of the travellers and dumped on the bed and fall instantly asleep i dream of strathspeld and the long summers of my childhood passed in a trance of lazy pleasure ending with that day running through the woods but i turn away from that memory the way ive learned to over the years i wander again through the woods and the small hidden glens along the shores of the ornamental lochan and the river and its loch and im standing near the old boathouse in that defeatingly bright sunlight light dancing on water and i see two figures naked and thin and white in the grass beyond the reed beds and as i watch them the light turns from gold to silver and then to white and the trees seem to shrink in on themselves leaves disappearing in the chill coruscations of that enveloping white blaze while the view all around me becomes brighter and darker at once and all is reduced to black and white trees are bare and black the ground smothersmoothed in white and the two young figures are gone while one even smaller one booted gloved coattails flying behind runs laughing across the white level of the frozen loch someone calls out chapter lux europae twelve hours later im in the fucking channel islands still nursing a hangover and thinking what in the fuck am i doing here eh what wake up cameron theres a phone call oh right i try to focus on andy i cant seem to get my left eye open is it important dont know so i get up and pull my dressinggown on and head down to the cold dusty lobby where the phone is cameron frank here oh hi so are you enjoying your wee hol in the highlands oh yeah i say still trying to persuade my left eyelid to lift whats the problem frank well your mr archer phoned oh yeah i say warily yes he said you might like to know i hear frank rustling some paper mr jemmels real name is j azul thats the initial j then azul and that azul knew the full story but he was leaving on a foreign trip well this afternoon that was all hed say i tried

and sure enough all i got was the recording saying try again later oh christ anyway another thing hes going to come out with another of his ridiculous spellcheck semijokes i cant fucking believe it meanwhile my minds racing or at least trying to race right now it feels like its stuck at the side of the track trying to get its legs out of its tracksuit bottoms and hopping around and falling down while the race takes place elsewhere what if its a common name frank asks what if half the people in beirut or somewhere are called azul i mean it sounds like a sort of frank listen i say suddenly inspired and sounding a lot more sober and calm than i feel i think i remember where i know the name from i saw it in the back of private eye something to do with i dont know the sort of thing that gets into the back of the eye please frank he might be connected with defence aerospace intelligence or the arms trade try profile just type in get azul and i know i know thanks frank im going to get dressed now if i dont hear from you in about half an hour ill ring anyway bye christ those five murdered guys not to mention all the others mcdunns investigating and this guy leaving this afternoon rang yesterday christ i hate deadlines im panicking i can feel it my heart is racing im trying to think but i dont know what to do decide i decide when in doubt its vitally important to keep moving velocity is important kinetic energy frees the brain and confuses the enemy im gulping hot coffee and pulling on my coat my bags sitting on the reception desk in the hotel lobby and andys standing hunched and blinking and blearyeyed watching me stuff toast into my mouth and slurp coffee from a handlefree mug andy is looking at my bag one of my socks is poking out from where the two zips meet like a floppy white hernia andy pulls one of the zips open pokes the sock back in and then recloses the bag the phone often goes off he says apologetically probably the storm last night never mind i glance at my watch past time to phone frank listen andy says scratching under his chin and yawning the police might want to talk to you i know ill let them know where i am dont no i mean the local cops what why oh he sighs there was a bit of a rumble last night when the boys left outside looks like howie and his pals jumped the two traveller guys on the road landed one in hospital apparently cops are looking for howie anyway you were asleep when it happened but they might want to have a word so jesus i i begin the phone rings i grab it and yell what cameron frank oh hi have you found anything i think so could be a mr jemayl azul he says he spells out the first name and im thinking jemayljemmel uhhuh british citizen frank goes on english mother turkish father born educated harrow oxford and yale but is he in defence or has his own arms company connected with the saudis but hes sold arms just about everywhere including libya iran and iraq hes bought up a lot of small uk firms in the past mostly to close them down been the subject of a question in the house the israelis accused him of selling nuclear information to the iraqis in you were right about him being mentioned in the eye appeared a few times and i got the cuts up more paper rustling according to the report here one of the aliases he used in share deals and bank accounts was mr jemmel hows that frank sounds pleased with himself brilliant frank brilliant i tell him so where is he addresses in london and geneva an office in new york but based on jersey in the channel islands telephone number i checked unlisted and just an answering machine at his company address but i called a pal of mine in st helier who works on the local rag and he reckons your mans at home right right i say im thinking what about an address aspen hill street gorey jersey okay okay im still thinking frank thats brilliant an incredible help could you put me through to eddie what eddie says when i tell him inverness to jersey come on eddie im onto something here id pay for it myself but my cards up to the limit this had better be good cameron eddie this could be fucking enormous im not kidding well so you say cameron but your record overseas isnt terribly encouraging come on eddie thats cheap and anyway jerseys barely overseas and im giving up a days holiday here oh all right but youre going economy some life andy says putting my bag into the rear of the yeah i say getting into the car i can feel my headache attempting to reassert itself looks exotic on occasion doesnt feel it i close the door and wind the window down im not at all sure im fit to drive but i have to if im going to get to inverness in time for the connecting flight andy says looking dubious you sure you know what youre doing covering the story i tell him and grin see you soon i make inverness airport in ninety minutes through showers of hail towed under tall grey clouds sound track by count basic and islams answer to pavarotti in the even more enormous shape of nusrat fateh ali khan voice like a trippedout angel in a dream even though i have no idea what hes singing about and always sneakingly suspect its something on the lines of hey lets string up salman rushdie yeahyeah the tickets waiting for me at the desk im still officially on holiday so i force myself not to read any newspapers i think about buying some fags but the headaches still there behind my eyes and i have the feeling smoking a cigarette would make me want to throw up of course what i really need is something chemical and crystalline but i dont have any and wouldnt know where to start looking for it in inverness i feel the need to do something so i buy a dumb little handheld game and sit playing it while i wait the flights delayed but only slightly i change at gatwick in breezy sunshine and the touches down on jersey in relatively balmy conditions i even manage to hire a car with the credit card which seems like a blessing the nova comes with a map i drive through the neat little lanes and some straighter faster roads feeling even in those few miles that the place is too damn clean and twee and crowded after the west highlands gorey is easy to find out on the east coast looking out over the sands and round to the point where the castle i always thought was in st helier actually is hill street takes a little longer but aspen is conspicuous a long white villa set just below the crest of a low wooded ridge surrounded by white walls with ornamental black railings and little ballhead shrubs standing in wooden tubs terracotta tiled roof it looks cool i imagine its value is probably pretty cool too there are tall black iron gates but theyre hooked open so i just drive through and up a drive of pink bricks to the door i ring the bell and wait there are no other cars in the drive but theres a garage block attached to the house with two double doors the suns dipping down over the trees and a breeze gets up rustling the leaves on the ornamental shrubs and blowing some grit into my left eye making it water again i ring the bell once more i look through the letterbox but i cant see anything i reach in and feel a box on the far side of the thick door after a few minutes i take a look round the place stepping under moorish archways and over low white walls past an astroturf tennis court and a swimming pool about the same size uncovered and still i kneel and test the water with one hand warm i try to look in the windows of the house but theyre either covered with those plastic rolldown external shutters you usually see in france or closed off inside by venetian blinds i go back to the car thinking maybe mr azuls only out for a short while of course maybe ive missed him entirely and hes already set off on whatever trip mr archer seemed to know about ill give it half an hour maybe an hour or so then ill call the local paper and ask for franks contact i consider playing the handheld i bought in inverness but im either not hooked on it yet or my jaded palate has produced gameboredom already im thinking there might be something wrong with my plan to wait as i close my eyes only to rest them but even as i yawn and put my hands into my armpits i think a spot of rest isnt such a bad idea so long as i dont fall asleep andy runs out across the ice i am five years old and he is seven strathspeld is everywhere white the sky is still and shining hiding the sun in a dazzling brilliant haze its light somehow distanced by the intervening layer of high cloud overlooking a chill wilderness of snow the mountaintops are smothered black crags violent spattered marks against that blankness the hills and forests are blanketed too the trees are frosted and the loch is hard and soft together iced over then snowed upon here beyond the gardens of the lodge and the woods and ornamental ponds the loch narrows and becomes a river again bending and funnelling and quickening as it heads towards the rocks and falls and the shallow gorge beyond usually from here you can hear the thunder of the falls in the distance but today there is only silence i watch andy run out i shout after him but i dont follow him the bank on this side is low only half a metre above the white plain of the snowcovered river the grass and reeds around me are flattened under the sudden overnight fall of snow on the far side where andy is heading the bank is tall and steep where the water has cut into the hill removing sand and gravel and stones and leaving an overhang of earth and exposed dangling treeroots the dark gravel space under that ragged overhang is the only place i can see where there is no snow andy is yelling as he runs coattails flapping out behind him gloved hands outspread his head thrown back the ear flaps on his hat snapping and clapping like wings hes almost halfway across and suddenly i go from being terrified and annoyed to being exhilarated intoxicated overjoyed we were told not to do this told not to come here told to sledge and throw snowballs and make snowmen all we wanted but not even to come near the loch and the river in case we fell through the ice and yet andy came here after wed sledged for a while on the slope near the farm walked down here through the woods despite my protests and then when we got here to the river bank i said well as long as we only looked but then andy just whooped and jumped down onto the boulderlumped white slope of shore and sprinted out across the pure flat snow towards the far bank at first i was angry at him frightened for him but now suddenly i get this rush of joy watching him race out there into the cold level space of the stilled river free and warm and vivacious in that smoothed and frozen silence i think hes done it i think hes across the river and safe and theres a buzzy glow of vicarious accomplishment starting to well up within me but then theres a cracking noise and he falls i think hes tripped and fallen forward but he isnt lying flat on the snow hes sunk up to his waist in it and theres a pool of darkness spreading on the whiteness around him as he struggles trying to lever himself out and i cant believe this is happening cant believe andy isnt going to jump free im yelling in fear now shouting his name screaming out to him he struggles turning round as he sinks deeper chunks and edges of ice rearing into the air and making little puffs and fountains of snow as he tries to find purchase and push himself out hes calling out to me now but i can hardly hear him because im screaming so hard wetting my pants as i squeeze the screams out hes holding his hand out to me yelling at me but im stuck there terrified screaming and i dont know what to do cant think what to do even while hes yelling at me to help him come out to him get a branch but im petrified at the thought of setting foot on that white treacherous surface and i cant imagine finding a branch cant think what to do as i look one way towards the tall trees above the hidden gorge and the other along the shore of the loch towards the boathouse but there are no branches theres only snow everywhere and then andy stops struggling and slips under the whiteness i stand still quietened and numbed i wait for him to come back up but he doesnt i step back then turn and run the clinging wetness round my thighs going from warm to cold as i race beneath the snowshrouded trees towards the house i run into the arms of andys parents walking with the dogs near the ornamental ponds and it seems like an age before i can tell them whats happened because my voice wont work and i can see the fear in their eyes and theyre asking where is andrew where is andrew and eventually i can tell them and mrs gould gives a strange little shuddering cry and mr gould tells her to get the people in the house and phone for an ambulance and runs away down the path towards the river with the four golden labradors barking excitedly behind him i run to the house with mrs gould and we get everybody my mum and dad and the other guests to come down to the river my father carries me in his arms at the riverside we can see mr gould on his stomach out on the ice pushing himself back from the hole in the river people are shouting and running around we head down the river towards the narrows and the gorge and my father slips and almost drops me and his breath smells of whisky and food then somebody calls out and they find andy round the bend in the river down where the water reappears from a crust of ice and snow and swirls lowered and reduced round the rocks and wedged treetrunks before the lip of the falls which sound muted and distant today even this close andys there caught between a snowcovered treetrunk and an icedover rock his face bluewhite and quite still his father splashes deep into the water and pulls him out i start crying and bury my face in my fathers shoulder the village doctor was one of the house guests he and andys father hold the boy up letting water drain from his mouth then lay him down on a coat on the snow the doctor presses on andys chest while his wife breathes into the boys mouth they look more surprised than anybody when his heart restarts and then he makes a gurgling noise in his throat andy is wrapped in the coat and rushed to the house submerged to the neck in a warm bath and given oxygen when the ambulance arrives hed been under the ice under the water for ten minutes or more the doctor had heard about children usually younger than andy surviving without air in cold water but never seen anything like it andy recovered quickly sucking on the oxygen coughing and spluttering in the warm bath then being dried and taken to a warmed bed and watched over by his parents the doctor was worried about brain damage but andy seemed just as bright and intelligent afterwards as hed been before remembering details from earlier in his childhood and performing above average in the memory tests the doctor gave him and even doing well in school when that started again after the winter break it was a miracle his mother said and the local newspaper agreed andy and i never did get properly told off for what happened and he hardly ever mentioned that day to me unless he had to his father didnt like talking about it much either and used to be slightly dismissive and jokey about it all mrs gould gradually talked less about it eventually it seemed it was only i who ever thought about that still cold morning recalling in my dreams that cry and that hand held out to me for help i could not would not give and the silence that followed andy disappearing under the ice and sometimes i felt he was different and had changed even though i knew people changed all the time and people our age changed faster than most even so i thought on occasion there had been a loss nothing necessarily to do with oxygen starvation but just as a result of the experience the shock of his cold journey slipping away beneath the grey lid of ice and perhaps i told myself in later years it was only a loss of ignorance a loss of folly and so no bad thing but i could never again imagine him doing something as spontaneously crazy as aggressively contemptuously fatetempting and unleashed as running out across the frozen ice arms out laughing youre already wearing your moustache and wig and glasses and you have clipon sunshades over the lenses because it is quite a bright day you ring the doorbell watching down the drive for any cars while you pull on your leather gloves youre sweating and nervous and you know youre out on a limb here youre in the process of taking some terrible risks and the luck the flow that comes from being justified and in tune and not taking too much for granted not being contemptuous or disrespectful of fate all thats in danger here because youre pushing the envelope youre maybe relying on one or two too many things going perfectly even getting it all set up to get you this far may have taxed your fortune to the limit already and theres still a long way to go but if youre going to fail youll do it fullface on not flinching not whining youve done more than you thought youd ever get away with and so in a sense its all gain from here in fact its been all gain for some time and so you cant complain and you dont intend to if fate deserts you now he comes to the door just like that no servants no security phone and that by itself gives you the green light you havent the time for any finessing so you just kick him in the balls and follow him inside as he collapses foetal on the floor you close the door take off your glasses because your vision is so distorted and kick him in the head far too softly then still not hard enough as he scrabbles round on the floor one hand at his crotch and the other at his head making a spitting wheezing noise you kick him again this time he goes limp you dont think youve killed him or severed his spine or anything but if you have that cant be helped you make sure he cant be seen from the letter flap which is covered by a sealed box then you look round the hall golf umbrella you take that still nobody coming you walk quickly through see the kitchen and go in there pulling down the venetian blinds you find a breadknife but you keep the umbrella too you find some tape in a kitchen drawer and go back to the front hall turning him round so that youre between him and the door you tie his hands and wrists together hes wearing expensivelooking slacks and a silk shirt crocodile slipons and monogrammed socks manicure and a scent that you dont recognise hair looks slightly damp you take off both his shoes and stuff both socks into his mouth theyre silk too so they ball up very small you tape his mouth closed put the roll of tape in one pocket then leave him there to search the rest of the house pulling down the blinds in each room as you go in the kitchen again you find the door to the cellar on the first floor you hear music and the sounds of water you creep along to an open doorway bedroom probably the master bedroom brass bed huge maybe even goldplated disturbed bedclothes broad sunlit balcony beyond windows and pastelpink vertical blinds the sounds are coming from the ensuite bathroom you go into the bedroom checking the position of the mirrors none of them ought to show you to anybody in the bathroom youre listening as you approach the bathroom door the music is loud its a eurythmics song called sweet dreams are made of this a power cable stretches from a socket in the wall into the bathroom thats interesting the voice sings along with the song then turns into a hum your heart sinks you were hoping he was alone in the house you look through the crack at the door hinge the bathroom is big in one corner there is a sunken jacuzzi with a young person in it moving sinuously in the bubbling waters caucasian with short black hair you cant tell whether the person is male or female the research you did on mr azul didnt cover his sexuality the ghettoblaster lies less than a metre away from the lip of the jacuzzi there is at least another couple of metres of flex coiled on the floor the young man or woman sings along with the song again again putting their head back as they do so probably female neck smooth no real adams apple you look again at that power cable your mouth is dry what to do it could be so quick so easy and it would simplify things so much it is almost as though fate is saying look ive made it easy for you just get on with it do it whoever or whatever they are theyre associating with this man and if they dont know what he does then they should but youre not sure this violates the code this goes against what you originally decided were your operational parameters there have to be rules laws for everything after all there are even rules for war maybe this is fate testing you offering you a litmus test an apparently simple way round a problem that will prove you find you out if you take the easy way you will have failed and nothing will save you then not your skill not your determination or righteousness and not your luck because that will have turned against you the young person in the tub looks happy enough for now you go to the bed put down the umbrella and start looking in the drawers and cupboards built into the wall units surrounding the head of the bed you keep glancing to the bathroom door the drawers slide smoothly in and out without a sound one of the perks of picking on the welloff rather than the chipboard classes you find a gun smith c wesson loaded box of fifty rounds you permit yourself an almost inaudible sigh and grin to yourself you lay the knife beside the umbrella heft the gun and put it under the duvet to click the safety off peek in the drawer again no silencer that would be too much to ask for but then in another drawer you find something maybe even more useful you stare at the gear in the drawer a glow in your belly spreading through you you have made the right choice and you are being rewarded you glance over the thick tubes that make up the emperorsize brass bedstead and smile you take the bondage hood out of the drawer it zips up the back and its only feature is a noseshaped crease with a couple of little nostril slits at the base you take out your penknife and cut a couple of eyeholes continually glancing at the bathroom door you try the hood on then take it off and slit some more leather off the eyeholes you put it on again zipping it up halfway at the back it smells of sweat and that scent mr azul favours you take one of the pairs of handcuffs from the drawer and go into the bathroom pointing the gun at the figure in the tub jem she says what are you you decide to use your michael caine voice it doesnt sound very much like michael caine but then it doesnt sound like your own voice either and thats all that matters its not fucking loverboy dear now get out of the fucking bath and do as youre told and you wont get hurt its not too bad the mask helps disguise your voice too she stares at you mouth open its a bad time for the doorbell to go but thats what happens she looks past you make a noise darling you say quietly and youre fucking history understand the doorbell goes again the eurythmics song finishes and you put a foot on the ghettoblasters power cable and drag it smartly across the bathroom tiles pulling the lead from the back of the machine you half expect the next song to start anyway because there are batteries in it but instead silence the girl stares at you you watch her it all feels strangely academic as though you dont really care what happens next if she does make a noise you probably wont shoot her and anyway theres a chance she couldnt make enough of a noise to be heard outside the front door its a big house and although there are a lot of hard soundreflective surfaces in it youre not convinced a scream would make it all the way to whoevers outside either down the stairwell or through the doubleglazed balcony windows plus of course you might have time to get over to her and hit her knock her out before she could even gather a decent breath but its dangerous edgeworking stuff and youd rather not have to think about that the doorbell doesnt go a third time you pull a towelling robe from the back of the door and throw it at her she half catches it as it lands to one side of the jacuzzi right put that on now come on you expect her to crouch and try to put the robe on before shes fully out of the water or to turn her back to you but instead theres something like a sneer on her face as she stands up facing you and wraps the robe around herself with a kind of disdain she has a good body and that single vertical tuft of pubic hair you need if youre a model or the possessor of a highcut swimsuit she puts her head back with a nervous resigned sigh when you put the gun to her head but she doesnt try anything as you cuff her hands behind her back you tape her mouth then you walk her down to the kitchen and down into the cellar as you pass through the hall you notice that mr azul is just where you left him the cellar provides lots of rope you tape her fingers together and then tie her sitting on the floor to a stout wooden workbench you remove anything sharp from the workbench surface and check theres nothing within reach of her legs you take some of the rope with you you go back up to mr azul and hes gone you go stupid on yourself for a moment as the luck wobbles threatens to fly away and leave you you stare at the place where he was lying curled up tied up in front of the door you stare at the empty stretch of carpet dumbly as if staring will help then you turn and run into the main lounge hes there still curled up and still secured by the tape but he must have wriggled his way through to here while you were down in the cellar hes knocked over a table with the phone on it and hes just turning the phone the right way up as you enter the lounge and see him he wriggles getting his face over the buttons on the base of the phone he stabs at the buttons three times then wriggles over to the handset and makes muffled shouts through the gag until you cock the gun and he hears it and looks round at where you stand next to the wall waving the telephones wallplug you haul him upstairs and throw him on the bed he struggles and tries to shout its getting dark so you turn the pink pastel vertical blinds closed and pull the curtains before putting on the lights mr azul screams through his silk socks and maskingtape you hit him hes only groggy not out but youre able to secure him to the bed with the other set of handcuffs and the leather straps from the same drawer the hood came from youre satisfied hes tightly held the bed is sturdy and the straps are supple but quite thick they fit perfectly he struggles a little then you take the rope you brought from the cellar and measure out four lengths cutting them with your penknife you tie one length round mr azuls upper right arm as close to his armpit as possible over his silk shirt you kneel on the bed and haul with all your might and the rope bites deep into the sheen of the pale silk shirt mr azul cries out behind his gag a strangled anguished shriek you do the same to his other arm you tie his legs too fitting the rope up to his crotch and tying it tight bunching the fabric of the slacks mr azul bucks up and down on the bed in a bizarre parody of sexual energy his eyes are popping and sweat stands out on his skin his face is going red as his heart struggles to pump blood down arteries blocked off by the ropes then you take out the little plastic box from your jacket and show him the syringe needle hes still bucking up and down and hes shaking his head too now and youre not sure he understands but it doesnt matter all that much you prick him once on each arm and leg this is a refinement you thought of only recently and are quietly proud of it means that even if he is discovered in time before necrosis sets in he will be hivpositive you leave him there and go down to check the woman is all right mr azuls screams sound harsh and hoarse and far away its sunset when you leave locking the quiet house securely behind you the sun flames orange and pink behind the trees above the house the breeze is cool rather than cold scented with flowers and the sea and you think what a pleasant if rather bland place this would be to settle down i jolt awake with a bad taste in my mouth and my left eyelid stuck down again its almost dark i look at my watch where the fuck is this guy i take another look round the house no lights back in the car i try to use the mobile but the batteries are flat and the nova doesnt seem to have a cigarette lighter i head for st helier shit ive just tried the local newspaper but franks pal has gone out and they wont give me a contact number im standing in a phone box near the harbour i watch a white lamborghini countach trundle past on the street outside and shake my head in disbelief a lambo more than two metres broad and barely one high just the car to have on an island full of lots of narrow highhedged twisty roads and a milesperhour speed limit i wonder if he ever gets the beast out of second gear maybe i should phone the police hello hello ive just spotted a cretin recklessly in charge of an obscene amount of money is there a reward tempting every bastards out frank isnt at home azuls unlisted i try the local paper here but they cant or wont help and the airlines refuse to give out information on passengers i put the phone down shit i shout it sounds very loud in the phone box i phone yvonne and williams house but theres only williams voice on the answermachine i remember yvonne saying something about being away on a job for the next few days i think about phoning her mobile but she hates me doing that so i dont oh bugger this if i was some fucking private eye or something id head back out to mr azuls big house and break in somehow and find something really interesting or a body or a beautiful woman or just get slugged on the back of the head and wake up wisecracking but im tired ive still got a headache i feel beat and out of ideas and i feel embarrassed dammit what in the fuck am i doing here what was i thinking of hell this seemed like such a good idea this morning i can still make a flight back to blighty which will connect with the last plane to inverness forget covering the story sometimes a tactical retreat is the only course to follow even saint hunter would agree if i feel the need to do something i can always exercise my creative abilities trying to think of a story thatll appease eddie fat chance i take the noya back to the airport an hour to kill time to hit the bar i start off with a bloody mary as this is breakfast in a sense then cleanse the palate with a bottle of pils i buy a packet of silk cut and carefully smoke a cigarette making sure that im actually enjoying it not just doing it out of habit while managing to fit in a couple of large and very refreshing gts before the flights called and theres just time for a single knockedback whisky to provide a bit of nominal support for the scottish export drive i board the plane feeling no pain eat the evening meal and continue with the gt theme land in gatwick and make the connection via the smoking area of the bar and another gulped gordons then pass on the second offered dinner but not the accompanying booze and quietly pass out somewhere over the west midlands to be woken by a dishy blonde with an impudent dimpled smile and were here weve landed weve arrived were on the stand at the airport and id ask her what shes doing later because im drunk enough to not care when she says no as she probably will but i know im too tired and besides my left eyelids stuck again and i suspect it makes me look a bit like quasimodo so i dont say anything except uh thanks which is cool or sad im not sure which i walk into the terminal thinking well at least there isnt that smell of sewage around you sometimes get when you arrive in dear old embra im not sure i could handle that right now i walk through the lounge thinking something looks wrong somehow then stop and stand still where the lounge opens out into the main terminal building suddenly filled with horror and confusion its all too small and not shaped right this isnt edinburgh those amiable but blatantly incompetent buffoons have brought me to the wrong fucking airport dickheads cant they even navigate for fucks sake christ i bet there isnt even a flight back from where the hell am i i see the sign saying welcome to inverness just as i remember where i left the car and where i left from this morning and just before i turn and stamp to the nearest desk and demand in my highest dudgeon to be taken to edinburgh on a charted lear if necessary or limoed immediately to the higheststarred hotel within a reasonable radius for a free overnight dinner bed and breakfast and unlimited bar tab narrow escape from terminal embarrassment people are walking past looking at me oddly i shake my head and set a course for the car park its kind of late now and im in no condition to drive so when i get the i only take it as far as the outskirts of inverness where i stop at the first lit bed and breakfast sign i see and talk politely and slowly to the pleasant middleaged couple from glasgow who run the place and then say goodnight close the door of my room and fall fast asleep on the bed without even taking off my jacket chapter friendly fire i head south after what i thinks called a hearty breakfast and an even heartier cough i fuel up at a wee petrol station just before the a and phone fettes while the tanks filling sergeant flavell sounds a little odd when i talk to him and tell him ive been to jersey for the day but im on my way back to edinburgh i ask him if i can have my new laptop back and he says he isnt sure he suggests i come straight to fettes they want to talk to me i say okay south on the a sound track michelle shocked the pixies carter and shakespears sister i catch a bit of radio while im changing cassettes just north of perth and hear something called ill sleep when im dead by bon jovi which isnt a patch on uncle warrens song of the same name and makes me more than reasonably annoyed into edinburgh by late lunchtime past the signs trumpeting the upcoming eurosummit i dont know how theyve done it but the typography on the signs makes me want to pronounce the word edinburg and i live in the place for gods sake christ in a bucket independent bastarding deterrent the genuine shit article cold fucking filtering edinburg edinborow sleep when im a derigueurly longhaired whiteskinned headbanging highpitched middleaged subgrunge lightmetal zepclone what a pile of shit everything is on ferry road within sight of fettes schools preposterous spire and only minutes from the police hq i have the first cigarette of the day not because i really want it just to feel bad uncle warren knows a thing or two this turns out to be smart thinking in a way because when i get to cop central they promptly arrest me the hotel is dark and very quiet the cellars are full of junk most of which might have been useful once but all of which is now covered in water or mud or fungus some of the timbers under the floor are white with fuzzy rot on the lower ground floor you pass through the snooker room the ballroom and a store room the table in the snooker room is waterlogged its baize stained and its wooden sides cracked the old motorbikes tables chairs and carpets in the ballroom look like forlorn toys in some longneglected dolls house rain beats softly against the windows the only sound outside it is black dark the stairs from here to the top floor stretch upwards around the dilapidated grandeur of the stairwell on the next floor up the reception area is dusty and bare the bar smells of sour booze and stale cigarette smoke and the empty dining room is redolent of dampness and decay the kitchen is cold and hollow and echoing there is one old domestic stove powered by bottled gas and one sink theres an apron hanging on a nail you take the apron and put it on the next two floors hold bedrooms there is dampness here too and in some of the rooms the ceiling has fallen in the plaster and lath lying draped over the heavy oldfashioned furniture like some clumsy travesty of a dustsheet the rain is hitting the windows harder now and the wind is getting up whistling through cracks in the panes and the windowframes the top floor feels a little less damp a little more warm though the wind and rain still sound loud outside and above at one end of the dark corridor past the wedgedopen fire door a door lies ajar the living room inside is lit by the remains of a log fire collapsing now into ashes a couple of logs lie on the hearth drying and the air smells of their pine scent and cigarette smoke an old coal scuttle to the side of the fireplace holds a can of paraffin almost full in the corner of the room the dumb waiter contains a selection of logs of various sizes most of them still damp you take the biggest of the logs which is about the size of a mans arm and walk softly across the room to the bedroom door you go through and stand listening to the rain and the wind and just audible the noise of a man breathing slowly and rhythmically in the bed you hold the log out in front of you as you walk towards the bed he moves in the darkness something you hear more than see you stop and stand still then the man in the bed starts to snore rain drums on the window you smell whisky and old tobacco smoke you get to the bedside and raise the log over your head you hold it there this is different somehow this is somebody you know but you cant think about that because that isnt the point although you know it does matter you cant allow it to matter you cant let something like that stop you you bring the log down with all your might it hits his head and you dont hear the noise it makes because you cry out at the same time as though its you in the bed you being attacked you being killed theres a terrible sucking bubbling noise from the figure in the bed you raise the log and bring it down again calling out once more the man in the bed doesnt move or make a sound you turn on the torch there is a lot of blood it looks red where it seeps into the white sheets black where it quietly pools you take the apron off and cover his shoulders and head with it then you go downstairs to get the gas bottle out of the old stove in the kitchen the twicesoaked bed linen lights quickly paraffin overcoming blood you leave the gas bottle on the floor at the foot of the bed and walk quickly away along the shorter length of corridor and step through the emergency exit out into the loud darkness of the night you run down the metal fire escape on the gable end of the building you stop at the top of the road and look back to see the flames just starting to become visible over the edge of the hotel roof dancing orange into the night maybe you hear the gas bottle explode a couple of minutes and a couple of miles later when youre on the lochside road heading away but its blowing quite hard by then and youre not sure its been three days now im not sure though i could be wrong because i havent slept very well i have nightmares of a man and they think its me but it isnt is it is it im starting to wonder he has a gorilla mask on and he talks with the voice of a baby and he has a huge syringe and im tied to the seat screaming i cant take it they keep questioning me always asking where i was what i did why i did it did all of them where i was who i was with who am i trying to kid why dont i just admit i did it well if i didnt do all these things who did im in london im in the nick im in fucking paddington green for christs sake the highsecurity station they use for the proves and they think im so dangerous so much a security risk theyve got me here and even holding me under the prevention of terrorism act jesus god because some of them still arent convinced they arent dealing with some unholy alliance of the ira welsh nationalists and uppity jocks they brought me down that day from edinburgh bundled me into a transit van with seats but no windows handcuffed to a big quiet london lad who wouldnt talk to me at all and didnt even say much to the other two cops in the back of the transit just sat staring ahead and we seemed to drive all night just stopping once at some service station on the ml took a while to arrange everything then they came in with a selection of cans of soft drinks and sandwiches and pasties and pork pies and chocolate and we all sat there munching then they asked me did i need the toilet and i said yes and they opened the door and it was straight over the grass into the gents toilets two cops guarding the door and some men looked like truckers standing watching me waiting for their turn after id had my private visit only wanted a pee but i couldnt do it even though the big lad wasnt actually watching just having him standing there handcuffed to me was enough so they checked the stalls and then took the cuffs off me and i had to leave the door open a crack while i went then back out and i see the other cop cars christ a range rover and a senator too im a fucking vip then its into the van and on with the journey to london where the questioning starts theyre concentrating on sir rufuss murder for now because they found a card a fucking business card in the woods near the burned cottage not mine that would have been too obvious but a card from a guy i know on janes defence weekly with some scribbled notes on the back ctrl alt pov chnge shft alt chn of cmnd zoom bounces milk cheez bred shavng foam they ask me is that your writing and it is of course it is those are despot control codes from when the computers mouse was misbehaving and thats the way i always spell when i do a shopping list i vaguely recall writing down the codes months ago and losing whatever it was i wrote them on i stare at the muddied warped little card sealed in a dealsized plastic bag recognising my own writing and feeling my mouth go even drier than it already is and i can only gibber something about well it looks like my writing but i mean and anyway somebody anybody could have taken that i mean but they just look quietly pleased and the questions go on and all i can think is dont confess dont confess dont confess there are detectives and dcis and chief supers and commanders every fucking where more tecs and cid guys and antiterrorism squad chaps and regional guys than you can shake a nightstick at all asking questions all asking the same fucking questions and me trying to give the same fucking answers seeing di mcdunn sucking saliva through his teeth and letting me share his bhs is like meeting an old pal even though hes got all his questions too its a relief when the terrorist squad boys seem to lose interest but that still leaves all the rest and i cant think i cant think straight i cant sleep its bad enough at first but then it gets worse even as they keep me because they found more they found two more and that was while i was here for christs sake while they held me while things were still happening more stuff came in while they were questioning me and they looked at me with disbelief horror disgust and i was going what what is it now what what am i supposed to have done now and they told me about azul in jersey and before that i think it was before that they showed me the forensic photographs of all of them bissett skewered on the railings grotesque and spread and limp the bloodsmeared vibrator used on the retired judge jamieson the drained shapeless white body of persimmon tied to his grid above a pool of blood then nothing when there should have been something then what was left of sir rufus carter blackened bones distorted and bent the black skulls jaw hinged down in a blind scream but the flesh all gone very much a dentalrecords job and it was all black the nails the wood and the bones too but its their mouths their jaws i remember their silent screams hanging slack or jammed open and it gets worse because they show me the fucking video they show me the video they think i made or that i think they think i made but i didnt they make me watch it and its horrific theres a man and hes dressed in black or dark blue and he has a gorilla mask on and he keeps sucking on this little bottle hes carrying which must be helium because it gives him that baby voice disguising his own voice and he has this fat little guy strapped to a chrome seat his mouth taped one arm tied down onto the arm of the chair shirt rolled up and the little guys shrieking as hard as he can but it sounds quiet because the noise is having to come down his nose while the man in the gorilla mask looks from the camera to the guy in the seat and holds up this huge fucking syringe like something from a nightmare from an old movie from a horror film and i can feel my heart beating wildly because thats what this is this is a horror movie a fucking horror movie this lunatic is making his own horror film and you cant even tell yourself hell its only a story arent the special effects good it isnt real because thats exactly what it is and the gorilla man is explaining in that hideous highpitched babys voice what he has in this bottle and in this syringe and i throw up halfway through but they pause the video for me after its over we cut to another scene and theres somebody who might be the little guy again and hes still strapped to a chair but this time its a tall hospital chair with wheels and a little foldaway table in front of him and the straps holding his torso would be easy to undo but his hands are limp theres some sort of board behind his head and a towel or something round his forehead holding his head upright but the eyes christ the eyes theres nothing there and mcdunn says persistent vegetative state they call it apparently persistent vegetative state and it looks it man it looks it and then of course there are the other two first its azul and his girlfriend shes traumatised and dehydrated but otherwise unharmed but hes got soul brothers limbs where his own ought to be necrosis like frostbite blooddeath at the extremities but the extremities start at shoulder and groin hes alive but if you were him youd rather not be arms salesman okay the avenger the equaliser the total fucking nutter went for the legs too but still and the editor spiked and the rapist lenient judge raped and the pornographer poisoned and stroked and the man who was so callous about the bloodshed in the iraniraq war forced to watch his penned animals die like cattle like soldiers like cattle and then bled to death in his own private fountains of blood and the businessman who put profits before safety and not only helped kill a thousand people but then tried to get out of paying the survivors and dependants any compensation gets his own gas explosion blevey is the technical term apparently and fuck me whoever he is assuming he is a he hes got a sense of humour or at least irony why hes produced whats almost a snuff video effectively a snuff video if you mean braindeath anyway its the closest anyone will admit to ever having seen or found one even the obscene pubs squad whove been looking for years but although everybody assumes they exist nobodys ever seen one until old gorilla man comes along and just makes his own specifically to warn off any other porn merchants thinking of dealing in snuff its hilarious its really ironic and you explain all this to mcdunn and you laugh because it actually isnt the fault of the police youre not sleeping its the nightmares where youre stalked by a gorilla with the voice of a baby and a huge syringe and he wants to fuck you with it isnt that hilarious you cant sleep youre actually providing your own sleep deprivation and you say hey next thing you know i really will be falling down the stairs but he doesnt seem to get the joke and then its back to the cell and then the interview room with the barred opaqued windows so you cant see out and they switch on the tapemachine recording everything as usual and its getting more bizarre they get me to do a michael caine voice they ask me to impersonate michael fucking caine can you believe that and then theres this technician or something here and they ask me to breathe in helium from a mask and make me repeat some of the things gorilla man said on the video so i feel like im becoming him theyre trying to make me him i dont think i sound the same as the guy on the brainsnuff video but fuck knows what they think there are too many to know what the fuck they think loads of them officers from all over the fucking place with different accents london midlands welsh scottish elsewhere god knows its not just flavell and mcdunn though i still see them now and again especially mcdunn who looks at me kind of weird most of the time like he cant really believe it was me did all these things and i get this bizarre feeling that he thinks im kind of pathetic i mean that in a grudging stilldeterminedtobustthefucker way he actually has more respect for gorilla man than he does for me because ive just gone to pieces under the questions and the things they put in my head with those photographs and that video ha which means gorilla man has already put stuff into my head already has fucked my brains filling my head with the idea of that the vision the meme of that and i thought i was some tough cookie but i was wrong im just a dunked digestive baby im soft im flopping im disintegrating and thats why unless im the best fucking actor hes ever seen mcdunn cant accept i was capable of the things gorilla man did yet so much of the evidence especially the dates and times that sort of stuff points at me not to mention that piece of tvcrit i did that reads like a hitlist now and it just goes on keeps going on another night another nightmare and then back to the interview room again and the tape machine again and more questions about stromefirrynofirry and jersey and flights and thats when they tell me about the other one thats when they say oh by the way your best friend andy is dead blown up in the hotel when it burned down probably beaten to death first head stoved in but of course you probably know all that because you did that too didnt you i lied about something earlier i told it the way it felt not as it actually was or the way it feels and actually is whatever andy yvonne hi she says shaking his hand and thats william out there i tell andy with the big sword andy turns and watches william william masked clad in white grasping his sabre and suddenly lunging forward one leg darting ahead his opponent jumps back and tries to fend off the blows with his own sabre but hes offbalance and william presses forward swinging the sabre in a hacking sweeping motion whacking the edge of the heavy curved blade into the side of his opponents torso aw rats the other guy says as william stands back relaxing they take off their masks and william conies over to us mask under his arm sabre hanging from his hand his face red and sheened with sweat glistening in the sports halls brilliant lights i introduce him and andy andy with his short hair and his blazer and neatly creased jeans face handsome but a little spotty expression slightly disdainful and wary hes twentyone two years older than us but william looks the more confident and assured hi william says tossing back some blond hair fallen over his forehead so youre cams soldier boy andy smiles thinly you must be willy is it i sigh id hoped these two would get on yvonne taps william on the shoulder with her mask shes been fencing too her long black hair tied back from her face her face bright with sweat i think she looks like some italian princess daughter of an ancient minor house with no real pretensions but still casually opulent huge faded villas in rome and on the grand canal and in the tuscan hills shower she tells him we have to get stuff ready for tonight she smiles at me quick drink in the bar ten minutes great i say andy is silent yvonne turns to him coming to the party yes he says if thats all right of course she smiles ah hot hot hot what took the hot chilli crunched on a whole fucking green chilli ha yvonne says fanning her mouth and hanging onto my arm woof thanks she reaches into my vodka and lemonade and hoiks out an ice cube here she says thickly handing a joint while she rolls the ice cube round in her mouth and tries to breathe through it at the same time im grinning widely at her shes frowning hurtfully at me andy is at my side but then ducks away into the throng the music is loud the campus flat packed with people its a warm may evening the exams are over and everybodys partying the windows are open to the night spilling the sound of the pretenders first album out over the slope of grass towards the small loch and the lights of the library and admin buildings on the far side ah my mouth yvonne says she slaps me on the shoulder look more sympathetic you pig she tells me her eyes are watering sorry andy comes back with a glass of milk here he says offeri it to yvonne she looks at him he nods at her mouth ice wont work he tells her the the stuff that causes the heat in chillis and i smile because i just know from the way he phrased that that he knows the technical term but doesnt want to appear too smartalec isnt soluble in water but it is soluble in fat try it itll work yvonne looks round i offer my hand and she slips the remains the ice cube delicately into my palm then sips the milk i shrug and put the lozenge of ice back into my drink yvonne finishes the milk she nods that is better thanks andy gives a small smile takes the empty glass from her and heads back through the crowds to the kitchen hoo yvonne says dabbing at her cheeks with a tissue she glances after andy so boy scouts have their uses after all ask him to show you his swiss army knife later i laugh feeling a little treacherous yvonnes wearing a black scoopnecked tshirt and a simple black anklelength wrap skirt her hair is tied back from her face and held by a long white lacy ribbon but tumbles down loose behind her arms look firm and muscled and her tanned breasts are full and high nipples producing little bumps on the black cotton of the tshirt the final effect is perversely exotic and i feel my usual pang of jealousy i glance into my glass and hand her back the j her eyes close as she draws on it and i put my lips to my glass slipping that suckedon sliver of ice into my own mouth and rolling it around there pretending its her tongue but it was true labour wasnt working wasnt producing the profits the capitalists want to see you mean the implication of the ad was that labour had produced mass unemployment and the tories would cure it not only have they made it worse they knew they would even if they genuinely thought their policies were somehow better for britain as a whole they knew damn well theyd put hundreds of thousands of people out of work and saatchi saatchi must have known that too if theyd bothered to think it was a lie it was an election william says looking tired whats that got to do with it i exclaim it was still a lie it doesnt matter and anyway its just a shortterm thing they will produce more jobs eventually theyre just getting rid of the dead wood at the moment therell be new jobs in new growth industries bullshit even you dont believe that william laughs you dont know what i believe but if that ad helped win the election for maggie thats fine by me ah come on alls fair in love and war cameron you should stop whingeing and start trying to make things work all is not fair in love and war havent you heard of the geneva convention if yvonne fell in love with somebody else would you kill both of them fucking right william says matteroffactly as andy appears at our sides holding a can of lager somebody passes him a j but he just hands it on to me william shakes his head you get this all the time too he asks andy what oh this continual earbending about the tories and what beastly cheats they are all the time andy smiles they lied to get in i say theyll lie to try and stay in how can you trust them i trust them to try and sort out the unions william says it was time for a change andy says country needs a kick up the fucking bum william agrees defiantly im horrified i am surrounded by selfish bastards i thought were my friends i say slapping my forehead with the hand holding the j and almost setting my hair alight this is awful andy nods he drinks from his can and looks at me over the top of it i voted tory he says quietly andy i say appalled almost despairing shock therapy he grins more at william than me how could you i shake my head and pass the number to william andy looks exaggeratedly thoughtful it was that advert that did it i think dont know if you know the one labour isnt working it said great political advert succinct memorable effective even mildly witty ive got a poster copy of that in my room back at st andys did you ever see that advert at all william william nods watching me and grinning i am trying not to overreact but its difficult very fucking funny andy i say andy looks at me oh cameron come on his voice pitched somewhere between sympathy and exasperation it happened accept it it might all end up better than you hoped tell that to the fucking unemployed i say moving away towards the kitchen i hesitate either of you two tory bastards need a drink im lying awake in my room in the flat i share a floor down from william and yvonnes took some speed a friend turned up with so i cant get to sleep stomach a bit churny too too many voddies and lemonades probably and the punch at the party was evil the flat i share looks in the opposite direction to theirs across the access road and the lawns to the old estate wall and the tall old trees rising on the ridge beyond the window is open and i can hear the sound of the wind in the branches it will be dawn soon i hear the front door of the flat open and close then a few seconds later the door to my room opens my heart beats hard a dark figure kneels at my bedside and i can smell perfume cameron she says quietly yvonne i whisper she puts her hand behind my head then her lips to mine im in the middle of the kiss before it occurs to me i might be dreaming but i know immediately im not i put one hand to the back of her neck then to her shoulder she shrugs off her dressinggown and slips into the little single bed beside me warm and naked and already wet she makes love quickly strongly almost silently i try to keep quiet too and because i had a quick quiet wank earlierdont come too quickly she gives a brief cutoff little cry like a chirp as she comes and sinks her teeth into my shoulder it is quite sore she lies on top of me breathing hard head on my shoulder for a few minutes then she stirs pulls herself up so that i flop out of her and her hard little nipples stroke my chest she puts her lips to my ear taking advantage of you cameron she purrs barely audible hey i whisper im a man of easy virtue william drank too much fell asleep at a really frustrating point ahhah well any time mmhmm this never happened all right between these four walls she kisses me then shes out slipping on the dressinggown and padding away and clicking the door closed behind her i can hear gentle snoring coming from the room next to mine one of my flatmates the only extra soundproofing on the breeze blocks between his room and mine is a couple of layers of paint which is probably why yvonne was being quiet i lift my head up and look down to the floor at the foot of the bed where andy is lying curled up in his sleeping bag unseen in the shadows which is why i was being quiet andy i whisper very quietly thinking that maybe he slept through it all lucky fucking bastard he says in a normal voice i lie back laughing silently i can feel blood on my shoulder where her teeth broke the skin another morning another interview interrogation little chat i sit down in the grey plastic chair in the featureless room with mcdunn and a man from the welsh squad a big blond brindle guy in a tight grey suit he has a rugby players neck and steely eyes and huge hands that are clasped on the table lying there like a mace of flesh and bone mcdunns eyes narrow he makes that sucking noise through his teeth what you been doing to your eyes cameron i swallow take a long sigh and look at him crying i tell him he looks surprised the welsh boyo looks to one side crying cameron mcdunn says his dark heavylooking face creasing into a frown i take a deep breath trying to control things you said andy was dead andy gould he was my best friend he was my best friend and i didnt fucking kill him all right mcdunn looks at me as though slightly puzzled the welsh lads got this steady gaze on me like he wants to use my head as a rugby ball another deep breath so ive been grieving for him and another is that all right mcdunn nods slowly slightly a distant look in his eyes like hes not really nodding at what ive just told him hasnt been listening to a word ive said in fact the welsh guy clears his throat and picks up his briefcase he takes out some papers and another tape recorder he passes an a sheet over to me just read out the words on this sheet of paper all right colley i read the words through first looks like its the statement our man phoned in after sir rufus was flamegrilled welsh nationalist extremists apparently claiming responsibility any particular voice i ask michael caine john wayne tom jones lets try your own voice first eh steelyeyes says then well try you with a welsh accent he smiles the way i imagine a prop forward smiles just before he bites your ear off cigarette ta afternoon session mcdunn again mcdunn seems to be settling out as the colley specialist he lights a cigarette for me holding it in his mouth my hands arent shaking so bad right now so maybe this isnt strictly necessary but i dont care he hands the fag to me i take it and it tastes good i cough a bit but it still tastes good mcdunn looks on sympathetically i actually find that i appreciate this i know how theyre supposed to work i know all about the importance attached to establishing a rapport and initiating trust and building confidence and all that shit and im almost flattered they havent done the old goodcop badcop routine though maybe they just dont do that at all any more because everybody knows about it from the tv but i really do feel something for mcdunn hes like my lifeline back to reality my ray of sanity in the nightmare im trying not to get too dependent on him but its hard not to so i say sitting back in the grey plastic seat im wearing a blue prisonissue shirt openneck of course and the jeans i was wearing when they arrested me they dont hug so well without the belt bums a little saggy to tell the truth but fashion isnt my top priority these days well mcdunn says looking at his notebook weve found people who think they remember seeing you in the broughton arms hotel on the night of sunday the twentyfifth of october when sir rufus was murdered good good i nod and the times for you getting down to london for the attack on oliver if you include the times you or whoever were seen in the toilets at tottenham court road are looking very tight there was a delay on all the flights from edinburgh into heathrow that day makes it impossible really great i say rocking back and forward in my seat brilliant unless he says you had a double in edinburgh or a lot of people are lying it means youd have to have an accomplice in london somebody youd hired to ah make the collection mcdunn looks at me levelly i still cant read him im not able to tell whether he thinks this is likely or not whether he thinks this is evidence im not his man or he still thinks i am but i had help well look i say put me on an identity parade now now cameron mcdunn says tolerantly this is something ive suggested before something i keep on suggesting because its all i can think of will the limbless mr azul think im the guy he saw at the front door what about rent boys from the toilets at tcr the cops think im the right build and they suspect gorilla man wears a wig and false moustache sometimes and maybe false teeth too theyve taken some very carefully setup photographs with a big fucking camera and i suspect from an aside or two they probably didnt expect me to understand that these snaps will be the basis for some computer manipulation to see how well i fit the bill anyway the upshot is mcdunn doesnt think its time for a parade yet he looks wise and fatherly and says i dont think we want to be bothered with that do you come on mcdunn give me a shot ill try anything i want out of here mcdunn taps the fag packet round and round on the table a couple of times well thats up to you isnt it cameron eh what do you mean oh hes got me now im interested im leaning forward elbows on table face forward hooked in other words whatever hes going to try and sell me im buying cameron he says like hes just come to some big decision and sucks air through his teeth you know i dont think its you oh great i say and laugh sitting back and looking round the room at the bare paint walls and the constable sitting by the door then what the fuck am i its not just me cameron he says tolerantly you know that then what let me be frank with you cameron oh be as frank as you like detective inspector i dont think its you cameron but i think you know who it is i put my hand to my brow looking down and shaking my head then sigh theatrically and look at him letting my shoulders slump well i dont know who it is mcdunn if i did id tell you no you cant tell me yet mcdunn says quietly and reasonably you know who it is but you dont know that you know i stare at him mcdunns going metaphysical on me oh shit youre saying its somebody i know mcdunn splays one hand smiling smally he chooses to tap his fag packet round and round on the tabletop again rather than speak to me so i say well im not sure about that but its certainly somebody who knows me i mean i think that card with my writing on it proves that or its something to do with those guys in the lake district mcdunn sighs yes the di thinks my theory its the security forces trying to fit me up is pure paranoia no he shakes his head i think it is somebody you know cameron i think its somebody you know well you see i think you know them as well well nearly as well as they know you i think you can tell me who it is i really do you only have to think about it he smiles thats all you have to do for me just think just think i repeat i nod at the di he nods back just think i say again mcdunn nods summer in strathspeld the first really hot day that year air warm and thick with the coconut smell of gorse swathed richly yellow on the hills and the sweet sharpness of pine resin lying dropleted on the rough trunks in thick translucent bubbles insects buzzed and butterflies filled the glades with silent flashes of colour in the fields the corncrake stooped and zoomed its strange percussive call stuttering through the scentladen air andy and i went down by the river and the loch clambering up the rocks upstream then back down watching fish jump lazily out on the calm loch or strike at the insects speckling those flat waters jaws snapping underneath dispatching swallowing leaving ripples we climbed some trees looking for nests but didnt find any we took off our shoes and socks and waded among the rushes surrounding the hidden scalloped bay where the stream draining the ornamental pond near the house splashed down to the loch a hundred metres up the shore from the old boathouse we were allowed to take the boat out ourselves by then as long as we wore lifejackets and we thought we might do that later get in some fishing or just some pottering around we climbed the low hills northwest of the loch and lay in the long grass under the pines and the birch looking out over the small glen to the forested hill on the far side where the old railway tunnel was beyond that over another wooded ridge unseen and heard only on occasion when the breeze veered from that direction was the main road north further beyond that the grampians southernmost summits rose green and goldenbrown into the blue sky later that evening we were all going into pitlochry to the theatre i wasnt too impressed with this id rather have seen a film but andy thought it was all right so i did too andy was fourteen id just turned thirteen and was proud of my new status as a teenager and as usual of the fact that for the next couple of months i was only a year younger than andy we lay in the grass looking up at the sky and the fluttering leaves on the silver birch trees sucking on our reed stalks and talking about girls we were at different schools andy was a boarder at an allboys school in edinburgh and came back only at weekends i was at the local high school id asked my mum and dad if i could go to a boarding school the one in edinburgh andy was at for example but theyd said i wouldnt like it and besides it would cost a lot of money plus there wouldnt be any girls there didnt that worry me i was a bit embarrassed about that the comment about the cost confused me i was used to thinking of us as being welloff dad ran a garage and petrol station on the main road through strathspeld village and mum had a wee gift and coffee shop dad had been worried after the sixday war when theyd introduced the fiftymilesanhour speed limit and even issued fuelrationing books but that hadnt lasted very long and even though petrol cost more nowadays people were still travelling and using cars i knew our modern bungalow on the village outskirts overlooking the carse wasnt as grand as andys mum and dads house which was practically a castle and stood in its own estate ponds streams statues lochs rivers hills forests even the old railway line passing through one corner of it one big garden in effect and vast compared to our single acre laid to lawn and shrub but id never thought of us as really having to worry about money that much certainly i was used to getting more or less what i wanted and had come to think of this virtually as a right the way only children are apt to if their parents are anything other than actively hostile to them it never occurred to me that other children werent spoiled as a matter of course the way i was and it would be years and my father would be dead before i understood that the expense of sending me to a boarding school was just an excuse and the simple sentimental truth was that they knew they would have missed me you have not bet you i have youre kidding im not who was it none of your business ah youre making it up you little tramp you never did it was jean mcduhrie what youre kidding we were in the old station shed seen her brothers and she wanted to see if they all looked like that and she asked me so i showed her mine but it was only if shed show me hers and she did as well dirty wee rascal did she let you touch it touch it i said surprised no ah well then what youre supposed to touch it no youre not not if you just want to look of course you are rubbish anyway what did it look like was there any hair on it hair ugh no no when was this not long ago last summer maybe maybe before not that long im not making it up honest huh i was pleased we were talking about girls because i felt this was a subject where andys two extra years didnt really count i was effectively the same age as him and maybe i even knew more than he did because i mixed with girls every day and he only really knew his sister clare she was away shopping in perth with her mother that day have you ever seen clares dont be disgusting whats disgusting shes your sister exactly what do you mean you dont know anything do you bet i know more than you do crap i sucked on my hollow reed for a while staring up at the sky have you got hairs on yours then i said yeah you havent want to see eh ill show you it its pretty big too because weve been talking about women thats whats supposed to happen oh yeah look at your trousers i can see it what a bulge look ah ugh wow thats called an erection wow god mine never gets that big well its not supposed to youre still young charming im a teenager do you mind i watched andys cock huge and golden and purple and sticking out of his fly like a gently curved plant some sweet exotic fruit growing into the sunlight i looked around hoping there wasnt anybody nearby watching we were only visible from the top of the hill where the railway tunnel was and usually nobody went there you can touch it if you like i dont know some of the guys in the school touch each others its not the same as being with a girl of course but people do it better than nothing andy licked his fingers and started to stroke them up and down over the purple bulge of his cock this feels good do you do this yet i shook my head watching the saliva on that full taut hood glisten in the sunlight there was a thickness in my throat and a tight feeling in my stomach i could feel my own cock throbbing come on dont just lie there andy said matteroffactly leaving his cock alone and lying back in the grass putting his arm behind his head and staring up at the sky do something oh god all right i said tutting and sighing but really my hand was shaking i pulled up and down on his cock gently all right use some spit good grief i dont know i spat into my fingers and used them then found his foreskin was loose enough to be rolled back and forth over the head and did that for a while andy breathed hard and his free hand went to my head stroking my hair you could use your mouth he said voice shaky i mean if you want hmm well i dont know whats wrong with ah oh oh oh yuk what a mess andy took a deep breath and patted my head chuckling not bad he told me for a beginner i wiped my hand on his trousers hey i put my face up to his ive seen clares i told him what you i jumped up and ran laughing down through the grass and the bushes down into the glen he jumped up too then cursed and hopped about struggling to get his fly shut before he could chase me chapter growth i remember that remember the feeling of his warm cooling sunlit juice on my hand slippy becoming sticky but i cant think about it any more without thinking of gorilla man and the little guy tied to the chair i think they were surprised when i threw up i hope they were i hope they were surprised and very interested and thought ullo ullo ullo it wasnt im then after all he aint the villain hes been fitted up so help me oh god i hope my belly spoke for me better than my fucking brain in other words not guilty didnt do it thats why what gorilla man did sickened me no blood well hardly any blood literally a drop a drip a fucking pixel on the screen and the only thing slicing into flesh was a needle tiny and delicate not a chainsaw or an axe or a knife or anything but its that image that idea that old devil meme i keep dreaming about it keep having nightmares about it and im the trapped one im the man in the leatherandchrome chair and hes there with his gorilla face and his squeaky baby voice explaining to the camera that what he has in this bottle and in this syringe is sperm the crazy fuckers loaded it up with jism man looks like half a fucking milk bottle of the stuff and hes going to inject it into the little guys veins and he ties something round the naked upper arm of the little guy strapped to the chair and pulls it tight and waits for the vein to show while the little guy howls and screams like a child and tries to shake the chair to bits or rip it apart but hes too well strapped in there no purchase no leverage and then the man in the gorilla mask just does it sinks the needle into the little guys skin with a bit of blood and empties the whole syringe into him i throw up onto the floor and they pause the video for me and somebody goes to get a mop after ive stopped chucking and coughing they restart the video and we cut to the other scene and the tall hospital chair and the little guy again with empty eyes and mcdunn says his bit about persistent vegetative state well indeed they did a dnafingerprint test and found he had a busload of people in him linked it to some guy who was in the toilets under centre point the day before hiring rent boys but he didnt want the full business just wanted them to wank into this bottle thank you for your contribution young man every little bit helps going to a good home thank you mind how you go im thinking this is the trickledown effect in action is it no this is the showoff effect in action clare tells me having to shout over the din everybody else seems to be cheering andy and william are standing on a seat andy leans out over a table laden with glasses a champagne bottle in one hand and his other arm held by william who leans out the opposite way to balance him the table andy is perched over is stacked with several hundred champagne glasses forming a glittering pyramid rising a couple of metres from the tables surface andy is filling the single champagne glass at the apex of the pyramid with champagne it is overflowing filling the three glasses beneath it they in turn are overflowing filling the glasses on the level beneath them which are also full and so spilling over to the level underneath and so on and so on down almost to the bottom andy is on his eighth magnum he glances down at the final layer of glasses how we doing he roars more more everybody shouts william somebody yells from the crowd fifty quid if you just let him go dont you fucking dare sorrell andy shouts laughing upending the magnum over the topmost glass as the bottle empties not for a measly fifty william laughs as he and andy pull together and draw together tottering on the seat while andy throws the emptied bottle to someone in the crowd and is handed another full magnum by his partner in the gadget shop a fellow exadman whos a few years older than andy it strikes me the symbolism of this whole venture would be better were it he and andy balancing together on the seat but i get the impression andys partner isnt fully into such flamboyance winch me out there will andy bellows god though its tempting william says leaning back and letting andy crane out over the pyramid of glasses again this is infantile clare says shaking her head whats what yvonne asks making her way through the crowd she clutches a bottle of champagne this is infantile clare says nodding at the pyramid of glasses she sees the bottle in yvonnes hand oh i say well done that woman she holds out her flute yvonne fills the glass cameron ta she fills her own glass and stands beside clare and me watching andy pouring the champagne onto the top of the pyramid yvonnes wearing a little black number that to my untutored eye looks like it could have cost ten quid or a thousand clare is rather more ostentatious in a short sparkling crimson creation that looks like it wants to be a ballgown when it grows up andy and william are in monochrome djs removed for the bubblywaterfall operation yvonne grins boys she says sounding longsufferingly affectionate i look around when andy invited me to the launch of the the gadget shop i naively assumed it would be in the shop itself in covent garden but that didnt measure up to andys sense of showmanship it wasnt glitzy enough dramatic enough or even big enough instead he hired the science museum part of it anyway that got people interested a shop is just a shop and even a shop selling expensive executive toys is still just a shop but a museum is well glamorous people reckon the natural history museum is the most glamorous partying in the shadow of all those dinosaurs in that huge space is just the business but for the gadget shop the science museum along the road was the obvious venue as well as being cheaper besides everyone who matters has already been to some sort of bash at the natural history museum this is new theres a fullsize hovercraft held tipped on wires directly above us a virtually circular thing with a tiny cabin and a huge fluted central airintake i vaguely recall making an airfix kit of that thing when i was a kid it floats above us gleaming in the darkness as if supported on a cloud of talk and booze while the people below swarm and chat and roar andy on the champagne already dripping down off the edges of the table onto the temporary matting beneath from spillages is almost overflowing the secondlast level of glasses more more people yell oh less less clare mutters sniffing nearly there yet andy shouts more more everybody roars i look at them all these are people like me christ media people people from the advertising company andy has just left a few politicians mostly tory or social democrats though there are a couple of labour guys bankers lawyers business advisers investment experts actors tv people at least one film crew though their lights are switched off for now various other city types a scattering of people who are well just professionally famous and the remainder seemingly either part of some enormous floating metaparty or hired from some agency to impersonate people having a whale of a time rentahoot or something similar im mildly surprised we havent had a kissogram but maybe thats a little lorent for andy clare told me hed taken rather a lot of convincing once hed determined to do the slightly naff champagnepyramid stunt in the first place not to try doing it with proper champagne flutes but to use the perry glasses like everybody else did too tall too unstable otherwise youre very quiet cameron yvonne says smiling at me yeah i say helpfully i think cameron clare says sniffing disapproves she draws out the oo sound in the word clare is a tall auburn girl with striking angular looks she shares with her brother but whereas andy is at the moment bulkily fitlooking and tanned clare is just thin and luminously pale i reckon shes overly keen on coke and spends too much time in clubs but maybe im just jealous my cubreporter status on the caley and the triumphofminiaturisation salary that goes with it make habits that expensive out of the question clare has always had rather more in the way of aristocratic pretensions than andy who has that aura of classless brothofaboyhood that usually only the congenitally rich can carry off convincingly clare works for an estate agent so far upmarket its mostly estates they deal in not humble houses no matter how extensive if it doesnt boast a couple of salmon rivers a few square miles of trees and a brace of hills lochs or lakes then they just arent interested cameron clare continues is content to lurk here on the sidelines radiating selfrighteous socialist disapproval and imagining how after the revolution well all have to pull ploughs eat raw turnips and take part in interminable selfcriticism sessions long into the candlelit night on the collective farm arent you cameron you dont pull ploughs i reply you push them i know dear there is a farm next door to us back on the dear old homestead and daddy does usually describe himself as a farmer but i meant that we capitalist parasites would be taking the place of the oxen not the hornyhanded saltoftheearth types cracking the whip over them well im sorry to disappoint you i tell her but im afraid youre assuming a rather more lenient revolution than the one i had in mind i had you down as bonemeal actually come the day sorry i shrug watching andy start to pour what everybody nearby seems to agree will be the last magnum required before the glass pyramid is finally full of champagne clare looks at yvonne cameron always did take a hard line on these things she tells her oh well might as well enjoy ourselves while we can before the commissars take their gloating revenge im off to powder my nose would you like to come yvonne shakes her head no thanks ill leave you with young hottotrotsky here then clare says patting yvonne on the shoulder and winking at me as she sidles off through the cheering crowd the pyramid is still not quite full one more bottle one more bottle everybody is shouting i turn to yvonne so hows the venturecapital businesss these days venturesome yvonne says flicking back her shoulderilength black hair hows the newspaper business folding oh ha ha i shrug no im enjoying it moneys not brilliant but someetimes i see my name on the front page and i feel almost successful for a while until i come to something like this i nod at andy taking yet another opened magnum and leaning out over the glassstacked table his task is almost finished the pyramid is nearly full yvonne glances at the pyramid with what might be contempt oh dont let your head get turned by all this shit she says the tone of her voice surprises me i thought youd love all this i tell her she looks slowly around at the people and the place hmm she says and packs a disconcerting amount of cold equivocation into that single sound she fixes her gaze on me but dont you just long for a neutron bomb sometimes constantly i tell her after a pause she nods eyes narrowed for a moment then she shrugs tiurning to me and grinning hottotrotsky she asks looking after clare still heading thinly majestic in the thick of the crowrd for the ladies i made the mistake of trying to get clare into bed onoce i confess cameron really yvonne looks delighted what happenned she just laughed yvonne tuts she glances round id have given you a refearence cameron she says quietly i smile and drink my champagne remembering when andy came to stirling for yvonne and williams party five years ago it seems like a lot longer did you ever tell william about that i ask her yvonne shakes her head no she says she shrugs maybe when were older i think about telling her that andy was there in his sleeping bag listening the whole time but while im thinking about it something goes wrong there must have been a flaw in one of the glasses or the weight is just too much because theres a cracking sound and one side of the pyramid starts to collapse sending an avalanche of falling glass and frothing champagne spilling crashing down off the table and smashing bouncing and splashing onto the mats and the floor below andy goes aww and holds his arms straight out people cheer still thinking four years later clare and her latest fiance were spending a weekend at strathspeld when she died of a heart attack i heard the news from a guy i knew who still lived in the village i couldnt believe it a heart attack overweight male execs squeezing themselves behind the wheel of their mercs they died of heart attacks arthritic workingclass guys raised on a diet of fish and chips and fags they died of heart attacks not young women in their midtwenties christ clare was even fit at the time shed given up doing coke and taken up healthy shit like running and swimming it couldnt be a heart attack and that was exactly what the doctor thought that was precisely what helped kill her the local doc the guy whod helped save andy after he almost died under the ice all those years earlier was on holiday at the time and there was a locum a deputising doctor in charge of the practice except from what the locals muttered later it seemed hed treated his stay in strathspeld as a holiday too and spent more time on river banks with a rod in his hands than at bedsides toting a stethoscope the family called him when clare started to complain of chest pains in the late afternoon but he didnt come out told them shed just strained something rest and painkillers they called him twice again and eventually he appeared that evening once it was explained the family wasnt used to this sort of treatment and once he realised the best salmon stream in the area ran through the estate he still couldnt find anything wrong and left again they called an ambulance when clare became unconscious and her lips turned blue but by then it was too late andy and his partner had sold the gadget shop chain the previous year andy was still thinking about what he wanted to do next now he was rich and was deep in the desert on a transsaharan expedition when clare died the funeral was private family only andy got back just in time i rang the house a week later and talked to mrs gould who said andy was still there she thought he would like to see me a grey day in a cold april one of those wintersend days when the land looks exhausted and worn and it seems like all the colour is gone from the world the cloud was thick and low and moving slowly on a damp chilling wind a lidding expanse hiding the sky and the snow on the distant hills the trees bushes and fields were all the same dun shade as though a thin layer of dirt had been sprayed everywhere and wherever you looked there seemed to be mud or rotting leaves or bare deadlooking branches i thought that if id just come from the sahara to here id head back as soon as possible family duties or not i stopped at the house to give my condolences to mr and mrs gould mrs gould was covered in flour and smelled faintly of gin she was a tall nervous woman whod gone grey early she always wore large bifocals and usually dressed in tweeds id never seen her without a single string of pearls which she fingered constantly she apologised for the mess wiping her hands on her apron and then shaking my hand while i said how sorry id been to hear she looked around the hall distractedly as if wondering what to do next then the door to the library opened and mr gould peeked out he was about the same height as his wife but he looked stooped now and he was wearing a dressinggown normally he was the epitome of tweedy countrysquiredom an archetypal laird in threepiece suit clumpy shoes checked shirt and cap he resorted to a beatenup much reproofed barbour when the weather turned particularly foul id never seen him in anything as softlooking as human as the pair of scruffy trousers opennecked shirt and dressinggown he wore then his strong square face looked drawn and his thinning brown hair hadnt been combed he came out of the library when he saw it was me shook my hand and said terrible thing terrible thing a few times while beethoven sounded loudly from the opened library door and his wife tutted and tried to smooth his errant hair his eyes kept looking away over one of my shoulders or the other never meeting my gaze and i got the impression that like his wife he was constantly waiting for something important to happen expecting someone to arrive at any moment as though they both couldnt believe what had happened and it was all a dream or a ghastly joke and they were just waiting for clare to come gangling through the front door kicking off muddy green wellies and loudly demanding tea andy was out shooting i could hear the shotgun barking as i walked through the dim dripping woods from the house staying off the muddy path as much as possible and walking on the flattened exhaustedlooking grass at its side to keep my shoes from clogging up the field was surrounded by trees and looked out towards the river upstream from the loch the river wasnt visible but there had been a lot of rain over that week and one corner of the field had flooded leaving a shallow temporary loch reflecting the tarnished dark silver of the clouds its waters were still and flat there was a stretch of curved gravel edged with planks near this end of the field six posts stood along the front edge of the gravel stand and on top of each post there was a little flat piece of wood like a tray twenty yards in front of the gravel pathway was a low mound where the launcher mechanism for the clays sat there were two other mounds about the same distance away to either side i could hear the little generator puttering away inside the central mound as i got closer clearing the trees and looking across and down at where andy stood i watched for a moment andy wore cords shirt and jumper and bodywarmer a cap hung from the top of one of the nearby posts he was very tanned a big box of shells sat opened on top of the post in front of him a foot switch at the end of a long snaking flex operated the catapult in the pit he slotted six cartridges into the longbarrelled pumpaction gun and turned to aim his foot tapped once and the clay shot out of the hide spinning away into the greyness in a dayglo orange blur the gun roared and the clay disintegrated somewhere out over the field when i looked carefully i could see lots of orange fragments scattered over the sodden grass and glistening brown earth of the field the generator revved up and down providing power to the automatic launcher it had some sort of randomly set variation built into where it was aiming because the clays came out at a different angle and heading each time andy got them all with his first shot except for the last one he even tried to reload fast enough to have another crack at it but it thumped into the wet heather near the river before he could get the shell into the gun he shrugged put the cartridge back into the box checked the gun and turned to look at me hi cameron he said and i knew then hed been aware of me all the time he put the pumpaction down carefully on an oiled gun bag lying on the gravel hi i said walking up to him he looked tired we shook hands a little awkwardly then hugged he smelled of smoke fucking squaddie culture yeah adoration of the fucking maggie and pit bulls and getting some scoff down your neck and lets get pissed on lager and all moon together from the bus and camouflage jackets in the high street and yeahwelliminarestidinmartialartsinti im not a fucking nazi i just collect militaria im not a fucking racist i just hate blacks and gun magazines instead of magazines for guns wanking over the glossy photos of chromed lugers ill bet half of them think elvis is still alive buncha fucking stupid little cunts the dipshit little bastards deserve the fucking micks turning them into mince saw the inside of an armoured car once been blown to buggery thrown a hundred feet into the air and then rolled all the way down a hill we took turns looking inside just to prove we were real men looked like the inside of a fucking slaughterhouse i sat with andy while he ranted on we were drinking whisky he had a big room on the second floor of the house at strathspeld wed played here as kids making models fighting wars with toy soldiers and the train set and airfix tanks and forts made from lego wed conducted experiments with our chemistry sets raced our scalextric cars flown gliders out the window down to the lawn and shot at targets in the gardens with our air rifles and killed a couple of birds and smoked a few packets of illicit fags from the same window wed smoked untold spliffs here too listening to records with pals from the village and with clare why are people so fucking incompetent andy screamed suddenly and threw his whisky glass across the room it hit the wall near the window and smashed i remembered the disintegrating pile of champagne glasses in the science museum only four years earlier the whisky left in the glass hed thrown made a pale brown stain on the wall i focused on the liquid as it slowly dribbled down sorry andy muttered not sounding sorry at all getting unsteadily out of his seat and going to where the bits of glass lay broken on the carpet he squatted and started to pick them up then let them drop back to the floor and just crouched there and put his hands over his face and started to cry i let him cry for a bit and then went over to him and squatted down beside him and put my hand over his shoulders why are people so fucking useless he sobbed fucking let you down fucking cant do their fucking job fucking halziel captain fucking michael fucking lingary dso cunts he pushed away from me and stood up and stumbled over to a wooden chest tearing one of its drawers right out so that it crashed to the carpeted floor and a load of jumpers fell out he got down on his knees behind the drawer and i heard tape rip he stood up holding an automatic pistol and started trying to slot a magazine into the grip fucking brainectomy coming up doctor fucking halziel he said still crying and still trying to get the magazine to fit into the gun halziel i thought halziel i recognised lingarys name from the times andy had talked about the falklands hed been andys co the one andy blamed for the deaths of some of his men but halziel oh yeah of course the name of the locum whod let clare die the guy the locals thought was more interested in fishing than doctoring fucking load cunt andy screamed at the gun i got up suddenly feeling cold i hadnt felt like this when id seen him firing the shotgun it hadnt occurred to me to feel frightened of him then now it did i wasnt at all sure i was doing the right thing but i got up and started towards him as he finally got the clip to slide into the gun and snick home hey andy i said man come on he glared up at me as though seeing me for the first time his face was red and blotchy and streaked with tears dont you fucking start colley you little cunt you let me down too remember hey hey i said putting my hands out and retreating andy crashed into the door opened it and almost fell out into the landing i followed him down the stairs listening to him curse and shout in the front hall he tried to get a jacket on over his clothes but couldnt get it to fit over his hand holding the gun he hauled the front door open so hard that when it hit the stop the stainedglass panel shattered i looked woozily around for mr and mrs gould but there was no sign of them andy slammed the heel of his hand off the half of the storm door that was still closed then fell out into the night i went after him he was trying to get into the land rover i stood beside him while he cursed at the keys and thumped the side window he put the gun sideways in his mouth to give him two free hands and i thought about trying to grab it off him but i thought id probably kill one of us and even if i didnt i was no match for him and hed just take it off me again andy man i said trying to sound calm come on this is crazy come on dont be insane man killing this dickhead halziel isnt going to bring clare back shut up andy yelled throwing the keys down and grabbing me by the collar and slamming me back against the side of the landie shut the fuck up you stupid little shit i fucking know nothingll bring her back i know that he banged my head against the land rovers side window i just want to be sure that therell be one stupid incompetent fuck less in the world but i said ah fuck off he hit me in the face with the gun an inefficient glancing blow with more chaotic anger than directed malice behind it i fell down correspondingly more because i felt i ought to than because i was actually knocked out still hurt though i lay on the gravel face up it was only then i realised it was raining i worried distantly about being shot and killed then andy slammed the gun sideon against the land rover and kicked the door christ he bellowed he kicked the door again christ i was getting wet i could feel water seeping through my jumper and making my back damp andy bent down and looked at me his eyes screwed up you all right yeah i said wearily he flicked something on the gun and stuffed it down the back of his cords then held a hand out to me i put my hand up to his i remembered william and andy balanced on the chair under the old hovercraft he pulled me up sorry i hit you he said sorry i was a prat oh man christ he put his head on my shoulder breathing hard but not crying i patted his head still thinking yvonne and i at south queensferry a couple of summers ago across the road from the hawes inn at the slipway underneath the tall stone piers of the railbridge the milewide river bright before us people promenading along pavements and down the pier an occasional smell of frying onions from the snack bar beside the inshore lifeboat shed we were there to witness william getting to grips with his brandnew jet ski this process seemed to consist largely of getting on powering away trying to turn too fast and falling off in an extravagant splash his big blond head kept coming up shaking once and then bobbing through the water as he struck out for the machine there were another three jet skis buzzing around on that part of the river and a few waterskiers with their bigengined speedboats all creating a fair old racket but we could still hear william laughing the guy thought buying a frighteningly expensive piece of machinery and spending most of your time falling off it into the water was just the most enormous wheeze what do you actually use these things for i asked what jet skis yvonne said leaning on the sea wall and clinking ice around in her fruit juice fun she watched william bank into a turn narrowly miss another jet ski and plough into the wash of a waterski boat sending william in a new variation on his repertoire of falls somersaulting over the handlebars of the jet ski and flopping on his back into the water in a cloud of spray his laughter whooped above the revving motors he waved to show he was all right then swam back to the floating machine still laughing yvonne put her sunglasses on theyre for fun thats what theyre for fun i said nodding william was still laughing i watched yvonne watching him he waved again as he got onto the jet ski she waved back listlessly i thought yvonne was slim and muscled in shorts and tshirt her breasts were pushed up by the wall she was leaning against we had been lovers for a year or so she shook her head gently as william gunned the machines engine again i leant on the wall beside her do you ever think about leaving him i asked her quietly she paused turned to me put her sunglasses down her nose and looked at me over them no she said and there was a question in her voice it was asking me why id asked such a thing i shrugged i just wondered she waited for a family to pass by eating icecreams then she said cameron ive no intention of leaving william i shrugged again sorry id asked now like i say it just occurred to me well unoccur it she glanced at where william was bumping enthusiastically across the waves miraculously still upright she put a hand out and briefly touched my arm cameron she said and her voice was tender youre the excitement in my life you do things for me william couldnt even imagine but hes my husband and even if we do stray now and again well always be an item she narrowed her eyes then added probably she looked at him again as he executed a slower turn wobbling but upright i mean if he ever gave me aids id give him a colombian necktie eugh i said id seen a photograph of one of those they cut your throat and pull your tongue out through the slit surprisingly big the human tongue you told him that she laughed once yeah he said if i left him hed demand custody of the merc i turned and looked at the subtly tarted much breathedupon sitting at the kerb then made a show of sizing up yvonne i shrugged fair enough i said turning to look out across the water and drinking my pint she kicked me on the knee later when we were helping william take the jet ski out of the water some very loud people all wearing black leather jackets with bmw logos arrived with a gleaming black range rover and a big black ski boat they demanded that everybody get out of their way so they could launch their boat while people whod been there for the best of the tide were already bringing their craft out their tripleengined ski boat had blocked the exit to the road and when people asked them to move it the bmw people started arguing i even heard one of them claiming to have booked the slipway there was impasse for about ten minutes we got the jet ski onto its trailer but williams merc was one of the cars trapped on the slip he tried to reason with the bmw people then sat in the car and sulked yvonne seemed silently furious then announced she was going up to the lifeboat shed to buy some souvenir crap or whatever when in doubt shop she told us slamming the car door william sat tightlipped looking in his rearview mirror at the argument continuing further up the slip bastards he said people are so fucking inconsiderate shoot the lot of them i said thinking about getting out and having a cigarette no smoking on the champagnehued leather of the merc yeah william said hands kneading the steering wheel people might be a bit more polite if everybody carried guns i looked at him it was all sorted out after some confusion and a lot of illfeeling the bmw people moved their boat forward so cars and trailers could get past it to the road we picked yvonne up at the top of the slip by the rnli shed where they sold stuff to help pay for the lifeboat she didnt seem to have bought much she tossed me a box of matches as she got into the car here she said i studied the matchbox wo hey you sure about this i looked back as we powered away up the hill through the trees heading for edinburgh there was another commotion going on down on the slip the bmw people were gesticulating wildly and pointing at the tyres on one side of the trailer holding the big ski boat which appeared to be listing slightly in that direction now it looked like it was all getting rather heated again down there then the leaves got in the way and we couldnt see any more i was sure id seen a punch thrown i turned back to find yvonnes grinning face looking past me in the same direction she looked suddenly innocent and sat back in her seat humming i remembered the time andy and i had let down all the wheels of his dads car folding matches in half and sticking them into the tyre valves i opened the box of matches yvonne had given me but you couldnt have told whether there were a couple of them missing or not looks like they had some sort of problem with their trailer there i said good william said probably a puncture yvonne sighed she glanced at william we do have lockable tyre valves on this thing dont we william in the woods outskirts of edinburgh almost within sight of the estate where his and yvonnes new house is toting a paint gun on another of these stupid but grudginglysometimesfuninaterriblyboyishsortofway paintball games his computercompany boys and girls versus the crack troops of the caledonian news room my gun jammed and william recognised me and came forward laughing and firing shot after shot at me while i waved and tried to duck and these yellow paint balls went splat splat thunking into my hired camouflage trousers and combat jacket and smacking into my visored helmet while i waved at him and tried to get the damn gun to work and he just walked forward slowly shooting me bastard had his own paint gun and hed probably had it souped up knowing william that was almost inevitable splat splat splat he was getting closer and i was thinking christ does he know about me and yvonne has he guessed has somebody told him is that what all this is about it was pretty fucking annoying even if it wasnt i really wanted to get the bastard because wed been having this stupid argument before wed started about how greed really was good and how william had been so disappointed at how poorly the argument was put across by the gekko character in wall street but it is good william protested waving his gun around thats how we measure fitness to survive these days we were being shown round the paintball site having flagpoles and log barricades and that sort of stuff pointed out to us its natural william insisted its evolution when we still lived in caves we used to go out and hunt and whoever brought back the mammoth or whatever ate the best meat and got to fuck the women and all that was good for the human race now its got a bit more abstract and we use money instead of animals but the principles the same but it wasnt just individuals who hunted animals thats exactly the point i told him it was all about cooperation people worked together and got results and shared the spoils i agree william agreed cooperation is great if people didnt cooperate you couldnt lead them so easily but and youll always need leaders but greed and selfishness have produced everything you see around you william said waving the paintball gun around again exactly i exclaimed throwing my arms out wide capitalism yes exactly william echoed also gesturing with his hands and we stood there me with a great big frown on my face quite mystified that william couldnt see what i was getting at and william smiling but looking equally puzzled that i appeared to be incapable of understanding what he meant i shook my head exasperated and brandished my paintball gun lets fight i said william grinned i rest my case so i really wanted to nail the bastard preferably with the cooperation of my teammates just to prove the point but the fucking technology let me down and the gun jammed and he had me pinned firing shot after shot at me and finally i gave up trying to unjam the gun and made to throw it at him though i could hardly see because there was yellow paint all over my visor but he ducked and tripped and sat down on a trunk holding his stomach and the bastard was laughing his socks off because i looked like a giant dripping banana only id just realised the gun wasnt jammed after all the safety catch was on i must have knocked it or something and id a couple of shots left and i ought to have shot the swine but i couldnt not while he was sitting there killing himself laughing bastard i yelled at him he twirled his paint gun around one gloved ringer evolution he shouted you learn a lot when you live with a liquidator he started laughing again later at the buffet lunch in the marquee he barged to the front of the queue saying oh i dont believe in queuing and when somebody behind him objected convinced her with a sort of apologetic bashfulness that actually he has diabetes you see and so needs to eat right now i cringed blushed and looked away still thinking thinking about all the times ive seen people i know do something for revenge or do anything vindictive or sneaky or smart or even threaten to hell everybody i knows done something like that at some time or another but that doesnt make them a murderer i think mcdunns crazy but i cant tell him that because if hes wrong about that and im wrong about it being something to do with those guys who died in the lake district a few years ago then theres only one suspect left and thats me the trouble is my theorys looking shakier all the time because mcdunns convinced me it really was all just a smokescreen there is no ares project never was any ares project and smout in his prison in baghdad isnt connected to the guys that died it was just somebody coming up with a clever conspiracy theory just a way of getting me to go to remote places and wait for phone calls and deprive me of an alibi while gorilla man did something horrible to somebody else somewhere else of course mcdunn points out that i could still be the murderer this could all be a story ive made up i could have recorded the mysterious mr archers phone calls and had them directed to the office while i was there they found most of the equipment to do just that in my flat when they searched it an answermachine my pc and its modem another lead or two and it would have been easy to set it up if you knew what you were doing or just used trial and error and were patient mcdunn really wants to help i can see that but hes under pressure too the circumstantial evidence against me is so strong people who dont know the details of the case are getting impatient over the lack of progress apart from that fucking business card they have no forensic evidence no weapons bloodstained clothes or even minutiae like hairs or fibres to link me with any of the attacks i suspect they dont think id be identified by any of the witnesses or id have been on an identity parade by now but it just all looks so obvious it must be me lefty journalist goes loco wastes rightwingers apparently ive missed some good headlines while ive been in here actually i missed some good ones in the couple of days holiday i took if id just bothered to look at a single fucking newsstand after i left stromeferry id have seen this story starting to break about this guy the red panther the tabloids decided on eventually murdering these rightleaning pillars of the community mcdunn doesnt want to charge me with any of the other murders but theyre going to have to make a decision before too long because my initial time under the pta is nearly up and the home secretary isnt going to grant an extension ill have to appear in court soon hell i might even get a lawyer im still terrified even though mcdunns on my side because i can see hes not so hopeful any more and if they take him off this i might get the bad cops the ones that just want a confession and christ im in england not scotland and despite the mcguire seven and the guildford four they still havent changed the law down here you can still be convicted on an uncorroborated confession even if you try to retract it later im getting paranoid about that determined not to sign anything worried that maybe i already have when they first brought me here and said it was just a receipt for personal effects or a legalaid application or whatever and i worry about them getting me to sign something when im tired and theyve been interviewing me in shifts and all i want to do is go to bed and sleep and they say oh do us all a favour and sign this and you can sleep come on now its just a formality you can always deny it later change your mind but you cant you cant of course theyre lying and you cant i even worry about signing something in my sleep or them hypnotising me and getting me to do it that way hell i dont know what they get up to cameron mcdunn says its day five the morning they want to charge you with all the murders and assaults and take you to court day after tomorrow oh jesus i accept a fag mcdunn lights it for me you sure you cant think of anything mcdunn asks anything at all he makes that sucking noise with his teeth again its starting to annoy me i shake my head rubbing my face in my hands not caring that the smoke from the fag goes in my eyes and my hair i cough a bit sorry no no i cant i mean ive thought of lots of stuff but nothing but youre not telling me about it are you cameron the di says sounding regretful youre keeping it all locked up inside you you wont share it with me he shakes his head cameron for gods sake im the only one who can help you if you have any suspicions any doubts you have to let me know about them you have to name names i cough again looking down at the tile floor of the room this might be your last chance cameron mcdunn tells me softly i take a deep breath if theres anybody you can think of cameron just give me their name mcdunn says itll probably be easy to eliminate them from the enquiry we arent going to frame anybody or hassle anybody or pull anything heavy i stare at him still uncertain my hands are still splayed over my lower face i take another drag on the fag fingers shaking again mcdunn continues there are or were people on this case who are very good dedicated and enthusiastic officers but the only thing theyre enthusiastic about nowadays is getting you charged with the rest of the attacks and getting you into the dock ive persuaded the people who matter that im the best man to work with you to help us clear this up but im like a football manager cameron i can be replaced at a moments notice and im only as good as the results i get at the moment im not getting any results and i could go at any time and believe me cameron im the only friend youve got in here i shake my head frightened to speak in case i break down names a name anything that might save you cameron mcdunn says patiently is there anyone youve thought of i feel like a worker in stalinist russia denouncing his comrades but i say well i thought of a couple of friends of mine i look at mcdunn to see how im doing theres a concernedlooking frown on his dark heavy face yes william sorrell and well it sounds daft but his wife umm yvo yvonne mcdunn says nodding slowly and sitting back he lights a fag he looks sad he taps the cigarette packet round and round on the table surface i dont know what to think or feel yes i do i feel sick are you having an affair with yvonne sorrell mcdunn asks i stare at him i really dont know what to say now he waves his hand well maybe it doesnt matter but weve looked into mr and mrs sorrels movements discreetly once we knew they were friends of yours he smiles always have to be alive to the possibility its more than one person cameron especially with a group of crimes spread out over so much territory and fairly complicated ones at that i nod looked into movements looked into i wonder how discreet is discreet i want to cry very much now because i think im admitting to myself that no matter what happens life is never going to be the same again as it turns out mcdunn says while the fag packet goes tap tap although they are both away from home a lot their movements are very well documented we know pretty well what they were doing during all the attacks i nod again feeling like my guts have been ripped out so ive denounced them and there wasnt even any point to it i thought of andy i tell the floor looking down there avoiding mcdunns eyes andy gould i say because apart from everything else andy stayed with me during the summer round about the time the card with my writing on it went missing i thought it might be him but hes dead funerals tomorrow mcdunn says flicking ash and then inspecting the glowing end of his cigarette he scrapes it round the edge of the light metal ashtray until the tip of the fag is a perfect cone then smokes it carefully my ash falls on the floor i sweep it to nothing with my foot guiltily god i could use some dope i need to mellow out i need to calm down im almost looking forward to prison plenty of dope in there if im allowed to mix with other inmates christ its going to happen im accepting it im coming to terms with it christ tomorrow i say swallowing im trying not to cry and im trying not to cough either because that might make me cry yes mcdunn says tapping ash carefully off his cigarette again burying him tomorrow at the family estate whats it called again strathspeld i tell him i look at him but cant tell if he really forgot the name or not strathspeld he nodsstrathspeld he rolls the word around his mouth as if savouring a good malt strathspeld on the carse of speld he sucks air through his teeth again i wish hed get his teeth seen to do they have special police dentists or do they have to go to the ones everybody else goes to and hope the dentist doesnt have some have some grudge some grudge against wait a minute wait a fucking minute here and i know its like a speck of dust drifts down and goes into my eye and i look up to see where it came from and im hit by this tonne of bricks it hits me that hard i sit there for a second thinking no it cant be but it is it wont go away and i do know and i know that i know i know and i feel sick but its something just to feel this certain about anything again i cant prove anything and i still dont understand it all but i know and i know that i have to be there have to get to strathspeld i could just tell them to get there be there keep watch there because hes bound to be there has to be there there of all places but i cant let it happen like that and whether they get him or not and i doubt they will i have to be there so i clear my throat and look mcdunn in the eyes and say all right two more names pause swallow something sticking in my throat jesus am i really going to say this yes yes i am and ive got something else for you mcdunn tips his head to one side his brows say oh yes i take a deep breath i want something from you though mcdunn frowns what would that be cameron i want to be there tomorrow at the funeral mcdunn frowns more deeply he looks down at the fag packet and taps it round another couple of revolutions on the table he shakes his head i dont think i can do that cameron yes you can i tell him you can because of what ive got for you i pause take another breath the air catching in my throat its there too mcdunn looks puzzled and what would that be cameron my heart is hammering my hands are balled into fists i swallow throat dry tears finally coming into my eyes and eventually i squeeze the words out a body chapter carse of speld i run down the hill into the sunlit glen and then up the far side with andy crashing through the bushes heather and ferns behind me i shake my hand free of most of his semen and deliberately let my hand brush across the leaves and blades as i dash past wiping the rest off im laughing andys laughing too but shouting threats and insults as well i run up the hill seeing movement ahead and assuming its a bird or a rabbit or something and almost run straight into a man i stop i can still hear andy pumping up the hill behind me tearing through the bushes and yelling curses the man is dressed in walking boots brown cords and a shirt and green hiking jacket he wears a brown rucksack on his back he has red hair and he looks furious what do you boys think you were doing what eh ah i say looking back to see andy coming up the hill behind me suddenly slowing and looking wary as he sees the man you the man shouts at andy his voice makes me jump i hide my sticky hand behind me as if its brightly stained what were you doing there with this boy eh what were you doing he shouts looking around he puts his thumbs between the shoulder straps of his rucksack and his jacket and sticks his chest and chin out come on what dyou think you were doing eh answer me boy none of your business andy says but his voice is shaky i can smell something funny i worry that its coming from my sticky hand and im frightened that the man will smell it dont you talk to me like that boy the man yells glancing round again he spits as he shouts youve got no right being here andy says sounding frightened this is private property oh is it the man says private property is it and that gives you the right to do dirty perverted things does it we shut it laddie the man takes a step forward looking over my head at andy the mans so close i could touch him i get that smell even stronger oh god hes bound to smell it now i feel myself trying to shrink cowering the man thumps himself in the chest with one finger well let me tell you something sonny he tells andy im a policeman he nods drawing back and upright again aye he says eyes narrowing you may well look frightened boy because youre in deep bloody trouble he looks down at me right this way come on he takes a step away im trembling rooted to the spot i glance back to see andy looking uncertain the man grabs my arm and pulls me i said come on boy he drags me after him through the woods i start crying and try to break away struggling weakly please mister we werent doing anything i wail we werent doing anything honest we werent doing anything honest we werent please please let us go please please let us go we wont do it again honest please please please i look back through my tears at andy whos following looking desperate and uncertain biting on one knuckle as he follows us through the bushes were near the summit of the hill deep in the bushes under the thin cover of trees the smell is very strong and my knees feel like the bones are gone if i wasnt being held up by the mans gripping hand hauling me through the ferns i feel like id fall down leave him andy shouts and i think hes going to burst into tears like me he seemed so old a few minutes ago and now hes like a little kid again the man stops whirls me round and holds me against his chest he feels very warm behind me and the smell is even stronger andy comes to within a couple of yards come here the man shouts i can see spittle arc out from above me as he shouts andy looks from him down to me i can see his jaw trembling come here the man screeches andy comes forward a couple of feet take off those trousers he hisses at andy go on i saw you i saw what you were doing take off those trousers andy shakes his head backing off i start to sob the man shakes me right he says he leans over me puts his big fingers to the zip of my jeans and starts trying to pull the zip down im struggling and howling but i cant get free the smell is all around me its him its his sweat his smell leave him you bastard andy shouts youre not a policeman i cant see what andys doing because the mans body is in the way but then andy hits into him bowling him backwards and he shouts and i wriggle away from them i scramble off through the ferns on all fours and then stop and look back and the mans got andy hes struggling with him leaning over him folding him pressing him down and andys breathing hard grunting trying to break free bastard leave me alone youre not a policeman youre not a policeman the man doesnt say anything he pushes andy down into the ferns and gets a hand free and punches andy in the face andy goes limp but then moves weakly the man is breathing very hard and when he looks at me his eyes are wide and staring you he gasps you just stay there stay there dyou hear im shaking so hard i can hardly see straight tears fill my eyes the man pulls andys trousers down i can see andy looking round groggily his gaze fastens on me help he croaks cameron help cameron is it the man says glancing at me and pulling down his own trousers well you just stay there cameron you just stay there right i shake my head and back off cameron andy wails the man is struggling with his underpants as andy tries to get out from under him im stumbling backwards almost falling i have to turn to stop myself tripping and the turn becomes a run and i cant stop myself i just have to escape i race away through the woods tears burning on my face sobbing hysterically the breath whistling and whooping in and out of me hot and desperate and livid in my throat ferns whip at my legs and branches lash at my face i gave mcdunn the two names last night and told him the respective professions of their owners then clammed up just refused to say any more about them or about the body there was a lot of toothsucking for a while as he tried to get me to say more and that was almost funny given that it was the toothsucking that made me think of it in the first place suddenly thinking the dentist recalling going into kyle while i was at stromefirrynofirry and remembering that nightmare vision of the burnedblack man after the blevey sir rufus with his black bones black nails black wood and his black jaw hinged back and very much a dentalrecords job and thinking how did they identify andy the names worked even better than i expected i can see a way out now i feel like judas but theres a way out not with any honour perhaps but ive looked at myself pretty closely over the last few days and ive had to admit to myself that im not quite as wonderful a guy as i liked to think i was ive imagined myself in situations like this made up speeches in my head speeches about truth and freedom and protection of sources speeches i imagined delivering from the witness box just before the judge sentenced me to ninety days or six months or whatever for contempt of court but i was kidding myself even if its true that i would have gone to prison to protect somebody else or make some dubious point about the freedom of the press i know id only have been doing it to make myself look good im just like everybody else selfish i can see a way out and im taking it and the fact its a kind of betrayal doesnt really matter besides im paying for the betrayal by telling them about the body by itself it doesnt prove a thing but its my way of getting them to take me to strathspeld for the funeral i can look mcdunn in the eye and tell him the truth and he knows its the truth and hell take me i think and perhaps with this act of treachery i can finally buy my freedom from the burden of buried horror that bound me to andy twenty years ago so that dispossessed of that trespass im left free to betray him again now mcdunns in very early this morning were here in the same old interview room the place is familiar becoming home taking on a tinge of spurious cosiness mcdunns standing behind the table smoking he waves me to sit in the chair and i do yawning i actually slept fairly well last night for the first time since i got here theyve both disappeared mcdunn says hes staring at the table he draws on the bh id quite like a cigarette too even though its still early and ive barely got over the morning cough but mcdunn seems to have forgotten his manners halziel and lingary he says staring at me and he looks really concerned worried and harried and tired for the first time yes its all change here in paddington green theyve both disappeared the di tells me sounding shaken lingary just yesterday doctor halziel three days ago he pulls the seat back and sits in it cameron he says what body i shake my head take me there mcdunn sucks his teeth and looks away i just sit there i feel in control at last i suppose in theory i could be lying through my teeth and have some other reason for wanting to go to strathspeld maybe im just getting homesick for scotland but im certain he knows that im not lying and that there is a body i think he can see it in my eyes mcdunn breathes hard then glares at me you do know dont you you know who it is he sucks on his teeth is it who i think it is i nod yes its andy mcdunn nods grimly he frowns so who was it in the hotel theres been nobody reported missing up there there will be i tell him guy called howie i cant remember his second name begins with a g he was supposed to leave for aberdeen the day i left to start some job on the rigs anyway a few of us had a drink in the hotel that night and apparently there was a fight this was after i got drunk and got put to bed andy told me howie and another two locals jumped a couple of travellers whod been at the party as well the local cop was called and he was looking for howie i hold my hands out i mean this is all stuff that andy told me so it could be just a story but id bet that up to that point its all true i think andy offered to let howie hole up in the hotel while the cops were looking for him and everybody else up there just assumes howies offshore at the moment i tap my fingers on the table and look at mcdunns cigarette packet hoping hell get the hint grissom i tell mcdunn suddenly remembering couldnt think of it all night but now i have just by talking about it thats who it was howie grissom his second name was grissom theres a terrible sick empty feeling in my guts my hands are shaking again and i put them between my legs i give a small laugh i even saw the local cop outside the dentists day of the party i just assumed he was there to get a tooth filled or something but andy must have broken in and switched the records then were checking the dental records of the body from the hotel with the armys records mcdunn says nodding he glances at his watch should have something this morning he shakes his head and why those two why lingary and doctor halziel i tell the di why i tell him about two more betrayals about the commanding officer who had let men die to cover up his own inadequacy or at least andy believed he had which was all that mattered and i tell him about the locum doctor who couldnt be bothered to attend a patient and then when he eventually did pay a visit just assumed her pain was something trivial mcdunn finally offers me a cigarette oh joy i take it and suck hard coughing a bit i guess i tell him hes getting personal now because his usual targets have become more wary i shrug and maybe hes guessed ill put you onto him or that youll just work it out for yourselves so hes settling old scores while he can before theyre warned too mcdunn is staring at the floor and turning the gold bh packet over and over on the table he shakes his head i get the impression he agrees with what im saying and hes just shaking his head at the sheer extent of human deviousness and spite i think in a strange sort of way i feel sorry for mcdunn theres a pause while a young constable comes in with some tea the man at the door gets his cup and mcdunn and i sip ours so detective inspector i say sitting back in my chair hell im almost enjoying this sick feeling or not are we going there or not mcdunn sucks his lips in and looks pained he nods i trip on something in the ferns twisting in midair as my ankle gives underneath me and i slam backwards into the ground winding myself i lie there gulping for air terrified of the man coming to get me while i lie there helpless then i hear a scream i get to my feet i look down at what i tripped over a fallen branch about the size of a mans arm i stare at it thinking down the depth of years to that frozen day by the river get a branch the scream again get a branch im still staring at the branch its like my brains screaming at me inside my own head and i dont know what else it is thats listening except it isnt listening my brains screaming run run at me but the message isnt getting through theres something else in the way something else pulling me back back to andy and back to that frozen river bank i hear andy crying out and i can still see him reaching towards me and hes about to slip away from me again and i cant do anything but i can this time i can i can do something and i will i take hold of the branch and pull it ripping out of the grass and ferns i start to run again back the way ive just come the branch held out in front of me in both hands i can hear andys muffled shouting for a moment i think ive lost them and run past them somehow then i see them almost straight ahead the man is moving up and down over andy his backside looks large and white against the green of the ferns he still has the rucksack on and it looks weird frightening and comical at the same time he has one hand over andys face clamped tight his head is turned away from me red hair fallen down over one ear i put the branch twohanded over my right shoulder as i run up to them jump over a small bush and then as i land at their side bring the branch swinging down it whacks into the mans head with a dull hollow sound jerking his head to one side he grunts and starts to get up then goes limp i stand over him andy is wheezing struggling for breath he pulls himself out from underneath the man there is blood round his backside he pushes the man away the man flops onto his side then rolls forward onto his face again groaning andy sucks breath staring at me he pulls his trousers up then he puts out his hand and takes the branch from me he raises it over his head and brings it crashing down on the back of the mans head once twice three times andy i shout he raises the branch again then drops it he stands there shaking then hugs himself chin on his chest staring down at the man his head and whole body trembling there is blood leaking from the back of the mans head beneath the red hair andy i ask him i put my hand out to him but he flinches we both stand and stare at the man and at the blood spreading amongst the red hair i think hes dead andy whispers i put one shaking hand out and roll the man over his eyes are halfopen he doesnt seem to be breathing i hold one of his wrists for a while trying to find a pulse what are we going to do i ask letting the man roll forward onto his face again sunlight dapples the grass and ferns around us birds call from the trees above and i can hear the distant sound of traffic on the main road through the forest andy is silent wed better tell somebody dont you think andy wed better tell somebody eh wed better tell tell tell tell your mum and dad well have to tell the police even if he is even if he was i mean this was selfdefence they call it it was selfdefence he he he he was trying to kill us kill you it was selfdefence we can say that peoplell believe us it was selfdefence selfdefence andy turns to me face set and pale fucking shut up i shut up i cant stop shaking then what are we going to do i wail i know andy says a civvy granada to heathrow london on a bright november morning people and cars and buildings and shops i watch the real life go by outside like its something from an sf movie i cant believe how alien it all looks how strange and foreign i feel a bizarre sense of loss and yearning i watch the men and women as they crowd along the streets or sit in their cars and vans and buses and trucks and their freedom seems inestimably precious exotic and vicariously intoxicating to be able just to walk or drive wherever you want christ ive been away from all this for less than a week and i feel like somebody coming out after thirty years and i know these people dont feel free i know theyre all hurrying along or sitting there worrying about their jobs or their mortgages or being late or an ira bomb in the nearest litterbin but i look at them and feel a terrible sense of loss because i think ive surrendered all this the ordinariness of life the ability just to be part of it and take part in it i want to hope that im being melodramatic and everything will settle back to the way it used to be before all this ghastliness but i doubt it in my guts i feel that even if everything goes the best it possibly can for me my life has changed completely and forever but fuck it at least im back in the real world and with a modicum of control im discreetly handcuffed to detective sergeant flavell mcdunn has the key and we have a couple of burly plainclothes men with us i strongly suspect are tooled up but the pressure seems to be off me a bit i dont think im suspect numero uno any more i think mcdunn at least believes me and thats enough for now the unfortunate captain later major lingary retired and doctor halziel have done me a lot of good by disappearing so mysteriously i try not to think what andy might be doing to them i try even harder not to think about what he might do to me if he ever got the chance were on the dear old elevated section of the m where lorries are so apt to break down when theres a call for mcdunn he takes the handset listens and sucks his teeth for a bit then says thank you he puts the phone down and looks back at me army records he says he turns back to face the front as we head through the latemorning traffic the body in the hotel was not andrew goulds did they check the records against the ones in howies file i ask mcdunn nods they match goulds not perfectly hes had work done since but they say theyre ninetynine per cent sure they were switched i sit back smiling for a while theres a glow in my belly which displaces the sickness for a while mcdunn gets on the phone to somebody from tayside police and tells them to contact the goulds and stop the funeral lunch for five at feet then edinburgh from the air greyly grand and a tad misty we land just after one oclock and get straight into a jag jamsandwich so a ford at both ends ha the xj speeds north over the roadbridge no lights or siren on but we clip along and its the smoothest fucking motorway journey ive ever had just a total hasslefree zone creaming along around the ton with no worries about unmarked police cars and hoowee the traffic in front of us just fucking evaporates man just brakes and wobbles sometimes as the guy probably gets the cold sweats and the wowheredmystomachgo feeling swings meekly left and brakes again youve never seen a beefy bmw series duck in so fast in your life might as well all be driving cvs its beautiful we take a leg each and drag the man facedown through the ferns towards the northeast end of the hill his cord trousers are still rolled down round his ankles and get in the way and we have to stop and turn him over and pull the trousers back up fastening them by one button his cock is small now and there is dried blood crusted on it we pull him away beneath the trees in his other hand andy is still holding the branch we hit him with we come to a thicket under the trees a cluster of rhododendron and bramble bushes andy clears a way through the undergrowth and we drag the man beneath the thorns and soft fruit of the brambles and the glossy leaves of the rhodies into the green darkness his rucksack catches on the branches above and andy takes it off him pushing it ahead of us we come to a stubby cylinder of undressed stone the second of the two chimneys from the old railway tunnel under the hill we make good time on the road from the motorway people actually help you overtake when youre in a cop car unbelievable i almost wish id become a copcar driver instead of a journalist now this is such sweet driving still maybe it kind of takes some of the sport out of it at gilmerton where the three wee blue fiat s used to live theres a sapphire cosworth orangeandwhite squatting just off the road by the junction it flashes its lights at us as we pass theres another patrol car at the turnoff to strathspeld kind of highprofile here arent we i ask mcdunn mmhmm is all hell say we come to the village i look up at our old house bushes and trees are taller satellite dish conservatory on one side i watch the familiar shops and houses go by mums old gift shop now a video shop the arms where i had my first pint dads old garage still doing business another police car parked on the village green will the goulds be at the house i ask mcdunn shakes his head theyre in that hotel we just passed im relieved i dont think id know what to say to them hi the good news is i didnt kill your son in fact he isnt dead at all but the bad news is hes a multiple murderer five minutes later were at the house the gravel circle outside the house looks like the car park at a cop convention i hear a clattering in the air as mcdunn gets out of the jag and i look up over the trees into high bright overcast fuck me theyve even brought a chopper mcdunn stands talking to some heavily brassed uniformed cops on the steps of the front door i look round the old place the window surrounds have been painted the flowerbeds look a bit unkempt nothing else has changed i havent been here since that day a week after clare died and it had the same muddily washedout look about it then mcdunn comes back towards the car catches flavelps eye and beckons him we get out and follow mcdunn into the house nothing much different inside either still looks and smells the same polished parquet flooring sumptuous but fading old rugs assorted mostly very old furniture lots of big houseplants on the floor and timedulled landscapes and portraits on the woodpanelled walls we walk under the angle of the main staircase into the dining room the place is full of cops theres a map of the estate on the table almost covering it mcdunn introduces me to the other officers i have never had so many hard suspicious looks in my life so wheres this body one of the uniformed guys from strathclyde asks hes here because theyve loaned the helicopter still here i tell him unlike unlike the man youre looking for i look at mcdunn the one friendlyish face in here and the only one i can look at without feeling like a fiveyearold whos just wet his pants i thought the idea was to let the funeral go ahead or at least make it look like it was he was bound to be here you might have caught him then mcdunns face gives a good impression of being stoneclad that was not felt to be the most suitable way of proceeding in this matter he says sounding like a police spokesman for the first time theres a sensation of well tailored black uniforms rustling in the room and i get the impression from the general atmosphere and a few exchanged looks that this is a contentious point were still waiting for this body says the man with the braid from tayside the boys officially in charge mr colley he adds i look down at the map of the estate ill show you i tell them youll need a crowbar or something about fifty metres of rope and a torch a hacksaw might be handy too andy reaches up to the iron grating and pulls at it this one comes away he grunts his voice is still shaky i help him we lift the rusting grating up at one end but the far side is still secured by an iron pin and we cant shift it any further andy takes the branch we hit the man with and wedges it under the grating part of it sticks through but theres a stump where a smaller branch has broken off and the grating rests on that held a halfmetre or so off the stone rim andy throws the mans rucksack into the shaft then bends and takes the man under one armpit trying to heave him up come on he hisses we haul the man up his back against the stone of the vent his head flopping down onto his chest theres a little blood on the stones of the chimney andy takes the mans calves under his armpits and lifts i get underneath and force the mans shoulders up his head goes over onto the stone rim of the vent beneath the grating we both push and heave and the mans shoulders scrape over the rim his arms drag up and over as andy pushes grunting feet slipping on the old leaves and soil i push the mans behind up lifting with all my might the mans trousers snag on the stone and start to come down again then the branch holding the grating shirts and the iron grid falls down thumping into the mans chest shit andy breathes we struggle to lift the grating up and wedge the branch underneath again the mans head is poised over the shaft drooping down into it we push his legs but they buckle at the knees so we have to hold them up above our heads as we push to make them stay straight then as we shove and his trousers are rolled down by the rim of stone his arms flop over the far side of the shaft rim and it suddenly gets easier to push him he slides out of our grasp slipping into the shaft with a scraping noise his trousers bunch round his ankles again then catch round his boots and disappear over the edge of the chimney kicking up at the last moment and hitting the grating the branch slips and the grating slams down the branch falls through it into the shaft and drops after the man we stand there for a second or two then there is unless we each imagine it a very faint thump andy suddenly jerks into motion and scrambles up onto the rim of the chimney he stares through the grating down into the darkness can you see him i ask andy shakes his head but lets get some branches anyway he says we prop the grating open with another branch and spend the next halfhour pulling fallen branches and logs from all over that part of the hill dragging them into the clump of bushes and throwing them into the shaft we snap dead branches off trees and bushes and haul and peel living ones off we scrape together armfuls of dry leaf litter and throw those over the edge of the chimney too everything goes under the grating and down into the shaft we still cant see anything down there eventually a large branch with lots of other branches on it and lots of leaves half a bush practically snags only a few metres down the shaft and we stop breathless sweating trembling from exertion and delayed shock we let the grating fall back and throw the last branch down into the darkness it catches on the branches stuck near the top of the shaft we sit on the dead leaves at the foot of the vent backs against the stone are you all right i ask andy after a while he nods i put a hand out to him but he flinches again we sit there for some time but i keep glancing up and gradually become terrified that the man is somehow not dead or has become a zombie and is climbing back up the shaft towards us to push the grating up and put his already rotting hands down and grab us both by the hair i stand up and face andy my legs are still shaky and my mouth has gone very dry andy stands too a swim he says what lets andy swallows lets go for a swim down to the loch the river he glances back at the stones of the air shaft yeah i say trying to sound cheerful and unconcerned a swim i look at my hands all scraped and dirty theres some blood on them theyre still shaking good idea we crawl out of the undergrowth into the bright day there are a few minutes perhaps not more than three or four when i exist in a bewildering storm of hope joy incomprehension and dread when they dont find the body at the bottom of the shaft we walked here through the gardens and the woods past the hill where andy and i lay in the sunlight all those summers ago into the little glen then up through the bushes and the dead auburn wreckage of the ferns to the trees at the summit of the small hill a damp wind blew from the west shaking drips off the high bare trees and taking the sound of the main road away there are about twenty of us altogether including half a dozen constables carrying the gear im still very much attached to sergeant flavell id naively thought they could mount some lowprofile operation to catch andy watching his own funeral id imagined cops slinking through the undergrowth whispering into radios gradually closing in instead were here mobhanded crashing through the undergrowth towards a dead body except it isnt there i tell them it is i tell them theres a mans body at the bottom of the air shaft and they believe me it takes them long enough to cut a way through to the chimney of the air shaft sawing through the rhodie branches and tearing away the brambles and other undergrowth then they lever off the iron grating over the shaft without any difficulty and one of the younger cops in an overall and a hard hat wraps the rope around himself proper climbing rope they had in the back of one of the range rovers and abseils down into the darkness mcdunns listening on a little radio handset it crackles lot of branches the cop on the end of the rope says then down on the bottom the helicopter clatters overhead im wondering where andy is by now when i hear the guy in the shaft say nothing here what just a load of branches and stuff the cop says mcdunn doesnt react i do i stare at the radio whats he talking about i feel dizzy it did happen i remember it ive lived with it ever since had it at the back of my head ever since i know it happened i feel like the woods are revolving around me maybe if i wasnt still handcuffed to the sergeant id fall over and i remember the man saying can remember his voice perfectly hear him again as he says im a policeman some of the other cops gathered round the air shaft are wearing knowing looks wait a minute the cop in the tunnel says my heart thuds what has he found i dont know if i want him to find him it or not theres a rucksack here the voice on the radio says large daypack size brown looks full fairly old nothing else mcdunn asks just the branches cant see to the end of the tunnel in either direction patch of light in the distance eastwards thats the other air shaft i tell mcdunn back that way i point want me to have a look round sir mcdunn looks at the tayside chief who nods yes mcdunn says if youre sure its safe safe enough i think sir untying mcdunn looks at me he sucks his teeth i avoid the eyes of the other cops mcdunns eyebrows rise a little he was there i tell him it was andy and i this guy attacked us abused andy we hit him with a log i swear mcdunn looks unconvinced he peers over the edge of the stonework down into the shaft im still feeling dizzy i put a hand out to the stones of the airshaft chimney to steady myself at least the rucksacks there it did happen for christs sake it wasnt an hallucination the guy was probably dead when we tipped him into the shaft we just assumed he was at the time though the older i got the less sure of that i was but even if wasnt he must have been killed when he hit the bottom its thirty metres at least could andy have decided since that the body wasnt well enough concealed and come back and removed it hauled it up taken it away and buried it wed never talked about that day and we never again came near this old air shaft i dont know what he might have done since but id always assumed he was like me and just tried to forget about it pretend it never happened denial hell sometimes its best ear me yet the radio crackles yes mcdunn says found him it will take a while to get the body out they have to get more guys down there take photographs the usual shit most of us return to the house i dont know what the hell to feel its finally over its out people know other people know the police know its no longer just between me and andy its public i do feel some relief no matter what happens now but i still feel i have betrayed andy regardless of what hes done the mans body was under the other air shaft the poor fuck must have crawled all that way a hundred metres or more to that second patch of light our bright idea of putting the branches down after him to cover him up was pointless for all these years it would only have needed some more kids to have come along with torches or bits of burning paper to discover the body they reckon there was a load of fallen branches lying under the air shaft before we pushed the guy down it according to the young cop who first went down it looked like hed crawled out from the middle of the pile even so i dont know how he survived that fall god knows what he broke how he suffered how long he took to crawl there to the other slightly brighter patch of light how long he took to die part of me feels sorry for him despite what he tried to do what he did do god knows maybe hed have ended up killing andy killing both of us but nobody deserves to die like that on the other hand theres a part of me that rejoices that is glad he paid the way he did that for once the world worked the way its supposed to punishing the wrongdoer and that saddens and sickens me too because i think that this must be the way andy feels all the time its strange to be in strathspeld to be in the house and not have seen mr and mrs gould some of the cops have gone there are only ten cars and vans on the gravel drive now the chopper went to refuel came back and buzzed around some more and then returned to glasgow apparently they had road blocks and patrols on roads all over the area and they searched the grounds of the house fat chance back at the house in the library i tell a di from tayside all that happened that day twenty years ago mcdunn sits in too it isnt as painful as i thought it would be i tell it just as it happened from where we ran up the hill almost straight into the man i leave out what andy and i were doing just before and the mans line about dirty perverted things i cant tell that with mcdunn sitting there it would be like telling my father actually i guess i wouldnt want to tell it to anybody not so much because im ashamed i tell myself as because its private one last thing i can hide thats between me and andy only so letting me feel that there is one thing at least in which ive not betrayed him utterly sergeant flavell has been released from me to take notes im attached to myself now wrists cuffed together the aged respectable leatherbound tomes of the gould family library look down upon the nasty tale i have to tell with musty distaste outside its dark think ill be charged i ask the two dis i already know theres no time limit between committing a murder and being charged with it not for me to say mr colley the tayside guy says gathering up his notebook and tape recorder mcdunns mouth twists down at the edges he sucks through his teeth and for some reason i feel encouraged theyve ordered food from the strathspeld arms the same food the funeral guests would have eaten a bunch of us eat in the dining room im handcuffed to one of the london burlies now and we both have to eat with one hand id kind of been hoping theyd take the cuffs off me altogether by now but i suppose theyre thinking that the body in the shaft doesnt prove anything by itself and that andy could still be dead or he could be alive and he or somebody else could have kidnapped halziel and lingary to provide cover for me mcdunn comes in as im chasing bits of quiche around my plate with my fork he comes up to me nods to the burly and unlocks the cuffs come here he tells me putting the handcuffs in his pocket i wipe my lips and follow him to the door what is it i ask him its for you he says striding across the hall towards the phone where the handsets lying on the table and an officer is attaching a little device like a sucker to the phone a wire leads from the sucker to a pro walkman the officer starts the machine recording mcdunn glances back at me before stopping at the phone and nodding down at it its andy he hands me the phone chapter slab andy hello cameron it is his voice urbane and controlled until this moment some tiny part of me still believed he was dead i get the shivers and the hair on the nape of my neck prickles i lean back against the wall looking at mcdunn whos standing with his arms crossed a metre away the young officer who turned on the walkman hands mcdunn a pair of earphones plugged into the machine mcdunn listens in i clear my throat whats going on andy sorry to drop you in it old son he says in a conversational sort of way as though apologising for some thoughtless remark or landing me with a mismatched blind date yeah are you mcdunn makes a circular waving motion with one hand keep going oh christ here we go again they want me to keep him talking so they can trace him one more betrayal well yes andy says sounding as though hes a little surprised to find he actually is sorry albeit only slightly i feel a bit bad about that but at the same time i felt you deserved it not that i thought youd go to prison for it wouldnt inflict that on you but well i wanted you to suffer for a while i take it they found that card i left in the woods near sir rufuss place yes they did thanks andy yeah great i thought we were friends we were cameron he says reasonably but you did run away twice i give a small despairing laugh glancing at mcdunn again i came back the second time yes cameron he says and his voice is smooth thats why youre still alive oh thanks very much but anyway cameron youre still part of it youve still played your part in it like me like all of us were all guilty dont you think what is this i ask frowning original sin you becoming a catholic or something oh no cameron i believe were born free of sin and free of guilt its just that we all catch it eventually there are no clean rooms for morality cameron no boys in bubbles kept in a guiltfree sterile zone there are monasteries and nunneries and people become recluses but even thats just an elegant way of giving up washing ones hands didnt work two thousand years ago and it doesnt work today involvement cameron connection i shake my head staring at the little window in the walkman where the tape spindles are patiently revolving the strange thing is it is like talking to a dead man because he sounds like the andy i used to know andy the mover and shaper the andy from before clares death before he gave it all up and became a recluse its that voice calm and untroubled that im hearing now not that of the man i knew from that dark decaying hotel flat with resignation or audibly sneering with a kind of cynical despair mcdunns looking impatient hes writing something on his notebook listen andy i say swallowing mouth dry i told them about the guy in the woods theyve been down the air shaft they found him i know he says i saw he sounds almost regretful i close my eyes they almost caught me actually he says conversationally thatll teach me to break my own rules and attend the funeral of one of my victims but then it was supposed to be my own after all anyway you told them did you kind of thought you might one day that a weight off your mind is it cameron i open my eyes as mcdunn nudges me and shows me the two names hes written on his notebook yes i tell andy yes it is a weight off my mind listen andy they want to know whats happened to halziel and lingary oh yes he sounds amused thats why i called mcdunn and i exchange looks look andy i say i laugh nervously i kind of think youve made your point you know youve scared a lot of people cameron ive murdered a lot of people yeah yeah i know and a lot more are terrified to open their doors but the point is youve done it man i mean you might as well let these guys go you know just just let them go and and and you know im sure if we can just talk about this you know talk about talk about this andy says laughing oh stop gibbering cameron he sounds so relaxed i cant believe hes talking this long he must know they can trace calls really quickly these days what next he asks sounding amused are you going to suggest i give myself up and ill get a fair trial he laughs again andy all im saying is let those guys go and just fucking stop all this all right i mean what i said all right youll let them go i look at mcdunn hes raised his eyebrows a uniformed cop comes in the front door and whispers something to mcdunn who takes one of the earphones out to listen he looks annoyed yeah andy says theyre a boring couple of farts and i guess theyve suffered enough andy are you being serious of course he says youll get them back unharmed cant vouch for their mental state of course with any luck the bastardsll have nightmares for the rest of their lives but mcdunn looks pained he makes the waving keepgoing signal again listen andy i mean i guessed you were mr archer yes i used a voice synthesiser andy says patiently but all that ares stuff was it all a diversion cameron thats all hey he laughs maybe there was some heinous plot linking those five dead guys but if so ive no idea what it was and as far as i know theres no link between them and smout and azul pretty neat conspiracy theory though dont you think i know you hacks just love that sort of thing oh yeah had me fooled i smile weakly at mcdunn who motions me to keep talking but how did you i have to swallow again fighting my nausea i feel like ive got a coughing fit coming on too how did you know those ira codewords i never told you your computer cameron your pc you had them in a file on your hard disk made everything a lot easier when you got that modem dont think i ever told you id become a bit of a hacker in my spare time did i christ and that time i rang the hotel and you phoned back when you must have been in wales yes cameron he says sounding indulgently amused answermachine at the hotel linked to a pager called up the machine heard your message rang you back easypeasy and you were on the same plane as me to jersey four rows back in a wig glasses and tache got a taxi while you were still looking for the hirecar desk anyway he says and i imagine i can hear him sighing and stretching must dash this technical stuffs all very fascinating but i do have a faint suspicion theyre getting you to keep me talking im on a mobile which is why they havent traced it yet this is a biggish cell im in hey thats a coincidence isnt it cameron you in a cell last week me in one now well maybe not anyway as i say its a biggish cell but if i keep talking im sure they can find me here too eventually so andy no cameron just listen ill return halziel and lingary tonight in edinburgh theres a double call box in the grassmarket outside the last drop pub i want you to be in the coinoperated box at seven oclock you personally nineteen hundred hours tonight coinop box outside the last drop public house in the grassmarket edinburgh bye now the line goes dead i look at mcdunn who nods i put the phone down edinburgh on a cold november evening the grassmarket lightbright under a smir of rain below the castle a rotund floodlit presence in the orange darkness above the grassmarket is a kind of long square in the hollow southeast of the castle surrounded by mostly old buildings i can remember when it was a seedy rundown old place full of winos but its moved gradually upmarket over the years and its a fairly cool area to hang out now chic eateries good bars fashion outlets and shops specialising in things like kites or minerals and fossils though theres a still a homeless hostel round the corner so it hasnt been irredeemably gentrified the last drop is at the east end of the grassmarket near the splitlevel curve of victoria street home of yet more specialist shops including one that mystifyingly seems to provide a living selling only brushes brooms and very large balls of string the pubs name is less jolly and more witty than it sounds at first the city gallows used to be right outside no obvious cop cars around im sitting handcuffed to sergeant flavell in an unmarked senator with mcdunn and two plainclothes guys from lothian theres another unmarked car at the far end of the grassmarket several others nearby and a couple of vans full of uniform guys parked in side streets plus various cruising patrol cars in the vicinity they say theyve checked the box itself and all likely vantage points but im still worried that andys not finished with me yet that hes lying through his teeth and if i step into that telephone box ill get a rifle bullet through the head a plainclothes guy is in the box pretending to use it so itll be free when andy calls its already wired up so they can record everything i look at the facade of the last drop theres a new upmarket indian restaurant within sniffing distance too near where the old traverse theatre used to be a pint and a curry jesus my mouth waters were spitting distance from the cowgate and the kasbar too mcdunn looks at his watch seven oclock he says i wonder he breaks off as the cop in the phone box waves at us mcdunn grunts military precision he says then nods to flavell we get out of the car as the driver switches something on the radio producing a ringing tone in time with the one i can hear coming from the box flavell squeezes into the box with me while the other cop waits outside hello i say cameron yeah its me change of plans be in the same place at three oclock this morning youll get them back then click the line goes look at flavell three oclock did he say flavell says looking peeved think of the overtime i tell him they take me to a cop shop in chambers street about a minutes drive away i get fed and watered and put into a cell that look and smells of disinfectant the food they give me is crap gristly stew mushed potatoes and brussels sprouts but there is one wonderful thing theyve given me back my laptop mcdunns idea i try not to feel too pathetically grateful i check the files first nothing missing i give half a thought to going into xerion to try the mushroomcloudriding trick andy showed me but its only half a thought instead i go straight into despot i cant believe its the same game i feel my mouth open its a wasteland my kingdom is gone the land is still there some of the people are and the capital city designed in the shape giant crescents of buildings around two lakes so that from the air it says cc but something terrible seems to have happened the city is crumbling largely abandoned aqueducts fallen reservoirs cracked and dry districts flooded others burned down the activity taking place within the city is about what youd expect from town the countryside has either become desert or marsh or returned to forest huge areas are barren and where there is any agriculture its in the shape of tiny stripfields around little villages deep in the woods or on the fringe of the waste the ports are drowned or silted up the roads and canals have fallen into disrepair or just disappeared altogether the mines have caved in or been flooded all the cities and towns have shrunk back and all the temples all my temples are ruined dark abandoned bandits roam the land foreign tribes raid the provinces plagues are rife and the population is much smaller less productive and individually shorterlived the civilisation to the south that i had so many problems with seems to have retreated or relapsed as well but that is the extent of the good news the worst of it is theres no head man no despot no me i can look at all this but i cant do anything about it not on this scale to start playing again id have to trade this omniscient but omniimpotent view for that of god knows some tribal warrior village elder a mayor or a bandit chief i range over it all for a while looking down appalled somebody must have started it up just to look then left it running while they checked out the other stuff or maybe they tried to meddle played with the game but couldnt control it unless this is what they wanted what they designed i guess a radical green or deep ecologist would think its a pretty cool result the battery alarm beeps might have known they wouldnt have charged the damn thing up properly i watch the unfolding of my once great realm until the machine senses too little power to work with and closes itself down the screen fades out on the overhead view of my capital i watch my vainglorious ccshaped city just dissolve quietly into darkness they put the cell lights out a few minutes later i sleep on the narrow little metal cot with the laptop cradled in my arms three in the morning dry now but cold the police driver leaves the engine running and our exhaust smoke drifts into the air to one side on a chilly breeze the grassmarket is silent the car isnt the radio chirps now and again and i cant stop coughing the cop in the phone box waves bang on three corner of west port and bread street soon andy says then hangs up its walking distance but we take the car anyway pulling up outside the gas rock cafe bar nothing much here office buildings shops across the street another unmarked car is parked on bread street itself the vans with the uniformed police are parked on fountainbridge and the grassmarket and the various patrol vehicles are still cruising in the neighbourhood mcdunn takes a walk around then comes back to the car we have some coffee from a big thermos sipping it black it helps my cough a bit soon mcdunn says contemplatively looking into his plastic cup as if searching for coffee grounds to read thats what he said i tell him clearing my throat hmm mcdunn leans forward to the two guys in the front dont smoke do you lads no sir ill go outside to be unhealthy then thats all right sir no i want to stretch my legs anyway he looks at me colley smoke i cough again cant make me any worse handcuffed to the di i guess its a kind of promotion we light our fags and have a stroll down past the pub across the road to look in the window of a secondhand bookshop then walk up past a video shop a butchers and a sandwich shop all of them dark and quiet a taxi rattles past forhire light on heading into the grassmarket we stand leaning over the pedestrian barrier at the kerb the tenement buildings behind look rundown and from here i can see the victorian pile of the old coop building which closed just this year and the sixtiesmodern goldbergs department store shut down the year before doesnt even smell too good right here theres a wetfish shop just behind us and a chip shop down the road but upwind even the pavement looks greasy cant imagine theyll be bringing the euroheads of state down this neck of the woods for a blackpudding supper and a dirty video christ that beanos only three weeks away now bet the lothian police boys are enjoying this little outing when theyve got all that to look forward to i expected to be busy doing lots of euroarticles for the paper in the runup right about now ah well he had a good army record your friend mcdunn says after a while so did lieutenant calley i suggest the di ruminates upon this he studies the cone of his cigarette smoked down almost to the filter now do you think hes politically inspired your friend looks it up till now i stare up high riggs as another taxi comes bumping down towards us mcdunn folds his cigarette neatly against the railing of the barrier were leaning on i dont think its political i tell mcdunn i think its moral the di looks at me moral cameron he sucks through his teeth hes disillusioned i say he used to have lots of illusions and now hes got only one that what hes doing will make any difference hmm we turn to go i drop my fag to the greasy pavement and grind the butt out with my shoe then look up the lights of the cab turning out of high riggs and rattling down west port swing across behind us i stare mcdunns saying something but i cant hear what it is funny noise in my ears mcdunns tugging at my wrist with the handcuffs cameron i hear him say somewhere in the distance he says something else after that but i cant hear what it is theres this weird roaring noise in my ears highpitched but roaring cameron mcdunns saying but its still no good i open my mouth he taps me on the shoulder then holds my elbow finally he brings his head round in front of me putting his face between me and the fish shop cameron he says you all right i nod then shake my head i nod again pointing forward but when he looks he cant see anything the shop is dark and the street lights dont light up the interior ha i begin i try again have you got a torch i ask him a torch he says no got my lighter what is it i nod my head at the fishshop window again mcdunn flicks his lighter he peers in face close to the glass he shields his eyes with his other hand taking my hand with it cant see anything he says fish shop isnt it he glances up at the shops sign i nod back towards the unmarked car tell them to reverse up lauriston street and put full beam on on here i say mcdunn looks narroweyed at me then seems to see something in my face he waves to the car they put the window down and he tells them the car whines backward up lauriston street lights on full beam we turn away from the glare and stand just to one side of the shop front the fish shop has a pullup front window inside there is a single slab of what looks like green granite sloped a little off the horizontal where the fish are displayed when the shops open it has stubby rounded walls at each side and a little gutter at the bottom near the window on the slab there are bits of meat not fish i recognise liver ruddy chocolatebrown and silkylooking kidneys like dark grotesque mushrooms what is probably a heart and various other cuts of meat in steaks cubes and strips at top centre of the slab there is a large brain creamygreylooking good christ mcdunn whispers funny its that that brings the shivers not the sight not after that first glimpse and realisation in the taxis headlights i look back at the neat almost bloodless display i suspect even a sun reader would know none of this came from a fish im fairly sure its human but just to leave us in no doubt at bottom centre of the slab there is a mans genitalia uncircumcised penis small and shrivelled and greyyellow scrotum crumpled and brownpink and the two testes pulled out one to each side little eggshaped grey things like tiny smooth brains connected by slender convoluted pearly tubes to the scrotal sac so that the final effect is oddly like a diagram of ovaries connected to a womb halziel or lingary i wonder mcdunn says sounding a little croaky i look up at the sign fish i sigh the locum i tell him the doctor halziel i start coughing the lights behind us flash just as im about to ask him for another fag the car comes quickly across the street to us turns to face down west port and the passengers window opens again found one of them sir flavell says north bridge oh my god mcdunn says putting his free hand up to the back of his head he nods down the street to the other car get those lads here the other ones lying in this fish shop dissected he looks at me come on he says rather unnecessarily as were still handcuffed together in the car he unlocks the cuffs and pockets them without comment and so to north bridge slanting over the platforms and glass roofs of waverley station newly painted floodlit the link between the old and the new towns and barely a cobbles throw from the caley building there are two cop cars there already when we arrive theyre pulled up near the high end of the bridge on the west side where the view looks across the station and princes street gardens to the castle the decorated parapet of the bridge here holds a couple of large plinths one on either side on the east where during the day you can see salisbury crags the countryside of lothian and the scoop of the forth coast at musselburgh and prestonpans the plinth supports a memorial to the kings own scottish borderers a groupsculpture of four giant stone soldiers there is a similar plinth on the west side where the cop cars are blue lights strobing along the painted panels of the parapet and the grubby blond stonework of the plinth until now that plinth has been empty sitting there unoccupied and unused except to provide temporary parking for the odd wittily removed road cone or possibly a platform for an adventurous rugby fan to demonstrate highaltitude pissing from tonight though it has another role to play tonight it is the stage for andys tableau of major lingary retired in fulldress majors uniform but with the insignia torn off and with his sword lying broken beside him he has been shot twice in the back of the head mcdunn and i stand looking at him for a while in the morning at chambers street they feed me a fairly decent breakfast and give me back my own clothes i was back in the same cell for the rest of the night but this time the door wasnt locked theyre letting me go after a few statements the interview room at chambers street is smaller and older than the one at paddington green green painted walls lino floor im becoming something of a connoisseur of interview rooms and this one definitely wouldnt rate a star first theres a cid guy from tayside wanting to be told the whole story about the man in the woods who became the body in the tunnel gerald rudd the mans name was been on the missing persons list for twenty years assumed to have walked into the grampians and disappeared and ironically he really was a policeman if only parttime a special constable and scoutmaster from glasgow he was already under investigation for interfering with one of the boy scouts coffee at eleven they even send somebody out to get me fags then another statement punctuated by my coughs to a couple of lothian cid lads covering what i know about halziel and lingary they havent got much from last night inside the fish shop the display got even more bizarre andy had used the docs fingers to spell out i lied on the counter only the e gave him any problems and somebody saw a white escort driving away from the plinth on north bridge shortly before lingarys body was discovered the car was later found abandoned on leith walk theyre dusting the fish shop and the car but i dont expect theyll find anything mcdunn comes in with another plainclothes guy about half twelve he introduces the other cop as detective inspector burall from lothian theyre holding on to my passport and they still want me to keep them informed of my whereabouts in case the procurator fiscal decides to prosecute on the rudd case i have to sign for the passport im coughing a lot id get to a doctor about that cough mcdunn says sounding concerned i nod tears in my eyes from the coughing yeah i wheeze good idea after ive had a walk and a few pints maybe im thinking mr colley the lothian cop says hes a seriouslooking guy a bit older than me with very pale skin and thinning black hair im sure youll understand were concerned about andrew gould possibly still being in the city especially with the european summit coming up detective inspector mcdunn believes there is a chance andrew gould will attempt to contact you and even that he might try to attack or kidnap you i look at mcdunn whos nodding mouth compressed i have to admit the idea of andy paying a visit had occurred to me as well after that i lied burall continues wed like your permission to station a couple of officers at your flat for a while mr colley well put you up in a hotel if this is agreeable to you mcdunn sucks through his teeth and i almost want to laugh at the sound now i dont i cough instead i would advise you to say yes cameron mcdunn says frowning at me of course youll want to pick up some clothes and things first but the door swings opens and a uniform guy rushes in glances at me and whispers into mcdunns ear mcdunn looks at me what sort of present for you would he leave at torphin dale torphin dale i say the sickness comes back oh christ oh christ oh christ its like ive been kicked in the balls i have to struggle to make my mouth work thats where william and yvonne live the sorrells mcdunn stares at me for a moment address he says four baberton drive i tell him he glances up at the uniformed guy got that sir get some cars out there and get one for us then hes up out of his chair nodding at burall and me come on i stand up but my legs dont work too well as we walk quickly out of the station into a bright cold afternoon a uniformed driver runs out ahead of us pulling on a jacket and blipping the doors on an unmarked cavalier a present for me at torphin dale oh sweet jesus no come on get out the way now cameron mcdunn says burall puts the radio handset down mcdunn asked me for the telephone number of william and yvonnes house chambers street is ringing there now and theyll call us if they get through come on i mutter under my breath willing the road to clear for us the drivers doing his best weve a siren going and blue lights flashing behind the grille were darting in and out of the traffic and taking a few risks but theres just too much traffic what are all these people doing on the road why arent they at work or at home or on public transport cant the bastards walk we go wailing across the red lights at tollcross snarling traffic up in all directions take the rightturn lane heading up home street dodge a little old lady on the pedestrian crossing at bruntsfield and scream down colinton road through thinning traffic the radio gibbers away at us i lean forward trying to listen a patrol cars there at the house no sign of anybody my hands are hurting i look down and see theyre clenched tight tendons standing out on my wrist i sit back thrown to one side as we swerve for a car coming suddenly out of a side street the radio tells us the garage doors are open at the house the beat cops cant get any answer at the front door we sweep across the bypass im sitting back in the seat staring at the headlining of the cars roof coughing now and again tears in my eyes oh christ andy please no we enter the executive development of torphin dale between the tall sandstone gateposts of the old estate on baberton drive everything looks the way i remember it apart from the orangeandwhite parked in the short driveway from the bottom of the culdesac to the house the three garage doors are all tipped open i dont know why but this gives me a bad feeling williams merc is there yvonnes isnt we pull into the drive it takes a second for me to remember that im not handcuffed to anybody the driver stays in the cavalier talking into the radio a uniformed cop comes down the drive from the front door nodding to burall and mcdunn no answer sir we havent looked inside yet my mates round the back looking in the garden there a door from the garage to the rest of the house mcdunn asks looks like it sir mcdunn looks at me you know these people cameron they in the habit of leaving the place unattended like this i shake my head pretty securityconscious i tell him mcdunn sucks on his teeth we walk into the garage under the tipup doors the usual garage stuff if youre filthy nouveau riche packing cases golfing gear the jet ski on its trailer a work bench a grid on the wall holding neatly arrayed car and garden tools most of them gleaming and unused pairs of skiboot bags and ski bags hanging from the wall a steamcleaning outfit a little minitractor lawn mower a big greyblack wheelie bin and a couple of mountain bikes the triple garage is huge but still cluttered if yvonnes car was here it would be positively crowded mcdunn knocks at the door into the rest of the house he frowns looks back at burall we got any disposable gloves with us at all in the car burall says and jogs back to the cavalier youve been here before have you cameron mcdunn asks yes i say coughing right let us know about any nooks and crannies will you i nod burall comes back with a handful of the sort of gloves you can buy at service stations for working on the car we all get a pair even me mcdunn opens the door and we go into the utility room nothing in the cupboards in the utility room nothing in the kitchen the four of us spread through the house i stay with mcdunn we walk through the main lounge looking behind the curtains the couches under the tables even up inside the hood of the central fireplace we head upstairs we check one of the back bedrooms the officer in the rear garden walking back towards the house sees us he waves and makes a handsout shrugging motion shaking his head mcdunn inspects the drawers built into the divan bed i look in the builtin wardrobe sliding my mirrored image out of the way my heart in my mouth clothes just clothes hats and a few boxes we go to the main bedroom i try not to think about what we were doing here the last time i was in this room i have that roaring noise in my ears again and ive got a cold sweat and i feel like i could just collapse at any second i have a weird invasive feeling being here with the detective inspector clumbering around the expensively delicate domesticity of this house with no william or yvonne here i look in the dressing room while mcdunn checks under the bed then looks out onto the balcony i open the dressingroom wardrobes lots of clothes i pull them back hands shaking nothing i put the mirror doors back i walk towards the bathroom i put my hand on the door a pale pastel light shines from the room as the door starts to open cameron mcdunn says from the bedroom i retreat padding through leaving the door halfopen hes looking out the window towards the drive he glances at me nods car i go to the window a red bmw yvonnes car its as if the cars hesitating just in front of the drive put off by the patrol car and the unmarked cavalier parked in front of the garage then it parks across the bottom of the drive blocking our way out but leaving an escape route for itself mcdunn looks suspicious but i feel relieved if andy was here hes long gone thats an yvonne move and its her sweet jesus its her its her its her she gets out of the car holding a big black torch about two foot long her face set in a frown shes wearing jeans and a leather jacket over a sweatshirt shes had her hair cut again her sharp leanfeatured face is unmadeup and looks aggressively distrustful she looks wonderful that mrs sorrell mcdunn says quietly yes i say on an outrush of breath something in me easing i want to cry yvonne looks away up the drive as another patrol car swings in she puts the torch away as the car pulls to a stop and two uniformed officers get out she walks up to them nodding back to the house lets get down there and see what shes got to say shall we mcdunn says we go past the dressingroom door just a minute i say mcdunn waits as i go through the dressing room i press the door to the bathroom open the pale light spills out onto me nothing i look in the shower the jacuzzi the bath nothing i take a swallow and a deep breath and join mcdunn to head downstairs cameron yvonne says as we get to the bottom of the stairs shes putting a newspaper and a couple of pints of milk down on the telephone table the two cops from the second car are behind her she glances at mcdunn then comes up to me hugs me holding me tight are you all right fine are you yes she says what is all this somebody from the paper said you were the man they were holding for all those murders she pulls away still with one arm round my waist why the police she looks at mcdunn detective inspector mcdunn he says nodding good afternoon mrs sorrell hello she looks at me stepping back but still holding my hand searching my face cameron you look she shakes her head sucking on her lips she looks around and says wheres william mcdunn and i exchange looks detective inspector burall comes downstairs saying nothing up there as he sees yvonne she lets go of my hand taking a step back and looking around at all of us as the cop from the first patrol car comes into the hall from the study and i see her gaze falling on my transparently gloved hands and on the hands of the other men theres an instant when i suddenly see her as a young woman in her own home surrounded by all these men whove invaded it just turned up uninvited all bigger than her all strangers except for one shes been told might be a serial killer she looks wary angry defiant all at once my heart feels fit to melt was your husband here when you left mrs sorrell mcdunn asks in a comfortingly natural voice yes she says still looking round us all settling on me evaluating enquiring before looking back to mcdunn he was here i only left about half an hour ago i see mcdunn says well hes probably popped out for a moment but we had a message that there might be some problem here we took the lib hes not in the garden she asks apparently not no well you dont just pop out from this estate detective inspector yvonne says the nearest shops are ten minutes drive away and his cars still there she looks at the cop who was upstairs youve been searching for him searching the house mcdunn is all charm yes mrs sorrell we have and i apologise for this invasion of privacy its entirely my responsibility the investigation were involved in is a very serious one and the tipoff we had was from a source that has been reliable in the past as the house was open but apparently unoccupied and we had reason to believe there might have been a crime committed i thought it right to enter but so you havent found him yvonne says you havent found anything she looks suddenly small and frightened i can see her fighting it and i love her for it and want to hold her shush her comfort her but another part of me is full of a terrible jealous despair that the person shes so concerned about is william not me not yet mrs sorrell mcdunn says what was he doing when you last saw him i see her swallowing see the tendons on her neck stand out as she tries to control herself he was in the garage she says he was going to take the honda out the wee tractor and sweep up leaves in the back garden mcdunn nods well well just have a look shall we he looks at the two cops whove just arrived and holds up one hand flexing it gloves lads the two cops nod and head back for the front door the rest of us troop towards the garage through the hall and the kitchen my feet feel like theyre wading through treacle and that roaring noise is coming back i try not to start coughing mcdunn stops at the utility room he looks slightly embarrassed mrs sorrell he says smiling i couldnt ask you to put a kettle on could i yvonne stands looking at him she looks hard and suspicious she swivels on her heel and marches towards the work surface where the kettle is mcdunn opens the door into the garage and i see the mercedes and im thinking the car the boot of the car i see the packing cases christ there too i dont feel so good i start coughing mcdunn and the officers look in the packing cases and the car and its like theyre not seeing the big black wheelie bin i stand to one side and lean against the wall listening to them talk watching them open and lift and peer and that big black bin is just standing there ignored bulking dark against the light of the day outside where a breeze stirs swirling dust and leaves into the air pushing a few of the leaves onto the whitepainted garage floor mcdunn looks under the car burall and the other cop are removing some of the packing cases and tea chests against the wall to look in the ones beneath the two cops from the second patrol car are walking up the drive pulling on plastic gloves i push myself away from the wall when i cant take it any longer just as yvonne comes into the garage from the house i stagger across to the fat chesthigh bin i can feel the others looking at me and sense yvonne behind me im coughing as i put my hand on the bins smooth plastic handle i lift it a rotting fishy smell comes out faint and tinged with other scents the bin is empty i stare into it perversely shocked reeling back i let the lid fall i bump into yvonne and she holds me the breeze eddies in through the open garage doors again one of the poised garage doors creaks then something snaps overhead and the middle door swings suddenly down in the faces of the two policemen coming up the drive making me flinch and step back and as that middle section of the light closes off and the door slams clanging down in a cloud of dust and yvonne gives a quick cutoff scream i see william william strapped to the internal bracing of the door with tape and twine round his wrists and ankles his head covered with a black rubbish bag tied tight round his throat with more black tape his body limp i turn away doubling up and coughing and coughing blood comes suddenly from my mouth splattering red on the white of the garage floor as in that particular instant of loneliness through my tears i see mcdunn come forward and put a hand on yvonnes shoulder she turns away from him and from william and from me and puts her hands up over her face chapter basra road the little speedboat swings round the low island the island is covered in whin and bramble and a few small trees mostly ash and silver birch greyblack walls and roofless ruins and a few slanted headstones and memorials are visible through the bushes and trees surrounded by ferns turning fawn and yellowing grass covered by brown fallen leaves a gunmetal sky looks down loch bruc constricts here amongst the low bare hills near the sea until it is only a hundred metres in breadth the little funeral isle fills most of this bend in the narrows william guns the engine once sending the speedboat surging ahead towards the little jetty which slants into the calm dark water the jettys stones look old theyre unevenly sized mostly very large and on the top surface of smooth dressed stone there are timeworn iron rings set into circular depressions on the shore behind us there is an identical slipway angling out from the end of a track through the trees and the reedclumped grass eilean dubh the dark isle william announces letting the boat drift in towards the island jetty old family burial ground on my mothers side he looks around at the gently sloped hills and the higher steeper mountains to the north a lot of this used to belong to them was that before or after the clearances william i ask both he grins andy sips whisky from his hipflask he offers me some and i accept andy smacks his lips and looks around giving the impression hes drinking in the silence nice place for a cemetery yvonne says shes frowning looking cold even though she has her ski gear on downplump jacket and big goretex mitts yeah i say in an approximation of a downhome american accent kinda morbid for a graveyard isnt it bill old buddy couldnt ya kinda liven it up a bit know what i mean a few neon gravestones talking holograms of the departed and hey lets not forget a flower concession stand featuring tasteful plastic blooms a ghosttrain ride for the youngsters necroburgers made with real dead meat in coffinshaped polystyrene packs highspeedboat trips in the funeral barge used in dont look now the movie funny you should say that actually william says tossing his blond hair back and leaning out to fend the stone jetty off with his hand i used to run boat trips out here from the hotel he puts a couple of white plastic fenders over the gunwales to protect the boat then steps up onto the slip holding the painter locals take to that all right andy asks standing up and pulling the stern of the boat closer in to the pier william scratches his head not really he secures the painter to one of the iron rings funeral party turned up one day while one lot were having a barbie bit of a fracas you mean this place is still used yvonne says accepting williams hand and being pulled up onto the slipway she tuts and looks away shaking her head oh hell yeah william says as andy and i get out too a little unsteadily it has to be said as we werent totally sober when we woke up around noon in williams parents house at the top of the loch and weve been getting stuck into the whisky in first my hipflask then his on the twentykilometre journey down the loch i mean william says flapping his arms thats why i wanted you guys to see this place this is where i want to be buried he smiles beatifically at his wife you too blueeyes if you want yvonne stares at him we could be buried together william says sounding happy yvonne frowns severely and walks past us heading towards the island youd only want to go on top as usual william laughs uproariously then looks briefly crestfallen as we follow yvonne onto the grass and head up to the ruined chapel i meant sidebyside he says plaintively andy chuckles and screws down the cap of the hipflask he looks thin and kind of hunched this visit to the west coast was my idea i invited myself and andy here for a long weekend with william and yvonne at williams parents place on the shores of the loch not so much for my own enjoyment i get jealous around william and yvonne when theyre in their weekendhorseplay mode but because it was the first idea id had for a break that andy didnt reject immediately clare died six months ago and apart from a month of nightclubbing in london which seemed to leave him more depressed than ever and certainly less wealthy and healthy andy hasnt left strathspeld since ive tried a dozen different ways of getting him away from the estate for a while but this was the only one that sparked any interest i think andy just plain likes yvonne and is sort of morbidly fascinated with william who spent a large part of the journey down the loch telling us about his nonethical investment policy deliberately putting money into arms businesses tobacco companies exploitative mining industries rainforest timber concerns that sort of thing his theory is that if the smart but ethical money is getting out the dividends have to get bigger for the smart but unscrupulous money that takes its place i assumed he was joking yvonne pretended not to listen but andy was taking him quite seriously and from williams appreciative reaction i suspect the guy wasnt kidding at all we walk up between gravestones of various ages some are only a year or two old many date back to the last century and some are dated in the seventeen and sixteen hundreds others have been worn smooth by the elements their text levelled and obliterated back into the grainy nap of the rock some of the stones are just flat irregular slabs and you get the impression that if the poor people who erected these and could not afford a stonemason could write and did carve the names and dates of their loved ones on such slabs the letters and numerals must only have been scratched onto the surface of the stone i stand looking at some long flat gravestones set into the ground with crude depictions of skeletons chiselled into them other carvings are of skulls and scythes and hourglasses and crossed bones most of the horizontal stones are covered in grey black and light green lichens and mosses there are a couple of family plots where more affluent locals have walled off bits of the little island and grander gravestones of marble and granite stand proud if theyre not covered by brambles some of the more recent graves still have wee cellophane parcels of flowers lying on them many have small granite flowerpots covered by perforated metal caps that make them look like giant pepperpots and a couple of these have dead faded flowers in them the walls of the ruined chapel barely come up to shoulderheight at one end beneath a gable wall with an aperture like a small window at the apex where a bell might have hung once there is a stone altar just three heavy slabs on the altar theres a metal bell greenblack with age and chained to the wall behind it looks rather like a very old swiss cowbell apparently some people nicked the old bell back in the sixties william told us last night in the drawing room of his parents house while we were playing cards and drinking whisky and talking about heading down the loch in the speedboat to the dark isle oxford students or something anyway according to the locals the guys couldnt sleep at night because they kept hearing the sound of bells and eventually they couldnt stand it and came back and replaced the bell in the chapel and they were all right again what a load of old nonsense yvonne said two two william said yes probably oh i dont know andy said shaking his head sounds pretty spooky to me one please thanks sounds like fucking tinnitus to me i said three ta dealer takes two william said he whistled oh baby look at these cards i take the old bell up and let it ring once a flat hollow appropriately funereal sound i set it carefully back down on the stone altar and look round the walled oblong of hill mountain loch and cloud silence no birds no wind in the trees nobody talking i turn slowly right round watching the clouds i think this is the most peaceful place i have ever been i walk out among the cold carved little stones to find yvonne standing glaring at a tall gravestone euphemia mcteish born died and her five children died in childbirth her husband died twenty years later andy strolls up drinking from his flask grinning and shaking his head he nods up to where william is standing on the wall of the chapel looking down the loch with a pair of small binoculars wanted to build a house here andy says he shakes his head what yvonne says here i say on a graveyard is he mad hasnt he read stephen king yvonne looks coldly at her distant husband he was talking about building a house up here but i didnt know it was here she looks away tried to persuade the local authority with a really good deal on a bunch of computers andy says chuckling but they wouldnt play for the moment hes had to settle for being allowed to get buried here yvonne draws herself up which might happen sooner than hes expecting she says and marches off towards the chapel where william is staring down into the buildings interior and shaking his head hard rain on a soft day it falls from the leaden overcast continual and drenching creating a huge rustling in all the grass bushes and trees around us williams body is laid to rest in the thick peaty soil of the dark isle according to the pathologists report he was clubbed unconscious and then suffocated yvonne beautiful and pale in slim black her face veiled nods to the mourners and their few soft words and murmurs something of her own the rain drums on my umbrella she glances at me catching my gaze for the first time since i got here i barely made it in time i had a hospital appointment for this morning yet more tests and had to drive hard across country towards rannoch and the west but i got here got to the sorrells home met williams father and brother and saw yvonne briefly but did not get a chance to talk to her before it was time for us all to set off for the circuitous drive round the mountains and down to the far end of the loch and the hotel there and the drive up the track to the slipway facing eilean dubh and the two little boats that shuttled us across the last one bringing the coffin the minister keeps the service short because of the rain and then its over and were queuing at the slip while the little rowing boats ferry us four at a time back to the mainland and yvonnes standing on those old smooth stones of the slanted pier receiving the condolences of the other guests i just stand there watching her we all look slightly ridiculous because as well as our formal black clothes all of us sport wellington boots some black most green to deal with the mudslicked grass of the island somehow yvonne looks dignified and attractive even in those though of course maybe thats just me its been a funny few days getting back to work trying to pick up the threads there having a long soultosoul with a very sympathetic eddie getting embarrassing slaps on the back and wewererootingforyous from colleagues and finding that frank had run out of amusing scottish placename spellchecks for me ive been staying with al and his wife in leith while the police stake out my flat but theres been no sign of andy meanwhile ive been to the doc and been sent for various tests at the royal infirmary nobodys mentioned the cword yet but i feel suddenly vulnerable and mortal and even old ive given up smoking well al and i had a pipe or two of dope the other night just for old times sake but there was no tobacco involved anyway im still coughing a lot and i get a sick feeling now and again but theres been no more blood since that afternoon we found william i shake yvonnes hand as i wait for my return trip in the wee rowing boat the fine black tracery of her veil scattered with tiny black gathered specks makes her look at once mysteriously distant and rawly seductive rain or no rain wellies or no wellies through the trees on the mainland i can see and hear the cars reversing and manoeuvring and bumping away back down the track to the village and the hotel the tradition is that yvonne as the widow is last onto the last boat sort of like a captain and a sinking ship i guess you all right she asks me eyes narrowed her sharp evaluating gaze flitting over my face surviving and you the same she says she looks cold again and small i want so much to take her in my arms and hug her i feel tears prick behind my eyes im selling the house she tells me looking briefly down long black lashes flickering the companys opening a euro office in frankfurt im going to be part of the team ah i nod not sure what to say ill drop you a line with my new address once im settled right good okay i nod theres a splashing swirling sound behind me and a soft hollow bumping noise well i say any time youre in edinburgh she shakes her head and looks away then smiles gallantly for me and tips her head indicating thats your boat cameron i just stand there nodding like an idiot wanting to say the one right thing that must exist for me to change all of this make it good make it all better make it eventually happen happily for us but knowing that that thing just doesnt exist and theres no point looking for it and so just stand there nodding dumbly with my lips trapped compressed between my teeth looking down not able to look her in the eyes and knowing thats it the end goodbye until after those moments she puts me out of my misery and puts out her hand and gently says goodbye cameron and i nod and shake her hand and after a while i get my mouth to work and it says goodbye i hold her hand one last time just for a moment the hotel at that end of the loch is full of dead stuffed fish in glass cages and mangylooking taxidermised otters wild cats and eagles i dont know many people and i think yvonnes avoiding me so i have a single whisky and a few sandwiches then i leave the rain is still torrential i have my wipers on quicktime but even so theyre hardly coping the moisture coming off my brolly and coat lying puddling on the back seat is fighting a pretty equal battle with the heater and blower to mist up the glass on the inside i get about fifteen miles on the singletrack road round the mountains when the engine starts to misfire i glance at the instruments half a tank of fuel no warning lights oh no i groan come on baby come on dont let me down come on come on i tap the cars dashboard gently encouragingly come on now come on im heading up a slight hill into a stretch of road through a forestry commission plantation when the engine does a passable impression of me in the morning coughing and spluttering and not quite firing on all cylinders then it dies completely i coast quickly to a stop in a passing place oh christ shit i yell slamming the dashboard then feeling stupid the rain makes machinegun noises on the roof i try starting the engine but theres just another bout of coughing from under the bonnet i release the bonnetcatch put my coat back on take up the sopping umbrella and get out the engine makes little metallic creaking tinking noises steam wisps up as raindrops hit the exhaust manifold i test the plug leads and look for something obvious like a loose wire it doesnt appear to be anything obvious i dont think ive heard of anybody in a situation like this ever finding it was something obvious i hear an engine and look round the side of the raised bonnet to see a car heading in the same direction as me i dont know whether to try and wave them down or not i settle for just looking pleadingly at the approaching car its one guy in a beatenup micra he flashes his lights and pulls in ahead of me hi i say as he opens the door and gets out pulling on an anorak and shoving a deerstalker hat on hes redhaired bearded it just stopped i tell him ive got fuel but it just cut out could be the rain i suppose my voice trails off as i suddenly think christ it might be him it might be andy this could be him disguised come for me what am i doing why didnt i get round to the boot and get out the fucking tyreiron the instant the car stopped why arent i carrying a baseball bat a can of mace anything i stare at the guy thinking is it him is it hes the right height the right build i stare at his cheek and his red beard trying to see a join trying to see glue aye he says stuffing his hands in his anorak pockets and glancing down the road ye goat any wd pal he nods at the engine looks like yon bit there could do with some im staring at him my heart pounding theres a weird roaring noise in my head and i can hardly hear him over it his voice sounds different but he was always good at accents my belly feels like a solid chunk of ice and my legs like theyre about to buckle and give way im still staring at the guy oh christ oh christ oh christ id run but my legs wont work and he was always faster than me anyway he frowns at me and i feel like ive got tunnel vision all i can see is his face his eyes his eyes just the right colour just the right look then he changes somehow seems to straighten and relax and in a voice i recognise says ah very perceptive cameron i dont see what he hits me with just his arm swinging round at me quick and blurring as a striking snake the blow lands above my right ear and fells me sends me folding down in a galaxy of flickering stars and a huge growling swell of noise as if im falling through the air towards a great waterfall i twist as i fall and hit the engine but it doesnt hurt and i slide off it and down and fall towards the puddles and the road and i hit the road but i dont feel that either oh god help me here on the island of the dead with the cries of the tormented here with the angel of death and the acrid stench of excrement and carrion taking me back in the darkness and the pale fawn light to the place i never wanted to go back to the manmade earthly black hell and the human scrapyard kilometres long here down amongst the dead men midstways with the tornsouled and their wild inhuman screams here with the ferryman the boatman my eyes covered and my brains scrambled here with this prince of death this prophet of reprisal this jealous vengeful unforgiving son of our bastard commonwealth of greed help me help me help me my head hurts like buggery my hearing feels blurred thats not the right word but it is eyes shut they were shut with something earlier shut by something but not any more at least i dont think so i sense light beyond my eyelids im lying on my side on something hard and cold and gritty im cold and my hands and feet are tied or taped i shiver uncontrollably scraping my cheek across the chill granular floor bad taste in mouth the air smells sharp and i can hear i can hear the dead men hear their flayed souls wailing on the wind to no ear save mine and no understanding at all the view behind my eyelids goes from pink to red then purple into black and is suffused with a rumbling shift into a terrible tearing roaring noise shaking the ground filling the air pounding my bones dark going dark black stinking hell o mum o dad o no no please dont take me back there and im there in the one place ive hidden from myself not that cold day by the hole in the ice or the other day in the sunlit woods near the hole in the hill days deniable because i was then not yet the me i have become but just eighteen months ago the time of my failure and my simple shaming incapacity to reap and work the obvious power of what i was observing the place that exposed my incompetence my hopeless inability to witness because i was there i was part of it just a year and a half ago after months and months of badgering cajoling and entreating sir andrew he finally let me go when the deadline was up and the trucks and tracks and tanks were about to roll i got my wish i got to go i was given the chance to do my stuff and show what i was made of to be a genuine frontline journalist a rootintootintokintipplin godbijayzuz gonzo war correspondent bringing the blessed saint hunters manic subjectivity to the ultimate in scarifying human edgework modern warfare and forgetting the fact the drinks were few and far between and that the whole mediamanaged event was so unsportingly onesided and mostly happened far away from any journos tendance gonzoid or not when it came to it and it did come to it i did have my chance it was put right there in front of me practically screaming at me to fucking write something i couldnt do it couldnt hack it as a hack i just stood there awestruck horrorstruck absorbing the ghastly force of it with my inadequate and unprepared private humanity not my public professional persona not my skill not the face i had laboured to prepare to face the sea of faces that is the world and so i was humbled scaled downsized i stood on the sunless desert beneath a sky black from horizon to horizon a rolling heavy sulphurous sky made solid and soiled packed with the thick stinking effluence squeezed erupting from the earths invaded bowels and in that darkness at noon that planned deliberated disaster with the balefire light of the burning wells flickering in the distance with a dirty guttering flame i was reduced to a numb dumb realisation of our unboundedly resourceful talent for bloody hatred and mad waste but stripped of the means to describe and present that knowledge i crouched on the tarblack grainy stickiness of the plundered sands within scorching distance of one of the wrecked wells watching the way the fractured black metal stub in the centre of the crater gouted a compressed froth of oil and gas in quick shuddering instantly dispersing bursts and bubbles of brownblack spray into the furious screaming tower of flame above a filthy hundredmetre cypress of fire shaking the ground like a neverending earthquake and bellowing madly in a strident jetengine shriek shuddering my bones and jarring my teeth and making my eyes tremble in their sockets my body shook my ears rang my eyes burned my throat was raw with the acidbitter stench of the evaporating crude but it was as though the very ferocity of the experience unmanned me unmade me and rendered me incapable of telling it later on the basra road by that vast linearity of carnage a single strip of junkyard destruction stretching again from horizon to horizon on the flat dun face of that dusty land i wandered the scorched perforated wreckage of the cars and vans and trucks and buses left after the as and the cobras and the tows and the miniguns and the thirtymill cannons and the cluster munitions had had their unrestrained way with their unarmoured prey and saw the brownburned metal the few bubbled patches of sooty paint the torn chassis and rippedopen cabs of those hondas and nissans and leylands and macks their tyres slack and flattened or quite gone burned to the steel cording inside i surveyed the spattered shrapnel of that communal ruin rayed out across the sands and i tried to imagine what it must have been like to be caught here beaten retreating running desperately away in those thinskinned civilian vehicles while the missiles and shells rained in like supersonic sleet and the belching fire burst billowing everywhere around i tried too to imagine how many people had died here how many shredded cindered bodies and bits of bodies had been bagged and removed and buried by the cleanup squads before we were allowed to see this icon of that long days slaughter i sat on a low dune for a while maybe fifty metres away from the devastation on the strip of ripped bubbled road and tried to take it all in the laptop sat on my knee screen reflecting the grey overcast the cursor winking slowly at the topleft edge of the blank display i gave it half an hour and still couldnt think of anything that would describe how it looked and how i felt i shook my head and stood up twisting back to dust my pants the black charred boot was a couple of metres away halfburied in the sand when i picked it up it was surprisingly heavy because it still had the foot inside it i wrinkled my nose at the stink and let it drop but it still didnt help didnt break the logjam didnt ha kickstart the process nothing did i filed a minimum of uninspired warishellandfranklysoispeaceifyourefemaleouthere stories from the hotel and smoked some mindbendingly powerful dope i got from an affable palestinian helper who as soon the journos left was picked up by the kuwaiti authorities tortured and deported to lebanon when i got back sir andrew told me he wasnt at all impressed with the stuff id filed they could have run ap stories for a lot less money and just as much impact i didnt have an argument against this and so had to sit there and take the old mans verbal battering for half an hour and even though at the time i knew it was wrong unjustifiable and a feeble contemptible piece of selfimportant selfpity for a while under that withering deluge of professional contempt i felt like something trapped and pulverised amongst the dust and greasy ashes on the basra road im hearing the cries of the dead men above the roar of the screeching broken wellheads and i smell the thick cloying brownblack oil and the sweet gagging odour of corruption then the cries turn to the calls of seagulls and the smell to that of the sea with an acrid overtone of birdshit im still tied up i open my eyes andy is sitting across from me his back against a rough concrete wall the floor underneath us is concrete as is the roof there is a doorway to andys left no door just a pitted aperture to the sunlight outside i can see more concrete buildings all derelict and a skinny concrete tower spattered with seagull droppings beyond there are chopping waves rolling white at their tops and a glimpse of distant land the wind sighs through the doorway over little stones and shards of glass i can hear waves hitting rocks i blink looking at andy he smiles my hands are tied behind my back my ankles are taped together i work back to the wall behind me and lever myself up until im sitting too i can see more of the water outside now and more land a faraway scatter of houses a couple of buoys bobbing in the windpatterned water and a small coastal freighter heading away i work my mouth it tastes foul i blink start to shake my head to try and clear some of the fuzziness but then think the better of it my head aches and throbs how are you feeling andy asks me fucking awful what do you expect could be worse oh im sure i say and feel very cold i close my eyes and put my head carefully back against the chilly concrete of the wall my heart feels like its beating air too fast and faint to be propelling anything as thick as blood air i think christ hes injected me with air im going to die heart thrashing on foam on froth on air brain dying starved of oxygen sweet jesus no but a minute or so passes and while i still dont feel too good i dont die either i open my eyes again andy is still sitting there hes wearing brown cord trousers a combat jacket and hiking boots theres a big camouflaged rucksack against the wall a metre to his left and a halffull bottle of mineral water in front of him by his right hand theres a cellphone by his left a gun i dont know very much about handguns beyond the difference between a revolver and an automatic but i think i recognise that grey pistol i think its the one he had that night a week or two after clare died when he was all set to take vengeance right then on doctor halziel maybe im thinking now should have let him im still wearing what i was when he kidnapped me black suit dirty and stained now and a white shirt hes removed my tie my drizabone is lying neatly folded but looking scruffy a metre to my right he stretches out one leg and his hiking boot touches the water bottle he taps it water he says i nod he gets up takes the top off the bottle and holds it to my lips i glug down a few mouthfuls then nod and he takes it away he sits back where he was he takes a bullet out of his combat jacket and starts turning it over and over in his fingers he takes a deep sighing breath and says so cameron i try to get comfortable my hearts still beating like hell and making my head pound my bowels are threatening terrible things and i feel kittenweak but im fucked if im going to plead with him actually im probably fucked no matter what i do and being realistic when it comes to it ill probably plead like a little kid but for now i might as well tough it out you tell me andy i keep my voice neutral what happens now what have you got in store for me he grimaces and shakes his head frowning down at the bullet in his hand oh im not going to kill you cameron i cant help it i laugh its not much of a laugh more of a gasp with pretensions but it raises my spirits oh yeah i say like you were going to give back halziel and lingary unharmed he shrugs cameron that was just tactics he says reasonably they were always going to die he smiles shaking his head at my naivety i inspect him hes cleanshaven and fitlooking he looks younger than he did a lot younger younger than he was when clare died so if youre not going to kill me andy what i ask him hmm give me aids chop off my fingers so i cant type i take a breath i hope youve taken into account the advances in computer voicerecognition which are making keyboardfree word processing a realistic possibility in the near future andy grins but theres something cold in it im not going to hurt you cameron he says and im not going to kill you but i need something from you i stare meaningfully at my tapedtogether ankles uhhuh what he looks down at the bullet again i want you to listen to me he says quietly its as though hes embarrassed he shrugs and looks me in the eye thats all really okay i say i flex my shoulders grimacing could i listen with my hands untied andy purses his lips then nods he takes a long knife out of his boot it looks like a thin bowie knife the blade is very shiny he squats while i turn round and the knife slices slickly through the tape i tear the rest off taking some hairs with it my hands tingle i look at my watch jesus how hard did you hit me its half nine in the morning the day after the funeral not that hard andy tells me i kept you under with ether for a while then you just seemed to sleep he sits back where he was sliding the knife back into his boot i put one hand out and lean to the side looking out the doorway i squint into the distance christ thats the fucking forth bridge somehow its a relief that i can see the bridges and know homes only a few miles away were on inchmickery andy says off cramond he looks around place was a gun battery during both wars these are old army buildings he smiles again you get the occasional adventurous yachtsman trying to make a landing but there are a couple of boltholes they cant find he pats the wall behind him makes a good base now the hotels gone mind you its under the flight path for the airport and i suspect the security boysll want to give it the onceover before the eurosummit so im bailing out today one way or the other i nod trying to think back i dont like the sound of that one way or the other do i remember you bringing me here in a boat i ask he laughs well i dont have access to a helicopter he grins yes an inflatable hmm he looks to each side as if checking the gun and the phone are still there so sitting comfortably he asks me well no but dont let it put you off he gives a small smile that disappears quickly im going to give you a choice later cameron he says sounding calm and serious but first i want to tell you why i did all those things uhhuh i want to say its perfectly fucking obvious why you did them but i keep my mouth shut it was lingary of course first andy says looking younger still now and staring down at his hand and the bullet i mean id met people i despised in the past people i had no respect for and who i thought well the world would be a better place without them but i dont know maybe i was being naive and expected that in a war especially in a professional army it would somehow be better people would rise above themselves stretch their own moral envelope you know i nod cautiously im thinking moral envelope coastspeak but of course its not true andy says rubbing the little copper and brass shape of the bullet between his fingers war is a magnifier a multiplier decent people act more decently bastards get to be even bigger bastards he waves one hand im not talking about all that banalityofevil stuff organised genocide is different i mean just ordinary warfare where the rules are obeyed and the truth is that some people do rise above themselves but others sink beneath themselves they dont gain they dont shine the way some people do in combat and they dont even muddle through the way most people do scared to death but doing their job because theyve been well trained and because their mates are depending on them they just have their faults and weaknesses exposed and in certain circumstances if that person is an officer and his flaws are of a particular type and hes risen to a certain level without ever encountering a real battlefield those faults can lead to the deaths of a lot of men we all have moral responsibility whether we like it or not but people in power in the military in politics in professions whatever have an imperative to care or at least to exhibit an officially acceptable analogue of care duty i suppose it was people i knew had abused that responsibility that i attacked thats what i was taking as my authority he shrugs frowns the situation was a little different with oliver the porn merchant that was partly to throw them off the scent and partly because i just despised what he was doing and the judge well he wasnt quite so culpable as the others i was comparatively lenient with him the rest they were all powerful men all rich several of them very rich indeed all of them had all they could ask for in life but they all wanted more which is okay i suppose its just a failing you cant kill people for that alone but they all treated people like shit literally like shit something unpleasant to be disposed of it was like theyd forgotten their humanity and could never find it again and there was only one way to remind them of it and remind all the others like them and make them feel frightened and vulnerable and powerless the way they made other people feel all the time he holds the bullet up in front of his face peering at it there wasnt one of those men who hadnt killed people indirectly the way the nuremberg nazis mostly did but definitely unarguably beyond any reasonable doubt and halziel he says taking a deep breath well you know about him jesus andy i say i know i should shut up and let him talk on as much as he likes but i cant help it the guy was a selfish bastard and a lousy doctor but he was incompetent not malicious he didnt hate clare or anything or wish her but thats just it andy says holding his hands out if a certain level of skill of competence translates into the gift of life or death it becomes malice when you dont bother to exercise that skill because people are relying on you to do just that but he holds up one hand to me forestalling and nods ill admit to a level of personal vengeance there once id done all the others and i reckoned i didnt have much longer to operate overground as it were well it just seemed the right thing to do he looks up at me a strange wideeyed open smile on his face im shocking you arent i cameron i gaze into his eyes for a while then look away out the doorway towards the water and the small white shapes of the circling crying birds no i tell him not as much as when i realised it was you whod spiked bissett like that and it was you behind that gorilla mask and you who burned howie howie didnt suffer andy says matteroffactly i stoved his head in with a log first he grins probably saved him from a terrible hangover i stare at him feeling sick and close to tears at the offhanded way the man ive always thought of as my best friend is talking about murder and also feeling pretty vulnerable and at risk myself right now too no matter what hes said and even though he has untied my hands andy reads my expression he was a cunt cameron he pauses looks at the ceiling no thats not fair and thats what he usually called women as well so lets say he was a prick a dickhead and a violent prick a vindictive bullying dickhead at that over the years he broke his wifes jaw both her arms and her collarbone he fractured her skull and he kicked her when she was pregnant he was just an unmitigated pigfuck of a man he was probably battered as a kid himself he never talked about it but fuck him thats what were human for so we can choose to alter our behaviour he wouldnt do it himself so i did it for him andy i say for christs sake there are laws there are courts i know theyre not perfect but oh laws andy says voice saturated with scorn laws based on what with what authority well how about democracy for example democracy a twoway choice between tough shit and notquitesotough shit every four or five years if youre lucky thats not what democracy is its not just that its a free press and we have that dont we andy laughs except the bits that are free arent read very much and the bits that are most read arent free let me quote you theyre not newspapers theyre comics for the semiliterate propaganda sheets controlled by foreign billionaires who just want to make as much money as technically possible and maintain a political environment conducive to that single aim all right i stand by that but its still better than nothing oh i know it is cameron he says sitting back and looking slightly shocked at being so misunderstood i know it is and i know that what powerful people can get away with they will get away with and if the people they exploit let them well in a sense that serves them right but dont you see he jabs himself in the chest that includes me he laughs im part of it too im a product of the system im just another human being a bit better off than most a bit smarter than most maybe a bit luckier than most but just another part of the equation another variable that societys thrown up so i come along and i do what i can get away with because it seems fit to me to do it because im like a businessman you see im still a businessman im addressing a need ive seen a niche in the market unfilled and im filling it wait wait hold on i say im not buying this crap about fulfilling a need anyway but the point about the difference between your authority and everybody elses is that youre just you youve made up all this this rationale by yourself the rest of us have had to come to some sort of agreement a consensus were all trying to get along because thats the only way for people to exist together at all andy smiles slowly numbers make the difference do they cameron so when the two greatest nations on earth over half a billion people were so scared of each other they were quite seriously prepared to blow up the world they were right he shakes his head cameron id be prepared to bet that more people believe elvis is still alive than subscribe to whatever flavour of secular humanism you currently think represents the one true way for humanity and besides where has this consensus of yours brought us he frowns and looks genuinely mystified come on cameron he chides you know the evidence the world already produces we already produce enough food to feed every starving child on earth but still a third of them go to bed hungry and it is our fault that starvations caused by debtor countries having to abandon their indigenous foods to grow cash crops to keep the world bank or the imf or barclays happy or to service debts run up by murdering thugs who slaughtered their way into power and slaughtered their way through it usually with the connivance and help of one part of the developed world or another we could have something perfectly decent right now not utopia but a fairly equitable world state where there was no malnutrition and no terminal diarrhoea and nobody died of silly wee diseases like measles if we all really wanted it if we werent so greedy so racist so bigoted so basically selfcentred fucking hell even that selfcentredness is farcically stupid we know smoking kills people but we still let the drug barons of bat and philip morris and imperial tobacco kill their millions and make their billions smart educated people like us know smoking kills but we still smoke ourselves ive given up i tell him defensively though its true im dying for a cigarette cameron he says laughing with a kind of desperation dont you see im agreeing with you i listened to all your arguments over the years and youre right the twentieth century is our greatest work of art and we are what weve done and look at it he puts a hand through his hair and sucks breath through his teeth the point is there is no feasible excuse for what we are for what we have made of ourselves we have chosen to put profits before people money before morality dividends before decency fanaticism before fairness and our own trivial comforts before the unspeakable agonies of others he stares pointedly at me and his brows flex i nod reluctantly recognising something i wrote once so he says in that climate of culpability that perversion of moral values nothing nothing i have done has been out of place or out of order or wrong i open my mouth to speak but he waves his hand and with a faint sneer says i mean what am i supposed to do cameron wait for the workers revolution to make everything right thats like judgement day it never fucking comes and i want justice now i dont want these bastards dying a natural death he takes a deep breath and looks at me quizzically so how am i doing so far cameron do you think im mad or what i shake my head no i dont think youre mad andy i tell him youre just wrong he nods slowly at this looking at the bullet hes turning over and over in his fingers youre right about one thing i tell him you are one of them maybe this spottinganicheinthemarket stuff isnt so fatuous after all but is a sick response to a sick system really the best we can do you think youre fighting it but youre just joining in theyve poisoned you man theyve taken the hope out of your soul and put some of their own greedy hate in its place soul did you say cameron he smiles at me you getting religion no i just mean the core of you the essence of who you are theyve infected it with despair and im sorry you cant see any better response than to kill people not even when they deserve it no i still dont believe in capital punishment andy well they do he sighs and i suppose i do and what about hope do you believe in that he looks disparaging what are you bill clinton he shakes his head oh i know theres goodness in the world too cameron and compassion and a few fair laws but they exist against a background of global barbarism they float on an ocean of bloody horror that can tear apart any petty social construction of ours in an instant thats the bottom line thats the real framework we all operate within even though most of us cant or wont recognise it and so perpetuate it were all guilty cameron some more than others some a lot more than others but dont tell me we arent all guilty i resist the urge to say whos sounding religious now instead i ask and what was william guilty of andy frowns and looks away being everything he claimed to be he says sounding bitter for the first time william wasnt a personal score like halziel or lingary he was one of them cameron he meant everything he ever said i knew him better than you did when it mattered and he was quite serious about his ambitions buying a knighthood for example hed been giving money to the conservative party for the past ten years he gave money to labour too last year and this because he thought they were going to win the election but hed been putting respectable amounts into tory coffers for a decade as well as keeping an eye on how much the average successful businessman has to donate to ensure a knighthood he once asked me which charity hed be best advised to join to provide the usual excuse wanted one that didnt encourage scroungers this was all longterm but that was the way william thought he was still determined to build a house on eilean dubh and he even had a complicated scheme involving a front company and a threatened underground toxicchemicals store in the area which if it had worked would have had grateful locals practically begging him to take the island and a few times when he was drunk he talked about trading in yvonne for a more upmarket userfriendly model preferably one with her own title and a daddy in serious big business or the government his nonethical investment programme wasnt a joke either he pursued it vigorously andy shrugs it was just a coincidence that i knew him but i dont think there was any doubt william was going to turn into a man like the others i killed he rolls the bullet around in his palm eyes lowered however for what its worth if killing him screwed up things between you and yvonne im sorry oh i say that makes it all right then its meant to sound sarcastic but it just sounds dumb he nods not looking at me he was a very charming but actually quite an evil man cameron i stare at him for a while he rubs the bullet between his fingers finally i say yes but youre not god andy no im not he agrees nobody is he grins so what i close my eyes unable to bear the relaxed merely mischievous expression on his face i open them again and look out through the empty doorway at the water and the land and the ceaseless wheeling birds yeah i see well i say i dont think theres any point in trying to argue with you is there andy no youre probably right andy says suddenly all cheery decisiveness he slaps both knees and jumps up he lifts the gun and sticks it down the back of his cords he hoists the rucksack up and puts it over one shoulder he nods down at the cellphone lying on the concrete floor heres your choice he tells me phone and turn me in or not he waits for a reaction from me so i raise my eyebrows he shrugs im heading down to the boat now put the kit bag aboard he grins down at me take your time ill be back in ten fifteen minutes i stare at the phone on the littered floor its working he reassures me your choice he laughs ill be all right whatever leave me be and i dont know i might retire now while im ahead but on the other hand there are still a lot of bastards out there mrs t for one if that piques your interest cameron he smiles or theres always america land of opportunities on the other hand if i end up in jail well there are people in there id really like to meet too the yorkshire ripper for example if its possible to get to him id need just a small blade and about five minutes he shrugs again whatever see you in a bit he skips out into the sunlight and the swirling wind taking the steps two at a time down to a walkway between two concrete blockhouses i lean back as he disappears whistling i squat on my tapedtogether feet and lift the cellphone it looks charged and connected i dial the number of my mum and dads old house in strathspeld village i get an answermachine a mans voice gruff and curt i switch the phone off it takes a minute to get the tape off my ankles i lift my drizabone from the floor and dust it down then put it on the coattails flap round my legs as i stand in the doorway fife to my right the trees of dalmeny park and mons hill to my left and the two bridges ahead upstream one tensed webbedred and the other straightcurved battleship grey the firth is ruffled bluegrey the waves marching away wind blowing from behind out of the east two minesweepers are heading upstream under the bridge towards rosyth a huge tanker sits tall and unladen at the hound point oil terminal attended by a pair of tugs two huge cranebarges float nearby where theyve been most of this year installing a second terminal pier a small tanker is almost level with the island heading out to sea low in the water with some product from the grangemouth refinery north beyond inchcolm a redhulled lpg tanker sits at braefoot bay loading from the pipelines connected to the mossmorran plant a few kilometres inland position marked by white plumes of steam i watch all this maritime activity surprised at how industrial how continuingly mercantile the old river is above and around the seagulls bank and ride hanging in the air bills open crying to the wind the concrete blockhouses towers barracks and gun emplacements on the small island are all covered in seagullshit white and black yellow and green i rub the back of my head wincing as i touch the bump i look at the phone in my hand breathe in the sharp sea air and cough the cough goes on for a while then it goes away so what to do one more betrayal even if it is one that andy seems half to want or become in effect his accomplice and leave him free to murder and maim god knows who else a free radical in our systemic corruption what is to be done shake head colley look round this concrete dereliction and survey this breezily industrious river and try to find an inspiration a hint a sign or just something to take your mind off a decision youre sure to regret one way or another i punch the number into the phone various tones and beeps sound in my ear as i watch the clouds all moving away overhead then the connections made yes hello i say doctor girson please cameron colley i look around trying to see andy but theres no sign of him yes cameron thats right i was just wondering if you have the results through yet so you have well if you could just give me them now thatd be well over the phone why not well i do i think it is well its my body isnt it doctor i want to know now look let me ask you a direct question doctor have i got lung cancer doctor doctor no doctor look id really like a straight answer if you dont mind no i dont think please doctor have i got cancer no im not trying to no im just im just look have i got cancer have i got cancer have i got cancer have i got cancer the doctor loses his temper eventually and does the smart thing and hangs up see you tomorrow doc i sigh i switch the phone off and sit down on the step looking out to the water and the two long bridges under a blue and cloudstrewn sky a seal pops its head out of the water about fifty metres out into the waves it bobs there for a while looking at the island and maybe at me then it disappears back into the rolling grey water i look at the key pad of the cellphone and put my finger on the button for all i know andy is going to come back cheerfully say hi and then blow my brains out just on general principles i dont know my finger hovers over the button then retreats no i dont know i sit there for a while in the wind and the sunlight coughing now and again and looking out and holding the phone tightly in both hands chapter sleep when im dead at the heart of the grand grey elegance of this festive city there is a literal darkness an old void of disease despair and death beneath the eighteenthcentury highrise of the city chambers slotted into the steep hillside between the banked s of cockburn street and the cobbled width of high street opposite the cathedral of st giles there is a section of the old city which was walled up four hundred years ago mary kings close was abandoned and covered over in the sixteenth century left just as it was untouched because so many people had died of the plague in that part of the old towns swarming tenementwarrens the bodies consigned to the shared grave that their homes had become were simply left to rot and the bones only removed much later so in the glacierscoured debris east of the castlecrags volcanic plug deep underneath the civic core of this dormant capital that old cold utter darkness sits to this day and you have been there you went there five years ago with andy and the girls you were going out with at the time andy knew people in the council and arranged a visit while he was in the city for the opening of the gadget shops edinburgh branch just for a laugh he said the place was smaller than you expected and dark and it smelled of damp and the black roof and black walls ran with glistening water the girl you were with couldnt handle it and just had to go back up the steps to the corridor above where the old caretaker whod shown you in had gone and when the lights went out suddenly a few minutes later there was a darkness more complete and final than anything you had ever known before the girl with andy gave a small scream but andy just chuckled and produced a torch hed set it all up with the caretaker a joke but in those moments of blackness you stood there as though you yourself were made of stone like the stunted buried buildings around you and for all your educated cynicism for all your latetwentiethcentury materialist western maleness and your fierce despisal of all things superstitious you felt a touch of true and absolute terror a consummately feral dread of the dark a fear rooted back somewhere before your species had truly become human and came to know itself and in that primaeval mirror of the soul that shaft of selfconscious understanding which sounded both the depths of your collective history and your own individual being you glimpsed during that extended petrified moment something that was you and was not you was a threat and not a threat an enemy and not an enemy but possessed of a final expediently functional indifference more horrifying than evil and so you sit on salisbury crags remembering that stillpresent darkness and looking out over the city feeling sorry for yourself and cursing your own stupidity and the institutionalised thoughtlessness the sanctioned legal lethal greed of the companies the governments the shareholders all of them a tennis ball they say its about the size of a tennis ball you slide your hand inside your coat and jacket and press up under the floating rib on your left side pain youre not sure whether you can feel it the thing the growth itself or not you cough a bit as you press and the pain gets worse you stop pressing and the pain eases an operation injections chemotherapy sickness and premature baldness probably temporary you hunch up rocking back and forward and looking out across the spires and roofs and turrets and chimneys and trees of the city and the parks and lands beyond towards the two bridges looking right you can see cramond isle inchcolm inchmickery and inchkeith inchmickery looks small and buildingcluttered two towers prominent andy came back up the steps after quarter of an hour whistling he asked you what youd done you told him youd rung your doctor he smiled told you to keep the phone and asked you to give him an hours start then he put his hand out to you you shook your head not his hand and looked down he grinned and shrugged and seemed to understand he said goodbye and that was it he skipped down the steps and away five minutes later from a circular concrete gun emplacement on the islands east side surrounded by shitstains and mobbed by raucous screeching gulls you watched the little black inflatable go scudding across the waves heading for granton the city and the hills to the south rose sharp and bright beyond you gave him the hour twenty minutes after you dialled a couple of police launches came slapping and bouncing across the waves towards the island more cops arrived later after one of the boats put back to port to collect them they discovered the remainder of doctor halziel in one of the ammunition magazines sunk deep into the rock of the island you had one last interview with mcdunn telling and retelling everything that happened both on inchmickery and the day before on the road back from the funeral the cops checked your car andy had put a little semipermeable plastic bag full of sugar into your fuel tank while you were all out at the funeral isle you told mcdunn andy hid the cellphone in the buildings on the island and it took you an hour to find it you dont know if he believed you or not you told him that andy let you call your doctor with a gun to your head to prove the phone was working before he hid it mcdunn nodded wisely as though it was all fitting into place the cops are remaining in your flat for another few days still vainly hoping andy will appear there meanwhile al and his wife seem happy to let you stay with them in leith you tried to rescue despot a couple of times but not very hard and not with any noticeable result you tried the trick andy showed you in xerium and it worked but you cant be bothered with games just now this morning a redirected letter arrived from the finance company saying theyre going to repossess the laptop unless you make your payments you think youll let them take it at the paper they know youre not well and everybodys been very sympathetic and supportive they arent asking too much of you but sir andrew rang eddie from antigua and suggested you might like to do a series of articles on your experiences the definitive word on the whole story other papers are interested too theres no shortage of offers ways to make money out of the deal you can see rain in the air sweeping abundantly over the city towards you on the turned westerly wind obscuring the view of the bridges now and dragging huge curved veils slowly over the islands in the firth could be sleet not rain you went down to the cowgate last night and scored a little coke to cheer yourself up for a while you make sure theres nobody else around then turn and hunch over back to the wind you gather your coat around you take the little tin box out of your jacket pocket and open it the stuff insides been razored already and you lift some out with your car key and sniff it two tiny white heaps for each nostril then three and then four when your throat doesnt go quite as numb as it should thats better you put the tin away sniffing you tap the other packet in your jacket then shrug take it out and open it you bought these last night too what the fuck screw the world bugger reality saint hunter would understand uncle warren wrote a song about it you light a cigarette shake your head as you look out over the greyenthroned city and laugh end
