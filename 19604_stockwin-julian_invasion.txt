invasion a kydd sea adventure napoleon bonaparte paris chapter mr kydd how dare you sir to think to approach me in my own headquarters demanding a hearing in such an impetuous manner admiral sir james saumarez stood upright at his desk clearly outraged ill remind you sir that you narrowly escaped courtmartial by your contemptible actions and must be satisfied with a dismissal commander kydd held his impatience in check at long last he had the evidence to prove false the accusation that had led to him being removed from command of his beloved teazer and his first lieutenant christopher standish given the ship sir i beg leave to place before yethis he handed over a small folded piece of paper saumarez inspected it then flung it down with contempt mr kydd if this is a brazen attempt to implicate me no sir it is not those are the secret orders i found within your reglar instructions as made me act as i did an which its nothing but a crude forgery and not in the proper form as you must well allow sir i acted in good faith as ive never seen secret orders afore i couldnt produce it for ye in your investigation as it was stolen from me but now i can if youd be so good as to hear me out saumarezs expression remained stony but he sat reluctantly and as kydd told his story the admirals anger was replaced first by bewilderment then dismay it was a sorry tale driven by envy and resentment at kydds successes a more senior captain had arranged for false secret orders to be inserted into kydds main instructions that had him clandestinely retrieving a chest ashore after a tipoff by an anonymous informer a formal search was made of hms teazer on her return and the chest was found to contain smuggled goods the upright and honourable admiral saumarez had seen no option other than to remove kydd the ships captain from his command still standing kydd produced a second sheet of paper and this is lieutenant prossers confession sir he agrees to testify against commander carthew as principal in the matter thank you mr kydd saumarez said heavily if this is true it is a particularly sad circumstance imputing as it does an appalling transgression against common morality on the part of an officer of my command it were best i should bring this matter to a head without a moments delay the admiral rang a bell and ordered his flaglieutenant commander carthew scorpion and lieutenant prosser teazer to attend me here within the hour then he turned back to kydd youll oblige me by remaining sir while i establish if there is a case to answer carthew entered the room his dress uniform immaculate when he caught sight of kydd he recoiled sit if you please mr carthewthere saumarez said indicating the place opposite kydd mr prosser sir the flaglieutenant ushered in a haggardlooking officer who stared doggedly downwards carthew was clearly disconcerted to see him now this should not take long gentlemen saumarez began mr kydd has laid before me evidence of a conspiracy that resulted in the loss of his ship and his good name we are here to sir carthew flung a murderous glance at kydd surely youre not to be swayed by anything this proven blackguard has said hes mr prosser saumarez said flatly ignoring carthew do you recognise this he handed across a paper i do sir the man said miserably in barely a whisper did you or did you not give mr kydd to understand that it was part of his orders from this office i did carthew turned pale under whose instructions saumarez continued mr carthews sir prosser muttered this you will swear in court after a tense silence he replied ii will saumarez took a sharp breath you shall have your chance to rebut in due course mr carthew i find that this matter shall go forward in law you mr prosser may consider yourself under open arrest mr carthew your case is more serious and i can see no alternative but carthews chair crashed to the ground as he leaped up chest heaving crazed eyes fixed on kydd youill see you in hell with a panicked glance at saumarez he pushed wildly away commander return at once sir at the door carthew knocked aside the flaglieutenant and ran down the stairs stop that officer saumarez roared kydd leaped to his feet and followed shocked faces peered out of offices at the commotion the sound of footsteps stopped and when kydd reached the main entrance carthew was nowhere in sight where did the officer go he demanded of a bewildered sentry well an i was salutin like the man said even a hurrying officer still required the stamp and flourish of a musket salute with eyes held rigid to the front in respect two marines with ported muskets appeared too late hes gone kydd snapped and returned to saumarez nowhere to be found sir then i take it hes absconded flags do alert the provost hes to be returned here without delay he turned to prosser you sir will hold yourself in readiness to make deposition concerning this lamentable business now leave us mr kydd saumarez began gravely im faced with a dilemma by his actions commander carthew stands condemned and will answer for it at his courtmartial as will lieutenant prosser i am concerned that you mr kydd do see justice in fine a public disgracelosing your shipshould at the least deserve a public restoring yes that must be the right and proper thing to do kydds pulse beat faster could it be was he to step aboard teazer as her captain once again he tried to appear calm yet at the same time there is something of a moral difficulty kydds heart felt about to burst i believe you will have already considered the grave consequences of your assuming command of teazer at this time and it does you the utmost credit sir saumarez went on fearful of betraying his feelings kydd dropped his eyes therefore i shall relieve you of any responsibility in my opinion the claims of natural justice outweigh those of position and advancement kydd was struggling to make sense of what was being said saumarez pondered then continued conceivably the circumstances should properly be construed as the unfortunate relinquishing of command which in the nature of the sea service must from time to time occur so he was not going to be allowed to take back teazer saumarez saw kydds stricken face and hastened to console him pray do not allow your natural human feeling for a brother officer to affect you so sir consider in leaving command mr standish must in any event revert to lieutenant he is an acting commander only and therefore the mercy is that by this happenstance he is spared being sent ashore as unemployed kydds mind whirled he certainly did not want the arrogant prig back as his lieutenant after the contempt he had shown for him when he had become a privateer captain ii do see that sir he managed but i have concern that the hands might not show proper respect he being reduced back to lieutenant an all saumarez reflected for a moment oh quite then you shall have a new lieutenant i see no reason to delay matters the sooner this sorry affair is concluded the better for all i shall draw up your letter of appointment immediately mr kydd having allowed standish a couple of days to set his affairs in order and send his gear ashore kydd now stood proudly on north pier watching teazers gig stroking towards him from where she lay at anchor in the great road of st peter port hallum his new lieutenant waited behind him the boat approached and at the tiller midshipman calloway fought hard to keep a solemn face oars he snapped obediently they stilled as the gig swung towards the pier toss oars as one each man smacked the loom across his knee and brought it up vertically the gig glided into the quay the bowman leaped nimbly ashore and secured the painter calloway snatched off his hat with a huge smile kydd looked down into the boat stirk at stroke poulden next to him others all beaming as was the custom hallum descended first bear off calloway ordered give way tgether it had happened at last kydd was on his way to reclaim his rightful place beside him hallum nodded agreeably and both took in the lovely ship until the gig was brought smartly around to the side steps to hook on conscious of the men lined up on deck waiting kydd straightened his goldlaced cocked hat a second time then clambered aboard there before him was the ships company of hms teazer with hallum standing respectfully behind him he drew out his commission and read himself in as captain instantly his commissioning pennant broke out proudly on the mainmast truck mr purchet he acknowledged the boatswain whose smile split his face from ear to ear kydd went on to greet individually those he had come to know and respect in times past mr clegg an hows our little spritsl can i ask the sailmaker grinned and whispered shyly why hes a berth in m cabin mr kydd an nary a rat shall ye find in th barky mr duckitt the gunner removed his hat and shuffled his feet in pleased embarrassment our metals as good as ever it was sir he muttered kydds eyes found others and the memories returned the rest of the teazers were assembled forward their faces leaving no doubt about their feelings that their old captain had been restored kydd had teazer back and the future was up to him he turned to address the men legs abrace he took off his hat and opened his mouth but a lump in his throat stopped the words he drew out his handkerchief and spluttered into it until he had regained his composure then he began teazers itsits with it was no good he wheeled on the boatswain mr purchet this afternoon a make n mend for all hands in the storm of cheering that resulted he took refuge in his cabin it was bare and unkempt with an alien smell standish had cleared it completely and without furnishings it looked immense kydd gave a bleak grin after his dismissal from his ship hed been reduced to the life of a wandering vagrant sleeping in a sailloft until he had achieved handsome riches through privateering standishs petty act was meaninglesswith his newfound fortune he could easily purchase replacements there was a wellremembered knock on the door come tysoe he called happily and stood to greet his old servant the man entered discreetly his nose wrinkling in disdain at the sight of the forlorn cabin aye well weve a mort of work to do in seeing thisn all shipshape but theres none better i dare t say as i trust to take it in hand in the absence of his sister cecilias womanly touch he could safely leave it to tysoe to go ashore and make the necessary purchases a murmuring outside resolved in to the anxious features of ellicott the purser we should set th books straight now sir he said holding a pack of wellthumbed papers we will kydd promised he knew the reason for the haste standish had no doubt fudged the signingoff on some accounts ellicott feared that until kydd signed them into his charge he as purser would be held responsible for any deficiencies in the boatswains store gunners allowance and so forth before kydd started on the paperwork though there were a few things he must attend to first is the ships clerk in attendance he asked carefully it was a delicate matter his friend renzi had been acting in that role while kydd was captain but had given up the post and gone ashore with kydd when he had been dismissed from his ship but if the new one was larkin sir ellicott said apologetically ushering an elderly seaman inside you kydd said in surprise aye sir larkin mumbled kydd was taken aback he knew him to be a focsleman with an unusual attachment to poetry in the dogwatches it was his practice to copy out verse from books in large beautifully formed copperplate clearly he had been volunteered for the task by the previous captain this is no task for a prime sailorman larkin kydd said briskly ill see if mr renzi is at leisure to relieve ye an then your part o ship shall be focsleman again the man beamed so mr ellicott im your man in one hour he turned to tysoe now then id like t hear as how you think we should best fit out the cabin then yere to step off an secure it all oh an at six bells yell find mr renzi on north pier with his books hell want hands to bear a fist in swaying em aboard in the afternoon the men settled to their makeandmend a time set aside for leisure and attention to seaworn clothing or the crafting of a smart stepashore rig it was also a fine opportunity not only to make discreet survey of how his ship had fared out of his hands but as well to bring hallum to a closer appreciation of teazers character it would be a welcome respite too from the welter of paperwork that ellicott seemed intent on drowning him in hats firmly under arms the two officers strolled along the deck forward in favoured positions on the gratings against the sunnier bulwark or simply sprawled out on the planking men got on with the serious business of gossip and yarnspinning while they skilfully stitched away they fell silent as kydd approached but in the custom of the sea offwatch this was their territory and once the two had passed they resumed chatting the teazers seemed in good heart kydd knew the telltale signs of disaffection and saw none he had a suspicion however that much of their contentment stemmed from the prospects of a proven prizetaker being in commandbut who knew what lay ahead kydd went to a carronade and lifted the lead apron protecting the gunlock bed the weapon gleamed with attention from lampblack and linseed oil but when he peered more closely he saw that the firechannel between vent and pan shone with equal lustre the gun had probably not been fired since his own time further forward there were other giveaway signs of a ship that had been prepared more for a flagofficers inspection than war but with growing satisfaction he noted there was nothing wrong with teazer that a good first lieutenant could not bring to order in quick time as dusk fell renzi came aboard kydds closest friend and one to whom he owed his present felicity it had been renzi who had uncovered the truth behind the conspiracy to ruin him but he had not wanted to go into details from long experience kydd knew not to press his friend until he was ready to talk m very dear nicholas lets strike your dunnage down and my apologies to ye the ship being all ahoo like this well sup together tonight it was a brave showing the great cabin had a dining table in the form of a grating on mess tubs tastefully concealed beneath borrowed wardroom linen and quite passable in the golden candlelight i fear it could be short canny tnight kydd said as they entered tysoe has been ashore an not had time for my cabin stores it was a small price to pay for his return to his ship shall you renzi hesitated before the carpenters canvas easychairor was it to be the boatswains stout highback which was said to be proof even against the frenzied movement of a fresh gale kydd settled into the boatswains chair and nodded to the awed pursers steward tasked with the honours of the evening in tysoes absence a light claret was forthcoming glasses charged and the two friends toasted their new situation with feeling nicholas you must have something in your philosophies as should prepare a man for fortunes sport kydd remarked renzi shook his head with a smile as to that dear fellow who can say let us seize the hour and reck not the reasons the workings of fate are not to be comprehended by mortals im persuaded renzi looked gaunt his eyes deepset and lines in his face adding years to his age kydd regarded him with concern at their lowest ebb renzi had travelled to jersey and found menial employment with a titled foreign émigré youve suffered m friend that rogue y prince has worked ye near to death ive a mind to say let it rest brother renzi said firmly ive a notion that the certainties of the daily round in dear old teazer will set me up in prime kelter before long what piques my curiosity at this time is whether my good friend tom kydd will be changed at all by wealth kydd laughed aye its a grand thing not to worry at laying out for a new coat or an evening with the ladies but you should know as while i have m prospects that scrovy prizeagent has his fee an then theres yr pettifoggers who feel free to take their fill o guineas afore ever i see em im t settle a fair sum on my parents ive decided but the rest im putting away not in a bank as might fail but the funds consols at three per cent youll want to prettify teazer handsomely i believe renzi murmured the shipll have her gingerbread its true and m quarters are to be congenial topping it the swell at sea is t no account thoughtwould soon turn me soft as a milkmaid no nicholas your friendll not be changed by his circumstances im gratified to hear it brother kydd grew thoughtful there is a one more matterone o delicacy oh id surely want to see my dear friend right in th article o pewter as thank you but my needs are few and my modest income sufficient unto the day renzi said with finality your riches were honestly gained and by your own hand do rejoice in them ifif i should come by some misfortune you can be assured that i shall indeed remember you a cautious knock sounded on the door come kydd called it was hallum with some papers he took in of their dinner setting and made to leave but kydd motioned for him to join them at the table pray dont stand on ceremony mr hallum here where is yr glass sir ohim forgetting my manners this is mr renzi a philosophical gentleman takin passage with us for the sake of his studies hes obliging enough to act as our ships clerk while aboard hallum was mature with a hint of grey about him and an air of deliberation from diomede i believe kydd prodded it would have been something of a shock for him to be told with just hours notice to move from the tranquil backwater of the old flagship to a prime fighting vessel like teazer i am sir ill have my baggage aboard tomorrow and then be ready for duty have ye had experience in a sloop as a midshipman before the war yes sir an where was that in leith he said uncomfortably scotland any interesting service kydd asked encouragingly the man appeared to be considering what to say a frigate pegasus for two years in the north sea in ninetyeight he looked at kydd as though seeking approval for his disclosure north sea squadron er no sir timber convoys from the baltic mostly kydd nodded pleasantly privately reflecting that if this was the extent of his interesting service then his time in teazer was no doubt set to prove an eyeopening experience several steaming dishes arrived do tell mr hallumfrom what part of the kingdom do you hail renzi asked politely by the first remove it was discovered that hallums family was noted in suffolk for its sea connections and that he himself had made several trading voyages to norway as a youngster over the port kydd had a measure of his lieutenant solidly reliable but with little ambition and less imagination then lets raise a glass to teazer an her company he said warmly ive a fancy were in for exciting times the admiral says as how he wants to put us to the test right quickly chapter kydd sighed deeply as he took in the understated splendour of his great cabinits dark polished bulkhead across at the forward end and the brightness of whitened sides and deckhead which seemed to increase the apparent area to a gratifying size with a blackandwhite chequered floor covering and a deeply polished table in the centre it was almost intimidating and tysoe moved about with a lordly air in his silent ministrations on deck the whole sweep of the interior of the bulwarks was now a rousing scarlet with black and gold finishings about the scrollwork the yards were a deep black against the varnished masts and kydd had willingly parted with the necessary funds to ensure that the band of yellow between the gunports was shown at its best by a liberal mixing of white pigment in the paint the carronade tompions had been picked out in crimson and green and from the sweet intricacies of the miniature stern gallery aft to the dainty white figurehead forward with flecks of blue and gold teazer had never looked so bewitching kydd was keen to see his ship now in all respects ready for action back where she belongedat sea in the weeks since he had been restored to his post carthew had not reappeared and therefore preparations for a courtmartial could not begin prosser had been allowed to resign his commission and leave in return for making full deposition of his evidence it was however not in the interests of the service to keep a fine ship at idleness and teazers orders duly came they were short and to the point a cruise eastwards from alderney along the north coast of the contentin peninsula past the port of cherbourg and as far as its natural conclusion at pointe de barfleur all the eastwest coastal traffic from northern france must proceed that way and a royal navy presence athwart its passage would effectively bring it to a halt kydd would be sharing the task with lesser frya gunbrig and a cutter it was gratifying to have the master dowse and their local pilot queripel back in earnest conclave as they deliberated over their mission saumarez insisted that all nonnative naval vessels in his command carry a permanent local pilot as well as the usual ships master given the treacherous nature of the waters of the area kydd had quickly seen the wisdom in this requirement mr queripel he said yr opinion of this coast sir not easy sir not atall the man replied carefully th charts they doesnt tell the half of it how so all along this seaboard he said indicating the whole northfacing coast steepto an bold mostly but deceitful sir very deceitful see here cap lévi coast trends away t the noreast an youd think to weather the cape a cable or two clear but that would be to yr error sir straight to th north a good two mile outa wicked long rocky shoal below the waves awaiting for ye queripel continued an thats not all should the tidal stream meet wi a contrary wind why then ye gets the raz du cap lévi a dangerous race as can set any good ship t hazard aye y tides kydd murmured tides why y same cap lévi at spring tides sees a eastgoing stream o eight hours but a westgoing fr four hours only at a fierce rate o knots an with y saintpierre shell bank roilin an shiftin down where no mans eye cn see an your basse de happetout why itll thank ee mr queripel kydd said its my intention to stay as close with the land as will make it a sore puzzle fr the frenchies to think to pass us by he added firmly the whole coastline though seemed to be wilfully arranged as a snare and trap for english sailors your best charts mr dowsean dont spare the expense in their getting the illicit french productions to which he was referring could be purchased ashoreat a price the next morning when teazer weighed for the north an air of expectancy was abroad it was a hard life in a small ship on such a coast but there would be much satisfaction in action against the enemyand the chance of prizes laying guernsey abeam teazer shaped course to clear the casquets to starboard where the helm went over and they eased to the southwesterly for the long coastwise patrol to the east the forbidding rocks with their characteristic threepart lighthouse were left astern and the bare green of alderney the most northerly of the channel islands came into view with a fair wind on her quarter teazer showed her breeding one of the myriad uninhabited islands was coming up distinctive with its generous frosting of bird droppings kydd drew out his watch and calculated their progress a cast of the log confirmed iteleven knots and a half past alderney there was clear water for the eight miles to the northwest tip of france but almost immediately kydd felt teazer dip and sway as the notorious alderney race surging from the south took her full on the beam the waves tumbling on themselves in their hurry to emerge into the channel proper the dark mass of land ahead was france kydds duty was clear to take burn sink or destroy by any means the forces that so threatened england no consideration of prizes or personal ambition must stand in the way keep your eyes open there he roared up at the foretop lookout cap de la hague was approaching fast in the fair wind but once round the larger mass of the peninsula the wind under the land would drop and the ship would take longer to respond to anything they came up with th grunes sir queripel warned as they neared the rocky outliers to clear em kydd grunted it would not do to stay safely distant out to sea while the french crept along furtively close inshore id not be happy under a mile mr kydd queripel answered with an offshore wind and a favourable tide they could take risks lets have it eight cables kydd said the french chart had la petite and la grande grunes at no more than seven queripel said nothing they approached the bleak shore and as they eased to sail along it the lookout hailed to point out something in the sea it was a wide and lazy surface eddy over some sinister submarine hazard that they wouldnt have noticed had the water not been so calm an accusing glance from queripel told kydd that these were the grunes and he turned to the first lieutenant mr hallum were going coastal now the people to their stations if y please with the boats in their davits free of their gripes and ready for lowering a hand on the focsle with leadline ready coiled the watchofthehands alert and in no doubt about their duties for emergency manoeuvres there was little more they could do to alleviate the deadly danger they were in by sailing so close two or three miles ahead the first anchorage of note was marked queripel mumbled that it was a contemptible place with a sizeable rock awash the very entrance but kydd would not leave anything to chance the southwesterly that had been so briskly bearing them from alderney had now died to a gentle breeze in the lee of the cliffs and teazer moved along at little more than walking pace all depended on what they saw when they passed the headland in the small bay anything might be at anchor prey or predator but they could not meet every hidden inlet closed up at battle quarters they must trust to quick reactions and correct judgements the bay was innocent of any vessel merely a sweep of sandy beach between two nondescript headlands set amid an appalling sprawl of rocks scarring the sea out to a dismaying distance the visibility was good and the winds safely offshorebut what would it be to cruise here in adverse weather kydd wondered around the far headland the coast fell back it would stay trending away to the eastsoutheast until the port of cherbourg ten miles further on and mercifully less set about with reefs and hazards they remained under easy sailthere was no point in haste the patrol was for a period of days on station and then they would return teazer settled to routine the ageold and comfortable rhythms of the sea that the royal navy had evolved to a fine art hands to supper was piped as eight bells signalled the start of the first dogwatch in noisy conviviality the grog tub was brought up and the spirit mixed for issue to all messes before their evening meal kydd kept the deck out of sheer contentment cherbourg came into view over there one of napoleons arsenals was dedicated to the crushing of england and yet he reflected teazer was sailing by unchallenged with a merry crew enjoying their evening the port was well defended by fortifications which kydd had no intention of provoking he knew that small english cutters of shallow draught were lying off the harbour and that their sole purpose was to keep watch on significant movements there if necessary they could alert saumarezs heavy frigates within half a day kydd kept well away and towards dusk had made the far side of the port earlier he had noted a cryptic marking on the french chart that had piqued his interest pointe du brick and within a tiny bay anse du brick brick was french for brig andwho knewit might have a more subtle meaning he intended to anchor for the night close in under full view of the enemy shore thereby retaining his clamping hold on the coast is this wise sir hallum murmured at our moorings well be at the mercy of any of superior force aye this must be so said kydd but yell observe that nothing can get by without we know it no vessel of size would risk a closein passage at night and by dawn they would be well on their way in the fading light they found their place little more than a deeply wooded cleft in impassable terrain with a neat beach at its foot the handlead told of rapidly shoaling water so teazer went to two anchors with a precautionary kedge to seaward it left them in an admirable position to pounce on any vessel trusting to the cover of darkness to slip by into cherbourg the quiet of the night enfolded them the delicate scent of woodland was borne out on a gentle breeze and the faint maaaaa of a goat sounded to one side only the soft slap and gurgle of the current along teazers sides intruded and about the deck men spoke in low voices in respect to the stillness it was a bold even impudent movebut it had a weakness that might prove fatal if the wind shifted foul in the night they might find themselves trapped against the shore unable to claw off helpless against the gunboats that would be quickly called from cherbourg once their plight was discovered the night was quiet and the wind had held if anything backing more southerly at dawn teazer weighed and stood out for the north but almost immediately there was a heavy thud and smoke from a fort on a small promontory surprisin t see em awake growled the boatswain shielding his eyes from the first rays of the day as he tried to make it out fort lévi queripel said an they shouldve held their fire until we were under their guns kydd said contemptuously bear away if ye please they skirted around the impotent fort while he considered the next hazard well keep inside the septentrionale he told dowse leaving queripel to mutter on his own it was hard on the man but this was the only way they would be in any real position should enemy craft chance by once cap lévi was rounded and they resumed eastward queripel came up to kydd and offered if yed keep east b south five mile theres an inside passage only th fisherfolk takes as will see us through t barfleur after they had angled across near to the low marshy coastline teazer found herself easing between the land and a nearsubmerged cluster of dark granite rocks the highest with a strangelooking twist of iron atop it th chenal hédouin the frenchies call it queripel said on account of aye well do keep a weather eye on yr channel then mr queripel i dont want to leave teazers bones here kydd said tightly he suspected that only a small number of the countless crags under the surface were showing trace of their existence now within less than half a mile of an endless duncoloured beach the countrys remote nature was plain low marshy a reedy lake they were far from the civilised world eyeing a projecting knot of rock on shore queripel said now east b north sir teazer altered more to the northward until she was just abreast a large lake at which point the helm went over again and they found themselves heading between a sullen clutch of offshore rocks and a flat headland sprawling out to sea with a lighthouse that was a good seventy feet high pointe de barfleur kydd asked doubtfully surely they had not reached the end of their patrol area so quickly aye sir queripel said with satisfaction they emerged suddenly into the open sea it was masterly piloting kydd conceded grateful for the channel islanders years of merchantservice experience on this coast in the peace he took in the calm glitter of an unbroken horizon this was now the baie de seine and at its opposite shore was le havre and with it the seine river down from paris it was an utterly different land and the start of the line of ports stretching away that bonaparte was using to assemble his invasion fleets those would be the desperate business of the legendary downs squadron under admiral keith daily handtohand struggles as small ships like teazer were thrown at the enemy flotillas in epic engagements before napoleons very eyes they themselves had seen nothingone or two fishing luggers lobstermen and tiny craft no sign of the armada that was threatening england but they had reached the limit of their cruise it was time to return renzi came on deck blinking in the sunlight he glanced in puzzlement at the open sea with the coast at their backs then at the sun either the land has shifted in its axis or the celestial orb has taken leave of its senses he mused neither kydd chuckled this is the termination of our patrol line y see the baie de seine ahead but when wind an tide permit we wear about and return renzi gazed intently at the french coast concerned that his friend was still fatigued from his labours in jersey kydd said softly not as if youre to miss a fine sight nicholas the coast here is dull enough country youll believe renzi turned to face him ah then this is pointe de barfleur barfleur the town is a league down the coast quite renzi brightened then would it be at all convenient should we sight the same kydd responded to the sudden animation in his tone why yes m friend the breeze backing more southerly by the hour a little diversion will find us with a fair wind for our return an t tell it true id be happier then with th tide on the make hauling their wind teazer made sail southwards and barfleur was sighted a small but prosperouslooking village with a squat church in a tight little harbour but otherwise undistinguished the quarterdeck officers were respectfully standing to leeward allowing the friends their privacy the edward iii of capells shakespeare mentions this place warmly i believe renzi looked about then there must be under our keel at this very moment the last sad relics of the blanche nef erm which is i will tell you dear fellow on a dark night in the year the white ship sailed from barfleur for england with the only son of the most puissant henry the first aboard the mariners in a merry state neglected to consult the state of the tide with the dolorous consequence that the ship ran fast upon a rock and was lost only one was savedand that was not the kings son a cruel tragedy it wasbut worse for england at henrys soon passing in grief his daughter matildas crowning as queen of england was disputed by his nephew stephen the realm was plunged into years of an anarchy that only a medieval world can produce kydd nodded aye but this is yr centuries past were now to consider the invading of england herself no less then what more apposite place than this little town i cannot conceive of brother renzi said drily it was from barfleur of course that in william the conqueror did sail to seize england the last successful invasion of our islands i believe further historical musings were cut short for kydd had found it necessary to give the orders that saw teazer go to exercise of her foretopmen while they stretched further down the coast as anticipated the winds backing produced a useful southerly and by the time the ship reached pointe de barfleur again it was fair for the return a near perfectly executed cruise were it not for the complete lack of action they rounded the point and took up by the wind on the larboard tack for the inshore passage handing in the sheets in a smart and seamanlike manner that brought a grunt of satisfaction from teazer s commander as he considered whether to anchor in the lee of cap lévi for the night a disbelieving cry of saaail came from the maintop lookout two points on the bow aa brig wi some he tailed off in perplexity but threw out an arm to starboard kydd leaped for the mainshrouds and shaded his eyes as he peered out at a confusing scenenumbers of vessels of different sizes crowding together about four or five miles off the largest was a brigowar with distinctive red ochre sails and quite as large as teazer it was being circled by a smaller vessel a topsail cutter and had three open craft of puzzling form close astern kydd fumbled for his pocket telescope it soon became clear that they had come upon a drama which could have only one meaning colours mr hallum he roared their white ensign flew aloft as he jumped to the deck to meet the expectant faces of the quarterdeck frenchy invasion barges three of em being towed by a brigowar as is fighting off a cutter after a short delay the cutter responded with the correct private signal to teazers challenge she would be one of a number of game little ships that were making life uncomfortable for the gathering invasion fleet and had come upon these three barges probably being towed to the next port no doubt they had been newbuilt at barfleur and thinking that teazer was continuing south had been gulled into taking the chance of slipping out the cutter had found she had not been able to take on the bigger ship but had been snapping at its heels now the tables were well and truly turned against two determined menowar the brig stood little chanceand fleeing into the land was no longer an option for teazer in her inshore passage was waiting caught under two fires the brig did its best the barges tow lines were thrown off and ignoring the cutter the brig circled round to confront teazers onrush but as its crew hauled on the braces it slewed suddenly and stopped then the foretopmast tumbled hes taken a rock hallum crowed watching the confusion on the hapless vessels deck boarders if you please kydd said sourly as their prize slowly settled on the opposite side he could see that the cutter was hove to and already had a boat in the water ill take em mself he muttered and with a token force of men set out for the brig the vessel had driven up a ledge of rock and was fast aground but the slight swell was lifting the after part then dropping its dead weight again and again in a cacophony of cracking timbers closer to kydd could see that this was a merchant brig converted to appear fierce and protective the guns were quakersfalse wooden cannon at the gunports meant to intimidate the crew were crowded together on the highest part and appeared to await their fate with resignation kydd had the boat brought alongside to the mainchains and swung himself lithely on deck at the same time a lieutenant from the cutter boarded from the opposite side my bird i think the officer said with a dazzling grin he was absurdly young and it was difficult to take offence kydd smothered a cynical smile any naval ship in sight at the time of a capture could demand a share of any prizemoney kydd commander teazer brigsloop oh sirclive levesonwardle lieutenantincommand linnet cutter well now mr erltenant do ye take possession o this vessel sir as youve half a right t do so an id not linger sir i fancy shes not long for this world kydd said knowing that any talk of prizes was now merely academic by this time the brig lay ominously still and unresisting to the waves hard upon the rocky ledge just visible below in the murky depths kydd crossed to the little forward companionway access to the hold and opened the door there was an unmistakable dark glitter and the hollow swash of water below the ships bottom was breached and it had flooded then settled on the ledge which it would never leave th barges sir the boatswain his cutlass still drawn nodded to where they were being secured by the cutter yere right mr purchet kydd said with a quick grin theyll serve he returned to the young lieutenant sir im taking ye under my command he said your orders are to send a party o men to recover as much o what she carries as ye can an stow it in the barges it would go some way to making up for the loss of the brig i understand sir an then to take em under tow until ye make your offing and shape course for guernsey ill send help when i can er its that i see soldiers in them there barges sir the boatswain said uncomfortably all th better kydd said briskly no doubt theyll kindly bear a hand in return for theyre saved from the briny deep kydd surveyed the activity with satisfaction the cutters masters mate had had the sense to disarm the soldiers before boarding each barge and with marines borrowed from teazer to act as guards they were brought alongside one by one for transshipment to linnet he looked down curiously at one of the strange craft it was the first he had seen at close quarters of the thousands he had heard were being built and assembling in the invasion ports this must be a péniche designed for landing the maximum number of soldiers in the minimum time over three score feet long and twelve feet in the beam the open boat could probably cram aboard sixty or seventy troops and all their equipment it had provision for stepping three masts a simple lug rig no doubt a howitzer or mortar could be mounted forward and this was the smallest of the flotilla there were others much larger that could take horses and field guns still more that were big enough to warrant the same threemasted square rig as a frigate and with guns more than a match for teazer sir i heard em say among emselves like theym newmade in barfleur an hoping t take em to cherbourg it was one of teazers guernseymen with the breton tongue it was a chilling sight so close to the reality of napoleons menace notwithstanding kydds seamans instinct which was telling him that fully loaded they would be pigs to sail the thought of them in uncountable numbers crowding across the channel to invade england was a fearsome prospect there was little more he could do he called the lieutenant over im continuing m cruise to the west ill leave the marines for the prisoners and expect ye to haul off before dark good voyage to ye sir in the late afternoon they had reached the western end of the inshore channel without further incident and kydd was looking forward to supper with renzi who had been locked away for hours in his tiny cabin restoring acquaintance with his philosophical studies after his labours in jersey he turned to go below then stiffened a distant sound like the mutter of thunder guns he strained to hear but there was no more he might have imagined itbut one or two about the deck had paused like him mr calloway he called a younger mans ears would be sharper did ye hear guns aye sir i did i thought six ninepounders could be twelves mr kydd some frigates mounted twelvepounders as main armament and if he went to see what it was about kydd knew he might find himself turned upon by one of unanswerable force his duty was plain however clap on more sail mr dowse as near as he could tell it had been somewhere in the open sea beyond where cap lévi marked the abrupt turn south into the bay of cherbourg so he decided to press on directly after reaching the cape they passed the sprawling point and met deep water once more stretching out for the west teazer lengthened her stride in relief that the treacherous shoals were left behind and in half an hours fast sailing she had made her sighting right in the eye of the sunset and as close to the veering southerly breeze as practicable it was a substantial vessel if it saw them it gave no sign crossing their bows steadily on the starboard tack some three miles or so distant making directly for cherbourg with the light fading it was difficult to discern details until two things made all plain the first was that the ship was barquerigged so it was not a manowar and the second was the two flags that fluttered at her mizzenthe french national flag triumphantly over the english ensign she was therefore a british merchant ship taken recently by the enemy vessel whose guns they had heard the french with the safety of the port so close were flaunting their prize it was gallingin front of their eyes a valuable british ship being borne off to france kydd felt for the luckless crew now prisoners destined to rot in one of bonapartes prisonfortresses be damned to it ill not see em in chokey he burst out but he was not clear how this could be prevented teazer was still on the same larboard tack leaning into it on a course parallel with the distant depths of the bay while the barque was already on the opposite tack and set fair to make cherbourg in one reach firing on the vessel was out of the question and the time needed to tack about in chase would probably hand the frenchman an unbeatable lead they could hope for a windchange in the fluky conditions nearer the coast but the breeze was holding strength now veering slowly to the southwest kydd saw the plain sternquarters of the barque pulling steadily away and gritted his teeth either way they stood to lose the chase unless it was without question that he had the finer ship but how much better mr purchet bowlines to th bridle an sheet in on all courses until ye hears em sing he was going to make a race of it a long board deep into the bay a flying stay about to the other tack and direct chase in the hope that he could head the other ship before it made port word got about quickly soon the decks were crowded with tars each with his own opinion of how to get the best from their fair barque some all for an immediate tack and lunge others urging extremes of sail spread the boatswain was cautious sir yell want a sliprope an toggle on the bowlines im thinking their purpose was to tauten the leading edge of the major sails to allow the helmsman to ease in right up to the wind purchet was suggesting a way to cast them off rapidly and take up on the other side when they tacked about aye make it so kydd agreed as he considered the next move teazer s trim was fine he made a point of checking whenever possible for it had a surprising effect on performance if the ship had a tendency to come up to the windif she was ardentthis had to be counteracted by the opposite rudder which necessarily caused a degree of turbulence and drag to the detriment of speed he crossed to the helmsman poulden probably the best timoneer aboard does she gripe he demanded he had not sensed any giveaway lurch to windward when the bows rose not as who should say sir the man said stolidly they were making excellent speed the seas were fine on the bow and without the need to punch through them there would be no slowing to their progress however the barque was well past and into the bay making a fine show of it with royals now spread it was time for vigorous measures teazer did not carry fancy sailhe could set the foretopmast stunsl in these conditions but bonnets and drabblers would impede rather than assist no this race would be won if he tuned his ship like a violin ill have ye swift in the catharpings he told the boatswain he considered for a moment then turned to the master take the larbowlines an see to the bracing mr dowse each yard to be braced in half a point moren the one below it the resulting slight spiral would take into account the stronger winds to be found aloft aye aye sir an set hands to th lifts the yards to be agreeable as ye can to the horizon at their lively degree of heel so closehauled this would restore the sails natural aspect rather than bag the wind to the lee side sir there was more to think about too great a press of sail might bury her forefoot or thrust her to leeward paradoxically it was often better to reduce sail to increase speedthat foretopgallant for instance he gave the order to dowse to make it so it was exhilarating sailing never had teazer been urged like this the sea hissing and seething past all sail drawing to perfection in the spanking breeze and glorious sunset kydd stood by the wheel every nerve at full stretch sensing the exact angle of the wind on his cheeks listening intently to its thrum on taut rigging and the creaking highpitched then low from deep within the ship as the waves passed under her keel any of this might change and be the first warning of sudden calamity in the straining spars and rigging mr hallum stations fr staying this was the trickiest part putting about to the other tack if they fumbled it all would be over and they needed more than a workmanlike manoeuvre they had to make it a lightning move that had them over on their new tack and sails fully drawing with not a seconds delay kydd snatched a glance at the barque now significantly closer to cherbourg and safety he was going to play it out to the last card i have the ship mr dowse he said formally to the sailing master aye sir there was no resentment in his tone he understood that it was for his own protectionany failure in timing or execution could not now be blamed on him stay by me if y please kydd added quietly hallum approached to report that stations for staying ship were now complete lines thrown off from the belaying pins and faked along for running every partofship readied and tensewaisters focslemen topmen each a part of the whole just one falsestep could bring them all down ready about kydd roared and looked over the side they were slashing along as fast as he had ever seen her stretch before ready ready ease down the helm carefully spoke by spoke poulden began the fateful turn this was not the time for a sudden showy spinning of the wheel and abrupt angling of the rudder over which would result in spectacular white foaming and a sudden slowing in impetus as the drag came on instead teazer kept her speed on allowing time for the jib sheets to be eased and behind kydd the mainsail boom hauled amidships to keep the sail full until the last moment helms alee forward there was instant movement as the foresheet was let go together with the sheets to the headsails and teazers bow began to swing into the wind the sails slatting busily checking away the top bowline and lee forebrace they heaved around kydd saw the motion and bawled rise tacks an sheets the mainsails had lost their taut straining and their lines were manhandled to clear the nettings and other gear as teazer nosed into the wind haul in mainsail haul kydd bellowed hand over hand the mainyard was braced around at a furious pace the fore remaining on the old tack as teazer rotated through the winds eye this levered round the after part of the ship the fore as well took the wind aback but on the opposite tack pushing the bows away on to the new course everyone knew the stakes it was the synchrony of movements that held the key and teazer responded nobly haul of all kydd ordered exultantlythe main would fill and draw just as fast as the new weather tack and leesheets could be brought in the fore was braced around smartly and with a brisk banging and flapping the sails caught teazer leaned to her new course the men frantically at work to get in every foot of their hauling it was doneand beautifully kydd grunted satisfied his ship was as capable as she was pretty as they settled to their rushing passage he looked across at the barque it was now on the same board and although it was ahead by a considerable margin the game was far from over their prey was clawing as close to the wind as it could while teazer thanks to kydds patient and careful estimates lay to the wind with every sail drawing optimally were forereaching the master admitted eyeing the other vessel their tracks were converging and teazer was coming up on the barque with every minute kydd found himself clenching his fists frustrated that there now seemed little more that could be done the boatswain cleared his throat awkwardly er sir when i was a younker i seen a trick once oh th lower yards sir t increase th traverse a squarerigged ship could lie only about six points to the wind for the big spars swinging across the ship would come up against the mast stay and shrouds a natural limit kydd glanced at the big mainyard above them immovably up against the mainstay at the extremity of its traverse id like to know how mr purchet why sir we slacks off th trusstackle as gives us play an then cants down th weather yardarm while we swigs off on th catharpings all we can this would allow the yard to slide up and into where the shrouds were at their narrowestat the cost of the set of the sail from his memory of studying for his lieutenants examination kydd recalled the double tangent rule the tangent of the angle of the wind to the yard should be twice that between yard and keel this ensured that even a little achieved would see the effect multiplied we do it mr purchet he said it would be tricky work with sails drawing hard the trussropes held the big spar against the mast to slacken them deliberately with both main and forecourse cocked up at an angle they sheeted in once more half a point id say the master said clearly impressed while this was not dramatic it would amount over the miles to several ships lengths further to weather could it make the difference kydd eyed the distances the object was to point higher into the wind yet retain a faster speed culminating in an overlap at any distance to windward with the chase at his mercy under his lee should they end even yards to leeward it was certain to get away dowse assumed position next to poulden and monitored closely the flutter at the edge of the main it could so easily change to the sail taken violently aback be ye yare at th helm son he said quietly aware of the tender situation ill bear watch together they worked to bring the racing sloop to within a knifes edge of the wind luff n lie dowse murmured and poulden inched over the wheel dyce he ordered an nothing t leeward teazer flew in the gathering dusk she seemed to reach out after the fleeing barque every man aboard watching forward and feeling for the gallant ship now doing her utmost for them if the chase ended triumphantly the epic pursuit would be talked about for years to come in the further distance the sullen dark mass of northern france lay across their path with the lights of cherbourg dead ahead and their prey now visibly nearer as though it were being hauled closer on a rope it was evident that before long a convergence would take place in the last of the sunset they were finally within cannon shot of the vessel to windward kydd spared a fleeting sympathy for the unknown captain who must now be seeing the stone quays of the entrance to the harbour but then he thought of the prisoners soon to taste freedom place us within hailing distance mr dowse kydd saidbut suddenly the situation changed utterly the barque fell away to leeward in a tight turn wearing about to place itself directly before the windaway from the safety of cherbourg and back towards where they had come from it caught kydd completely off guard and it was some time before they could throw off the gear they had rigged for the chase against the wind it was a meaningless move there was no friendly port to the north or anything except the endless desolation of rocks and reefs before barfleur and there was now no question but that teazer was the swifter the barque had made good distance by the sudden wearing but teazer was closing rapidly the wind astern allowing any course she chose when the other ship veered towards the shore teazer did likewise at this rate it would be over before they made cap lévi even though the frenchman had put up a fine show then half a mile short of the cape and with teazer only a few hundred yards astern the vessel sheered towards the land and in the gathering darkness rounded to and calmly let go her anchor incredulous kydd was about to give the orders for a final reckoning when the mystery resolved in a flurry of gunfire bright flashes stabbed from the squat fort on the promontory above in the gloom he had overlooked fort lévi the guns were of respectable calibre and quite capable of smashing teazer to a ruin well before he and his crew could secure their prize it was all over circling out of range kydd knew he should give best to the frenchman now sheltering under the guns of the fort and move on but his blood was up and he would not give in boats after darka cuttingout expedition the french would imagine that he would give up and sail away during the night and therefore would wait patiently for morning before making for cherbourgbut they would be in for an unwelcome surprise the night was moonless impenetrably black and relatively calm perfect conditions the fort obliged by carelessly showing lights that were ideal navigation markers and kydd set to with the planning he reviewed his forces the barque would be manned by a prizecrew only and should not present a serious difficulty for a prime manowars boarding party the main object was to crowd seamen aboard in sufficient quantity that sail could be loosed and set before the fort could react too few and with three masts to man there would be a fatal delay so it must be every boat and all the hands that could be spared there would be two main divisions the armed boarders as first wave over the larboard bulwarks and the seamen to work the ship over the starboard it was essential to have the best men in the lead those who would not flinch at mounting the rigging in the dark and with the initiative and sea skills to know what needed doing without being told mr hallum are ye familiar with the barque rig er no sir then ill take command in the boats there were no barquerigged vessels in the royal navy and although the major difference was only in the foreandaftrigged mizzen kydd felt it was probably asking too much of this staid officer and of course he himself had made a voyage to botany bay as the reluctant master of a convictship barque in the days of the last peace there was no point in delay divisions for boarding were quickly apportioned and equipment made readycutlasses boarding pistols along with a freshsharpened tomahawk for every fourth man to use in slashing through boarding nettings and the like faces darkened by galley soot the teazers awaited kydds order he peered into the blackness once more nothing to see no sound they could wait for the last moment before moonrise just before midnight but little would be gained by sitting about get aboard he whispered men tumbled into the boats silently nesting their weapons along the centreline and taking up their oars the pinnace left the comfort of the ships side lay off in the inky blackness and waited for the barge and cutter to take position on me kydd called in a low voice and the small flotilla set off for a point somewhere to the south of the twinkling lights of the fort where the barque must lie they pulled in silence rags in the thole pins to muffle the clunk of oars and nothing but the swash of their passage to disturb the night hed spell the men before they away to the right but frighteningly close a scream in frencha boat out rowing guard a musket banged into the night and another then a deepervoiced command had the french boats crew pulling for their livesdirectly away keyed up for a desperate clash at arms kydd couldnt understand why they were running then he saw starting as a wisp of flame which mounted quickly then cascaded down in a flaming mass bundles of straw had been lit and thrown over the walls of the fort more fell and their flaring leaped up until the dark sea was illuminated by a pitiless red glare with themselves utterly revealed at its centre turn about kydd bellowed to the boats behind him go back disbelieving they hesitated then the guns of the fort opened up and the reason for the guardboats departure was apparent it had hastily cleared the field of fire for the artillery and now the cannon thundered vengefully into the night at teazers fleeing boats kydd flopped wearily into his cabin chair his face still smeared with soot be damned t it he muttered to be beaten after such a handsome chase at the least we got away with our skins renzi was in the other chair looking grave it seems the revolutionary army does not know much about night firing over sea tom you were fortunate ayebut the frenchy captain was a canny one no codshead hei should have smoked it he frowned and added sorrowfully i should so have liked to set the english crew free nicholas its a hard enough life they face now renzi nodded staring down then he lifted his gaze to kydd theres conceivably still a prospect of a successful outcome should we be so bold a direct assault on em by daylight i think not if im seen to hazard mens lives on a merchantman its to be understood as im prizetakin to the neglect of my orders quite but im not referring to courage before cannon and blade rather the devious application of cunning and deceit to attain the same object at kydds puzzled look he continued a stratagem as may secure your ship without need for overweening force that asks the enemy to allay his fears and put down his arms nicholas yere being hard to fathom are you saying we should creep up as theyre not looking then not at all heaven forbid we should think to skulk about like your common spy renzi said with a shudder what crosses my mind is that we could perhaps turn our recent experience to account and as dawns early light stole over the little bay teazer crept around cap lévi once more her crew quietly at quarters and kydd on her quarterdeck tense and edgy if renzis stratagem failed they would be sailing to disaster and it could only be his responsibility the bay opened up and the barque was still there now at two anchors it was heaved around ready for a rapid departureand then teazer had come on the scene for now she lay watchful but at any moment all depended on the effectiveness of the ruse teazer eased slowly into full view a trumpet call sounded distantly from fort lévi but there was no hint of alarm boldly teazer continued on course set to so on her way southward past the barque yet still there was no clamour of the call to armscould that be because she was being lured onwards they rounded the last of the point which now took them within range of the forts cannon and nothing where was the cutter it should be but then coming up fast linnet rounded the cape and sighting teazer opened fire on her with sixpounders teazer answered shot for shot in desperation encumbered with three invasion craft towing astern she was in no position for rapid defensive manoeuvres was it working no point in wondering now they were committed on kydds order a string of random flags jerked uncertainly up teazer s signal halliards but the wind was blowing them unreadably away from the french it was time y know what to do poulden he told the helmsman the wheel went overand teazer headed directly for fort lévi the response was immediate a gun cracked out from the highest turret but it was only to draw attention to the welcoming threeflag hoist by heaven an weve carried it off kydd breathed and glanced up at the ruddy ochre sails that had done their work so well kydd had counted on the french having word passed of a brig with red sails due from barfleur towing valuable invasion craft and obligingly had provided one that it was being harried by the royal navy was only to be expected of course and that it was seeking protection beneath the guns of the fort was equally understandable confident that no french soldier could be expected to know the difference between two similarsized brigrigged ships kydd took teazer in gliding along the foreshore before the fortifications until at precisely the right position they hove to preparing to anchor under threat of the shore guns the cutter abandoned its attack and hauled offthen seemed to have second thoughts and curving round once more placed herself in a daring show of bravado squarely alongside the barque that had been captured earlier by the french kydd played out the agreed scenario the position this foolish brig captain had chosen to heave to in just happened to mask the forts field of fire horrified by the cutters audacious attack he failed to notice the frantic signals from the fort and sent his men tumbling wildly into the boats and crossing to the barques rescue meanwhile the cutters men swarmed aboard in attack from the seaward side the brigs men scrambled over the other bulwarks and soon were fighting for their lives with the cutters fierce crewbut any cool observer might have been puzzled at the surprising increase in the number of men racing up from below to all ashore it must quickly have become clear that the brigs gallant rescue attempt had been in vain by some means sail was got on the barque and cables slipped it headed for the open sea but the brave souls in the brig were not going to let it get away the invasion barges were hacked free and the ship turned seaward to chase after them under full sail the ships raced away until at last they had disappeared over the horizon well upon my soul sir admiral saumarez sat back in amazement it does you the utmost credit when balked of your capture you turned to guile and artifice to accomplish what main force could not to be quite frank id not have thought it er in your nature mr kydd fighting down the urge to give renzi his duehe had been insistent that his role was not to be mentionedkydd responded twas easily enough done sir the moon rose just after midnight an by it we sighted the wreck an stripped it of fore n maintopsails the cut o the canvas wasnt pretty but it sufficed an linnet we found floggin gamely along she seemed eager enough for the adventure the rest well youre too reticent sir did you have a stiff opposition on boarding the frenchy thats the pity of it sir they yielded t linnet as we came over th bulwarks so we needs must fight among ourselves he chuckled as he recalled goading the linnets to have at the teazers in order to keep up the pretence and the bewilderment this had caused among the french when we released the crew of the merchant ship from below they loosed and set sail tolerably quick no one can doubt that at this moment they are drinking your health in a bumper mr kydd saumarez said drily a pity the french got back their invasion craft i suppose for that sir ye can rest easy the men took along the bungs for keepsakes leaving em t sink this left saumarez speechless then he laughed and clapped kydd on the shoulder youve had a grand cruise thats not to be denied thank ee sir the admirals expression turned thoughtful and it leaves me in something of a dilemma sir saumarez crossed to the window and gazed down on the harbour scene this is a quiet station as you know due mainly to the enterprise of officers of initiative such as yourself the enemy are kept cowering in their harbours and i should be grateful that one of your quality is under my command he turned back and regarded kydd gravely yet i cannot help but reflect that two elements converge that are in themselves unanswerable the first that the kingdom lies under a menace unparalleled in its history and in stern need of its most able warriors the second that your continued presence here will render it near impossible to achieve a distinguished action and hence preferment in all conscience i believe that your recent illusage deserves better mr kydd with great reluctance im going to have you and your ship released to the very forefront of the struggle the downs squadron chapter holding back his excitement kydd peered from the window of the coach as it crossed the bridge and ground up high street past wellremembered sights from his youth renzi had been anxious to visit london so this time kydd had journeyed to guildford on his own they approached the angel posting house the coachman cracking his whip to clear a path for the portsmouth flyer as it wheeled round and clattered into the courtyard the snorts of the horses echoed in the confined space and their pungent aroma lay on the air as kydd descended and went inside he had taken rooms at the angel as he didnt want to burden his mother there was a wondering unreality about it all while teazer was undergoing refit in portsmouth before joining the downs squadron he had snatched a week to go home for the first time since the beginning of this war of napoleon now he was back in the place where he was born and had grown up soon he would be greeting his parentsand with such a tale to tell with a deep breath he stepped out into high street the noise and smell instantly transported him back to the days of his youth and his eyes sought out the sights the big hanging clock on the hall opposite the tunsgate market the elizabethan almshouseand before it the little wigshop where he had once worked it was now a printseller the shop front filled with luridly coloured patriotic sheets that a war was on did not seem apparent the business of the town was cheerily going forward with hardly a reminder of the titanic struggle gathering strength out at sea things were the samebut different as kydd strode up the street not a soul noticed him but he had now been away for some time towards the top he took the little path past the sombre holy trinity churchyard to school lane several years ago with his fathers eyesight failing and the wig trade in decline kydds family had summoned him home in despair he and renzi had restored the family fortunes by establishing a small school run along naval lines the enterprise had thrived with jabez perrot its fierce and strict boatswain keeping order and mr partington its keen young headmaster kydd wondered if his sister cecilia would be at home since securing a position as a companion to lady stanhope she had travelled the world kydd knew cecilia would love to hear his tales as a rakish corsair even if the reality was a little different his voyages as a privateer captain had been successful though and he hugged to himself the anticipation of revealing his surprise to the family the trim schoolhouse came into view above it a blue ensign floatingkydd smiled at the thought of the boatswains face when he told him those were the colours he would fly in admiral keiths downs squadron the school was neat and clean and sounds of dutiful chanting issued from the classroom with the aroma of chalk dust and ink kydd crossed the little quadrangle to the residence thomas its you his mother squealed in delight at the door do come in son yell catch a death if y just stands there who is it fanny the querulous enquiry had come from his father frail with years and now completely blind its thomas an how fine he looks in his new cream pantaloons an brown leather boots is cec here kydd asked no dear shes in america somewheres wi th marquess an lady mrs kydd said proudly have ye brought that nice mr renzi wi ye letting the warmth of the homecoming wash about him kydd settled in the best armchair next to the fire while the wideeyed maid proffered a hot caudle against the cold and chairs were brought up for everyone to hear his tale so ye was a privateer son thats nice was it scareful atall you wi all those pirates about on th boat he was sparing in his account of battles and omitted any reference to the tragic loss of his fiancée rosalynd but he made much of the thrill of the chase and exciting tempests until he saw that the old couple were visibly tiring how is the school ma he asked politely jabez perrott the onelegged sailor who had been working in a guildford bookshop until offered the position of school disciplinarian was summoned to report which he did most willingly and with the utmost dignity he was a grave upright figure who had taken to wife a respectable widow and become a man of repute at chapel dinner was announced kydd took the place of honour at the other end of the table from his father and nodded to mr partington who respectfully asked about his sea career he was lodging at the house but it seemed he had an understanding with a certain young lady and his hopes for connubial bliss were well advanced the unreality crept back each had found their place in life and in a quiet way had prospered he on the other hand had experienced so much that to tell of it could only invite incomprehension of a world they could not be expected to understand he was possessed of means beyond any of their imaginings and of memories that could never really be shared there was now an unbridgeable distance between himself and his folk it wasnt meant to be like this his homecoming he glanced about the room saw the darted admiring glances heard the shy chatter the awkwardly addressed conversation perhaps it was because he had been away for so long that they were unsure of himbut in his heart he knew this was not so after the cloth was drawn and he was left with his parents he would bring out his surprise with rising elation he waited until he had their full attention ma pa ive somethin to tell ye aye son his mother said quickly clasping her hands over her knees in excitement is she pretty atall a shadow passed over his face no ma its not that itsits that ive done main well in the article o prizetakin and its to tell y both im now going to see ye into a grand mansiona prodigioussized one as ye both deserve mrs kydd looked at him with some perplexity thomas dear were comfortable here y knows kydd looked at her fondly aye thats as may be but heres the chance to live like the quality in a great house wi rooms an grounds an things a big housed be a worry dear no ma theres servants asll take charge of it for ye an then o course not now thomas love ma tomorrow i can talk to the listen dear were happy here its all we need an dont f get yr fathers eyes might ha failed him but he knows his way about here a great big place why wed all get lost not only that but what would i put in all them rooms taken aback kydd could only say yell soon be used to it ma then yell no son his father said firmly pay heed t what your mother just said we stays yes pa but thank ee most kindly for thinkin of us in that way son yes pa his mother brightly changed the subject ive jus remembered mrs bawkins always has us t tea on thursdays would ye like t come an say hello it was the best room in the angel but kydd did not sleep well he took his breakfast early and as he watched high street come alive through the quaint windows of the dining room tried to shake off a lowering dissatisfaction he started to walk to his parents home then realised it would be too early for them and turned back down the hill the previous evening had not been what he had looked forward to and his parents refusal of his offer had given him pause to think guildford was just the sameor was it the tradesmen were out in the old ways their cries echoing in the streets as shops were opened and the town woke to another day but it seemed subtly different he reached the bottom of the street and the bridge over the river wey where the road led to the south and portsmouth he wanted time to reflect so he wandered down to the towpath its curving placidity stretching away under the willow trees he had just turned thirty was it now time to take stock of his life by any measure he was a success he had left guildford a perruquier and returned a welltodo sea captain with experiences of the wider world that any man would but he had returned to guildford expecting it to be as it always had been he now saw that it had not changed he had those very experiences had given him perspectives on the world that were very different they had not only broadened his horizons but made it impossible to go back he stopped still guildford was of the past not the future it was no longer his home but what then did he call home many men and most women of his age had settled in their ways and begun to raise a family was it now time for him to cease adventuring and put down roots somewhere guildford the country he had a not inconsiderable fortune and must be a most eligible bachelor a stab of pain came at the thought of the death of his fiancée rosalyndbut he had a duty now to his future the thoughts flowed on put down roots where and as what a gentleman of leisure whose glory days were past no quite apart from the peril under which his country lay at the hands of the french he knew that he was a man of the sea and belonged there so was that what he must call home he would not be at sea for ever and it was the expected and natural thing for any officer to acquire a property for the time when he swallowed the anchor and returned to the bosom of his family since he had left guildford sea adventures had followed each other in exciting succession and his attention had been largely on the present perhaps now was the right time to consider where he was going with his lifeand who he was there was no point in denying that he was a naturalborn sailor who had the gift of seasense and tactics and from long ago he had not been troubled by fear in battle his end was just as near by land as sea and duty was a clear path in war no there was no doubt that the probability was given a reasonable run of luck that he was destined for yet greater honours even to the dignity of postcaptain it was not impossible now for with napoleon bonaparte declaring himself emperor of the french there was no prospect in the near future of peace and unemployment his heart beat faster to be made postthe captain of a frigate and later even shipoftheline and firmly set on the path that led to admiral it was not impossible but there were many commanders and few postcaptains it would take much luck and of course interest at the highest level which he did not have he did not mix in the right circles he must reenter the society he had turned his back on when he had chosen rosalynd a country lass over an admirals daughter that much was clear a chill of apprehension stole over him at the thought of facing patrician gazes again the practised swift appraisal and rapid dismissal but it had to be acknowledged that he was now a man of substance he had no need to be intimidated by those grander than he his situation was quite as fortunate as theirs probably more so than that of some and he could validly expect to step forward and claim his place among them the thought swelled he could afford the trappings need not fear lacking the resources to keep up with them in whatever pursuit the occasion demanded he would be treated with politeness and deference would be allowed and accepted into their company he would make friends he would be noticed it was a heady vision but to become a figure in society it was not enough to dress modishly to be accepted he must comport himself as they did assume the graces and accomplishments of gentility that renzi had been so at pains to instil in him when he had first become an officer he had no desire to be thought quaint which meant he should quickly acquire the requisite elements of polish such as an acquaintance with the classics musical accomplishments and remembering cecilias exasperated comments gentlemanly speech was that so hard if he was to achieve a credible finish then with his other advantages he could pass for one of them of course there was the difficulty of his origins his family but was this not the way the great families of the day must have started northern ironmasters liverpool shipping lords rising merchants of the city of london were all now laying down estates and being honoured in a modern world that was making way for men who were reaching the heights by their own efforts damn it he would be one of them and take his place among them by right and if it took the hoisting in of a few ancient tomes and working on his conversation so be it he would meet his future squarely and seize any opportunity with both hands suddenly impatient he began to walk back quickly letting his thoughts race above all he had the means to see it through if he was right about his prospects then the sooner he was equipping himself for his destiny the better it was going to happen there would be a new thomas kydd feeling surged but did that mean he was turning his back on guildford the place of his birth that until now he had called home no he would put this world gently but firmly to one side it was just that it was no longer the centre of his universe he hurried along the last few yards to the schoolhouse gate lightness of spirit urging him onward good mornin ma he said happily y say mrs bawkins is entertainin this afternoon teazer was delayed in her refit a humble brigsloop had no claim to priority in a dockyard that was at full stretch keeping the vital blockading shipsoftheline at sea and she was left for long periods in forlorn disarray her crew in receiving hulks and her officers bored kydd lost no time in taking rooms ashore not for him the noisy intimacy of the blue posts at portsmouth point he could now afford to stay where officers of rank were to be found at the george in penny street and there he began the process of refinement it was vexing that renzi was in london out of reach for advice but on the other hand this was kydds own initiative and he would see it through he went first to the largest bookshop the assistant had been studiously blankfaced as he asked for suggestions as to what primers gentlemen found most answered in a classical education he left with a clutch of books and hurried back the greek grammar was hopelessly obtuse and required him to learn by rote the squiggly characters of the alphabet before ever he could start it could wait for later the other looked more promising an interlinear copy of caesars commentaries on the campaign in gaul the latin on one line english on another at least it was about the manly pursuit of war not the fantastical monsters and gods of antique greece omnia gallia in tres partes divisa est did he really have to get his head round all this or could he learn some of the more pithy sayings and casually drop them into the dinnertable conversation to the pleased surprise of all that sounded much the better idea in the matter of polite discourse there could be no hesitation he would be damned as of the lower orders by his own words just as soon as he opened his mouth in company since the days of cecilias patient efforts on his speech he had slipped back into his comfortable old ways no this required an allout effortand he must apply himself to it this time resolved he gave it careful thought this was not to be learned casually with others or from books he needed professional assistance in the portsmouth commercial directory he found what he was looking for mr augustus delisle he asked politely at the door of a smart portsea terrace house it is sir at your service the rather austere gentleman answered with a slight bow appraising kydds appearance then bestowing on him a professional smile th language coach as can be engaged t fit a gentleman for converse even at the court o st james kydd persisted the same the man said with a sniff you should know that i count most of the noble houses of hampshire among my satisfied clients and are ye available for immediate engagement sir kydd asked abruptly why at such notice ive ten guineas to lay in yr hand as says itll fadge er very wellbut be aware sir i cannot abide the fugitive aspirate still less the cruelly truncated participle you shall bring along your child and he will not a younker sir its t be me ii dont quite understand you sir the man said uncertainly m names kydd and i want t speak wi the best of em yeve got me half a day every day until i can stand up an be taken for a lord every day he spluttered my young masters usually attend but twice a week and m time is limited sir kydd said impatiently id be thinkin ye a rare un if i sees ye refuse half a years fee for a few weeks work the refit ground forward in the dockyard but the day came not so many weeks later when teazer was released and became inhabited once more by her rightful denizens she stored watered and took in an overseas allowance of powder and shot the downs squadron being considered so active a station as to warrant a maximum loading there was no time to be lost admiral keith needed every vessel that swam in his crucial command and kydd was determined for teazer to play her part er i have to report ship ready for sea sir hallum said awkwardly kydd grunted it was now common knowledge about the ship that their clerk was still at large adrift from leave a letter of recall had been sent to him which had been acknowledged but he had not appeared and it now seemed that the ship would sail without him it was no use they could not delay kydd sighed heavily and went on deck searching vainly for a hurrying figure on the dockside single up he ordered all lines that tethered them alongside were let go save two away from the wharf dockyard workboats attended for the sloop to warp out and in teazer there was the ageold thrill of the outward bound sail bent on men expectantly at their posts kydd reluctantly gave the command take us out mr dowse ropes splashed into the murky water and teazer was ready to spread her wings colour appeared at the signal tower our pennant proceed sir squeaked their brand new midshipman tawse wielding the big telescope importantly acknowledge kydd said heavily with the ebb tide teazer loosed sail and left to meet her destiny the narrow entrance was difficult and needed concentration they passed the rickety jollity of portsmouth point close abeam then king henrys tower on one side with haslar and fort blockhouse only a couple of hundred yards to the other and they were through haaaands t the braces constrained by sandbanks close to larboard and the nab still to round before clear water there was little room for manoeuvre hes there sir screamed a youngster wildly pointing shorewards a sharplined wherry was putting off hastily from the sally port on a course to intercept its mr renzi right enough confirmed purchet after snatching at the telescope without hesitating kydd rapped heave to mr dowse it was madness in the fast current and sandbanks past the entrance to be not under way and close astern a heavy frigate was coming down on them at speed with the wind large there was no other way than to wheel about awkwardly and place the fore aback but kydd was not going to lose renzi the frigate plunged past with an energetic volley of abuse from her quarterdeck the wherry stroked out manfully and at last hooked on at the mainchains while teazer paid off before the wind willing hands hauled renzi in his bundles of books needing more robust hoisting i do apologise sir renzi said formally kydd still in his quarterdeck brace frowned but said nothing we lost a wheel before petersfield and mr renzi i rather feel that in this instance you might have been topping it overmuch the cunctator as it were renzi was transfixed with astonishment at his friends cultivated words the latin cunctatordelayerwas indeed appropriate an allusion to the tactic used by the roman commander in the war with hannibal an attempt to deny the enemy a battle why thank you sir he wasnt about to let kydd get away with this one whatever the reason for its mysterious appearance thank you kydd said crestfallen for the compliment of course dear fellow it was by this very tactic that quintus fabius maximus may have shamed the roman army but it undoubtedly won him the war and his nickname the open channel won and a fine westerly in their sails by evening there was chance to sup together renzi opened politely er at the risk of impertinence i cannot help but remark the elegance of your speech its genteel delivery the quite simple renzi old chap ive given it a deal of thought and it seems to me the only way to move forward in this world is not to kick against the pricks a flash of smugness was quickly smothered but be agreeable to the customary forms of civility and breeding when in genteel company in fine if im to enter in on society then im to be like them and you have m word on it enter in i will then you have my most earnest admiration tomer kydd old trout so recently shunned by society and cast into the very depths yet you hold no grudge no antipathy towards those who its past i have a bright future now and im going to take it with both hands and do what i have to are you certain that m dear friend since coming into my fortune i stand amazed at the boldness and presumption as can be found from having a pot o gold at your back i cannot fear the richdressed when im rigged the same or stand mumchance while they talk wry when i can just as well there are other you must believe ive not trifled away my time m dear renzi theres quantities of professional gentlemen in portsmouth who do rue our sailing and i have a stand o books in my cabin as will keep me amused for voyages to come i honour you for it renzi said youll oblige me by maintaining a quality o discourse while about my person i shall endeavour to do so came the sincere response then m course is set tysoe do attend to mr renzis glass if you please the downs a fulcrum for the torrent of shipping that came and went around the corner of the north foreland into the thames and the mighty maw of london where hundreds of ships of all flags might be lying anchored waiting for a favourable wind to take them outward bound downchannel or inbound to the north or across to the baltic the tenmile stretch of the downs was bordered five miles offshore by the notorious goodwin sands since medieval times a fearful hazard but this acted both as a shelter and a barrier it was the point at which the channel was at its narrowest a bare eighteen miles from dover to the french encampments at cap gris nez the last kydd had seen of it had been as the master of a convict ship bound for new south wales after the desolate shingle spit of dungeness it was the wide sweep of bay that was the foreshore of the smugglers haunt of romney marsh then the rising crags of folkestone turning into the soaring white splendour of shakespeares cliff dover and on to the rounding of south foreland in the bright earlymorning light the massive chalk ramparts seemed to kydd to stand foursquare and proudly defiant against englands foes marching away north in impregnable array teazer closed within half a mile of them to round the foreland and make the southern reaches of the downs the vista of countless ships at anchor was opening up before them now coasters east indiamen colonial traders from far distant parts of the globe an impressive multitude stretching for ten miles of open water but kydd had eyes only for the naval anchorage that of the legendary downs squadron standing so valiantly at the forefront of englands defence there across the anchorage he would never forget her ever the seventyfour riding to two anchors her lines oldfashioned but graceful it was monarch the flagship after the bloody battle of camperdown not so many years before kydd had in her become one of the very few who had taken the incredible journey from before the mast as a common seaman to the quarterdeck as a kings officer he let hallum take teazer inshore to moor while he took his fill of the sight it seemed odd but only monarch and two other minor shipsoftheline were present three frigates further distant and a number of sloops where was the battle squadron if not with their commanderinchief they would know soon enough tysoe had out his dress uniform and buckling on his handsome sword kydd returned on deck to board his gig poulden his coxswain and the entire boats crew were smartly turned out in matching blue jacketshe was determined to be noticed in the new command teazer blared poulden importantly in answer to the hail as they drew near to the flagship a sideparty could be seen assembling and kydds heart swelled he mounted the side of the old ship slowly letting the moment touch his soul it was the great cabin he remembered but admiral lord keith his commanderinchief was before him and this was no time for lingering sentiment do sit down mr kydd the august being said absently taking papers from his flaglieutenant and flicking his eyes down them the lieutenant collected others and with a glance at kydd left the cabin i do bid ye welcome to my command sir the scots brogue seemed to be one with his austere presence thank you sir he held up one particular paper and intoned mildly youve had some adventuring since last we met his cold eyes rose to meet kydds ivethat is to say its been interesting enough for me sir the last time they had met was in the previous war when keith had been forced to give kydd orders to lay up teazer and resign his command in the retrenchment following the announcement of peacebut he had also bestowed that precious captaincy in the first place ill have ye know sir that the downs is a far different duty from what yere used to he paused significantly no more than six leagues distant napoleon bonaparte and his hordes lie in an encampment ready to lunge at us across the water our duty is plain sir it must be kydd responded strongly is it keith said pugnaciously leaning forward i will say this to you mr kydd if any captain returns from sea with a prize at his tail without he has an explanation i promise i will break him sir in these perilous times the first duty of a sea officer is the ruin and destruction of the enemy forces not the pursuit of private gain keith leaned back slowly that said theres everything in your record to encourage me to believe your service here will be a credit to the royal navy when you return you may depend on an active employment when i return this is the most complex and fastmoving station in the realm i will not have my commanders in any doubt about the strategics and dispositions of the situation in which they sail you will this day take coach for londonthe admiraltyand within the span of a week acquaint yourself most thoroughly with the details of what faces us is this clear er yes sir my ship your ship will relieve another here pro tem are ye in doubt of your premier sir mr hallum no sir kydd said hastily a most reliable officer your orders will be ready for your return good day to ye mr kydd the capital was crowded noisy and smelled as pungently of seacoal smoke and local stenches as it always did but kydd was not of a mind to care the hackney carriage creaked and swayed as it bore him towards the admiralty office in whitehall the jarvey swearing sulphurously at any who dared cross him while kydd gazed from the grimy window he had left renzi with tysoe at the inn he smiled to himself at the pathetic excuses renzi had contrived at short notice to accompany him but was secretly pleased it would not be all a duty visit and he had never before been with his friend in london they lurched from cockspur street into the broad reaches of whitehall and came to a stop by the colonnaded screen of the admiralty kydd paid off the jarvey and hastily pushed through the admiring throng outside and into the courtyard he raised an arm in acknowledgement of the patriotic cries that rang out at the sight of his uniform and hurried inside through the high portico the doorman showed him to the captains roombut this time it was not as a penniless commander begging for a ship in the days of the last peace but as the captain of a frontline manowar about to be informed of the grave strategic questions that faced his country there were other commanders in the room they looked at him enviously as the first lords second secretary came down to spirit him away earl st vincent was in the board room seated at the long table beneath the legendary windgauge a vast mass of papers was spread forth and he was flanked by several dourlooking men not in uniform they did not rise or attempt to leave the first lord however got to his feet and returned kydds civil bow so your flagofficer wants ye to hoist aboard an understanding of our situation he said bleakly ayeer yes sir right and proper too st vincent growled sitting again heavily he had aged since kydd had seen him before his thickset figure bowed and stiff this was the man who had taken it upon himself to root out the gross inefficiency and corruption of the royal dockyards standing alone against the powerful timber cartels in a bluff and uncompromising seadog fashion he had faced down the political storm that resulted the downs commandyoull be seeing as much action as yed wish sir he said with a wintry smile as its rightly said the frontier of britain is the coastline of the enemy do your duty sir and england need have no concern for its fate an elegantly dressed postcaptain appeared at the other door and waited diffidently ive no time to attend to ye myself st vincent said with an ironical glance at the seated figures captain boyd will see to the matter good fortune be with ye mr kydd thank you sir but the old earl had turned back to the grey men and he was dismissed boyd late of bellona and he was a postcaptain of one of cornwalliss major shipsoftheline and had probably been moved closer to the centre of power to acquire the necessary experience before elevation to flag rank kydd brigsloop teazer kydd said defensively at boyds languid and polished manner joining the downs from where mr kydd the officer said distantly as they walked together the channel islands for m sins kydd said as lightly as he could boyd raised one eyebrow a sea change of note he said drily youve seen active service no doubt the nileand acre following kydd said with a touch of defiance boyd stopped did you really by god he said suddenly respectful the droll affectation fell away as he resumed walking then youll relish the downsno end to the sport to be had there they entered a small office and a worriedlooking lieutenant glanced up from his desk do carry on dukes boyd told him testily then asked kydd you have somewhere to stay the white hart in charles street boyd nodded then crossed to gaze out of the window his office overlooked the vast paradeground behind horse guards the army headquarters further along distant screams of sergeants and the regular tramp of soldiers in formation drifted up in the warm sunshine he turned back to kydd the volunteers always at their marching up and down i see now mr kydd i rather think youll need me to provide something a trifle more useful than i can at short notice shall we say tomorrow at ten at ten would be most civil in you sir oh and it might be politic to present yourself at the admiralty reception tonight boyd added a russian who thinks to mount some expedition that has our interest carriages at sixswords and decorations im afraid no sir mr renzi has not yet returned tysoe informed him kydd sighed and took an armchair his friend could be anywhere in the vast seething city after some musty book or arranging to meet a savantjust when he needed reassurance before an important social occasion both formal and diplomatic idly he picked up the morning newspaper a theatre scandal occupied all of three columns and trading figures for the stock exchange were neatly summarised on the right but by far the majority of articles were in some way connected to the war one piece dealt at tedious length with a review by the duke of york of the medway militia battalions a breathless editorial alerted the faithful readers to the dangers of a baltic embargo on ship timber another item reported that the conveyance of a trade minister of spain said to be very soon an enemy state had been set upon by a mob and lucky to escape with his life the pretext had been a punitive increase on duty for imported spanish wines hardly his fault kydd thought wryly he turned to the next page and stared in surprise at a detailed picture of a vast platform of heroic dimensions fit to carry a regiment of men and horses and held aloft by a dozen fire balloons of the kind that the montgolfier brothers had demonstrated before the french revolution in earnest words the newspaper reiterated its promise to keep its readers informed of the plans of napoleon bonaparte to deploy such craft in great numbers for the invasion of britainten thousand men and guns to cross the water as fast as a galloping horse then descend from the skies in irresistible numbers visiting upon britain what the continent had already suffered it was pointed out gravely that if any would doubt it they had only to recall the historic first flight across the channel by jeffries and blanchard which had occurred all of twenty years before kydd paused he had no idea of the practicality of the scheme but if it were true then the navy would be helpless to defend the shores as the giant platforms sailed across overhead to invade it was a menace as unanswerable as that which he had heard from a garrulous army officer in the coach that bonaparte was employing his idle army in boulogne to dig a tunnel under the channel kydd tried to dismiss a mental picture of battalions of crack grenadiers suddenly pouring out of the earth in the pretty countryside of kent to overwhelm the local volunteers yet who could say it was impossible at one wheelbarrow of earth from each man every twenty minutes with a quarter of a million men it would not take so very long to tunnel the eighteen miles bonaparte had been preparing his invasion now for more than a year the tunnel might be nearing completion at that very moment hows this sir as some might say a brown study renzi had returned unnoticed and came to sit in the other chair here old fellow i have something for your diversion he slapped down a few garishly coloured prints kydd picked up the top one entitled a correct view of the french machine intended to convey their soldiers for the invasion of england it was a gigantic raft and had what appeared to be windmills spaced along its sides to give point to its size troops of horses were galloping about its decks most ingenious renzi murmured the mills may be turned into whatever direction the wind deigns to blow and being in train each to a paddlewheel we have a means of locomotion for a vessel to enable it to proceed on any course it wishes one may assume even directly into the winds eye he added thoughtfully kydd perused the next a french print of a vessel la terreur dalbion of extraordinary length and with an obligatory liberty cap in bloody red atop an enormous forward turret and what seemed to be an iron skeleton flourishing the grim reapers scythe on the after one in gleeful detail a legend explained that the turrets were machinery towers and inside a series of paddlewheels would be powered by a great number of horses whose combined strength would urge the craft to speeds unmatched by the noblest of english frigates kydds eyes met renzis in sombre reflection before he picked up the next this was of a flat lozengeshaped raft fully seven hundred feet across with a central citadel and powered by a giant lateen sail on a swivel itself five hundred feet long it was soberly estimated to be capable of transporting thirty thousand troops other prints depicted mancarrying kites unsinkable hidecovered cork boats and other bizarre contrivances and today i heard of a weapon of terror that would chill the blood of any man renzi said it is a species of clockwork balloon a what an automaton aloft renzi said set forth it requires no man aboard to control it a deadly craft of the skies which when commanded by its mechanism soullessly rains down fiery destruction on the cowering wretches beneath it surely theyd never im desolated to say that it appears to be true my friend at the royal societys rooms i was privileged to view an experimental french balloon captured only this last month it is raised aloft not by the fire of montgolfier but a cold miasma of lavoisiers hydrogen which of course will never need tending by man in order to retain its lifting powers then yes dear fellow renzi said quietly it would seem that very soon war will be visited on every creature promiscuously skill at arms will be of no account in this new itll never happen kydd retorted cant you see england would never stoop s low as to use such and for the french why theyd hold back for fear wed pay em back in their own coin no theyd not dare bonaparte is soon to be crowned the emperor napoleon but mark me he wont rest until hes master of the entire world at kydds look of disbelief renzi continued darkly you dont understand the man he holds his country in a vile subjection while he destroys and plunders but the world sees only his glory the france of versailles and the encyclopedists no longer exists for inside the country he trailed off kydd felt unsettled strong words from a man o letters im persuaded he said then added where did you hear all this renzi gave a twisted smile before he spoke dear fellow i do believe i must trust you may i have your word that nothing of what im about to tell you will go any further why er yes o course nicholas very well your understanding of my occupation in jersey is that i was a species of secretary to an exiled royalist prince this is in fact true inasmuch that commodore dauvergne is indeed the prince of bouillon and awaits a restoration of his fortunes however the greater part of my duties was to support and assist in his real vocationan unremitting clandestine war against the tyrant conducted through a network of brave souls opposed to his rule in that cause i had occasion to treat with spies and agents as they came and went in france as indeed once i was obliged to do myself you must believe me when i say that this has given me insights of a personal nature into the character of bonapartes imperium that trouble me greatly you will be startled to learn that secret police are being deployed by him for renzi went on to recount what he had learned of the true state of the tyranny that he had played his part in trying to overthrow the paradoxes that lay at the heart of the most rational nation in civilisation which had been torn apart by a bloody revolution and was now being forged together again at the will of one man for one purpose his own personal vainglory kydd felt growing disquiet he had never seen renzi so intense on a subject so you were aa spy then nicholas kydd said uncomfortably shocked to discover that while he had been roaming the seas as a successful privateer his friend had been hazarding his life for higher principles a spy yes but in a particular servicethe desperate plot to kidnap bonaparte that came close to ending this war but unhappily terminated in the most hideous consequences to those involved you should know i find the practice of spying odious and utterly incompatible with the condition of gentleman and i pray most earnestly that i shall never again be so employed kydd slumped in his chair if renzi thought that this was much more than simply the latest war with the french there was every reason to take fear that some of the rumours and agitations at large were true and the peril to england that much more serious than he had thought later no doubt when he was ready renzi would divulge more about his time in jersey he had come back shattered and must have endured much it was a glittering affair and with a mixture of exhilaration and trepidation kydd entered the grand room with boyd the hundred or so guests were in every mode of fashion and elegance their stars and ribbons in a breathtaking show of splendour under the chandeliers it would oblige me sir should you point out the russians to me kydd murmured in his best speech bowing civilly to a passing couple ill do better than that kydd comemeet rezanov hes to be their new ambassador to japan boyd replied suavely ushering him across the room ah sir may i present commander kydd a distinguished officer in his majestys navy he did confide to me that it would gratify him immensely to make the acquaintance of one so soon to make such an historic circumnavigation mr kydd the kammerherr rezanov a compact but striking man with a neat black beard regarded him dispassionately as boyd excused himself and left your servant sir kydd said bowing low a sea officer of note i believe rezanov said mildly in barely accented english why er mr kydd you bear the nile medal and i have no doubt that your presence at this gathering is not altogether fortuitous sir modesty forbids me a reply kydd said smoothly inwardly exulting at the successful deployment of his newfound urbanity but i do confess im curious to know the objectives of your expedition rezanovs eyebrows shot up in astonishment then he eased into a smile very well sir you speak directlyand i will tell you by direction of his imperial majesty the tsar our prime concern is to discover new routes that will enable us to supply our colonies in russian america russian america kydd supposed he must be speaking of the frozen reaches of the american continent to the northwest you will have no conception of the difficulty we face at the momentit would astonish you to learn that we expend the lives of four thousand horses a year in the traverse of siberia with supplies and alternate means would be very welcome as our interests extend southward kydd was out of his depth if the russians were entering from the north and the spanish were to the south where did this leave the united states and canada he reached for more familiar ground a voyage of that length sir is a great thing your ships are well found at all from kronstadt to sitka island it certainly is an enterprise to remark but as to our vessels you may rest easyboth the nadezhda and the neva are recently purchased from the royal navy mr kydd for your further questions i believe you shall speak now with the commander of the expedition kydd bowed in acceptance and was taken to a knot of officers in haughty discussion kapitán this is commander kydd rezanov snapped at a young but intensefeatured officer in the centre mr kydd kapitánpérvogo ivan krusenstern he bowed smartly with a crisp click of the heels and was gone my best wishes for your success sir kydd said to the officer as graciously as he could mr kruer i understand youre sailing in one of our ships he said slowly hoping the man had sufficient english for polite converse o course commander yell recall leander o the nile as was it was passing strange to hear the robust idiom of an english focsle coming from an exotically dressed russian shes now th good ship nadezhda an im t see her where yr captain vancouver once led he saw kydds surprise and added dismissively oh ive done a mort o service wi the kings navy afore now why er to be sure kydd said taken aback i do recall leander mr krusenstern as i was at the nile myself a fine ship and gallant krusenstern beamed as his eyes flicked to kydds medals he leaned across to shake kydds hand so ye were bgod an twas a thumpin fine mauling ye gave em that night cully the circle of officers about them fell back at the sudden comradely friendliness and kydd grinned a thunderin hard enough mill fr all hands as i cn tell ye an for yself a world cruise why yell have yarns enough t tell at every dogwatch fr years t come aye well its aught but a tradin matter krusenstern said guardedly taking kydd aside an th mutinous dogs o tlingit tribesmen on kodiak needin our attention they started walking alone together but belay th tough yarns weve a tight barky or two and our pelcompass an yr tauntons artificial magnet asll see us through all ataunto a right rousin voyage itll be the two seamen disappeared happily into the throng in the morning it seemed that boyd had got together his appraisal of the situation but before they began he told kydd that it was noted he had conducted himself in a most satisfactory manner to cut out krusenstern from under the eyes of the ambassador by talking seacant was a most ingenious stratagem you should look to more of the same in the future i dare to say er the kapitán krusenstern he claims service in the royal navy kydd asked he has and others too since tsarina catherines day theyve had many of their best men serve with us for a spell firstclass training they believe any active service if by that you mean a whiff of powdersmoke then most definitely odd thing though this ivan seems to prefer the company of the foremast hands to the officers when ashore a harddrinking cove you see your russian as they mounted the stairs to the upper floor of the admiralty office kydd tried to reconcile his excitement at the pomp and glitter of a diplomatic occasion with the nervous febrile atmosphere of a london trying to make light of the dreadful threat of imminent invasion the frightful images of the prints and renzis revelations had stayed with him should we take fear o those fantastical invasion machines do you think he asked hesitantly at first boyd did not reply then he said thoughtfully its as well never to underestimate the corsican kydd he knows how to sow fear and panic by lie and invention to believe every word of the moniteur would be to credit the tyrant with ten times more victories than he has but we must accept that there are those to which we are compelled to accede they reached a discreet door and boyd found his keys as he selected the right one he added soberly i suppose it is possible that many of these horrors are rumour and deceit but the french are a logical and inventive people and there may well be substance in them i really cant say the key rattled and the door opened on a darkened room boyd crossed to a single shuttered window and threw it open daylight through the bars revealed a single bare table and chairs what resembled a ships chart locker with its array of flat drawers stood along one wall kydd was motioned to the table while boyd closed and locked the door then sat opposite mr kydd he said with chilling gravity what i have to tell you this morning is privy information whose disclosure would cause panic and riot if known by the general public yet it is necessary for you to learn of it should the worst happen do you understand i do sir very well let me begin by admitting to you that never in the history of this realm has england lain under greater menace of invasion and consequent extinction as a nation our country cherishes the liberty of individuals and as such were illplaced to maintain great armies most of our land continues its daily round much as its forefathers did with little to tell that a war rages on the continent king and parliament are amicable but the people will not stand for oppression on the contrary side france now is subject to the resolve of one man who is able to focus the entire resources of his nation to one end an invasion and he is so pledged to invade this country i do not well see how he can avoid it therefore we must stretch every sinew in our defence there are volunteers the militia and our army all of which combined are greatly outnumbered by napoleons battleseasoned legions kydd stirred restlessly sir you discount the navy as our if said boyd heavily by any means the french get ashore there are plans he opened a drawer extracted a large map and spread it out our best intelligence now is that bonaparte intends to descend on the closest part of england to the coast of france his finger stabbed down at the shoreline of the downs in fact just to the south dover castle is an ancient but still formidable fortification which must be subdued but see here kydd recognised the flat and barely inhabited romney marsh a few miles on to the south its wide open to a massed assault on a broad front and i fear it will prove a forlorn hope to expect our militia and volunteers to move up quickly enough to meet a sudden descent kydd frowned what possible chance did those inexperienced amateurs have against the hardened troops that had stormed over europe to victory after victory boyd continued remorselessly thus it would seem not impossible to conceive that a landing would be met with a rapid success kydd went cold did thewill the king his majesty is under no doubt of his duty glenbervie of the household tells me he sleeps every night with his camp equipage and accoutrements to hand to the evident anguish of the queen in course he will not be suffered to take the field in the strictest confidence i have to tell you that the bishop of gloucester has prepared his palace for the evacuation of the king and the royal family across the severn at worcester in addition sir brook watson the commissary general has instructions in the event of the imminent loss of the capital to make ready thirty oxwagons for the transport of the nations entire gold reserves to be deposited with the king at worcester under the same guard to speak of such things to hear and consider the destruction and conquering of his country of birth it was a thing of horror for kydd boyd continued at woolwich the arsenal and artillery stores will be taken as will the purfleet ordnance board powder magazines to weedon in northamptonshire there is in construction there a vast military complex which will act also as a seat of government in the event of this is hard to bear sir kydd blurted surely the fall of the capital it is by way of being astride the grand union canal and well placed for the conduct of a protracted campaign kydd tried to gather his wits thethe common people sir how will they er what might be done to they have not been overlooked plans have been drawn up for their preservation here these instructions have been lately sent to every town and village in the south he extracted a leaf and passed it over kydd read the deputy lieutenants and justices the following directions in case of an alarm of the landing by the enemy for the removal of women and children aged and infirm to a place of general military rendezvous it went on to direct how a village was to be sectioned by responsibility how carts were to be numbered marked and covered such that those with a ticket of the right form might be conveyed away with provisions following males of the village over the age of twelve had duties of driving livestock or firing deadstock nothing of value to be left for the foraging army clergy and other worthies would act as shepherds and superintendents and it was trusted that on the receipt of an alarm regularity sobriety and seemliness would characterise the comportment of the villagers more followed in the same vein calm ordered and clear but underlying all was awful reality that the defences of england had failed and a hostile army was at last to take vengeance for centuries of humiliation sir the navy is ready weve fleets o the finest battleships as are poised to fall on the invading just so mr kydd boyd sighed and sat down wearily as you shall see later our squadrons are outnumbered by a margin and are wide scattered while we have the greatest confidence in them and recognising bonaparte faces formidable difficulties im supposing they are overborne and the enemy is able to reach our coasts in that melancholy eventuality the last service the navy can do its country is for the small ships to throw themselves before the armada in sacrifice in the hope that the time so dearly bought might he was interrupted by a timid knock at the door sir the volunteers his lieutenant asked ah yes well be down presently he rose briskly then scrupulously barred and shuttered the room volunteers asked kydd as they clattered down the stairs do you have any objection boyd said cuttingly the loyal london volunteers these men may well be hazarding their lives in the very near future to attend a parade seems little enough in return a parade in that case sir o course ill be present kydd hastened to say mollified boyd went on its a duty to be performed by those in the admiralty who can from time to time be spared as you must count yourself they left the rear of the admiralty and emerged onto the great expanse of the paradeground opposite two long lines of redcoats stood motionless kydds mind though was on what had been passed on in the office of rumours he had had his fill but he had been shaken to hear the final dissolution of his country discussed in such clinical terms a stand was erected on one side flags of all kinds proudly aloft and flanked by a guard in different regalia be so good as to make a countenance sir boyd hissed icily there are those who look to us for assurance in these times his own demeanour was pleasant and confident and he stepped out forcefully kydd quickly falling in beside him assuming a like pose they mounted the stage nodding to the other officers in uniforms of every possible description and sat nonchalantly a corpulent and redfaced general puffed on to the central dais and to the left with a spirited whirl of drumsticks and crash of cymbals a band stepped out kydd was in no mood to enjoy the spectacle as each rigid line passed he mechanically rose and removed his cocked hat with the rest but his mind was elsewhere to seas far over the horizon where without a shadow of doubt the destiny of england was to be decidednot here with these wellmeaning amateur soldiers at last it was over and they could return inside their little room again boyds expression tightened as he pulled out a long map covered with ciphers in red and tiny scrawled notes he studied it for a moment this is our situation as of this morning the disposition of our major fleets need not concern youthe brest blockade with cornwallis is holding nelson is in the mediterranean and the north sea fleet is watching over the dutch what is of more intimate concern is the disposition of bonapartes forces he glanced at kydd as if weighing what he should say i will not hide it from you since it is you who must oppose them the number of lineofbattle ships he has to command is many and will be still greater if spain moves against us as it must surely do but these are matters of high strategy and change from day to day you will want to know more of what faces your own part of the field in fine it is the forefront of the battle the invasion grande armée is massing with three corpsmarshals davout soult and ney if youre interestedwith more than a hundred thousand picked troops ready to embark for the first assault the emperor bonaparte himself to take command for this as you will know he has been fast assembling the largest invasion flotilla in history with specialist craft only some of which we have knowledge of kydd stared at the map the densepacked notations on the french side seemed endless stretching away down the coastline across the channelso very closea single line of dots and squares was brought right up against the line of the sea you will be informed about the details of these vessels later take it from me that they are in their thousands and under the direct command of admiral bruix a most experienced and canny officer they have been in the building at every boatyard and river port on the coast and are being assembled at the main ports to the north of cap gris nez we have calais dunkirk gravelines and so on to ostend and flushing to the south wimereux ambleteuse boulogne and étaples of which boulogne has by far the largest concentration now bonaparte is no sailor he believes the channel is a ditch to be crossed as in any other military operation but he will find it very different however he is the devil incarnate in the arts of war and is vigorously pursuing great works to assist his cause for instance at boulogne he is creating an embarkation quay a mile long and an artificial basin capable of floating a hundred vessels he is not to be underestimatedsome say he is mad but it were folly to take him so with his immense resources and a surprise by your infernal devices or a feint at ireland he could be across in the space of a tide or two only no sir make no error were under the greatest peril that ever was then what is our force sir kydd said evenly stand fast the main battle fleets we have three lines of defence against the immediate prospect of invasion boyd replied the first is of sloops and gunvessels and it is the inshore squadron of admiral keiths downs command against the french coast he added drily when kydd held silent he continued the second is of heavier metal and consists of frigates and older sailoftheline and it is in with the english coast to contest any landing in the southeast as well within the downs command the third may be found in every creek and estuary from hartland point in north cornwall to great yarmouth on our east coast by this i am referring to the sea fencibles who at this moment are some twentyfive thousand strong and manning some eight hundred vessels of er all kinds then quite the first line of defence must be our strongest there is no doubt but that you must brace yourself for the hardestfought struggle this age i do wish you well in this commander sir well go on to the details now signals chart emendations the invasion craft and their characteristics as known rendezvous positionstheres much to take in first we shall look into the new signal book kydd was troubled and apprehensive the mass of operational particulars had done nothing to lessen the effect of boyds first words that this was a situation of such dire consequence as had never been faced by his country before now knowing the details he was only too aware of the knife edge of chance factors that could determine the future of the world as head of the entire military strength of the kingdom the duke of york had nevertheless solemnly pronounced that the fate of the nation is in the hands of the navy and he must be right the war was as much the royal navys to lose as napoleons to win a fainthearted admiral a deceitful piece of intelligence to send a fleet in the wrong direction any or all could ensure bonaparte got the unfettered hours he needed returning to the white hart kydd found his chair and sat quietly eyes closed letting the tensions drain in two days he would return to the downs and take teazer to war would she come through would he the only thing that was certain was that the immediate future would test both himself and his ship to the limit half a million frenchmen under arms opposed by just a few thousand stormtossed seamen in worn ships do i intrude brother renzis gentle voice interrupted his thoughts oh er not so much m friend kydd said opening his eyes renzi theres a matter i need to talk to you about if y will it was coming out too stiffly but he had to say it that is it touches on the future you see why certainly renzi said sitting iveits been an interesting week and now im much clearer what is to be facing us and what is that pray if bonaparte crosses its nothing lessn a fight to the finishthe last extremity if you catch m meaning if he crosses the invasion fleet is readynear a hundred thousand men in the first assault only the navy to keep em off the first line o defence is ourselves m friend up against the french coast if they break through us and launch their monstrous flotilla theres precious little to give em pause before theyre flooding ashore if i may be so bold dear fellow might i observe that this agitation of spirit is quite unlike the tom kydd of yore renzi said lightly but his eyes were sombre youve not heard what i have kydd retorted grimly then caught himself no m point is this that shortly teazer is sailing into um uncertain times its possible well need to stand against bonapartes whole armadaand m dear friend id rather i had no distractions if you understand he said firmly am i to apprehend nicholas its a hard enough thing that i must place teazer athwart their bows its hard but its necessary what is not so is that i put the life of a learned scholar to hazard are you hear me if you will you must agree theres clerks aplenty to be had but not such a one whos as well a philosophical gentleman one whose work mankind will soon surely set a value to kydd faced renzi squarely nicholas im asking that you take y books and remain ashore until this business is concluded that will not be possible renzi said immediately pray why not grant me that my sense of duty is as consequential as your own and for all that there is little enough i can do for my country in its extremity all i ask is that i be allowed to continue in my post of duty to the satisfaction of my conscience ita time might come that as we agreed in the beginning if the ship is in imminent danger of boarding or some such you may rest assured i will take up arms to defend it as to the value of my carcass to posterity you will allow me to be the judge of that nicholas this is not dear chap there is nothing further to discuss rather your attention should be better reserved for the item addressed to you so recently brought by messenger he found a slim packet and handed it over it was a substantial sized invitation of stiff pasteboard and edged with gold a ducal crest was prominent with it was a hastily scrawled note from boyd indicating that he had been able to contrive an invitation for kydd before he left to an evening of entertainment and fireworks at the estate of the duke of stanwick further up the thames in the country a duke this was far beyond anything kydd had experienced before and despite his anxieties he felt a quickening of excitement it was generous of boyd to think of him at this level there would be the wealthy and famous statesmen and nobility and before going to war he would at least taste the heady delights of the highest society nicholas you must come o course kydd said impulsively giving him the card renzi studied it carefully the duke of stanwick at such an eminence you will not lack for fine victuals or the company of ladies of quality i believe an evening assemblyit will be by the river in as elegant a landscaping as mr repton has ever achieved then ill send to captain boyd to say i thank you no kydd drew in his breath sharply at times i find you a mort hard t fathom my friend here i am asking you to enter in on society again again kydd hesitated only a moment nicholas weve been particular friends for a long time and please believe me ive tried to understand but why it is youve never talked about your family always kept mumchance concerning your real past no letters from home no visits youre a gentleman o the first rank thats plain to any simkin and on jamaica i met your brother as is the same his name is laughton so this is yours as well i know something of the moral feelings that made you turn your back on em and go to sea as a foremast jackbut you became a kings officer and can be proud of it return to your family with honour why do you not renzi sat as still as a statue and did not speak your family is wealthy you told me so yourself so why then do you top it the poor scholar why do it is a matter for myself alone how i conduct my own affairs renzi snapped this is not a subject i wish to pursue kydd lifted his head and said softly but i rather think we must sir wha your presumption on our friendship is astonishing nicholas if you are to marry my sister one day im bound t satisfy myself on the particulars no wait let me finish there are those whod say that any in your circumstance must surely have offended the family honour in a grievous way and been cast out to fend how they may im not in their number but im most curious as to why your family has so deserted you and why youre so shy of showing your face in society renzi looked away then returned kydds gaze steadily i can see how it must appear there is good and proper reason for this i can sincerely assure you kydd said nothing very well renzi sighed if you must its easy enough said im the eldest the heir presumptive after a disagreeable contretemps with my father concerning my unwillingness to give up the sea he has seen fit to disown me so the estate passes to another thus im to find my own way in the world you see and o course this is why you cannot not at all my fathers character is not unknown to society and no doubt there is ready sympathy to be discovered but the chief reason for the discretion you have observed is my profound disinclination to come upon my father in a social situation he is often to be found in london for the seasonbut i seem to feel secure within the purlieu of the royal society he smiled thinly er it seems hard t say but might i ask kydd said awkwardly if you areif it can be said youre of noble birth certainly my father is the fifth earl farndon of eskdale hall in wiltshire it cannot escape you that had matters passed in another vein then in the usual course of events at my succeeding to the title cecilia might rightly look to the style of the countess of farndon wife of the sixth earl and mistress of eskdale hall struck dumb with the revelation kydd could only wait for renzi to resume as it is i shall endeavour to earn her respect and attention with my philosophies which i am sanguine will bear fruit within a conscionable time i er feel it um inappropriate to apprise her of what can never be and most fervently trust and hope she will be satisfied to bemrs renzi for the first time kydd had full measure of the truth of his friends moral compass the deep well of conviction from which he found the strength and courage to see through his logical decisions to their conclusion and he was humbled nicholas he said in a low voice as t that i cn tell yeer youfor a certainty she will be satisfied m very dear friend in the earlysummer evening the misthung thames was enchanting the darkening waters aglitter with the red of the flaming torches set at the edge of the grassy slopes before the stately hall your grace commander kydd of the royal navy shortly to take ship for the french coast amiable words from the elderly duke gracious attentions from the duchess a sweeping curtsy and thoughtful gaze from the eldest daughter then into the throng bowing to right and left making agreeable conversation in the excitement of the warm evening kydd worked his way to the long table of refreshments a full orchestra arrayed just beyond struck up with a grandiose rule britannia at which he found himself immediately occupied in acknowledging the civil bows in his direction boyd passed in conversation with an imposing lady whose pearls alone would have been sufficient to buy teazer complete with her crew she glanced across to kydd and drew herself up boyd is this one of your young men she asked imperiously indeed it is not milady this is commander kydd of teazer sloopofwar do you introduce me then sir she commanded mr kydd please meet lady musgrave dowager marchioness of winchcombe enchanted m lady kydd said with a wellpractised leg a fine evening he rose to meet a quizzical look a handsome blade indeed and i vow quite wasted floating about on all that sea tell me mr kydd are you in london for the season or im desolated to say maam but mr bonaparte has quite spoiled my plans ill be back aboard to sail very soon a tiresome and disagreeable fellow your bonaparte i say canning she called to a distinguished gentleman nearby what are we to do with this napoleon bonaparte hes quite ruined mr kydds season why lady musgrave surely the young gentleman is best placed of us all to chastise the fellow the man gave an exquisite bow and returned to his conversation ahquite a political can always be relied upon to conjure some words to sport with she held up her lorgnette now boyd ive decided mr kydd will escort me tonight be off with you she took kydds arm and they moved away together the orchestra was playing a spirited britons strike home and followed with some delicate purcell kydd was swept up in the charged atmosphere part excitement and part defiance at the fearful danger they were all facing dusk fell more lights were brought and the hubbub increased kydd met statesmen and nobility ladies of quality and young bucks of the fancy in a dizzying whirl and with more champagne it was becoming difficult to tell which was the greater realitythis fantastic gathering of jewelled splendour under the torchlight or the private knowledge that he was a sea captain about to go forth to defend his country at one point nibbling at a sweetmeat and listening to a somewhat racy account of a country weekend he happened to look at the black river sliding silently past and over to the opposite bank as his vision adapted to the darkness he saw that hundreds of people were silently standing there watching it was unnerving were these the common folk come to see the quality on show in their finery was he really one of them with a guilty surge he realised that tonight he must be numbered among the wellborn indisputably he had now won a place at the highest levels he gulped at the heady realisation but before he could dwell on it there was a tap of the lorgnette on his arm youre not paying me attention mr kydd but the frown turned to a smile and she confided a charming picture is it not i do so adore these outside entertainments kydd bowed it is an evening i will not soon forget m lady he said with perfect sincerity the best is yet to comeand i do believe that now is the time mystified kydd tried to look knowing but she laughed mr handels music for the royal fireworks silly the orchestra began the noble dignified piece and kydd felt peculiarly elevated there was general movement to the waters edge at the bend of the river he saw a procession of boats coming some with lights strung around the canopy each with oarsmen in striking uniform keeping perfect stroke these men need have no fear of the pressgang for they were in the livery of the worshipful company of watermen a sudden whoosh startled everyone as a rocket soared up from a nearby raft concealed in the blackness of the river it was the signal for others and as the music swelled the sky was lit with vibrant detonations while the reek of powdersmoke drifted down in the still night air caught up with the spectacle kydds attention was skywardsbut a muttered warning from the marchioness brought his eyes down to his astonishment all conversation suddenly ceased from his left the lords and ladies faced the river and were taken one by one in deep obeisance held motionless the king you fool his companion hissed from the depths of her curtsy kydd dropped hastily to one knee too flustered to recall the details of the elaborate court bow head still bowed he tried to glimpse the royal barge in progress it approached slowly and majestically and then by the sharp flash of firework clusters kydd caught sight of the person of his sovereign and liege lord his britannic majesty king george iii of great britain and ireland chapter and two in irons on account of disagreements with the soldiery ashore the first lieutenant finished his report visibly relieved that kydd had returned the crew had been restless keyed up to play a leading part in a desperate resistance to napoleons legions instead they had been idle in teazer anchored all week in the downs very well mr hallum er and were to hang out a signal immediately youre back on board make it so if y please kydd lost no time in going below to get out of his dusty travelling clothes and into his comfortable sea rig monarch did not bear her commanderinchiefs flag indicating keith was aboard his flagship so he had no need to report it would give him time to mr hallums compliments sir an boat putting off from actaeon an eager midshipman blurted at the door kydd knew he would not have been disturbed unless the boat was heading for teazer and bore someone of significance he lost no time in appearing on deck and watched while the gig threaded expertly towards them through the anchored vessels her ensign at the transom indicating a kings officer aboard boat ahoy pouldens challenge was answered immediately from the gig actaeon mr purchet roared kydd for this meant it was the captain of the thirtyeightgun frigate and as such he must be piped aboard by the boatswain charles savery sir the man introduced himself after punctiliously saluting teazers quarterdeck if we could repair to your cabin there he looked about appreciatively at the quality of the appointments then youve done well in the article of prizemoney he said equably ive been fortunate enough sir kydd replied cautiously aware that his appearance was not best suited to greeting a senior postcaptain savery gave a dry smile im here on behalf of admiral keith to enquire your readiness he being detained on another matter the man was large in teazers neat little cabin but his round jovial features were reassuring sir he particularly wishes to assure himself that you are in no doubt concerning the operational details of the downs command i take it that you have been well informed at the admiralty of the strategical objectives i have sirand i will confess t me its been a caution to learn what it is that faces us yes as it would to most id agree however to details you know the strength of admiral keiths command sir it was told to me as six otheline thirtytwo frigates and some hundred or more sloops quite so you should understand that the sailoftheline are old and unseaworthy each moored permanently to defend estuaries and therefore unavailable to us the frigates and sloops you will find anywhere from selsey in the channel all the way up the east coast to scotland and of those to stand directly against bonapartes invasion we are disposed in two divisions one to defend the channel coast of england the other before the french coast of the latter we are again of two forces the first those sloops and cutters in constant warfare against the enemy flotillas the other in the form of two more powerful flying squadrons based here at a moments notice to sail your orders which i have attach you to the one commanded by myself both squadrons have the same vital imperative to harass the invasion craft by any means clamping a hold on the harbours up and down the enemy coast to prevent their leaving and concentrating in overwhelming numbers at the main invasion ports i have to remind you that there is a deeper duty mr kydd which is to immediately apprise the commanderinchief of any intelligence that bears on the deployment and motions of the invasion fleets aye aye sir and especially should they sail on their enterprise neither ship nor man should be spared in the need to raise the alarm may i know sir whats t be our action here consequent on receiving this the first intelligence of an invasion fleet at sea is to be conveyed to deal there the shutter telegraph will have the news to the admiralty in ten minutes at the same time we have general craigs flags these are a chain of posts on church steeples and similar that constantly fly a white flag receiving word of an invasion they will be replaced by a red which will be the signal to loose the messengers picked men whose duty it is to set forth on horseback fly inland and raise the alarm at night we shall have beacons of furze faggots on hilltops as will instantly call the volunteers to arms and set in motion the evacuation plansbut the details of that we can leave to the military sir to return to our own operations youre to maintain at all times sea and ordnance stores conformable to a twohour notice to sail and when at alert a watch of the hands closed up at stations for unmooring yourself and principal officers on board at alert sir wind and tide favourable for a sortie an intelligence that bonaparte is contemplating a descent the signal tower hangs out a red warning pennant with a gunyoull see all this in the orders i understand sir to the squadron instructions youll observe that theres little enough on manoeuvres and signals this is because when we shall be called upon for service it will of a surety be a pellmell action as will not be of a character to allow the forming of line and so forth savery spoke calmly but there was no mistaking the icy determination as well of course we are all of different sailing qualities and in this i will be clear at an alarm the duty of every captain is to crowd on sail as best he might to close with the enemy not an instants delay how this is achieved is of secondary consideration sir we are all of one band and must rely on each otherin this you will see each must trust the other in the prime cause no signals no permissions no hesitation lay yourself alongside an enemy and you will have fulfilled your duty sir it was a level of trust in a commander that kydd had never encountered before to rely implicitly on a subordinates tactical judgement seamanship and brute courage without issuing a direct order this was what it was to be a sea officer of such a supremely professional navy aye aye sir kydd responded you may rely on teazer and her company very well do complete your stores and as of noon tomorrow consider yourself under orders er and it would be my pleasure to see you at our little gathering in the three kings at seven tonight youll find some of the other captains of the flying squadron there and theyll be pleased to meet you in the early afternoon kydd went ashore with the purser and renzi he wanted to inspect the capability of the kings naval yard in deal and also to see something of the town he had read the orders keiths were straightforward and to the point with no duty explicit other than the defence of the realm in so far as it meant harrying the enemy by every means possible the usual commanderinchiefs fighting instructions were almost nonexistent confirming saverys earlier comments that a grand fleet action was not likelyfor the moment saverys orders too were sparse emphasising individual initiative and deprecating caution but with the proviso that the preservation of his ship was a central concern for every captain throw himself at the enemy or hold back it would be kydds decision kydd realised that keiths constant fear would be that his forces would be so whittled down by taking the war to the enemy shore that at a sudden invasion breakout they would prove of insufficient numbers it was a warm sunny afternoon and with the breezy northwesterly a foul wind on the french coast there was little likelihood of an alert kydd walked quietly with the other two to the kings naval yard letting the character of the place seep in deal was a curious place a town at a seemingly random position along a lengthy stretch of flat shoreline nestled right up to a shingle beach it was said to be one of the biggest ports in englandyet it had no harbour but there were reasons for its existence there the lethal goodwin sands offshore were also a barrier to channel storms and the ships that gathered in its embrace waiting for a fair wind needed provisions stores and chandlery passengers favoured boarding their ships at deal thereby avoiding the tedious river trip to london with naval forces to support in addition the town was lively and prosperous the kings naval yard at one end of the waterfront was impressive with sawpits smiths shops sail lofts and the like a ship could be victualled for an entire ocean voyage from the brewhouses compendious storehouses and the bakery producing vast quantities of ships biscuits yet without a harbourno quays jetties or wharfstons of stores masts and yards weighty lengths of newspun cordage all had to be taken out to the ships in boats this meant that the heavy craft must be manhandled down to the water over the steep shingle loaded and after delivery heaved back up again at the yard there were eight slipways oaken balks settled well in with a massive capstan at the top of each kydd watched as a threeton frigate launch was hauled up for repair even with thirty men at the capstan and others steadying the boat it was a hard grind their business concluded the teazers returned to their ship kydd knew he had paperwork to deal with but felt restless he went to the shrouds and gazed out across the sparkling sea to the hard clean line of the horizon where the distant sombre headlands of france were stark and clear there was now no doubt the gathering storm that was about to break on england could be stopped by only one agency the royal navy teazer was at the cutting edge the furthest forward she could be on the field of battle and kydd was her captain ah mr kydd come meet this merry band of mariners savery said heartily stepping back from the fireplace a halfdozen officers looked at him inquisitively commander kydd is newjoined in teazer brigsloop from the channel islands he boomed claims he wanted a more interesting station there were murmurs of welcome and a shuffling to allow him a sight of the fire this is commander dyer of falcon shipsloop a cautiouslooking older officer nodded and ltenant keane locust gunbrig the cheerful redfaced young man winked at him playfully ltenant mills out of bruiser gunbrig the big man grunted defensively service oh north american station t begin with kydd said amiably there would apparently be no standing on ceremony in this company the med he added and the nile he finished lightly there was a general stir doubt we can find anything to top that mr kydd said keane respectfully im not so sure mills said forcefully boneys down on em hard if they dont put on a brave show defendin afore their own soldiers on the shore why in that mill we has last month off calais the talk ebbed and flowed the three kings like so much of deal was on the edge of the waterfront its entrance set at right angles for shelter the naval officers favoured rooms to seaward that looked out over the downs and in the strengthening northwesterly the windows shook and rattled savery glanced out to sea at the miles of bobbing ships and white caps then suggested cards gentlemen no alarums to be expected in this blow there was a general move to the table i do hope the claret is agreeable to your taste mr kydd he said as the cards were cut for our friday gathering we make it a point that the enemy provides for our wine out of a prize of course kydd did not shine at cards his heart was not in it his memory refused to take note of which had been successively dealt and he was regularly trumped in this company however it was no chore and gave him an insight into the personalities of those with whom he would go to war savery was cool precise and deadly clearly enjoying the exercise keane was impulsive but ingenious while mills was stolid but infinitely patient marshalling his assets until he could bang down his winning hand with a colourful oath it was an experience more pleasurable than he had expected there was relief to be had from sharing anxieties and fears with those who were in the same position as him and took strength from the sense of brotherliness in adversity of fellow warriors awaiting the dawn the following morning the wind still held to a northwesterly but had moderated somewhat there was no alert at the semaphore tower and kydd held court with hallum and purchet over how best to bring the ship to a knife edge of readiness it was the ageold problem in war men raised to a nervous pitch of skill and expectations then forced to idleness while waiting for the enemys next move traditional makework employment in harbour centred around cleaning and brightwork but nothing could be more calculated to dull the spirit more warlike tasks such as attending to the gunners store had long since been completed to perfection with a fine edge on every cutlass pistols and muskets flinted and tested shot brought to an impressive roundness by careful chipping with a rusthammer there was little more that kydd could think of to do poulden knocked tentatively at the door not sure as what t do with thisn he said holding out a paper mr calloway says yed be interested kydd read it and chuckled why this is just the medicine for the harbour mullygrubs gentlemen your attention please lieutenant keane and hm gunbrig locust were issuing a challengeatarms to hms teazer for the honour of hoisting a cock of the downs for the better ship locust lay a quarter of a mile to the eastward moored like teazer head to wind keane was proposing a contest of boardingthe very proficiency that would be so needed in the near future kydd read aloud the challenge it was to be undertaken from an eightoared pinnace the only boat held in common by both sides the object being to haul down the others colours in the face of various unspecified discouragements then return there were some interesting provisos boarders were to be fully armed and might not enter at any point between the quarterdeck and focsle the winners would be the first to return to their own ship and triumphantly rehoist their own colours to the masthead and to prevent later recrimination the respective captains would lead the boarders an impudence spluttered hallum they cant just but kydd had made up his mind and turned to poulden mr calloway is t hoist locusts pennant over the affirmative if y please he said firmly it was well conceived distance to cover under oars was equal as were the number of men carried in the boats bearing arms and coming aboard only over the bow or stern meant a boarding under realistic conditions and discouragements would add the necessary incentive to haste recalling keanes confidence kydd grinned he would be leading the teazers and it was fairly certain that the young officer had not heard of his own years as a young and agile seaman with boats in the water in deference to locusts lack of the newfangled davits it needed only the signal to start actaeons gig arrived and savery suitably grave as befitted an official umpire proceeded to an inspection of teazers boarders a fine body of men captain he pronounced they were not the words kydd would have used of his crew of desperadoes in every kind of piratical rig clutching their wooden cutlasses and grinning at each other in anticipation into your boats kydd settled at the tiller and tried not to beam back at stirk gunners mate and a seaman who went back to his earliest time at sea ready with his grapnel in the bows he snapped toss oars in obedience to the rules oars were thumped down and held vertically as a sign that the boarders were standing by savery sighted over at locust their boat was in similar readiness fire a swivel gun manned up in the maintop cracked out but the sound was almost drowned in the storm of cheering from the spectators kydds urgent roar sent oars thudding down between the thole pins and the boat slewing round to leap ahead straight as an arrow for the trim gunbrig the locusts were in view almost at once her captain crouched urging on his crew like a lunatic and coming on at a dismaying rate it was not kydds way to shout at men doing their best but he quickly found himself leaning forward and berating them as lubbardly old women and a hopeless parcel of gibfaced mumpers the resulting expressions of delight seemed to indicate it might have been expected as the pinnaces passed each other halfway yells of derision were hurled across keane stood precariously and bowed solemnly to kydd who couldnt think what to do other than doff his hat in reply then it was the final stretch the seamen panting and gasping with the brutal effort defenders were spaced evenly along the decks of locust and doing suspicious things with sacks like teazer the gunbrig was flushdecked with a continuous deckline her focsle was rounded and therefore without the usual beakhead with its useful climbingaboard points it had been agreed that boarding nettings would not be deployed as inviting damage to his majestys sea stores so it was a choice between bluff bow or sturdy transom kydd made up his mind and went for the stern instantly there was a frantic rush along the decks of the brig to take up position to repel boarders he snatched a glance behind the locusts were heading at breakneck speed directly for teazers bows and there was the same mad scramble forward to meet the boarding he smiled wickedlyit would be a valiant crew who made it to that hostile deck just a few hundred yards away from their goal he weighed up the angles and distances with locusts protruding rudder stock a sideto approach allowing simultaneous exit from the boat would not be possible better a headon one with stirk leading the charge up and over that plain sternwork they neared and he spotted defenders hunkered behind the low bulwark just before they made ready kydd twisted to look behind at the last minute keane had put over the tiller shooting under the bowsprit and at full tilt sped down the length of the ship to end up under teazers more ornate stern grapnels flew up in a perfectly timed sir pouldens anxious cry brought him backlocusts humble stern with its two small windows was looming above them but before he could act the boat drove head on into her timbers with a rending thump sending the oarsmen down in a tangle of legs and bodies go kydd cried hoarsely from the bottomboards but stirk had already hurled his grapnel and swarmed up the line with a roar he took the contents of a pail of galley slops full in the face then bilgewater flour slush and the like rained down stirk let out a howl but quickly recovered and fought his way slowly up through the deluge the teazers were now spurred on with the prospect of revenge and as stirk disappeared over the bulwarks he was followed by the rest with kydd fighting through the vile onslaught to join him on the neat little after deck the locusts were waiting with their wooden cutlasses at point except one sailor who was taken helpless with laughter at the sight of the enemy it was too much for stirk who threw himself at the man and with a show of strength wrestled him to the side and upended him bodily into the sea the decks resounded to fierce snarls and the sharp clikclok of wooden combat but the teazers blood was up and it didnt take long to fight through to the mainmast halliards guarded by a ring of vengeful seamen kydd rapidly hauled down their colours returning to the boat some jumped headlong into the early summer sea to rid themselves of their ordure then hauled themselves dripping over the gunwale move yselves kydd urged taking the tiller again they stretched out manfully the contest would not be over until their own colours had been restored the locusts however were already twothirds back well on their way to victory when the locusts drew abreast kydds boat to pass more taunts were thrown keane stood up in the boat and bowed low it was galling to be treated this way againkydd spotted a locust flourbomb among the mess in the bilge and as keane straightened his posture he received it full on the chest it burst with a satisfying white explosion and the young man teetered and fell bringing down his stroke oar and causing the next man to catch a crab then lose his oar the boat came to a stop in hopeless confusion while the teazers savagely saw their chance and threw themselves at their oars it was sweet victory captain savery shook his head at the sight of the seamen who heaved themselves aboard but allowed the teazers triumphantly to haul their colours aloft once more a crestfallen keane was summoned back to witness the award to the victor sirsir i yes mr keane it wasnt fair kydd couldnt help it fortunes of war old trout he rumbled smugly savery held up the trophy a handsome redpainted mast vane in the shape of a cockerel cock o the downs and this i award to the rightful winner with the strict injunction in hoc signis vincit under this sign go ye forth and conquer murmured renzi next to kydd with a satisfied smile kydd stepped forward to accept the prize not you sir savery said in mock horror snatching away the vane the locusts are declared victors this day come forward and be honoured mr keane the locusts sir kydd spluttered i dont understandwe were mr kydd i have above a hundred witnesses who will swear they saw you resume hostilities on your opponent even while your colours were struck this is not to be borne sir yet i dare to say you will be seeking a rencontre at another date the northwesterly eased and veered overnight leaving a fine summer morning to spread its beneficence abroad but at eleven as the wind passed into its easterly quadrant there was the thump of a gun and the red flag of the alert was hoisted the wind was favourable for the french a hurried muster revealed the absence of the gunner and his mate at the kings naval yard and a victualling party at the storehouse both midshipmen were dispatched with trusties to find them posthaste and teazer moved to sea watches before noon her complement was entire and the ship ready for sea lying to a readybuoyed single anchor sails bent on to yards her broadsides primed and waiting kydds eyes turned to actaeon the first sign of an alarm might be the sudden blossoming of a signal at the halliards and a warning gun then the flying squadron would be streaming instantly to sea but the day wore on was this to be their entire existence to lie waiting at a split yarn it could be days weeks before the french made their move to sea at sunset the men were piped to supper at least here they would eat well fresh greens and regular meat from the garden county of kent and renzi was clearly content with his lot little ships business to do and a stand of books to devour that would not disgrace a bookseller kydd vowed to find fresh ways to keep the men occupied and in fighting trim but for now he turned in early and drifted into sleep sir mr kydd sir called an anxious moyes as mateofthewatch he was confronted with the old naval dilemma he had been sent to wake an officer but if he shook him this might in theory be construed as laying hands on a superior with all the dire penalties that the act entailed kydd propped himself up in his cot and rubbed his eyes moyes was streaming water from his oilskins it must be dirty weather topside although the ships gentle motion did not indicate a blow what oclock is it middle watch sir an actaeon is hanging out three lights with a gun all captains ill be up directly rouse up a boats crew and have the gig in the water immediately aye aye sir moyes disappeared considerately leaving his lanthorn and kydd thudded to the deck shaking his head to clear it of sleep cast off he growled after they had entered the boat he had only a seacoat over his nightdress and maddeningly the light rain trickling off his hat found several ways to penetrate to his sleepwarm body but he knew there could only be one reason for the urgent summons the boat hooked on and he heaved himself up the rainslick side of the frigate noting bustle through the open gunports the ship was fully awake savery lost no time when all were assembled he snapped an alarm gentlemen sir sidney smith has sent urgent word of an invasion flotilla slipping out from ostend taking advantage of this noreasterly and thinking to join with others in calais and boulogne it must be stopped there were grave expressions on the faces of those who stood about wet and drooping and in all manner of strange night attire this is no small force it numbers over sixty craft and being a joint dutch force is defended by the jonkheer ver blaeu who i might remind you learned his trade under de winter at camperdown kydd would never forget the ferocious scenes of combat that daythe british had been victorious but the dutch had fought like demons showing the old spirit that had seen them lay waste in the medway the century before they are even now at sea proceeding down the coast towards dunkirk ambleteusewho knows it seems to be an attempt to overwhelm us with numbers and i expect a stiff fight there will be no help from sir sidney as he is heavily engaged but he offers to break off and come to our aid if requested his demeanour gave little doubt as to the likelihood of this have we reports of the type of vessel were likely to find sir said keane brightly at least thirty forty gunvesselsanything from your chaloupe canonnière to a fullrigged prame to be expected i believe your duty is the same in any case now to business the squadron will sail without delay with the goal of an intercept off the french coast at dawn we sail in darkness dyer said in a tone of disbelief the goodwins are in these winds we cannot sail north or hazard the gull passage therefore we shall go southabout to make our offing i would have thought it reasonable to stand in that direction for the lights of st margarets bay and thence haul your wind for france savery said irritably kydds mind raced if there were clear night waters rather than some eighty or so ships at anchor through which they must pass if the few lights of deal showing at three in the morning were as well loyally shining at the small hamlet in the great cliffs i shall expect the squadron to make rendezvous to the noreast of dunkirk in the morning savery continued come come gentlemen theres not a moment to lose the other business was dispatched rapidly and kydd returned to find his ship in a scurry of activity teazer slipped her anchor within the hour the night breeze taking her at some speed through a world of dimly bobbing lights in the pitch darkness with the occasional bulking mass looming of an unlighted vessel it was vital not to put the helm over for the reach to seaward too early for this would bring them to an unpleasant acquaintance with the deadly sands if left too long though it would take more time to beat back up the french coast and every seaman knew that the slower and more cautious the progress the more sluggish would be the response at the helm less than an hour passed but it seemed like a lifetime before kydd felt able to make the move teazer heeled as she took the wind abeam and struck out into the channel darkness it would be entirely by deadreckoning a larboard tack for long enough to get them past midchannel then a stay about to starboard to put them to weather of the rendezvous when dawn broke logline careful sail trim and much discussion of current sets and leeway at different points of sailing seamanship of the first order was demanded they were comfortably to seaward of dunkirk when the first tentative shafts of light from the east promised a fine day to come one by one sail was sighted and by full day the squadron was in position actaeon with the sloops teazer bruiser falcon and gallant with the gunbrigs locust starling plumper and others it seemed a pitiful number to throw before such odds they stayed in deep water with the frigate then a cutter came racing downwind with enemy in sight fluttering urgently from her halliards in the morning breeze from directly in the winds eye a handful of low sails appeared out of the haze more and more came into sight then still more until it seemed impossible there was room for others kydd was conscious of what the chart had shown about the coastendless hard sandbanks strung out to parallel the shore as if to ward off marauders a fearsome threat to any trespasser there was no point in beating towards it would be better to let them come then fall on them somewhere off dunkirk he raised his telescope and scanned the oncoming armada every kind of rig was there luggers of all descriptions brigs even fully shiprigged vessels advancing inexorably in a vast swarm of sail then he saw the invasion craft he had been told about the long and low péniche under a single lugsail the swedish designed shallowdraught crache feu type that carried frigatesized twentyfourpounders on slides and the various chaloupes canonnières which while smaller than teazer were armed with guns of much larger calibre the transports were gathered in the centre seemingly anything that swam including many of the dutch schuyts used in the rivers and shallows of the netherlands and ideal for close inshore work he wondered what the soldiers packing their decks would think of the ships lying in wait for them they would know them to be the same ships that had cleared the seas of every french battlefleet sent against them that had destroyed and captured their ships as they watched impotently from the beach but now seeing the crowds of french and dutch vessels around them and so few english ones ahead there could only be one answer contempt and the conviction that in the face of such numbers the english ships would just step aside there was no indication of faltering among the leaders of the armada as teazer neared the throng seemed to take on an order of its own the larger ships assuming seaward positions to shepherd along the lesser which were sailing as close to the shore as they could kydd swallowed now was the time to manoeuvre round and select where he would direct his charge into the enemy at this angle of the wind it would have to be somewhere off dunkirkbut would they simply slip away into the port and wait it out the first of the vessels was approaching the port entrance if he did not make his lunge now it might be too late along the decks long closed up for action his ships company looked gravely at him mr kydd sir dowse said quietly interrupting his thoughts umyes sir its my opinion th tides not going t allow us in without we know th ground better the frenchy thinks it safe enough aye sir the master said patiently hes in a mort deeper waterthe passe de lest as goes past th entrance atween us an them will be yr banc du snouw binnen ratel all shiftin hardpack sand as at this tidestate is shoaling fast was this why the others in the squadron were still hove to waiting the first enemy vessels reached the harbours cramped entrance and passed it the wily dutchman in command had known of the inshore passage and taken full advantage of the winds direction being the same as the ebbing tide in the protection of the offshore sandbanks he was making fast sailing towards his ultimate destination calais and boulogne now there was a chance once past they had to leave the protection of the sandbanks which did not extend any further and the little haven of gravelines on the way was near useless on an ebbing tide so somewhere off the low endless sand dunes between dunkirk and calais action must be joined the sun was high and warm to the skin when the time came careful bearings of the tall foursquare tower in the centre of the town told kydd and the other members of the squadron when the armada was finally clear of the protecting shoals first away was locust her red cockerel brazenly at the mainmast head with bruiser and falcon close behind then teazer joining the rush in an exhilarating charge straight into the heart of the enemy kydd willed his mind to icy coolness the swarm resolved to individuals the schuyts or the prame the first guns opened up but teazer would hold her fire to make every shot count the enemy sloops came round to meet them but surprisingly showed no inclination to close kydd looked back actaeon was asternthe biggest threat she must be their target he grinned savagely all the better to allow teazer to get among the flotilla locust disappeared in a haze of gunsmoke into the very centre and kydd made up his mind we take the schuyts and draw the big uns towards us lets the cutters and gunbrigs have a chance teazer made for a gaggle of four ahead white splashes kicked up around her it was smallcalibre the bigger guns they carried must be on crude slides and could not bear on them then a vicious whip of bullets all around him showed that they were making up for it with musketry kydd tested the wind once morefair and brisk on the larboard beam bring us astern o the last he ordered calmly the schuyts maintained course unsure of his intentions and he was quickly able to reach his position swinging round before the wind he tucked in astern of the last then surged forward to overtake the craft on its shoreward side fire he barked the forward half of the starboard guns smashed into it screams and hoarse shouts came from beyond the choking mass of powdersmoke and then they were up with the second and the after half of the guns opened up the next in line jibbed in fear at what was bearing down on it teazer s helm went over and she plunged between the opening gap to the seaward side and with a furious spin of the wheel straightened and passed the next schuyt the same trick againbut this time it was the unused guns of the larboard side that did the execution taking the next with the forward guns and the last of the four with the rest beside kydd purchet pounded his fist into his palm then in the hellish noise hallum snatched at kydds sleeve and pointed looming out of the roiling smoke and appallingly close a powerful prame as big as a frigate was lunging towards them as teazer passed beyond the schuyts the prame slewed about parallel to bring its full broadside of twentyfourpounders to bearat near pointblank range it would be slaughter and with teazers guns not yet reloaded they could not fire back kydd agonised as he waited for the eruptionhis skin crawled as the moment hungthen suddenly he swung round to look in the other direction as he suspected a lumbering transport was to leeward the prame dared not open up on teazer while it was in the line of fire lightheaded with relief kydd tried to think of a way out they couldnt stay with the transport for ever it was hard to concentrate as a chaotic swirl of noise and smoke battered in on his senses but the matter was shortly taken out of his hands with an avalanche of muffled thuds and a sudden rearing of gunsmoke on the other side of the prame the shipsloop falcon had taken her chance to attack while its attention was on teazer the prame wheeled about on its tormentor and teazer pulled into the clouds of powdersmoke rolling downwind from the two suddenly with a hideous splintering crash they were careering along the side of a shiptimbers smashing to wreckage sails snatched and torn away ropes parting with a vicious twang in a long agony of collision they stopped two ships locked together in a hideous tangle and for a moment a shocked quiet descended its a frenchy someone screamed and broke the spell kydd fought to keep cool this was an enemy and it was bigger than teazer teazers t board he yelled t me the boarders he whipped out his precious fighting sword and leaped on to the enemy deck where teazers bulwarks had been beaten flat the french gun crews gaped at him caught offbalance and dazed by the sudden turn of events the first to recover was a darkfeatured officer with a red sash who snarled in anger and rushed at him swinging a massive sword kydd dropped to one knee with his own blade above his head the weapons met in a clash the shock numbing his arm but his fine toledo steel held and deflected the blow to one side he let the stroke spend itself and with a dextrous twist got inside it and thrust out savagely taking the man in the lower body with a howl of anguish he dropped his sword and clutched at the skewering blade then crumpled knocking kydd sprawling and tearing it from his grasp the teazer gun crews had snatched up rammers tomahawks anything to hand and were racing toward the unarmed kydd with an urgent thump on the deck renzi arrived first taking position over kydd with a boarding pike outthrust its lethal point questing for the first to dare an assault the teazers soon had their bridgehead the disorganised gun crews saw no chance against fully equipped boarders and skidded to a stop the rush turned to a rout more teazers arrived and the ship was theirs trembling with reaction to the neardisaster kydd sent parties to secure the vessel and looked about the battlefield the action had moved away from them the flotilla was doggedly pressing on towards calais and the english firing wildly were staying with them he looked across at teazer the wreckage seemed confined to the bulwarks and foreshroud channels but there was a trail of dismounted guns and at more than one spot the dark staining of blood on the decking purchet loped up and reported spars still sound sir but th standin rigging t larbd is in a sad moil get us free quick as y like mr purchet stoppers and doubling anything asll see us under canvas again he looked out at the broader battle scene actaeon was beset by four large sloops and nearly hidden by towering clouds of powdersmoke but gunflashes regularly stabbed through from her and as kydd watched a mast on one of the sloops descended and the damaged vessel fell away the enemy did not seem inclined to pay attention to the two vessels locked together so they had a chance the royal marines took charge of prisoners while the entire seaman complement of teazer swarmed over the rigging aloft passing stoppers that joined the severed ends of ropes and adding relieving tackles to weakened sections when it was complete kydd sent hallum to limp back in the prize while he considered the state of teazer at a pinch they could keep to the wind particularly running large as the flotilla was doing but effectively they had lost all except one of the larboard guns and were open to the weather and smallarms fire along that side and they had numbers away as prizecrew kydd watched the receding battle he had been shaken by the savagery of the fighting the desperate flinging of their force into the midst of the armada and the french were far from running they were staying together to brute it through and add this huge number of invasion craft to their concentrations there was no alternative but to do his duty with kydd warily keeping an eye on the makeshift repairs aloft teazer set out after them but well before they were able to overhaul the rear the enemy entered calais roads and the unassailable shelter of the fortress batteries regrouping beyond the treacherous offshore ground of the ridens de la rade the flying squadron hove to it seemed that the francobatavian flotilla had indeed won precious miles from dunkirk towards their eventual destination boulogne and all the squadron could now do was to leave a pair of watching cutters and return to the downs yet within the hour there was movement incredibly the flotilla was putting out once more it was no feint the canny dutch commander had merely added to their number by drawing in those who had sheltered in the port earlier now nearly a hundred sail were issuing out steadily heading southwest it was an audacious and cynical move they had no doubt reasoned that while the english were occupied in their butchery of the unfortunates there would be left many more to plough on regardless and make their destination the simple outworking of time and numbers would ensure that by far the majority survived it was still before noon when heavy guns thundered out from the great citadel and no less than five forts falling back but warily pacing with them out to seaward the squadron waited until the strungout flotilla was clear of the port and its defences then one by one selected a victim and once more sailed in to close with the enemy teazer was no longer in the best shape for another deadly action but the stakes were extreme therefore with torn sails and trailing ropes she set her bowsprit resolutely at the foethree of the flatbottomed bateaux canonnières equipped with a stern ramp to take on even field guns and horses these were therefore of prime value to bonaparte and worth any sacrifice at this point with fewer sandbanks the immense sea cavalcade huddled close inshore it seemed incongruous to join battle before the mussel beds and lowly dunes and with no larboard guns teazer must work some miracle to come inside them to fight but as she made her approach guns opened upguns that had no right to be there shot tore up the sea all around and two heavy thumps told of hitsbut from where through his telescope kydd saw troops of horse artillery cantering up unlimbering their field guns on the crest of the dunes and blazing away it was an intelligent use of the immense military machine being assembled but it would only serve while they were close in with the land beyond the range of the fortress on the heights of cap blanc nez there were devilish offshore hazards which the french called the barrier that would force the armada miles out to sea the guns ashore fell silent as the range widened and the predators closed in it was close vicious and bloody workthe invasion flotilla must be stopped and nothing would be spared the first bateau dug in its steering oar and slewed around at teazera field artillery piece was tied down with ropes on its clumsy foredeck but when it fired the ball reduced teazers quarterdeck rail to flying splinters and ended the life of the lively and willing philipon an able seaman who had been with them since the channel islands it was an heroic act by the frenchman for they could not reload the piece they must wait while teazer stood off and destroyed themexcept that her own guns on that side were useless the two vessels faced each other defiantly but impotently until kydd took his ship under the stern of the other and crushed the little craft with a single broadside the next bateau sheered away cravenly inshore taking the ground a full mile out in a shuddering stop the shock canting the long vessels bow skyward tumbling over the side in a panicstricken flight the crew stumbled away a chaloupe appeared from the smoke her eighteenpounders opening on teazer as soon as she appeared the shots went wild and it disappeared as quickly as did the bateau they had been ready to engage the din and acrid reek of powdersmoke drove in on kydd where was the next target for a short time he could see locust hammering away frantically at two chaloupes assaulting her but there was nothing kydd could do for them and smoke drifted across to hide the scene an unknown vessel lay stopped ahead only a single mast left standing men swarmed over the wreckage like antswas it bruiser they had to take their chances for kydds duty was to engage the flotilla and there inshore was another bateau canonnièrebut beyond lay the dour heights of cap gris nez as if to mark the invisible boundary that had been crossed a plume of water shot upand another and more as the ball skipped towards them it was from the heavy guns on the dark heights of the iconic headland and the mass of sails quickly converged on its deepwater flanksit was now all but over held off by the formidable ring of iron the flying squadron stayed out of range but kept with the armada as it rounded the cape and with the last of the tide passed into the safety of the harbours of ambleteuse and wimereux their goal of boulogne just six miles further on it was not yet noon on a beautiful earlysummers day from first to last the action had taken just a few hours but now it was time to leave chapter the summer sun was high in the sky when hms teazer made her way home with the others to find her anchor buoy and pick up her moorings once again it was still warm and beneficent when kydd returned to his ship after an immediate conference aboard actaeon teazer was to be stood down from the flying squadron due to battledamagemuch of her larboard bulwarks beaten flat and guns dismountedand it would be several weeks before she could look to active service again kydd felt the need to stay on deck in the brightness of the day with the pleasant sight of the town and its bustle the constant toandfroing of scores of ships about their occasionsreality normality but a captain could not idly pace among the men as they worked reluctantly he went to his cabin and found renzi at the table scratching away at papers the interminable loose ends after any scene of combat a hot action he said looking up yes kydd muttered slumping into his chair only that morning his ship had been plunged into a desperate fight for survival and here she was an hour or two later battered and sore but lying to single anchor in sunkissed tranquillity seeing kydds drawn face renzi laid down his pen kydd went on sombrely as it was necessary m friend the sheer savagery of the encounter and the seemingly unstoppable determination of the vessels assembled for their grand enterprise had unnerved him he had also found himself quite affected by the death of young philipon a gay laughing soul now removed from the world of men and by the sight of locusts pinnace on its way past them to land the pitiful figure of her captain writhing under a blanket and mortally wounded later no doubt others from the naval hospital would be making their last journey on earth to the austere st georges church in deal these are times to try mens soulsbut he that stands it now deserves the love and thanks of men and women renzi murmured what said kydd distracted oh naught but the rantings of an unfashionable rogue of fevered times now past kydd sighed who is your philosopher then renzi his name you may have heard it tom paine kydd allowed a twisted smile he had borne the name of the revolutionary since birth his parents having once heard the great man speak and been caught up in the fiery rhetoric so the villain can conjure some right words im to say he sighed heavily but its hard t take after as grim a fight as ever weve been in whatve we won naught but a handful o boneys flotilla they say that with this last hes now above one thousand craft near boulogne so many vessels with but one purposeand he had seen for himself how powerless they had been against mere scores mr hallum ive a yen to step ashore the ship is yours kydd picked up his walking cane and clapped on his tall yellow beaver renzi was delayed with ships business and anyway he felt the need to walk alone to let the calm tranquillity of the land work on his soul with a lazy surf hissing in the shingle he was carried ashore safe and dry by his boats crew to the left was the kings naval yard with its admiralty telegraph to london even now clattering away and the smoky fumes of the smithy spiralling up behind the high wall to the right a long street faced the beach the inns and taverns giving way to substantial buildings further on and the bright hazy prospect of pegwell bay in the distance kydd struck out briskly nodding to passing gentlemen and doffing his hat politely to promenading ladies no doubt passengers from the indiaman anchored offshore he turned inland towards the town proper entering middle street here there were courts and passageways with cobbled streets and rich merchants houses he strolled on to high street with its bustling shops and markets and his eyes caught a placard in one window and our brave sons invite the foe to come for they remember acres valiant fight when britons put the vaunting gaul to flight remembering too niles battle he had been at both and felt a stab of pride then he noticed a recruiting poster brave soldiersdefenders ofyour country the road to glory is open before youpursue the great career of your forefathers and rival them in the field of honour a proud and usurpingtyrant a name ever execrated by englishmen dares to threaten our shores with invasion and to reduce the freeborn sons of britain to slavery the briton fights for his liberty and rights the frenchman for buonaparte who has robbed him of both there was a hard gaiety on the air women sported martial cockades and children strutted about every gentleman wore his sword the markets were thronged and the street cries as lusty as ever suggested that none in this town was about to be affected by the awful forces gathering just a few leagues across the water the cheerful hustle lifted his spirits restored he threw a coin to a begging child and returned to the seafront the view from the shore was impressive the crowding ships in the downs and just visible on the horizon a sablebrown line that was the goodwin sands reluctant to quit his view of the sea he strolled along in the warm sunshine and pondered the peculiar difference to be had in perspectives of it from the rockstill shore the landbound saw the line of white waves acting as a boundary between the two worlds and beyond the seas mystery with ships disappearing so quickly from mans ken over the horizon to far and unknowable regions a sailors prospect however was of being borne along on a constantly moving live quintessence without limit the land an occasional encounter in the endless oceanic immensity his steps took him past the kings naval yard and on to deal castle part of a coastal chain put in place by henry viii under much the same invasion threat the battlements were small round and squat they were from an era when cannon had been changing the rules of war but even today they were manned by redcoats and ready for service at the top of the shingle scores of deal luggers were drawn up before humble cottages and huts each of which had a capstan to the front with men working on them or just sitting in the sun with a comfortable pipe and baccy kydd wandered up every tiny seaplace on englands coasts had its own peculiarities and he was curious to see how the unusual steep shingle landings had influenced the boats construction they were all substantial craft few less than forty feet long and fifteen broad longyarded with a squareheaded dipping lug sail and handy mizzen and remarkably highwaisted most had an iron skeg with an eye at the turn of the forefoot to assist in hauling up and all were brightsided the varnish work on them as winsome as a newfallen horse chestnut eyes turned suspiciously on kydd as he crunched through the shingle to take in the bluff lines of one the kentish maid he bent double to catch the rise of bilge as he suspected the high gunwale was matched by a broad flat bottom ideally suited to coming ashore on a steep beach in anything of a sea he peeped over the gunwale it was simply equipped with a small shelter forepeak it was easy to sense great strength the boat stank richly of its sea gear caressing the sturdy sides in admiration he was startled when a shrill voice challenged him oi th young man yonder i seen yewhat are y doing wi that boat a wizened but brighteyed old man sitting on a pair of shipwreck timbers shook a knobby stick at him kydd chuckled and went over to him why sir im taking m pleasure in the sight of as fine a barky as ever ive seen elmbuilt is she the man squinted at him then who are ye then m name is thomas kydd may i know ticklewilliam ticklean ye hasnt said as why yere so taken wi th maid kydd had passed an ancient taphouse on the way sir if youd tell me more o these id be honoured t stand you a

gift o the sea free tradin like smuggling er tell me of your foying mr tickle aye well its naught but plyin for trade wi the merchant jacks out in th roads as wants fresh wegetables dry provisions y

portstrinity lot gives best t us any which wants t try th goodwins in a fog hovellingcant say as ive heard of it afore kydd said then i guess ye havent been t sea much where ye from um guildford mr tickle the hovelling it turned out to be as colourful and dangerous a sea trade as any he had heard of in his years of voyaging thoroughly at home around the treacherous goodwins on fineweather days the hovellers would hoist their distinctive bloodred sails and occupy themselves sweeping the seabed close to the great banks for anchors and ground tackle lost in storms they would sweat to recover them by art and sea craft and either bring them aboard or sling them beneath and return storing them in an anchor field close to the kings naval yard on foulweather days they would keep close watch on the edge of the goodwins for signs that a ship was dragging her anchors or had lost one and was nervously eyeing the remainder a stout deal lugger would then be launched into the violence to take out a complete anchor weighing tons along with heavy coils of cable and offer it to the anxious captain for a handsome fee it was seldom refused that explained the highsided construction and generous scantlings of these hardy boats kydd could only imagine the fearful effort required to set the boats to sea with such a load why thank ee mr tickle he said happily back to his old self youve quite explained it all for me im much obliged he doffed his hat politely and required the old seaman to accept a small contribution in token of the time he had spent how goes it mr purchet kydd asked looking doubtfully at the cluttered larboard deck the kings naval yard had done well to have five shipwrights and their sidesmen out to them within two days and their clunking and chipping had sounded ever since throughout the daylight hours main fine sir it seemed that their primary concern the slide on which the carronades recoiled was simple enough to repair the design being nothing more than a sliding bed on a longer one and secured by a thick pin the quarterman shipwright was therefore sanguine that teazers armament would be whole again within the week the bulwarks were another matter seasoned timber of such length apparently not in ready supply and kydd promised to take better care of his command in the future and in the meantime offered an earnest by which it would appear the timbers would be more expeditiously acquired it would be a frustrating wait but in deal rooms were to be had for sea officers at the genteel end of middle street and kydd established a presence ashore where renzis valuable work on his treatise could be kept in a place of safety yes mr hallum kydd said about to step ashore one morning im truly sorry to have to report that a midshipman has not returned from leave calloway in the navy since childhood and as loyal as it was possible to be or could it be their firstvoyage new reefer tawse unable to face another bloody action who is it calloway sir hes to wait on me the instant he returns on board kydd swore under his breath there was no possibility of going ashore until this had been resolved and when calloway did return an hour later his captain was is no mood for trifling the young man stood before him palefaced but defiant im sorry mr kydd its i overslept is all slewed t the gills no doubt i werent mr kydd then pray tell what tavernkeeper fails t shake his customers in the morning as will have em back on board in time or was it i wasthat is theres this girl i was with and and sally an i well kydd waited mr kydd he burst out s help me im struck on th girl shesshes right dimber an says im the first shes been with an she wants t be spliced to me andand biting back a sarcastic retort kydd glared at him for an affair o the heart youd hazard your chances at the quarterdeck let your shipmates down and if theres to be an alarm were not under sailin orders calloway said doggedly thats not the point as well you know younker the young mans eyes dropped but he went on in a low voice an im remembering too that time in th caribbean you an miss sukey mr kydd how dare you kydd spluttered an that was afore i had m step as an officer he added unconvincingly as though it excused everything sir i be damned to it ill not have m men out o the ship at this time theres a hot war out there in case y havent heard the youngster stared obstinately into space and kydd nearly weakened but told him any seaman in your division as overstays his liberty will be served the same way its t be stoppage o leave for you mr calloway the eyes turned on him in misery but mr kydd shell if youre not on deck assisting the boatswain in ten minutes ill double it after the young man had left renzi looked up from his papers with a wry smile miss sukey in those piping days of our youth i do not recollect our being introduced i do apologise old fellow an unfortunate oversight kydd replied sarcastically and might i ask how your letters are progressing before renzi could reply there was the thump of an alarm gun kydd hesitated but for only a moment it did not include them for he had not declared ready for sea but who could stand idle while others threw themselves into battle we must join em he said forcefully the larboard carronades were more or less mounted now and the bulwarkswell theyd rig canvas dodgers or something hands t unmoor ship he roared up the companionway having thrown aside his shore clothing for action dress by the time he reached the deck the ship was in an uproar mr hallum a muster o both watches after theyre closed up if y please who knew how many were ashore the first of the flying squadron slipped to sea a game little cutter thrashing out into the overcast for the french coast followed closely by actaeon others loosed sail and joined them teazer bringing up the rear still tying off on the improvised bulwarks it might have been worse with a twothirds complement they could maintain fire on at least every other gun and with no real need to mount long sea watches they had a chance in hours teazer and the others were hove to before boulogne and telescopes were quickly raised on quarterdecks at first glance there seemed no threatening movement then from inshore a small sloop set course under a crowd of sail direct for actaeon it would be one of the british inshore squadron that was doggedly watching the huge concentration a baneful sight for english eyes said renzi who generally kept out of sight until the ship was called to quarters his station was then on the quarterdeck to record events for the captain why t be sure kydd responded offhandedly and as long as we dont fall asleep i dare t say this is where they must remain he grunted and continued to search with his telescope it was his first encounter with the menacing sights around this premier invasion port the prospect was awesome the pale regular shapes of the encampment of the grande armée were spread out in an immensity beyond counting covering the swelling heights of the hills and valleys around the port as far as the eye could see this then was the reality the reason for their being a tidal wave of the finest troops in europe arrayed in plain sight against them the sloop reached actaeon and passed out of sight around her lee after half an hour a general signal was hoisted all captains repair on board kydd wasted no time in complying and convened with the other captains in the great cabin ill be brief gentlemen savery opened his features grave it does appear that the final act is at last upon us we have intelligence that the emperor napoleon bonaparte himself is at this moment in boulogne there was a stir of apprehension which was brusquely cut short this is not the first time he has been herehe likes to show himself to his army and to inspect preparations this is not exceptional what is unique and disturbing is that this time not only the emperor but his entire military staff has come paris is left without a single marshals baton this was received in utter silence marshal ney is here with his corps as are soult and davout the grande armée is now complete and i dont have to remind you that tomorrow is a new moon with spring tides the winds fair for england and the weather holding bonaparte has even sent for his brothers louis and joseph now styled princes and columns are said to be on the march for boulogne to a total of at least twenty cavalry squadrons and sixty regiments he concluded soberly i can see no reason for this sudden descent on boulogne other than lord keith has been informed sir kydd asked of course he is making his dispositions but i fear it will be a little time before we might see any reinforcements meanwhile our duty remains as it always has should the grande armée sail we place ourselves between it and england do i make myself clear there was a murmur of assent and savery finished we have an agent of the first calibre in boulogne who will attempt to reach me tonight under cover of dark with the final details which naturally you will share at first light i wish you well for the rencontre gentlemen it was no longer high strategy or studied tactical manoeuvring that would be needed tomorrow it would be nothing less than a frenzied fight to the finish a sacrifice for the very highest stakes teazer was as ready she could be and everyone aboard knew their duty while her company was issued a double tot of rum kydd and renzi took a quiet and reflective dinner together later in the privacy of his sleeping cabin kydd drew out his fighting sword in the flickering candlelight it gleamed with a fearful lustre the blued toledo steel blade at a razors sharpness and the gold damascening catching the light with a barbaric glitter his hand caressed the ornamentation a pair of choughs that he had insisted on to remind him of his uncle in far distant canada a noble lionhead pommel chased in gold would this blade taste enemy blood tomorrow or must he shamefully surrender it when teazer was overwhelmedor worse dawn came there was no news instead there was a sight that caused the whole ship to fall quiet the grande armée was on the move the martial glitter of bayonets and breastplates showed in the wan morning sun as the dense columns of soldiers marched over the slopes like giant caterpillars they converged on one vast open area in a sea of plumes helmets and banners more and more appeared over the line of hills to join the immense horde it was happening boat approaching sir said tawse matteroffactly the little midshipman was clearly not about to be overawed by anything frenchy it was a pinnace under a press of sail it rounded to hooked on by the side steps and a lieutenant bounded breathlessly on board captain sir he said excitedly from capn savery his compliments and believes you should want to know what is afoot i do kydd said drily my cabin no need sir im hard pressed sir this is the emperor napoleon and hes called the grande armée to we know this sir get on with it if you will kydd ordered hallums apprehension was plain and others came up anxiously to hear well kydd prompted er sir our agent was able to get out to us during the night with news of bonaparte sir hes called the grande armée to a parade only and to a parade kydd choked youre telling me hes mustered those hundreds o thousands of soldiers just for yes sir i am this is no ordinary parade its something of an historical day for napoleon wants to be sure of the army when hes finally crowned the people having had a revolution to get rid of the aristocrats and he desiring to start a parcel o new ones from his own family moren that hes creating a whole new order o chivalry to honour the new french empire as will have himself at its heart this day hes to award a new medal to the soldiers to replace the croix de saint louis he calls it the légion dhonneur kydds mouth dropped open the officer became animated one hundred thousand men captured banners massed salutes and all the glory t be wished for and for his throne hard pressed you said kydd reminded him um yes sir and im to say that capn savery conceives that no action of any kind will take place these three days on account of no frenchman would dare to risk being bested before the emperor hell be falling back to the downs and hopes to see us all in the three kings to raise a toast of damnation to the new emperor the shipwright had been right the timbers for teazers wounds were not so easily to be acquired for days now kydd had had the galling sight of the strippedback bulwark with naked toptimbers protruding from the deck where new timberheads had been scarphed into the stumps awaiting their cladding as well the forechains still lacked its channel and was unable to take the foreshrouds unfit for sea duties teazer could only lie to her moorings until she was made whole and was nominally transferred to the downs defensive inshore division it was now a matter of controlling frustration and preparing for the time when she would return to the offensive meanwhile it was not good that seamen keyed up for any sacrifice were spending their days in idleness kydd was too wise in their ways to contemplate more harbour tasks of endless prettifying and pointless restowing and allowed them relaxed discipline with liberty from midday however it bore heavily on his spirit to lie stagnating while others sailed to face the odds there was a marked coolness about calloway but it was an ideal time for both the midshipmen to exercise their craft and kydd saw to it that they were duly occupied on the fifth morning dawn broke on a falling barometer and a veering wind the sea stretched hard and dark like gunmetal out to a luminous band on the horizon under a greying sky there was no mistaking the onset of uncomfortable weather but equally there did not appear to be any ominous swells heaving in massively to warn of the approach of a gale kydd not yet fully confident of his knowledge of sea conditions in the english channel crossed to dowse foul weather i think aye out o the east this meant it would be one of the unaccountable continental blasts that could reach gale proportions within hours but because it had passed entirely over land would be given no chance to establish a fetch the long powerful seas induced by the same wind over hundreds or thousands of miles that were common in the atlantic it would be unpleasant but not deadly the sailing master sniffed the wind and stared upwards as he estimated its speed by clouds passing a fixed point in the rigging a sharp drop in th glass it could be a pauler or it might pass id say it t be the first sir mr purchet well turn up the hands to secure the ship for a blow i believe they were safely within the downs largely protected from anything in the east by the goodwins but kydd was too respectful of the sea to leave anything to chance they would lay out another bower veer away cable on both and have the sheet anchor on a slip stopper along with the usual precautions an strike topmasts sir if you please even if it did turn out that it was a passing blow it would do no harm to perform the exercise oh and let the first lieutenant know if we have any stragglers ashore would you pipes apart from needing a full crew on hand for any eventuality there was the requirement to have a tally of men aboard such that any missing after the blow would not be assumed swept overboard by midmorning the wind had hardened and steadied from the eastnortheast and the first whitecaps appeared snugged down though there was little to fear only the endurance of teazers endless jibbing and bobbing to her anchors as she lay bows to the seas an easterly renzi said looking up from his writing in the great cabin it is kydd grunted a fair wind for the french but i have m doubts that even for his knobbs napoleon the grand theyll put to sea in this his tea was now slopping into its saucer a wet cloth on the sidetable necessary to prevent it sliding off it would be his last for a while but with a bit of luck they should be over the worst by the next morning and could then get the galley fire going again kydd wedged himself more tightly into his chair which had been secured to its ringbolts and reflected ruefully on sea life in a small ship after a tentative knock purchet looked in at the door er a word wi ye sir kydd stood this did not seem to be an official visit thought yed like to know of it first see mr calloway aint aboard does the first lieutenant know um not yet sir thank you for telling me mr purchet the boatswain waited er ill take the matter in hand mselfno need t trouble mr hallum aye sir an if ye wants well yes on quite another matter tell mr moyes and mr tawse to step aft would you the boatswain nodded and left if it ever became official calloway was in deep trouble breaking ship after a direct order from her captain was at the least desertion and would most certainly end in a courtmartial with the destruction of his career renzi closed his book i er need to chase up a reference he said hastily passing moyes and tawse as he left moyes was a newmade masters mate and took his duties seriously but when kydd questioned him about one of his reefers he could throw no light on the disappearance thank you mr moyes you can go mr tawse he said as menacingly as he could i want you t tell me now where i can find calloway and ill not take no for an answer the little midshipman turned pale but stood his ground hes hes not on board he whispered i know that you simkin if he can be got back aboard before this blow stops the boats running hes got a chance t avoid serious consequences so wheres he t be found younker tawse flushed and stared stubbornly at the deck im not talking about a mastheading this is meat for a courtmartial flogging round the fleet id not be surprised at tawses continued silence he went on i know about his saucy piece his his sally was it hes gone t ground with her hasnt he answer you villain the young lad looked about miserably then said in a small voice hes queanstruck on her mr kydd andand he wont listen to his shipmates he tailed off under kydds venomous look it was the end for calloway unless he could be brought to reason a memory came to kydd of a shy thirteenyearold painfully learning his letters with dockyard master thomas kydd in antigua those years ago now that lad had turned into a fine seaman whom he had been able to set upon his own quarterdeck as midshipman with a future as bright as any but if he spared him ignored the crime every seaman in teazer would expect their own offence to be treated in the same way calloway must face the consequences and no damn it how could he let young luke be scuppered by some scheming wench if only he could get to him talk to the rascal knock a bit of sense mr tawse youre guilty o condoning desertion failing t inform your superiors kydd bellowed the lad shrank back his eyes wide and i find theres only one thing asll save your skin ssir tell me truly where hes atand no whoppers or ill personally lay on th stripes ii dont know sir shesshes not o the quality i know lukemr callowayhe wont say much cos i think hes worried well not approve her station where kydd ground out oh sir on stepping ashore we always must leave him at the top o dolphin street mustnt follow or hell give us a quiltin thats all why sir weve never even seen her no matter where she lives it was hopeless youve not heard him talk of her last name atall i cant say as i rememberoh one day i heard him say as shes got long hair like an angel as our figurehead has i see well duck away mr tawse and not a word t anyone d you mark my words clap a stopper on m tongue i will sir the youngster piped kydd bit his lip the only chance calloway had now was if someone went ashore and roused him to his duty before it became open knowledge and reached the ears of authority should he send tawse and let the lad roam the streets of a sailortown alone purchet or moyes no it would compromise their standing aboard if ever it came out then who it must be someone he trusted but at the same time a man who had the power to give credible reassurance kydd heaved a sigh it was crazy but there was only one who could go about the darker side of town knocking on doors and entering taverns then confront the looby and hale him back aboard himself but he would need a trusted accomplice mr hallum he said casually after going on deck ive just recalled something as needs my presence ashore for a short while call away the pinnace if y please sir the first lieutenant said frowning it would be a wet trip if not impossible but a delay in returning would probably prevent his captain being able to get back at all until the storm abated of course kydd added casually should i be unfortunately detained then youve nothing to worry of weve the safest anchoring in the kingdom sir may i ask what it is no sir you may not a worried look descended on hallum but kydd told him ill need to take the gunnerno a gunners mate will suffice thats stirk then sir hell do kydd replied have him lay aft while the boats crew were being mustered kydd retired to his cabin tore off his captains coat and breeches and pulled on an old pair of renzis plain trousers that he had borrowed with his ancient grego he would probably pass as a merchant skipper on business ashore when a mystified stirk arrived kydd laid out the situation before him young lukes got himself in a moil i knows mr kydd sir nothing could be read from the glittering black eyes and ive a mind t do something for him no response came someone should go ashore an bring the young scamp t his senses ive a notion thats t be me what d you say toby slowly stirks expression eased into a smile as i was athinkinshipmate a rush of warmth enveloped kydd the years had been stripped away the old loyalties of his days as a foremast hand had not been forgotten stirk rubbed his chin wont be easy well need t describe em both without anyone knows the cut o the jib of his dollymops heard tell shes a head o hair like our own figurehead all we has t say is anyone seen a towheaded youngster with a longhaired filly astern somewheres south o dolphin street kydd chuckled aware that his hardwon refined speech was wilting under the influence of the returning years i has th say aye said kydd meekly well boats alongside and pouldens coxswain stirk said firmly as though that explained everything kydd dutifully went down with his old friend into the boat leaving a puzzled lieutenant watching it was a wet trip the boats sail under a close reef and they surfed forward on the backs of the rolling seas until they grounded with a solid crash on the shingle kydd leaped nimbly overside before the recoiling wave could return and waited while the boat was brought up i er dont know how long m business will take poulden do ye wait for me here expressionless his coxswain acknowledged and kydd set out with stirk for dolphin street it did not boast the lofty residences and courts of middle street but a dark maze of interconnecting alleyways between the taphouses chandleries and shanties of the boatmen and artisans of the kings naval yard the rich stink of marine stores stale beer and fish hung heavily as they moved urgently along the taverns were full of local seafolk waiting out the foul weatherand they would be best placed to notice strangers coming and going rain squalls added to the winds bluster and kydd drew his old grego closer as he waited patiently at the door while stirk entered the farrier he wasnt long inside some reckons theyve clapped peepers on em but cant say where theys at were on th right course cuffin without stirk to allay suspicions there wouldnt have been a chance of laying hands on calloway who as a child had been a barefoot waif in london and knew all the tricks they hurried on the wind was rising and kydd tasted the salt sea spume on the air the brewers arms brought news a fuddled man in the blue jersey of a boatman disclosed gleefully that not only was calloway known but that he had taken up with the daughter of jack cribben a hoveller who it seemed was none too happy about the situation the obliging boatman was at pains to point out that cribben could be found in one of the little homes towards the seafront spread more sail toby well have im back in a trice the windows of the house were barred shuttered and wet with the constant spray kydd hammered at the door there was a muffled shout from within and he realised he was being told to go to the back where it was sheltered the door was answered by a diminutive furtive woman who immediately called cribben a powerfully built older man yer business he said abruptly noting stirks thickset figure we need t talk to luke calloway if y would cribben stiffened who says we know where hes at mate kydd bit off take us hold hard there cully an whos askin are yez a kings man wereshipmates o the lad who wants him back aboard afore he runs afoul o the captain kydd said quickly y see we know youre not as who should say glad t see him and y daughter my sallys not marryin into th navy shes a sweet lass as needs a steady hand on th tiller an one who comes home reglar each night no sailin away t them foreign parts havin a whale of a time an her left wi the little bantlings an all then well take im off y hands sir kydd said briskly just ask him t step outside if ye would standing legs abrace cribben shook his head and folded his arms defiantly no kydd spluttered an why not cos ill never be the shabbaroon as cravenly delivers up a body t the navy fer anyone begob a flurry of light rain came with the winds growing bluster then well have t get im fr ourselves cock kydd said the man did not move y wont find im here s where is he kydd demanded there was no response stirks fists slowly bunched if n y dont give us th griff cully an that right smartly kydd caught his eye no drop it toby seas gettin up wed best be on our way calloway would be tipped off about a navy visit and would hide deeper as they turned to go a small boy raced around the corner and burst out excitedly in front of cribben old bob fosh seen a packet in trouble off the north goodwins cribbens eyes glinted then the light died i thank ee y little rascal even as its t no account he found a coin for the child who darted off at kydds puzzled expression he said all of em hereabouts is out after th princess draggin anchor off the bunt seein as how shell pay over the odds bein an indiaman thats going t leave me wi no crew to go ahovelling he said bitterly not as yed care he turned to go back inside but kydd stopped him no hands ill work ye a bargain mr cribben we crew fr you an yere going t tell us where t find our luke agreed yell want shares in the hovel no shares should y keep this t yourself cribben hesitated for a moment wait he ordered and snatched an oilskin from behind the door then plunged off down the beach frontage kydd followed yere breaking ship yself then stirk said with relish as he caught up the lively seas were rolling in with whitecapped breakers here and there the wind flat and hard from the east if they left now they would make it out to teazer a wet and uncomfortable trip but if they delayed kydd chuckled well we bein held up ashore th ships boat wont take seas like this will it now s what we do while we waits for th weather t ease is no ones business they laughed together like youngsters out on a prank cribben disappeared inside a hut further along and came out with a weathered individual dick redsull he threw over his shoulder we needs another the man was clearly of some years and cackled a greeting at them but kydd recognised the wiry build of a seaman cribben hurried along to another boathut but without success long jabber neame redsull suggested reedily if n he aint betwaddled wi ale muttered cribben but entered a small cottage and emerged with a large bewildered man carrying seaboots and trying to pull on foulweather gear jack neame lads he said apologetically his redrimmed eyes probably owed more to grog than saltspray but he steered a straight enough course get some foulies fr ye cribben said and briefly ducked into his house finding kydd and stirk seaboots jerseys and oilskins they were well used with the smell of tar linseed oil and humanity leaving the grateful pair to haul them on cribben went away to get further word on the ship he returned with a satisfied grin a threemaster t seaward o the knoll he said to understanding nods from the hovellers well go im i think ohwhat does we call ye then ah toms m tally an this here is toby cribben nodded then explained that the ship was probably a foreigner without a pilot too much in dread of a notorious reputation to attempt the narrow channels through the treacherous sandbanks to the shelter of the downs on the other side and with the easterly wind strengthening so would be their anxieties over the anchor and cable that were holding them daisy may was lying stem seaward with deckcovers whipping and hammering in the gusts but already a large beach party was milling about in expectation of employment cribben waved cheerily at several men as he tramped over to the field past the kings naval yard dozens of anchors of all shapes weights and vintages recovered from the sands were laid out there cribben took his time and picked a stout piece nearly twice his height this un he declared it needed twenty men and a sledge to bring the awkward monster to the waters edge the seas breaking heavily about it in a seething hiss the crowd held back respectfully while cribben heaved himself up into the lugger and carefully checked the gear jack he called and neame joined him the long fore and mizzen yards with sails already bent on were handed into the boat clapped on to their masts and quickly rigged a steady stream of men laid square timbers down the shingle come on lets be havin ye cribben urged kydd heaved himself up over the high bulwarks and stumbled over a dismaying tangle of ropes and spars lying about in the capacious hull fortunately a dippinglug rig was the simplest of all and by the time impatient shouts were going up from those outside he had taken it in two masts a yard for each tacks and sheets under the wet snarl of rigging all around the bottomboards there were regular coils of substantial rope with the lefthand lay of anchor cable you tom go take th fore wi jack toby aft wi me kydd did as he was told and glanced to seaward it was a scene he had seen many times beforebut from the deck of a wellfound manowar not an open boat hardly bigger than a frigates launch under the hammering easterly the whitecaps were increasing and now marched in on the backs of greygreen waves setting the many ships in the downs jibbing energetically to their anchors but what drew kydds attention was an indistinct white line developing on the grey horizon wild seas piling up on the hovellers destination the goodwin sands the tide was low making it nearly a hundred feet down steep shingle to pull the craft to its native element the beach party crowded round every inch of the boat manned and a double rope led out forward with willing hands tailing on kydd looked down on scores of backs bent ready alaaaawww at the hoarse cry every man buckled to they were launching into the teeth of a dead muzzler and kydd knew they had to win their way against wind and the surging combers alaaaawww the cry went up again it was answered immediately by a regular chant and the heaving began alaw boat haul alaw boat haul haul haul haaauuul at first the straining saw no result but then the boat shuddered and inched forward over the timbers alaaaawww the ton deadweight of the daisy may picked up speed and slithered down the ways until she met the seas in thumps of sprayand they were afloat the wet black iron of the big anchor left forlorn on the beach jack damn ye but neame had already leaned over the bluff bow and taken the dripping rope handed up to him straightening and passing it rapidly to the waiting redsull then kydd understood this was a hauloff warp and he bent to help get it over the stout windlass so that they could heave their boat bodily out to sea past the line of breakers daisy may reared and shied at the considerable seas now rampaging in but with three men at the windlass they hauled out steadily in the teeth of the wind to the warping buoy and quickly tied off then the hard work began lines had been taken to their beached anchor and secured around its peak where the shank met the flukes in order to drag it out without it digging in it was backbreaking work in chill bursts of spray and on an unsteady footing sixfoot handspikes were thudded into square sockets in the horizontal windlass drum then came a heroic backwards straining pull the rhythm kept up by having the holes offset from each other so each man could resocket at different times unaccustomed to the toil kydds muscles burned but there could be no slackinghe had seen stirks devilish grin all four laboured until when the anchor was near cribben called a halt then it was more work at tackles to align daisy may before the last tasklifting the anchor bodily from under them until it hung suspended close beneath cribben ordered the jigger tackles secured and their tethering to the warp buoy singled up then raised an arm kydd had to concede it masterly seamanship performed in the wildest conditions get on wi ye neame said goodnaturedly the long yard needed to be hooked to the foremast and hoisted kydd aligned the spar to the direction of the wind seized the halliard and looked aft with concern a dead foul wind blowing hard could drive them helpless back on to the shore to be cast up there would be no second chance redsull pushed his way past to the bow painter while neame at the sheet looked steadily at kydd who in turn kept his gaze on cribben his arm fell kydd hauled furiously hand over hand and the heavy yard began to lift the wind hustled at it until at chest height it caught the exposed sail which bellied to a hard tautness daisy mays bow shying away in response at the same time neame threw off the buoy slip rope the mizzen briskly rose and took and suddenly they were making way against the towering boisterousness of the onrushing seas kydd hunkered down behind the bow with stirk trying to avoid the sheets of spume curling over as they met each wave with a crunch and smash of white spray they were winning their way slowly to seaward lightheaded he felt a guilty thrill at the escapade but savoured the exhilaration of such seamanship he flashed a grin at stirk who winked back they thrashed out through the anchored ships and towards the line of smoking white that now lay across their entire horizon vivid against the dark of the stormclouds with her burden daisy may made slow progress against the powerful seas but she was sure this was her true element and her highwaisted broad lines felt sturdy and secure on impulse kydd abandoned his shelter and passed hand to hand down the boat to where cribben sat at the tiller snug as a duck in a ditch kydd offered aye she is that were going northabout then cribben looked at him in astonishment no mate were goin through in course he said as if speaking to a child through why were fr them as knows th goodwins its no great shakes cribben said yed have t know that theys shiftin all the timeye have t keep a trace o every little spit and bay where the swatchways run in a tidefall th gullies an scourpits all achanging where lies th deepest foxfalls how the tide runs an b heaven we knows it during their slow beat out he went on to tell of the sands themselves in calmer weather they dried to miles of hardpacked grains on which the local lads would play cricket in bravadobut woe betide the laggard for the returning tide could race in faster than a man could run then the water would transform the vast sandbar into hillocks that ran like hot wax quickening the sand into treacherous glue to drag a victim under and if a ship was unfortunate enough to be cast up she had but one tide to break free when the sand became quick she would swaddle down to be held in the maw of the goodwins for everlike as not with her crew as well moren two thousan good shipsve left their bones t rot here cribben said soberly its bin called b your bill shakespeare th ship swallower an hes right an all they drew closer and the effectiveness of the huge mass of the sands in arresting the onrush of the gales heavy seas was becoming apparent to the weather side there was a broad band of hanging spray where the waves were in violent assault while to its lee daisy may was making her laborious way in perfect safety the goodwins were now in full view with the ebbing tidea long low menace not the golden yellow of a beach but the dark sable sand of the seabed stretching away unbroken into the far distance in both directions a gull landed on the gunwale hooking in its claws and swaying under the battering of the wind it was not the usual greywhite species but a big flatheaded type with cruel yellow eyes that watched them with cold calculation every member of the boat flailed at it sending it quickly up and away is a priggin corpse eater cursed redsull then ahead kydd saw their way at a sharp diagonal through the main banks and therefore unseen before it stretched away through to the violence on the other side they went about for the approach kellett gut grunted cribben nothing to worry ofwes moren sixty feet under us hundreds of yards wide only and churning with a tiderace it seemed a fearful prospect for the plucky little boat but she won through emerging into a quite different seascapemurderous combers crashing in to spend their fury in a bass thunder of breaking seas their tops smoking with white spume the stinging spray driven mercilessly downwind by the blast of the gale no more than half a mile to the north a foreignlooking barque was near hidden in the mists of spume cribben gave a soft smile and shouted against the wind hes in a fair way o takin the ground where hes atloses his holding there an its all deep water t the knoll kydd understood the barque was hanging on to an unseen narrow spit and if her anchor tore free of the sand under the winds blast the deep water between it and the steepsided knoll would give no holding whatsoeverthey were in dire peril go forrard then tom where we needs ye cribben told him he pulled on the tiller and crabwise daisy may came up with the deepladen ship passing into the small lee around her stern smart work with fore and mizzen kept her there while cribben stood and hanging onto a stay hailed the anxious faces peering down from her taffrail yez standin into danger that there sandspit compree he bellowed ach ve know came back a faint hail but vot can we do it was a prussian barque a danziger with a valuable freighting but when her master realised what was afoot he quickly turned cagey however cribben had done such haggling many times before and did not have to mention how inadvisable it would be if in the event of an insurance claim it became known that the offer of a perfectly sound set of ground tackle had been turned down it was not long before they were lighter one anchor and cable and the barque was in possession of a third anchor to windward taking advantage of their lee daisy may was put about for a rapid trip back before the wind the absence of the deadweight of an anchor resulted in a lively roll in the beam seas before they were able to shape course into kellett gut away from the chaos of the gale hoy jack cried neame urgently throwing out an arm to seaward at first it was difficult to make out what he meant but then a passing squall lifted the mist and revealed the stark outlines of a small derelicta coaster perhaps dismasted out to sea and now driving to her inevitable doom on the goodwins kydds heart went out to the unknown mariners who had suffered this calamity for he knew they could not be helped daisy may was too far committed into the narrow passage of the gut and the wreck would be cast up well before others could come to their aid nevertheless perhaps out of some sense of brotherly feeling towards them in their extremity cribben luffed up and came to in the lee side of the immense sandbank killick he threw at neame laconically the man cleared away their little bow anchor which plummeted down while all eyes followed the final act of the drama figures on the derelict were jerking about in some sort of frantic activity but the end could not be long delayed soon the huge breakers roaring in would rise up as they felt the solid bank under them bear the derelict aloft and smash it to flinders on the unyielding sand as kydd looked on mesmerised he realised that the activity on deck had been that of some hero who had fashioned a steering oar from a plank and had succeeded in wrestling the bow resolutely shoreward and he also recognised the vessel with her rakish lines she was a chassemarée a french privateer nobody spoke as a giant breaker curled and felland as the boiling surf raced up the sand it sent the wreck shooting forward the heros final actions were rewarded for as soon as the dark shape of the craft came to rest the figures stumbled from it on to the blessed firmness the sea returned in a hissing roar and pushed the craft crazily broadside but the men were not running for safety they were struggling with something in the wreck it was a bodyno an injured seaman and they were dragging him out then making hastily for the higher ground kydd felt like cheering but cribbens look was bleak as he grunted theyve got t come off of theretidell have em in a couple of hours cant we close with th bank an take em kydd asked why theys only mongseers is all let em take their chances theyre sailors jus like us all no kydd felt his blood rise but held himself in check five guineas t lay off the bank cribben looked at him in astonishment then peered into kydds face as if for reassurance as to his sanity seven done the others looked at kydd warily but helped to pull the lugger in as far as was prudent and kydd signalled to the stranded seamen with exaggerated beckoning movements there was a distracted wave back but no sign that they understood the urgency of their situation kydd swore in a short time they would be beyond mortal help he repeated the signal then got everyone aboard daisy may to join in but the frenchmen were not going to risk the tiderips leave em be the silly buggers cribben said dismissively clearly ready to leave kydd said nothing but began to strip off to his trousers whatre ye up to cribben demanded i knows th french lingo kydd retorted an in common pity they have t be warned we only gets th bounty fer bringing back bodies not live uns standing on the gunwale kydd leaped clumsily into the cold shock of the sea and struck out the current seized him and carried him along but after frantic strokes his toe caught the hard roughness of the sandy bottom and he staggered upright looking for the castaways the chill of the winds blast nearly took his breath away and when a frenchman hurried up to him he could hardly control his shuddering vvous êtes iici dans un ggrand péril mmon brave he stuttered and tried to convey the essence of the danger it was surreal he was standing on hardpacked brown sand that was about to plunge beneath the sea talking to a french privateersman whom it was his duty to killand himself a commander of the royal navy taking orders from a deal hoveller the frenchmen chattered among themselves then explained that for reasons of humanity they could not abandon their injured comradehe had been the one to wield the steering oarand besides like many seamen none could swim there was such poignant resignation in their faces that kydd was forced to turn away staggering with the force of a vicious wind squall across the flat banks he tried to flog his frozen mind to thought cribben would not keep daisy may among the leeward shoals for much longer it was a faint shout drew his attention to the lugger he saw stirk jump into the sea and strike out for them redsull back in daisy may furiously paying out a line stirk splashed into the shallows and kydd helped him up a small double line was threaded through his belt at the small of his back which he released hoarsely he panted they hauls em out b this rope cribbens in a rare takinbut them othersll be good uns the light line was handed rapidly along as an endless loop until a heavier line arrived and with a piece of timber for flotation the rescue was rapidly made complete s then mr hoveller wheres our luke calloway kydd demanded cribben was at the head of the beach with his arms folded watching daisy may hauled out of the surf and up the shingle in the fading light wheres m seven guineas snapped the man keeping his eyes on the straining capstan crew youll get em by sunset tmorrow kydd replied tightly then cribben turned to him with a smile i dont rightly know who you is mr tom but youse a right taut man o th sea as ever i seen an i honour ye for it follow me ill go tobyno need fr you kydd said cribben stamped up the shingle and into the maze of alleyways he stopped at the gaunt old edifice of a deserted maltsters and gestured contemptuously i know theys got their heads down in that there loft take him an be damned to the shab kydd eased open the ancient double doors and entered into the smelly darkness the wind covering the noise of his entrance as his eyes became accustomed to the gloom he saw dustcovered mashtubs long planked floors and to the side a flight of rickety steps leading up to the blackness at the top of the building kydd tiptoed to the stairs ears aprick for any sound halfway up he heard muffled giggling he completed the climb arriving at what appeared to be an overseers office within it he heard furtive movement and beneath the door saw dim light he crashed it open mr midshipman calloway yr duty t your ship sir with a horrified shriek a naked girl snatched for covering calloway sat up groggily and glared resentfully at him t break ship is a crime and an insult t your shipmates luke why er me n sally um were yr country lies under such a peril as never was are ye going t tell me youre comfortable t leave the fighting to others while ye cunny burrow with y trug calloway reddened and reached for his clothes im

aboard no questions asked all ataunto and if y dont then youll have t live with yr decision for the rest o your life chapter renzi contemplated the windtorn seas of the downs through teazers saltencrusted stern windows years in neptunes realm had inured him to the motion and he knew he would miss the honest liveliness and daily challenges of the elements if ever he was obliged to go ashore for good for now though that was not in question and he blessed his luck in securing a situation that ensured food board and the company of his friend while he pursued his scholarly quest it was proceeding well he had settled back into his studies after the catastrophe of the failed plot against napoleon and just recently had reached a delightful impasse in his careful building of the edifice of support of his central hypotheses the nomological determinist position was threatening the entire substructure of his economic man but once again the sturdy pragmatism of hobbes two centuries earlier was coming to the rescue in fact conflated with the naturalistic philosophies of hume the socalled compatibilists had the distant wail of the boatswains call sounded kydd was being piped aboard after his enforced delay ashore voices echoed in the tiny companionway to the great cabin then kydd poked his head in shaking water everywhere ill be with you in a brace o shakes old chap he said and disappeared to change then returned quickly to down a restorative brandy a tolerably divertin time of it yesterday he said expansively and one young fussock back aboard as is considering his position he wedged himself in his chair against teazers jerking at her moorings which was her way of indicating her impatience for the freedom of the open sea eyeing the canvas dispatch bag he added i see the boats are running againis that the mail guiltily renzi emptied the contents on to the table only one item seemed at all official any concerning officers would be conveyed personally by a midshipman or lieutenant so this was probably in regard to a member of the crew or yet another routine fleet order that teazer still awaiting repairs would be unable to comply with he passed it to kydd why i do believe youre found out renzi listen to this the ships clerk hms teazer to attend at the flagofficers forthwith kydd laughed dont worry ill send along a hand to bear a fist with all your workings the trip out to monarch was uncomfortable wet and not a little irksome the order had not specified which papers were due for a surprise vetting so renzi had been obliged to take along as many as he could manage carefully protected in two layers of oilskin his irritation increased when no one seemed to know why he had been sent for finally the first lieutenant appeared and regarded him curiously ah yes it is renzi is it not sir then my instructions are to convey you to walmer castle with all dispatch theyre expecting you i believe er pray refrain from discussing your visit with anyone that is anyone whomsoever do you understand me aye aye sir renzi replied taken aback very well i shall call away our own boat immediately theres no need to detain yours and do get rid of that rafflei hardly think walmer are likely to be interested in your weekly accounts or similar he chuckled this was strange indeed renzi had seen walmer castle from the sea a low round edifice like deal castle also dating back to the eighth king henry he had heard that it was now home to the lord warden of the cinque ports an honorary position under the crown whose origins were lost in medieval antiquity the castle was near the edge of the beach at a secluded location a mile to the south of deal a tightlipped lieutenant accompanied renzi as they trudged up the shingle and approached the ancient bastions halt an who goes there it was the first of many sentinels who challenged them before they reached the round tudor gatehouse and renzi felt stirrings of unease army sentries at a private residence the lieutenant spoke to the gatekeeper sergeant who took renzi in charge gruffly telling him to follow they went through the echoing gateway and upstairs eventually entering a distinguished residence with hanging pictures and velvet curtains with kitchen odours and the distinctive serge and leathery smell of soldiery it appeared well tenanted too they passed into a central corridor then midway along the sergeant stopped and knocked at a door it was answered by a welldressed civilian renzi do come in old chap warily he entered the small room with its single desk and visitors chair opposite illuminated by a mullioned gunport sit down make yourself at home tea or renzi declined refreshments hobson aliens office you must be wondering why weve asked you here he began mildly renzi remained silent hobson went on we have the warmest recommendation from commodore dauvergne in jersey as to your probity and reliability which leads us to consider whether in the matter of no a particular and delicate service i am never a spy sir of the highest importance to the interests of this country that you would consider understand me now sir i find the practices of spying repugnant to my character and odious in the extreme should you mr renzi no one has mentioned spying that i recall this concerns an entirely different matter and i confess im quite at a loss to account for your hostile manner sir he paused then resumed stiffly you will be aware of the humane and practical custom between belligerents of the exchange of prisonersofwar both of paroled officers and the common sort i am of course renzi replied then you will be as dismayed as his majestys government at the abhorrent actions of the french in detaining our prisoners with no hope of repatriation in any wise contrary to the usages of war which until the present conflict have always served perfectly adequately renzi knew of the unprecedented act of barbarism by bonaparte at the outset of the war in seizing every englishman high or low military or harmless tourist and incarcerating them along with their women was this to be some crazy rescue attempt hobson continued in the same tone there is to be noted a marked imbalance in prisoners held at the moment we hold some three or four times as many french as they do ours and it is our belief that this may be the means to bring napoleon to a more rational standing on the matter to negotiate quite so agreement has recently been reached with the french government through an intermediary for a diplomatic mission to be sent by us to explore the question you wish me to no mr renzi we do not the foreign secretary lord hawkesbury has appointed a mr haslip lately of the transport board to conduct the mission it is his wish to be accompanied by one in the undoubted character of gentleman who at the same time might be relied upon to undertake the humblerbut nevertheless vitaltasks as they present themselves despite himself renzi could not smother a cynical chuckle come come sir this is not an occasion for humour consider if you will the families of the unfortunates in the fortress prisons of france with no hope of release the hardships they must daily face the i thank you for your consideration mr hobson but i have to tell you i am perfectly content where i am hobson steepled his hands in thought you do surprise me renzi clerk of a brigsloop now to be given the opportunity to visit paris the home of diderot rousseau and enlightened manand while under diplomatic protection to be quite free to take your fill of the sights and mingle in learned company he had renzis avid interest now this was another matter entirely savants of sufficiently adequate stature on both sides wereafter considerable fuss at the highest levelsometimes given safeconduct for the express purpose of furthering human knowledge and were thereby able to pass unhindered between warring nations that he unpublished and unknown could enjoy the same privilege would be an incredible stroke of fortune er there is no question of my abusing such a position to engage in activities in the nature of spying of course hobson frowned in exasperation mr renzi this continual adverting to some form of espionage does you no credit at all you have my word on it that no spying is involved in point of fact should you be so far in want of gentlemanly conduct as to undertake such on a private basis then his majestys ministers will utterly condemn you you will go openly under your own auspices and with stated diplomatic objectives while no doubt you will be from the first subject to a form of surveillance by the authorities provided you are earnest and diligent in the discharge of your duties and refrain from being seen near locations of a military nature i can see no difficulties pursuant to an interesting and rewarding experience i shall proceed in cartel as a full member of the mission to mr renzi if you have a stated moral objection to assisting at such a level then please to let me know at this point hobson said with a touch of impatience i shall then be obliged to find another no not at all i was merely then shall we continue an accreditation to the mission requires more than a few diplomatic formalities which should be put in hand without further delay mr haslip has let it be known he wishes to depart at the earliest possible opportunity of course said renzi hastily i shall immediately put my affairs in order in my ship and there will be time for that later now to the first do you wish to travel under your own name or another some feel it more congenial to their privacy to discourage curious prying by a foreign power oh then er smith will answer i believe certainly there are other details we shall need to record and then under your signature these will be sent to whitehall by special messenger for your formal accession to the body of the mission i suspect mr haslip will therefore wish to be aboard the cartel ship departing this thursday night from ramsgate there may be final matters to discuss before you leave so perhaps we shall meet once more on wednesday oh and as no doubt you have already been told the invariable custom in these affairs is that complete secrecy is to be observed not even your captain must know he looked renzi directly in the eye you have no conception of the villainous creatures who inhabit the nether world ready to take advantage quite quite renzi said with feeling youre taking a holiday kydd asked in surprise as renzi assembled his bags in the larger space of the great cabin where will this be old trout renzi fought with the temptation to mention casually that he intended to spend the weekend in paris it did seem the most suitable opportunity teazer being under repair for the time being lightheaded with exhilaration at the prospect before him he deliberated whether the old but finer blue coat would more suit in a paris of fashion and gaiety or was it to be the newer but sombre brown in the end he decided that if he was to put up a decent showing as a diplomat then perhaps he would visit a fashionable tailor while he was there after all he was representing his country kydd would not let it rest fine weather just the ticket for a bit o sporting in the sun he tried again do you have anyone to go with nicholas you mean in the character of a female kydd grinned i see you wicked dog no then where renzi picked up one of the bags as though checking its weight thwarted kydd stumped off to annoy the officerofthewatch the day before the cartel ship was due to sail renzi made acquaintance of haslip he was a humourless pompous bureaucratic functionary but renzi knew how to handle such as him hobson greeted him warmly so youre leaving tomorrow for paris i envy you renzi my position seldom allows me such diversions he closed the door now one thing has come up old fellow do see if you can help us while youre in paris there is one chap wed like you to look up hes an artist portraiture and such the duke of devonshire and similar rather good toohes hung in the royal academy no less oh yes indeed hobson said smoothly you see hes an odd kind of cove head full of strange notions but wed like you to let him know that were quite keen to see him back in the old country ill let you have a sum of money to that endyoull sign and account for it in the usual way of course but we are rather concerned to have him return you meanto smuggle him back goodness gracious no hes a citizen of the united states a neutral and is quite free to go where he pleases name of fulton the cartel ship left the pier at ramsgate in the anonymous darkness and was soon butting into a chill southeasterly the passengers scuttled below to light and warmth but renzi stood on the foredeck clutching a shroud and burning with indignation he had been well and truly hooked caught and landed dazzled by the daring thought of paris in the summer he had not stopped to consider why he renzi had been plucked out of obscurity to perform the task the real reason for his visit turned out not to be spying but something infinitely worse and more dangerous the stakes for him and england could not have been higher this fulton or francis the codename he sometimes went by was an extraordinary man possibly a genius from childhood poverty in maryland he had attracted early support for his painting talent sufficient to have him sent to england where he had shone as a portrait painter he had spent some fruitful years in devon then come to the attention and patronage of benjamin west the president of the prestigious royal academy in the course of time he had been hung beside the great masters on the continent the hideous excesses of the french revolution had turned to power struggles and thence a fragile form of stability while energies were directed outward in war with england convulsed in the bloody mutinies of spithead and the nore fulton had suddenly decided to leave and cross to france where he had quickly taken up with the circle of expatriate radicals and friends of the revolution who encouraged the blossoming of his growing republican idealism then within months word had trickled back to england that extraordinarily fulton had presented plans to the directory for a submarine boat for use by the french navy against the british why and how a noted artist had turned his talents to such fancies was not explained to renzi then after a coup in napoleon bonaparte had become consul for life and his attention had been drawn to fultons schemes he had advanced the inventor funding to produce his first submarine nautilus if reports were to be believed fulton had indeed built it and trialled it in the seine submerging with his crew for an hour before horrified witnesses then triumphantly returning to the surface it seemed a far from practical weapon of war but when he later manoeuvred the submarine confidently about the entrance to le havre and then the open sea and talked of fitting it with his new exploding torpedoes there was no more doubt but that the sinister and deadly craft was about to rewrite the rules of war he had been granted a personal audience with bonaparte and had energetically begun to prepare plans for a bigger and more destructive submersible but peace had been declared and development stalled when war resumed fulton was well placed to demand what he would for a weapon that could be aimed directly at the one thing that denied the french domination of the world the royal navy since napoleons seizure of power his network of spies and secret police had clamped a tight hold on the capital so reliable information was virtually impossible to getbut it did not take much imagination to realise that any maritime nation would be helpless against the possessor of such an instrument of destruction utterly defenceless against something that could not even be seen who knew what was being promised to its inventor as bonaparte gathered his forces for the invasion of england renzis task was simple locate fulton detach him from the french cause and conduct him to britain the unfairness nearly choked him why should such responsibility be placed on his shoulders on sober reflection though he realised he was uniquely qualified for the job after his hard experiences in jersey assisting a spymaster he knew what to expect of the french system he was intelligent yet unknown to the french and with considerable experience of sea service added to that there was his undoubted moral integrity the demeanour of a gentleman and the fact that his naval record would even show service on the north american station that was why he had been chosen and it was a job that demanded the guile of just one man not a force and still less a full conspiracy with numbers came the chance of betrayal and the french would be merciless to any who threatened their trump card in summary his task was to find where the man was hidden in the great city and approach him with unanswerable arguments as to why he should betray and turn on his benefactorsafter he had unavoidably revealed himself to fulton as a british agent of course and this to the man whose intercepted letters had described englands navy as the source of all the incalculable horrors committed against the free citizens of the ocean and whose firm friend in paris was tom paine the notorious revolutionary it was the stuff of nightmares a near impossible objective but one that had to succeed his mind reeled his body oblivious to the cold and spray as they made for calais and enemy country he had no idea how he would begin he was on his own with nothing but his wits and cunning a white flag prominent at her foretopgallant masthead the cartel ship hove to in calais roads to await inspection to renzi dazed with lack of sleep it was utterly unreal so recently teazer had been fighting for her life in these very waters trying to prevent ships entering now here he was on an english ship about to be welcomed into that same port soon they were making their way within a narrow staked passage through the mudflats past the forts and into the inner basins crowded with invasion craft and dominated by the louring fort nieulay then came the sight of sourfaced douaniers on the quay the sharp tones of the officer conducting exchanges and the indefinable odours of foreign soil as his passport was minutely examined renzi felt himself in an increasingly dreamlike situation that was paradoxically insulating him against the dread of the reality into which he was being sucked he and haslip were separated from the others and conducted to a quayside office where their papers were checked yet again then taken outside to a waiting carriage a gens darmes lieutenant helped them to board and without comment entered as well signalling to the escort of two horsemen behind it was the usual gutrattling journey into the interior relieved only by regular stops for refreshment and a change of horses no one spoke haslip had not been made privy to the real reason for renzis appointment and ignored him in a lordly way while the lieutenant was not disposed to be friendly to an englishman renzi stared out of the window at the flat boring landscape prevented from dozing by the gritty joltingand the thought of the madness into which he was about to be plunged his mind strayed to the last time he had been with kydd before they sailed it was soon after they had seen fit to inform renzi of the true nature of his mission something in his face had sparked dismay in his friend brushing aside renzis light prattle of holidays kydd had gripped his hands and wished him all good fortune for wherever it was he was going villages became more frequent here little had changed in the years since as a carefree young man renzi had passed through france on his grand tour and as they neared the capital he felt a surge of exhilaration at approaching the legendary city of light the outer reaches of paris were much as he remembered and suddenly they were in the city the same open spaces narrow muddy streets and rising above the stink of horses and coalsmoke the enticing alien smell of garlic and herbs always on the air there were as many people on the avenues as before but they were of a different kind sombrely dressed and keeping to themselves as they hurried along there were fewer shabbily dressed poor renzi recognised the rue st honoré and close by the ancient church of st roche then the massive stone columns and classical pediments of the hôtel grandime came into view and the carriage swayed finally to a stop the lieutenant asked them curtly to remain and bounded up the steps he returned with footmen and they were ushered inside conscious of a wary hush and hostile stares renzi completed the formalities the eyes of the concierge flicking between him and the lieutenant their rooms were on the first floor a larger inner suite and a smaller outer one which he took for himself without comment i shall dine alone smith and shall not want to be disturbed haslip said importantly see that youre able to attend upon me at ten tomorrow is that understood it suited renzi well from his rooms he could slip in and out quietly as he pleased and that haslip wished to remain in his solitary glory was even better his meagre luggage arrived and worn out he flopped onto the musty fourposter and closed his eyes he drifted off quickly but woke feeling stiff and cold immediately the dread of his situation rushed back but he did not allow it to take hold he finished stowing his gear in the oldfashioned drawers and splashed his face with water he patted his waistcoat pocket and was reassured by the crackle of his passport then he went downstairs with an air of jaunty defiance ignored the watchful gaze of the concierge and strode out into the evening hesitating he turned right then walked purposefully along towards the vast place louis xv he emerged into its great spaces and slowed this was now the place de la révolution and he was making pilgrimage to the spot where just a handful of years ago the guillotines had slithered and fallen before screaming crowds to end the lives of so many of frances ancient nobility the sense of loss of the older world was overpowering here and he closed his eyes in melancholy the feeling passed and he walked on rapidlyhe needed the comfort of human company inside a nearby tavern it was warm and dark dense with pipesmoke low candlelight played on the animated features of couples and the babble of talk ebbed and flowed renzi found a corner table and settled quietly letting the memories return garçon the tapster seemed not to hear and he repeated the call more loudly astonished faces turned to him as the man stormed across msieur un demi de bière sil vous plaît the tapster came to an abrupt stop and peered at renzi vous êtes anglais he said disbelievingly whether it was because of his squarecut english coat or his accent renzi did not know but he was obliged to explain at length why an englishman was on the loose in the paris of napoleon in return he had to accept a scolding over his use of garçon and monsieur where now the egalitarian citoyen was expected a nearby couple made much of moving to another table and behind him a noisy incident was probably another pair ostentatiously removing themselves from the proximity of an englishman no doubt for the benefit of hidden watchers alone renzi sipped his beer as the conversations started again and his thoughts turned to what lay ahead it was near impossible but a start had to be made the hardest thing of all would be to locate the american he had his freedom to move about but that did not mean he could simply go up and ask where the submarine inventor called fulton was even the slightest interest in matters not directly concerning his official purpose in france would be reported and seized upon jubilantly as evidence that he was abusing his position to spy the moniteur would trumpet to the world such perfidy against his innocent hosts and the worthy cause of the hapless prisonersofwar would irrevocably be lost renzi forced himself to concentrate there had to be a way to fulton if he had the wit to find it without question he was being followed after jersey however he was too wise in the ways of spying to try to shake them off once identified an agent was a known quantity but more importantly a slick evasion would be the quickest way to guarantee the attention of fouchés secret police the safest course would be to appear to make the most of his stay and move about visiting and gaping this would have them relaxing their surveillance and make furtive meetings more possible he smiled wryly right at this moment he was where duty called openly tasting the night life of paris there was movement under the candlelight by the far wall as a ravenhaired chanteuse and a darker central european violinist bowed together and opened with a soaring peasant air from the auvergne which took renzi back to longpast days of gaiety and passion the singer made shameless play of her charms and held the room spellbound despite himself renzi was caught up in the charged atmosphere and applauded enthusiastically then followed a sensual love lament the tavern fell quiet as she held the audience with her tale of longing and suffering loving and losing renzi couldnt help a sudden rush of feeling for some reason she was reaching him with a message of humanity and grief that rose far above the gross distortions of war as the urgent pleading harmony enveloped him his mind rebelled he was furious at the pitiless logic that said the ultimate course for nations in disagreement was to throw themselves at each other in a struggle to the death he gulped at the intensity of his reaction but then an image of teazer assailed himthe graceful being in whose bosom he had been borne while his theories had matured destroyed without warning in a cataclysmic detonation prey to a lurking submarine boat her unsuspecting crew torn to pieces by the explosion it was horrific an unthinkable fate that might come to pass unless in the warm darkness it was all he could do to prevent his helplessness coming out in a storm of emotion and overwhelming him it was stultifying in the room haslip had resorted to a lengthy legal argument and was presenting it in a monotone the french were led by an arrogant young firebrand an earthy scion of the revolution who clearly despised both the english and what he had to do and did not bother to hide his impatience the presentation droned on and when they broke for refreshments renzi went to haslip to show him his notes and express support he met nothing but selfimportance and a pompous disinclination to listen in the afternoon the french deployed their own man an arid wordgrinder whose lengthy manytailed points were almost impossible to follow and summarise on paper renzi despaired it was as if the opposite party was under orders to obfuscate and delay and he was relieved when an appeal to an obscure medieval caselaw finding was interpreted in opposite ways and it was agreed to retire for study and deliberation his offer of assistance acidly declined renzi felt able to take time to get a hold on the situation but before he did so he would indulge himselfjust this once he had noted a bookshop of some distinction further along the rue st honoré that it would be a sin to ignore in this the paris of montesquieu and diderot it was in fact a grand palace of learning ramparts of books stretching away alcoves and desks for enquirers and stiffly dressed assistants attending the browsing public he reached for a voltaire and was soon contentedly absorbed in its earnest and learned preface written by another scholar praising the author as an epitome of the enlightenment an assistant came up to him renzi thought of his own studies clearly now was the perfect opportunity to discover the works of lesserknown authorsand at source in his best french he asked politely if it were known that the philosopher johann herder had published anything of note following the ideen zur philosophie which had so informed renzis earlier searches for historical origins je suis désolé msieur the man said sorrowfully clearly untroubled by renzis english appearance an older man nearby removed his spectacles and cocked his head to one side pardonnezmoi monsieur he said i could not but help overhearing i rather feel he would be most offended were i not to make mention of his briefe zur beförderung der humanität recently to print you are so kind sir renzi said with a bow i find herr herder at a refreshing distance from goethes classicism are you then a scholar monsieur the gentleman said with rising interest in the slightest way sir i am as yet unpublished still to mature my hypotheses on the human condition then surely the swiftest way to an enlightenment is disputing with the author himself was ist aufklärung then what is enlightenment renzi could not resist kants pungent epigram then he hurried on and i should wish it possible sir the mans eyes twinkled tonight you shall it is the first thursday of the month so there is a lecture at the institut and i am sure your author friend will be there oh may i introduce myself pierre laplace astronomer and mathematician renzi was stunned this was the very savant whose work on celestial mechanics and advanced mathematics had earned him the title of the french newtonand if he had heard aright he was inviting him to the famous institut to mingle with the finest minds of the age bbut i am english sir he said faintly you may be a hottentot for all i care this night you shall be my guest monsieur oher smith nicholas smith quite so close by an anonymous individual continued to concentrate on his bookrenzi noticed it was upsidedown the lecture on the taxonomic peculiarities of seaweed was persuasively delivered and afterwards laplace went in search of herr herder however it seemed that the elderly gentleman was ill and they dined alone for some hours renzi had been able to throw off his feeling of hopelessness and taste something of what it must be to reach a level of recognition that would find him welcomed into the company of great thinkers such as these would his own contributions to knowledge ever achieve such greatness sir i must express my deepest sensibility at your kindness in inviting me here he declared sincerely nonsense monsieur you will go from here with renewed purpose a higher vision this is what la belle france is giving to humanitya world where all are equal each may enter the temple of learning as a consequence of their gifts of logic and scholarship never the circumstances of their birth sir our royal society is prestigious but classbound in france we order things differently why where would be your genevan rousseau even your pole kosciusko had they not slaked their thirst for philosophies at the fountains of wisdom only to be found here in paris renzi murmured an agreement and laplace continued expansively why there are sages and philosophes from all corners of the world flocking here to be recognisedi honour these savantsand even original thinkers like the american who came here desiring of all things to create a submarine boat aa what renzi could hardly believe his ears a species of plunging boat that submerges completely under the water a most amazing device i have seen it myself for i have the honour to count the inventor among my friends laplace said itit immerses under the water and stays there renzis mind was flailing wildly come come sir this is hard to accept no it is true monsieur you have my word i was able to intercede on his behalf to secure the fundingi have the ear of the emperor you know and he was concerned even in these busy times to allow the gentleman to realise his undersea dreams how generous renzi said as heartily as he could can you conceive of it a boat that swims freely in the realm of the creatures of the deep and allows the brave argonauts aboard to view their disporting in safety and comfort this is a marvel indeed quite so and it may remain under the water for aa period of time i myself and three score distinguished witnesses observed its disappearance beneath the seine to reappear whole the crew unharmed after a full hour had passed and later the craft was transported downriver to the sea and he repeated the miracle the submersiblehe calls it nautilusmay be relied upon to navigate unseen travel many leagues at sea and carry quantities of men a magnificent opportunity for science renzi enthused does it have a window at all and how might the brave sailors breathe for so long in such confines this is a mystery that must seize the imagination of even the most hopeless dullard how i wish i might see this wonder of the deep ah that may be difficult i believe the inventor is under contract to our government for its development and naturally there is much discretion involved in such it is tedious but governments being as they are renzi allowed his disappointment to show i understand such a pity in my old age i might have recounted how i set eyes on the first submarine boat of the age and now my curiosity must remain for ever unsatisfied a vexation for you the pity of it all is that the man himself is most probably in the library below us it is his practice that when he concludes at the ministry he invariably spends time there he does treasure it for its quiet catching his breath renzi stammered to be here when laplace tuttutted clearly moved by renzis ardent manner sir this at the least i will do i will leave it to mr fulton whether or no he desires to be introduced to one who stands in admiration of his work and prays that he might learn more i believe the proctors office will be available to us at this hour and thus you may discreetly satisfy your curiosity as he will permit that is all i can promise it was an incredible stroke chapter in the booklined leathersmelling proctors office renzi waited for laplaces return with pounding heart it seemed an interminable time but suddenly he heard voices outside then two men entered the room renzi got hurriedly to his feet ththank you sir so kind in you to see me the man was tall and slender even graceful but what caught renzis eye was the intensity of his features the large dark eyes intelligent forehead and quick darting manner not at all my friend he replied in a hardly noticeable american accent then smiled and if im not mistaken in my reckoning youre english sir ohsmith nicholas smith of um plymouth in devon renzi stammered hoping to appear overcome at being in the presence of such genius i know where plymouth is friend i spent three years in devon at my easel fine place to be now be so good as to tell me how an englishman is here in paris unhung er im assistant to the official mission concerning the exchange of prisonersofwarand by way of a scholar but in the meanest degree he added with a shy glance at laplace a cartel man so not a son of albion come to his senses and the republican cause ah not as who should say sir renzi said aware that any pretence to radical sympathies as a means of penetrating a tightknit group of expatriates of the revolution would never stand scrutiny pity so what can i do for you sir mr fulton monsieur laplace was good enough to tell me something of your submarine boat and i confess im quite overcome with the grandeur of your vision to conceive of a craft that swims with the fishes inhabits neptunes world like the native denizensit is truly magnificent i thank you sir do tellfor im on fire with curiositywhen under the sea do you see by light from the windows or is it a lanthorn or similar i cannot imagine how it must be warm and dry but fathoms down in the pelagic gloom lit only by foxfire sir naught but your common foxfire at renzis look of incomprehension he gave a boyish grin and said a lanthorn or candle produces vitiated air not fit for a human this foxfire we get it from the woods after a season of rain it glows in the dark quite enough to conn our noble craft sir and you speak of air do you take aa balloon or some such with you on the expedition to release when the breathing becomes difficult laplace stood up forgive me gentlemen i must attend to another matter do feel free to continue your discussion while im gone but pray do not leave this office together it would prove inconvenient for me renzi could hardly believe his luck was this his chance his whole being urged him to make the move while he could there might be no further opportunity yet a tiny voice of caution insisted that until he knew more of this man he stood a good prospect of being denounced as a british agent fulton moved to the proctors desk and sprawled in his chair fiddling with a quill youre both fascinated and in dread of the beast am i right your nautilus is a scientifical phenomenon of the first order and im finding it difficult to grapple with its implications for mankind renzi said it is that thenthen do you not fear that your wonderful creation might not be subverted to serve an other baser interest that of war it might be supposed fulton smiled cynically then mr englishman i have news for you the entire reason for my inventing it is war sir i beg you to elucidate believe me mr smith to be an enemy to oppression wherever its to be found and the only guarantee of liberty for the individual is freedom for the nation i see that there exists one tyrant one oppressor who sorely bears on the nations of this world that has made perpetual war in my lifetime by bestridin the seas and robbing the world of its ancient maritime freedoms sir i speak of the royal navy go on sir renzi said the rest then surely follows nautilus and her sistersll make it impossible for your damn navy to take to the seas their shipsll skulk in harbour afeared o silent assassination the people will rise up on their monarchy and then the oceans will be free for all nations in amity to progress on their lawful occasions was there any sign of madness behind the triumphant smile if so renzi couldnt detect any and that englishman will be the end of war as we know it no state will ever more hazard to set a fleet of ships aswim with the intention of dominating the seas which will then oblige each nation to live peaceable within the bounds nature has set it he spindled a paper lazily in course ive taken steps to place the whole on a sound commercial footing as youd expect of a maryland farming boytheres to be a bounty payable on every warship put down by my submarines and a royalty for each one built under licence selffunding you see renzi struggled to reconcile the stern political radicalism with the artless words of a backwoodsman was this the raving of an unworldly visionary or was the future to be this horrifying reality he asked respectfully sir might we say your plans to this end are advanced at all do you mean sir is nautilus ready for her destiny mr napoleon bonaparte thinks so he told me to my face to take her overland to brest and there before a quantity of admirals i stalked unseen a shipand blew her to smithereens with my torpedoes that opened one or two eyes i can tell you out in the open sea renzi said chilled to the core this submarine did not just work it was now armed with a deadly explosive device and quite ready to strike wherever it chose it had happened the world he knew was fast ending of course and ill tell you something else he chuckled in the end months of the last war i took her out myself on patrol and theres two english brigs alive today only because they sailed before i could see to em who was to say that one of them had not been teazer unwittingly hunted by an unseen assassin to within a moment of being blown to fragments renzi pulled himself together aa fine achievement he said faintly i had no idea why thank you sir i didnt think to hear the same from an englishman fulton seemed genuinely touched er it would gratify me no end if i were able to view your fabled nautilus that will not be possible fulton retorted with a hard look i did not mean to offend sir fultons features softened well if you must know im right now in negotiation with the french ministry of marine for a larger more potent plunging boat and he tailed off and gazed out of the window i do understand your position sir renzi said the world will hear about em soon enough fulton swung around in his chair and rose extending his hand pleasure to meet you friend and good luck with your prisoners he added breezily and left the situation had changed from grave to catastrophic from future potential to present reality here was the truth of all the rumours a submarine craft had been constructed tested and fitted with weapons of irresistible destruction fulton had indeed the ear of napoleon and was concluding a contract for a whole fleet of the submersibles and very soon these would quickly break the stalemate and see the channel cleared wide open for a grand concluding scene in an agony of helplessness renzi sprang to his feet and began pacing the room if there was going to be any time left for action he had to think of something now but for gods sake what his frantic thoughts were interrupted by the arrival of laplace ahso mr fulton has returned to his work did you find satisfaction sir renzi composed himself indeed so monsieur a most fascinating gentleman then i must bid you farewell mr smith bonne chance in your negotiations i shall see you to the door out in the street renzi let the ceaseless flow of people and vehicles eddy past trying to bring to bear a line of thought that would lead to a path of action but there were too many conflicting elements the fortuitous meeting with laplace would be seen as harmless enough in itself for the academician had thoughtfully arranged his meeting with fulton in privacyno one would know and he was therefore unlikely to be under suspicion renzi still retained his freedom of movement and fulton had shown himself not unfriendly so it was reasonable to assume that he stood a chance if only he could think of something he paced slowly forcing his mind to concentrate the only way that fulton was going to leave france was of his own volition therefore it was up to renzi to create the elements that would lead to such a decision with arguments so persuasive that the inventor would see it overwhelmingly in his interest to abandon napoleon to go with the british no matter his political views it seemed impossible and time was running out who knew how much longer the talks about the prisoners would last then some hundreds of yards ahead he saw fulton walking down the street carrying a large flat case his head bowed in thought impulsively renzi followedat the very least he could try to find out something more of the man almost certainly fulton was being trailed bonaparte had too much invested in him to do otherwise however renzi had been seen publicly with the highly respected laplace who had obviously trusted him so at the moment it was unlikely he was being tracked deliberately renzi stopped and gawped upwards at an imposing stonework façade then wandered on taking in the sights but alert for one thing it wasnt long before he spotted what he was looking for a man who found shopwindows very interesting then hurried on his quick covert glances always in fultons direction renzi eased his pace letting fulton pass out of sight ahead as long as he had the tail in view he was being led after his quarry they both disappeared to the right down the next street renzi lengthened his stride moving faster without the appearance of haste round the corner fulton was comfortably in sight again he remembered this avenue led to the banks of the seinewhat was fulton up to the american paused at the edge of the water then he made off up the river on the leafy quai that led to some of the grandest sights in paris with the red of the setting sun the distant image of notre dame seemed to renzi to lift ethereally above earthly dross as if in sudden resolution fulton stepped out faster the evening promenaders drifting across the lineofsight made it easy for renzi to keep a discreet observation on his mark it was puzzling though the further sights were grander but this was not a district noted for its residences then suddenly clutching his case close to him fulton hurried across the pont au change and on to the midriver island that bore the great cathedraland the bloodsoaked conciergerie prison he didnt stop and passed quickly across to the other bank this was a mystery indeed fulton was now on the left bank and in the gathering dusk heading deep into the latin quarter of seedy decaying tenements was he visiting a paramour unlikely given the kind of doxy to be found in this district or the rendezous place of some revolutionary band finally it was down a short street and into a dead end where fulton passed into a doorway renzi crossed the road but stayed by the corner looking back diagonally across at the anonymous apartment building if he was caught there could be no pretence now of sightseeingthere could be only one reason for his movements was this merely a visit a deliverya clandestine meeting nerves at full stretch renzi waited there was no sign of the follower he pressed back into the grimy brickwork as an infant squalled on a lower floor and cooking smells wafted out at the top a light flickered into existence and steadied a shadow passed in front of it then another light sputtered on and fulton passed unmistakably between them yet another light appeared close to the first still no other figure fulton crossed back and when all had been still for some time it became clear to renzi that this was no secret rendezvous or other furtive assignation fultons unsuspecting movements could have only one meaning this was simply a man returning home after a hard day of work the many lights meant he was probably working on his design ready for the next days meetings this raised as many questions as it answered but he now had the priceless secret of where fulton could be found his spirits rose but there must be a reason for the mans living in such surroundings perhaps as an artist the bohemian lifestyle of this arrondissement appealed but why subject himself to the noise and stinks when he could no doubt demand a mansion renzi shook his head at the conundrums and turned to go from round the corner the follower stepped squarely into his path in one terrifying instant renzi had to make a decision to fight or run both courses would have the same outcome his spying would be discovered in a burst of desperate inspiration he plastered a foolish grin on his face and swaying towards the man fell to his knees pawed ineffectively at him then keeled over and dryretched into the filthy gutter the man stepped round him in disgust and renzi crawled away groaning then staggered to his feet trembling it had been a narrow escape haslip was waiting for him this i could scarcely credit mr smith one in your position daring to approach a gentleman of such stature as monsieur laplace and at the institut no less the french government have rightly expressed to me their serious misgivings that a junior member of a diplomatic mission should so far forget himself he snorted in indignation so the french knew of his meeting laplace and were nervousbut they had no idea he had spoken to fulton or it would have been a very different matter renzi forced himself to an icy calm sir i do sincerely regret the impulse that led me to such an action in my studies i have often encountered the work of monsieur laplace and that is to no account sir as head of mission i forbid you to engage in such scholarly pretensions above your station which can only result in ridicule do i make myself clear why yes mr haslip you do i shall not trouble the gentleman again hmph it seems to me there is little enough work to keep you occupied i shall think on it thank you sir should i go now sir renzi wheedled to his contempt he could see that this had mollified haslip who sniffed and indicated that the interview was at an end renzi left and took refuge in his room he sat on the edge of the bed head in hands the situation was tightening without doubt he was now being watched he could not count on freedom to act any more and what could be the meaning of fultons living in such eccentric circumstances when he was the confidant of an emperor his feet hurt and the incident with the follower had unsettled him to be at large in the paris of napoleon bonaparte who no doubt was preparing for the night in sumptuous surroundings less than a mile from where renzi sat was almost too fantastical for belief yet if he put a foot wronga lapse in speaking an unlookedfor coincidence recognition by one from his pastfouchés secret police would pounce there was a bottle of brandy between two glasses on the dresser he splashed himself a strong measure and tried to compose his thoughts everything hung on his conjuring an argument to detach fulton from the french cause he felt the brandy doing its work and paced up and down while he considered his next move he had to act quickly to prevent any suspicion growing for the moment they would be presuming that he had been reprimanded by his master for straying outside set bounds therefore he must do something suitably predictable in the circumstances and it must be a move that no selfrespecting spy would make it came to him almost immediately effective and credible but with the grave drawback that if he could not pull it off to perfection he would end by being the instrument of his own betrayal only iron selfcontrol would see him throughthe prize his freedom to act it was the only way forward tonight he would get drunk not just flustered or even betwaddled but completely cupshot and maudlin such that any sympathetic stranger sidling up to share his woes would not doubt for a moment what they heard renzi made his preparations he had not been lost to drink since his youth and the wanton excesses of the grand tour now he was determined to bring it to passthere could be no studied pretence at intoxication it could be only the real thing convincing in its repulsiveness and gradual descent into incoherence he examined his store of coins how many of these newfangled francs would it take to achieve total drunkenness carefully he went through his pockets there was nothing incriminating his precious passport was slipped deep within his waistcoat and he was ready for the night outside it was dark but the traffic showed little sign of diminishing he dithered at the hotel entrance long enough to be seen then turned left ambling along in quite the opposite direction from the latin quarter towards the more northerly faubourgs montmartreor was that now mont marat after the scientist and revolutionary he resisted the temptation to see if he was being followed and kept his eyes ahead but allowed himself to be jostled by a passing couple and swung about to glare after them with much satisfaction he saw guilty movement in a slightly built man a dozen yards behind he resumed his walk without a second glance back as the larger establishments turned into a smaller more intimate hostelry he looked about le canard sportif appealed and he went in the noise the glare of argand lamps on brass and crystal and the smell of humanity beer and gallic cuisine assaulted his senses but renzi reminded himself he had a job to do his order was taken by a waiflike girl in an apron who on hearing his accent ran back to the patron who came over to peer at him suspiciously but he had his story and with a suitably woebegone expression then the ostentatious checking of francs it seemed to persuade the man that he would be no trouble what did he desire to drink why absinthe would answerhe had heard of but never tried this newly fashionable tipple so monsieur has a taste for paris then the verte would probably most appeal mademoiselleici an odd pinchwaisted glass was brought with an intense green liquor in the base and a narrow spikeended spoon placed across the rim a lump of sugar was put on its slotted bowl and icecold water poured over it clouding the result to an opalescent milkiness fascinated renzi took it inhaling the wormwood aroma appreciatively he sipped the complex of herbs took him by surprise but was he concluded very agreeable remembering his duty he downed it resolutely and before long felt the subtle tendrils of inebriation begin to spread another certainly a few curious glances came his way the liquor had a lazy potency that was deceptive and even a fine onion soup did nothing to halt the muzziness stealing over him he became aware of someone drawing up a chair beside him at lastthey were making their move but it was a girl they chatted amiably but she pouted and left when he kept reaching for his absinthe the spirit took a deeper hold his inner being calmly noted a curious rotation of perspectives a plasticity in objects as his mind gently separated from its corporeal existence he noticed a distraction to one side and drunkenly turned in his seatit was a man smiling affably who introduced himself as one who so deplored this unfortunate state of hostilities between two such great nations and who seemed not to notice his befuddlement it took a convulsion of will to realise that the moment had come fighting lassitude he fumbled for the elusive french that expressed his solemn agreement and hope that this fine city might soon be open once again to any english hearts seeking to pay homage the man agreed and summoned more absinthe for his new friendhis opinion on a clear variety la bleue was earnestly solicited renzi allowed it a splendid drop and confided it was going far in helping him overcome his woes his head swam woes surely not another la bleue persuaded renzi to unburden and to the mans sharp interest he obliged passionately rather than the loneliness of a foreign country it seemed it was more the cruel fate of the prisonersofwar that grieved him they were getting nowhere in the negotiations and all the time men on both sides were spending their years in unjust captivity merely for doing their duty to their country renzi grew more emotional to see the conditions of the prison hulks in portsmouth and sheerness it would wring the heart of the devil himselfand now there was talk of building a massive fortress prison in the middle of remote dartmoor he struggled for words to describe the desolate heath the hopeless pallor of the prisoners families unseen whose grief at the separation to renzis relief the mans interest declined and finding he had an appointment he departed what was left of his rational being exultedand with a seraphic smile he surrendered all and slid to the floor the next morning his plea of illness was relayed to hasliprenzi didnt care how it was received as despite his hammering head he was gloriously triumphant by some mysterious working of the brain he had woken with a glorious vital inspiration at the forefront of his consciousness he now understood the real reason for fultons hiding away in the stews of the left bankand with it he had the key to making an approach he lay back in growing satisfaction letting all the pieces come together and they fitted as snugly as he could have wished it was the character of the man his was a brilliant and fecund mind in a few short years he had changed from an artist of the first rank into a selftaught engineer able not only to conceive of but actually bring to realisation dread engines of war but that very quality his lonely genius and singleminded drive to achieve had made him almost completely selfreliant never needing the support and comfort of an organisation and like many deeply immersed in a project of their own conception he was suspicious and wary the vital clue was what he had said about a business footing for his endeavours greed for gold did not figure in this he was using a commercial mechanism to control the project and remain at its head but thinking that paris would agree to such a novel prospect commercialising the art of warwas both naïve and futile however if fulton was holding out for a business relationship that would explain both the conspicuous absence of the military about him and his humble lodgings with the french standing firm the man was probably fast running out of money was this then his chance despite his thudding head renzi felt a leaping hope after his short talk with fulton he felt certain that for him the bringing into the world of his creations stood above all else he had almost certainly chosen to go with the french as having the greatest need for a warwinning sea weapon against the allconquering royal navy and the radical talk might be just that it was time to actbut was he prepared to stake everything even his life on one drunken insight he had until that night to decide slipping out of the hotel quickly renzi stepped down the avenue and into the darkness pausing only at the corner to glance back as far as he could tell his previous nights debauchery had succeeded and no one was interested in him he pushed on as if he was heading for the bastille then he took a last precaution at le marais he chose a narrow street turned down it and hid in the first alley he could find he had not long to wait he had been followed as the man pressed past urgently renzi was out and behind him hands clasped he brought his fists down hard on the nape of the mans neck then dragged his pursuer senseless into the alley in the blackness he went through the mans pockets taking a watch money papers he stuffed them away and for good measure took the coat a stout fustian then left now free to move he cut abruptly right and across the seine by the pont marie dropping the coat into the river as he went he headed directly through the latin quarter to fultons address slowing when he got near a watcher stood at the corner opposite this was another matter close in with the wall and at full alert the man could not be taken by surprise lights showed in the top floorfulton was there renzis resolve hardened should he kill the man but that would only awaken suspicions then he remembered something he turned back to a small pile of old furniture with a flapsided table over his shoulder he walked firmly towards the doorway the watcher would probably know the tenement residents but it was unlikely that a tradesman delivering goods would be challenged at the entrance he mimed to a woman that he was a mute jabbing upwards she let him in and he stumped up the dark stairs leaving the table at the top landing then heart racing he knocked at the door fultons muffled voice demanded who it was renzi mumbled a few words until an exasperated fulton flung the door open mr mr smith what in hells name renzi pushed his way past ducking out of sight of the windows forgive the intrusion mr fulton but my business with you is pressing and cannot stand on ceremony what business and how in the devils name do you know where i live sir i know you to be an inventor and genius of the first rank who will surely find a place in history i am also aware that youre frustrated in your desire to see your creations born to have them become a tangible reality a long table at the end of the room was overflowing with drawings and other papers renzi thought he could detect the form of an undersea craft not only that but you are being denied the fruits of your labourseven the means to sustain existence while you bring these wonders into the world mr fulton im here to by god youre english and youve come to put in your oar with me and emperor bonaparte he gasped in astonishment the barefaced hide of you sir a knot formed in renzis stomach if he revealed his true identity he might court betrayal to the watcher outside but if he denied it he would have no standing by which to negotiate its true isnt it how can you know of my affairs fulton snapped unless youve agents in the ministry of marine his eyes narrowed sir if your heart is set on this you must see that your present arrangement will not be the one that achieves it napoleons france will never agree to putting a military masterstroke in the power of a yankee businessman no matter what the terms you should see this sir time was slipping away at any moment the watcher might realise that the deliveryman had not emerged and become suspicious and if he had made an error concerning fultons true situation he was done for well mr smith or whatever your name is i can tell you now youre plain damn wrong in your reckoning theres nothing stands between me and my arrangement save a little matter concerning the crew of the submersibles the crew renzi said mystified if its the barbaric custom these days to treat fireship crews as pirates and incendiaries i want the french to stand surety that the enemy wont hang emand take reprisals on their prisoners if they do sir id hazard theyve been hanging fire over this for a long time renzi said quietly for the canny french it would be an ideal sticking point to drag matters out it was looking more and more certain that they were letting economic hardship do their work for them in forcing fulton to hand over the plans and come to a different agreement theyll get to it fulton said uncomfortably perhaps said renzi seeing his chance but in the meantime it would grieve me to see a mind as worthy as yours brought to such a needy pass he fumbled beneath his waistcoat and found his moneybelt heretwenty english guineas he placed them on the table fulton made no move to stop him theyre yours sir with my best wishes theres no need to account for themno one has seen me give them to you have they they were part of a sum he had signed for in faraway walmer castle and he would have to explain later but for now fulton gave him a look of indignation if youre thinking id sell out for english gold but renzi had seen the gleam in his eyethe money meant decent meals wine a respite from creditors independence at the very least renzi had bought his silence the danger of betrayal had receded sir i would not think to imply such a thing do take it as your due fulton picked up the coins and slipped them into his pocket accepted with my thanksbut i see myself under no obligation whatsoever quite i cannot help but observe that its not without its merit to consider some kind of business relationship with britain as will see your projects properly completed im sure are you an english agent fulton asked renzi caught his breath im authorised to offer you a contract with his majestys government for the full realisation of your works in a sum to be determined and all possible assistance from the naval authorities under your direction this was breathtaking gall renzi knew very well he had no such authorityin light of fultons commercial inclinations he had made it up on the spot so it seems you must be an agent mr englishman well unless i did not make myself clear before he said sarcastically let me inform you that my democratic and republican views are as democratic republican a singular position may i say for one who will now be seen as supporting the world ambitions of an emperor no less whose own views on leave mr bonaparte out of this i cannot see how that is possible renzi said smoothly so long as you confine your labours to the cause of this french emperor the world must draw its own conclusions fultons face reddened he started to say something but thought better of it renzi continued in a brighter tone for one in the character of a businessman im surprised you do not see the opportunity before you of enabling a helpless and frustrated navy before the invasion ports to enter unseen and put paid to the flotillas skulking within for this power they will pay much im persuaded renzi pushed the vision in course you will conjure such a fleet of submarine boats as will astonish mankind should you be paid by results as you wish then the elimination of two thousand invasion craft youre speaking for the british admiralty not at all i speak for his majthe government of great britain the prime minister sir fulton paced about the room if such a thing were possible it could only be under a copperbottomed business contract that sees me in charge and be damned to pettifogging interference can there be any other way we speak of resultswhat better way to secure them than to place the responsibility entirely in your hands renzi smiled ironically you will appreciate that the practice of business is not entirely dissimilar in our two nations fulton scowled but said nothing a thought suddenly struck renzi one that appealed to his romantic streak the submarine how fittinghow exciting it would be if they were to make their dramatic escape in it from napoleons clutches safely to the open sea beneath the waves er incidentally where do you keep nautilus at the moment she is no more oh fulton turned his face away to keep myself i was constrained to break her up sell the pipes and cylinders all the ironwork im sorry to hear it renzi said softly the vision fading the french were in a right taking when they heard about it he grinned sourly as well they might be thought renzi without a working specimen everything lay out of reach confined within fultons fertile brain it explained why they had held off seizing what they wanted and were now applying more subtle pressures renzi gave what he hoped was a look of sincere sympathy no more than they deserve a disgraceful treatment of a distinguished man of engineering you will find that we british will you british fulton snarled have a care sirive said naught about toadying up to king george as i remember nor should you renzi came back swiftly as we both know it is in the nature of a business arrangement only fulton stalked away and stood glowering out of the window above all things renzi said you will agree that while you remain here you stand small chance of seeing your sea dreams realised a firm contract with my government means you could be building within the month there was no visible response mr fulton if youre asking i take up with the losing side fulton retorted acidly do you not have confidence in your own device of war sir renzi replied coolly ill think on it sir i must press you to i said id think on it damn you an understanding perhaps that get out before i tip off your friend yonder renzi drew himself up very well should you desire to discuss terms then er i shall be in touch good day to you mr fulton he turned to go but fulton stopped him and pointed to the ceiling id advise you leave by that holeit lets out over the roof he said with a twisted smile no point in letting em know who youve been to see why thank you for your concern sir renzi said fulton grinned shall we say ive seen my share of creditors it was not until he was halfway back that the full implications of what had happened dawned on him in effect for all his efforts and personal danger renzi had nothing to show for it the best that could be said was that he had been right in his insight and that fulton had listened whether this might be turned to advantage was another matter now he was faced with a near insuperable problem he had slipped his shadow and for a certainty would now be trailed closely wherever he went with fulton under observation as well how would they get together to conclude anything even if the man was receptive at the grandime hotel he took care to reel in happily a foolish smile in place nodding to the silent men at the desk before he hauled himself up the stairs he flopped onto his bed and tried to recruit his thoughts it had all happened so quickly but at the same time he had achieved only a reconnaissance and worse he had lost the ability to continue any negotiations with fulton even if the man could be persuaded there was still the matter of an exit strategy an escape route that would keep them ahead of the inevitable hot pursuitthe french would spare nothing to stop them staring up at the dark ceiling he tried to bring together all the threads but always reached the same conclusion so near and so farhe could see no way forward on his own there was one last move open to him one that he had been warned was only to be made in extreme circumstances which did not include personal danger this was to make contact with the network of agents in paris the precious few who remained after the recent catastrophic failure of the plot against napoleon the next afternoon when haslip was taking time for himself renzi made his way to the broad open spaces of the place du carrousel this was where the plot to assassinate first consul bonaparte had so nearly succeeded two years before the breton giant cadoudal had barely escaped with his life to try again the following year renzi carefully pinned a revolutionary red white and blue cockade to his left arm and with his hat firmly under the right strolled through the gardens admiring the flowers in the pleasant sunshine he nodded to the ladies trying not to think of his deadly peril a covey of screaming children raced on to the grass with a scolding woman in vain pursuit vous là oui se tenir prêt les fleurs challenged a gendarme with a fierce moustache and redplumed bicorne venez ici he commanded gesturing papers he demanded when renzi came up one hand on his swordhilt the other outstretched renzi fought down the impulse to run and fumbled for his passport heart thudding passing promenaders gave them a wide berth oui monsieurles voici the gendarme examined it closely then looked up sharply the wolf howls only at the moon he stabbed his finger at the passport ththen it is silent renzi answered nervously it was the challenge and response and he was now in contact with a royalist agent what do you want aa delicate matter if you can arrange in some way a privy communication with a certain person when er as soon as possible very well he thrust the passport at renzi be sitting at the park bench over my shoulder at four do you understand renzi nodded the gendarme smiled unexpectedly bonne chance mon brave he said stepping back and folding his arms in dismissal in good time renzi was sitting on the bench as instructed at four there was no one and at a quarter past the hour a young mother insisted on occupying the other end while she dandled her baby on her knee in the sunshine cooing and clucking inviting him to admire the now squalling infant it was a clever ruse and within a few minutes renzi had been invited to impart the essence of the difficulty in return he received a businesslike solution a vase of flowers would later appear in his room if he placed it in the window it would indicate that a message for fulton was concealed under its base likewise fultons message for renzi might be found under the base should the vase appear again in the window at the other end there would be different arrangements how it was done was not his affair that night he wrote a short message in anonymous block capitals which simply explained how fultons new friend might be contacted and hoped that he would hear from him soon he placed the vase in the window and went to bed in the morning when he woke it was still there but when he returned from another morning of stupefying boredom at the prisonerofwar negotiating tables he found a different paper in the hollow base feverishly he tore it open the matter is not impossible it read in a beautifully neat and characterful hand what can you offer exultant renzi paced up and down while he considered in his bodybelt he held eight hundred pounds in gold intended for travel expenses and the like would this be enough to tempt fulton to leave immediately the form of the contract to be discussed in england the thought of quick acceptance followed by rapid departure from this fearful world of danger and deceit was intoxicating quickly he penned a reply emphasising immediate payment and rosily reviewing the prospects he had mentioned earlier for the rest of the day he was forced to attend a legal hearing and did not arrive back until latebut there was a reply renzi scanned it rapidly and his heart sank in lordly tones fulton was demanding no less than ten thousand pounds to leave france carefully he composed a reply it would not be possible to raise such an amount at short notice but the eight hundred would be more than sufficient to ensure a swift passage to england where all things would be possible his overriding objective was to ensure his freedom to negotiate at the highest level he chose when the response came it was longwinded hectoring and demanded as a condition to fultons considering any proposal an undertaking that the british government form a plenary committee within three weeks of his arrival to examine the scope not only of his submarine craft but of other inventions in return he would be able to offer the plans for an improved nautilus and his torpedoes to the admiralty for a hundred thousand pounds further written proof of the offer from the british at cabinet level would be necessary before he would contemplate acceptance or leaving france it was an impossibility the annual salary of a senior clerk for a thousand years the man must be mador was he whoever stalked the undersea realm would surely command the seas and it was plain that those who stood to lose the most were the english renzi slumped his first impulse was to promise anything at all as long as fulton left for england he was living on borrowed timeand the stakes could not have been higher but he knew he could not compromise his principles still further he sighed deeply and reached for his pen with the utmost regrets he admitted he was not in a position to bind the british government to the amount indicated however to keep faith with fulton he would with all dispatch open secret communications with whitehall to establish a basis for negotiation there was little more he could do now that he was passing the responsibility to a higher authorityand wearily he realised that this presented a grave problem in itself how the devil would he get messages of explosive content safely to england when he had no means to secure them trusting the agents to perform some kind of coding was asking too muchand apart from that they would then be privy to state secrets of the highest importance he had no cipher materials possession of such in any context was prima facie evidence of espionage yet if the communications were not enciphered he could not risk divulging vital and necessary details in any case to meet fultons demands he had to obtain a written undertaking at the highest level which must be secure he was going round in circles there must be a way renzi was by no means ignorant of secret codes after his experiences in jersey could he find a method from first principles to encrypt the message the gravest difficulty of all was that in virtually every case the key had to be known beforehand at the receiving end or it must be sent in clear by other meanswith catastrophic consequences if compromised despite everything renzi found himself drawn into the logical challenges of the dilemma after the intense boredom of the prisonerofwar negotiations the danger and frustration of dealing with fulton this bracing intellectual exercise was congenial and he bent his mind to the task any cipher whose key could be discovered was by definition unusable classical ciphers such as the famous caesar shift with no key but letter substitution were unsafecodebreaking had moved on in modern times the same applied to the transposition types and without prior arrangements more complex techniques would require a key or methodtype to be sent on before in clear a book cipher this had the advantage that the key was already in the possession of the receiverthe text of a preagreed book held by both a word in the message was specified as a precise location of that same word in the book the disadvantage was that not only was it essential for each to have precisely the same edition but it was laborious and the resulting encipherment could be large in size the bible had been used many times with its exact chapter and verse convenience but of course it would be the first that codebreakers tried there was another method the runningkey cipher this used a source book too but at individual character level from a given point the ongoing text was used as a continuous keystream to yield coded values against the message contents this was betterand if the books title was protected the resulting encipherment was near unbreakable so what volume was to be used known precisely by both parties the admiraltys own kings regulations or the articles of war but without them to hand he could not swear to accuracy and if it was to be some other book its name and edition had to be divulged first he was back where he had started he lay down and closed his eyes it was the separate transmission in clear of a key or decoding method that was the sticking point if he could only he sat bolt upright that was it the method the keytextand a castiron secure way of transmitting the key galvanised he set to work he would not be disturbedhe had uncovered some time ago that haslips concern to be left alone was on account of a certain woman and the french could not trespass on diplomatic territory snatching up paper and a pencil he began to set up his tabula recta the encoding matrix not needing to consult a book he was able to work swiftly and at a little after midnight he had the result carefully he burned his workings folded the papers as small as he could and sealed them tightly together he hesitated over the forwarding instructions but eventually settled on foreign office per smith paris it would find the right handler easily enough underneath in smaller lettering was the more important entry refer cdr thomas kydd hms teazer it was done kydd stalked into his cabin in a foul mood this was the third man flogged within the month for petty crimes unavoidably in full view of the shore and the spirit aboard was stagnating when would the damned timbers arrive for the repair he was keenly conscious of the fearful danger under which england lay and it went so much against his grain to lie in useless idleness and renziheaven knew what he was up to and would kydd ever find out restless he ventured on deck again a fine sight so many bluewater ships particularly the big indiaman to the southas massive as a lineofbattle ship with no doubt a freighting aboard worth a princes ransom and soon to venture out to the open ocean where dangers lurked in wait every day of her six months or more voyaging ashore he could pick out the deal hovellers on this fine summers day there was nothing to occupy them except the taking out of fresh provisions passengers telegraphs in a taking hallum offered behind him trying to make conversation the shutter atop a bluff tower in the kings naval yard was indeed busy clacking away furiously the chain of signal stations stretched all the way to london and the admiralty in a direct line idly kydd wondered what it was signalling never used for routine messages it was how the first lord of the admiralty through his senior staff was able to reach out and deploy the chess pieces that were his fleets to counter enemy threats incredibly this signal would be here in the commanderinchiefs hands some fifteen minutes or so after it was sent from london he resumed pacing it was no use worrying about his timber which would come in its own good time he must contain his impatience and be ready to throw teazer into the fray the instant she was whole once more boat approaching sir oddly the vessel had been launched from the kings naval yard instead of the flagship and with only a single officer in the sternsheets kydd stayed on deck and watched it hook on the officer came on board commander kydd sir he asked respectfully with more than a hint of curiosity it is then sir i have a message from the admiral you are to hold yourself in readiness at his office immediately for a particular service that he will speak to you aboutin person er i know nothing further very well admiral keith was short almost to the point of rudeness kydd i have just received a signal from the admiralty concerning you that greatly disturbs me sir the admiralty it asksno damn it demands that you be taken out of your ship and made ready to receive a parcel o rogues from the aliens office under circumstances of the utmost secrecy now sirthis is intolerable i will not be kept in ignorance you will tell me what is afoot this instant sir kydd swallowed sir ii cannot the aliens office are you asking me to accept that aa junior commander is to be made privy to matters considered too sensitive for a senior admiral have you been politicking sir i wont stand for it in a serving captain of mine mr kydd no not for one minute nno sir and i intend to be present when those jackanapes arrive of course sir most irregular yes sir it is youll wait here until sent for keith rumbled irritably you may not leave on any account aye aye sir sitting alone in the little side office kydd waited apprehensively late in the afternoon he heard a commotion in the outer office raised voices scraped chairs and hurrying footsteps moments later two traveldusty men strode in closely followed by a redfaced keith this is insupportable i will not have it this officer is under my command and sir we take our instructions from the foreign secretary directly this being as grave a matter as any that has faced this kingdom the taller individual sniffed you have a telegraph sir if you have any doubts he waited pointedly until the admiral had left them then addressed kydd from this point on everything that is said shall be at the highest possible level of secrecy do you understand me i know my duty sir very well he opened his dispatch case and extracted a small packet the seal broken what do you understand by this kydd took it and went cold why this is from my ships clerk and good friend where is he that will be of no concern to you can you say any more er unless i might read the contents no sir you may not he said taking it back please answer me directly was there any arrangement between you touching on the transmission of privileged information none hes in aa difficulty of sorts is he kydd said uneasily the two exchanged looks he is performing a mission of the utmost importance that is proving unfortunate in its complexity the taller man said carefully you may know that what you hold is a form of communication that is strongly ciphered we do not possess the key however and believe that his referring to yourself implies it may be found by reference only to you kydd was dumbfounded weve never discussed anything in the character of spyingnothing renzi wholly detests it you may believe then this leaves us in a difficult position indeed the man continued heavily if you know of nothing he has said no paper to keep guarded no locked cabinet i do not nothing whatsoever that may lead us to a key tell me this key how would i know it the other man broke in his dry voice calm mr kydd the practice of privy communications is a black art but has a number of inviolable axioms one of which is that the receiver must be in possession of the same key that was used to encode the message without which he is helpless it is the usual practice to establish a key beforehand else we shall be obliged to transmit the key by other means a most unsatisfactory and hazardous proceeding in this particular case we have no prior arrangement and the key not being onpassed therefore must exist here and be alluded to the only clue we have is what you see before you your name has been invoked and that is all a masterly stroke which is its own guarantee of security but regrettably leaves us in a quandary as to its appearance well a key can be of many formsan arithmetical formula a grid of nonsense a passage in a book and in fact anythingbut without it kydd realised that the men would not have acted as they had unless the matter was vitally important and renzi would not have given his name unless he himself was the key show me the message he demanded reluctantly it was handed over kydd examined it minutely it was in his friends hand but consisted of lines upon lines of meaningless letters in groups of five and covered several pages a few mistakes were blotted out and there were one or two crossedout sequences in the margin but that was all it was not signed and the beginning was only a bare date on one side with what looked like a doodle on the other no doubt it had occupied lonely hours of danger for renzi he looked at the little picture it was a stylised open book and a fat exclamation mark next to it as though in exasperation at the tedium of the task was this a signor a pointer of some kind a clue then he had it why i think i know what it is a passage from a book you said will a poem do at all yes damn it the sudden tension in the room made kydd think better of a grand gesture and he contented himself with the plain facts by this little picture renzi is reminding me of a poem hes got fastened to the bulkhead in his cabin above his desk taut hand with words is nicholas what poem the taller man ground oh it beginslet me see up up my friend and quit your books or surely youll grow double up up my friend and clear your looks why all this toil and trouble kydd tried to recall what went next but failed i cant remember the rest go out to your ship and get the doggerel now i dont see any reason why i should kydd replied quietly but at the mans reddening face he relented we can find it at the bookseller just along by beach street here its by his friend wordsworth whom he much admires should you get an edition youll no doubt find the poem in it the proprietor was taken aback when three men burst into his shop demanding urgently that precise volume of wordsworth but hurriedly obliged there was the poem the tables turned at the office the table was swiftly cleared and paper produced the taller yielded to the other who drew up his chair sharpened his pencil and opened the book priceless he chuckled and read books tis a dull and endless strife come hear the woodland linnet how sweet his music on my life theres more of wisdom in it damn you sir get on with it patiently a tabula recta for the tableau was constructed and the ciphertext applied in a short time the man raised his head and with a satisfied smile said quietly gentlemen we have a solution renzi returned to his rooms weary and depressed it had been weeks of waiting and no replyand the worst of it was that fulton had disappeared renzi had sent him a short message saying that london had been contacted on his behalf but it had been returned unopened with the terse notation not at this address and no further clue it had been maddeningly frustrating was fulton taken by the authorities had he quit the field entirely returned to america or was he in possession of a fine new contract from the french that now saw him in some palatial lodging and for ever out of reach as he flopped into his chair he noticed the vase back in the window nervously he lifted itbut there was no message then he saw a copy of that mornings moniteur tossed carelessly to one side and deep within it he found a substantial packet the superscription was in an unknown hand and unusually the packet was secured with sailmakers twine instead of the usual ribbon inside there were two parts both ciphered one was short no more than a few sentences renzi guessed the other was boldly inscribed even if in coded groups and on stiff expensive vellum there was no key no little drawing or textual hint however he guessed immediately the significance of the unusual fastening for that would surely be age twine thy brows with fresh spring flowers and call a train of laughing hours he took the vellum first a prominent indicating the keystream was to start with it and continue to the other he set out his matrix soon finding himself correct in his assumption the two pages were swiftly deciphered and then he sat back satisfied it had told him two things the first was that kydd knowing his penchant for memorising poetry had correctly divined his key the next was that whitehall had accepted his difficult situation and taken positive steps to help him for this was in effect a counteroffer from the foreign secretary of great britain himself renzi could prove it by decoding the vellum in front of fulton the offer was interesting but would it be sufficient he turned his attention to the shorter message and applied himself this was a very different documentand renzi was shocked to the core it was terse and to the point if fulton did not accept the offer he was to be killed mechanically he burned his workings and stirred the ash carefully all he had feared was coming to pass he was now being expected to perform the ultimate act of dishonour in this whole wretched business that of mercilessly ending the life of an unsuspecting other could he do it he knew he must this was the transcendent logical outworking of what he had undertaken to do the means silent but surea blade he had none but a quick foray produced a kitchen knife thinbladed but effective the point honed to a wicked sharpness there was of course the chance that he would never use it for where was fulton now the prisonerofwar talks dragged on with no sign of an agreement even though britain held some four times as many prisoners as the french and was prepared to exchange at the rate of many for one the unspoken obstacle was the reality that trained seamen were too valuable to return to duty in a navy that was so successful there was every probability now that there would be no hope left to the wretches in bitche and verdun utterly depressed by the futility of the situation renzi was unprepared for what met him when he reached his room after another week of tedium as he entered he was confronted by a grinning fulton rising from a chair hail to you smith he declaimed dramatically how goeth it recovering himself renzi said what the devil are you doing here youre being followed you fool anger flooded over him at the careless attitude and jocular tone then he became alarmed was this part of a french trap no im not trailed fulton said lazily stretching im only this day back in paris and nobody knows im here er have you by chance heard anything from london where have you been all this time may i ask oh amsterdam thought id like to see the canalsvery interesting to me renzi bit off a retort and forced himself to be calm if the french wanted to catch them together they would probably have made their move by now well im pleased to tell you that ive been in contact with englandand at the highest level he moved to the other chair and smiled winningly it seems that youve earned the attention of no less than lord hawkesbury the foreign secretary of great britain in fact i have a communication from him addressed to you oh fulton said renzi drew a deep breath indeed so he went to a picture on the wall and felt behind it detached the packet and opened it here he handed it over letting fulton feel the quality of the paper its in code naturally for your protection should the french discover you are treating with the english renzi took it back and smoothed it however i shall now decipher it before you as your assurance of its authenticity dont trouble yourself if youre fooling me well find out soon enough just tell me what hes got to say renzis stomach contracted it was the last throw of the dice well in it the foreign secretary welcomes your interest and notes the terms you are asking including the forming of a plenary committee and er your onehundredthousandpound fee im happy to say he sees no insuperable bar to any of your provisions go on there was no reading anything in fultons face of course he trusts you will understand that there can be no question of payments until your inventions have been properly examined and tested in england fulton wheeled about thats it no advances no promises i do assure you sir that should you trust us with your naval secrets then the government will treat you with the utmost liberality and generosity in strict accordance with the importance of your inventions and thats all at the moment it is fulton sauntered over to the window and looked out over the rooftops are you seriously suggesting i pack my bags and leave on the strength of that he asked continuing to gaze out dread stole over renzi fulton was not going to accept the offer and therefore he was going to walk off for ever he had his grim instructions fulton was facing away unsuspicious and it was not in public would a protest that he had had no idea fulton was any one but a common intruder fool the french long enough to buy him time to get away he had so little time to think rising silently he tiptoed over to the bureau and eased open the drawer the knife glittered up at him with it he would end the life of one whose mind had dreamed of voyaging with neptune and had so brilliantly succeeded renzi reached for it but at that instant he became aware that fulton had swung around the man cleared his throat and said abruptly yes i will he moved back across the room i trust you well go back to england together renzi went rigid then his hand moved to the decanter a drink then mr fulton he said huskily and splashed cognac into two glasses to brighter times hed done it against all the probabilities he had brought it off then despair flooded him how were they to flee across france ahead of vengeful pursuers when he had only the sketchiest plan prepared when they were seen together the conclusion would be obvious the solution when it came was an anticlimax renzi would find an excuse to return to england alone using his diplomatic passport at the last minute fulton would arrive at calais to join the cartel ship and they would leave together fultons papers from the ministry gave him access to all the northern ports and in any case as a neutral he could not be prevented from leaving renzi left it until the last possible moment the tedious carriage ride with another petulant young lieutenant had been a trialbut finally rising above the low customs building ahead he saw the upper yards of the cartel ship his heart beat faster for it would mean the end to the nightmare he sat outside a nearby tavern in the warm sunshine where he was able to view the comings and goings into the building and as time wore on for the evening sailing he grew more and more anxious there was no sign of fulton it was impossible that he should return without him but who was to say that fulton had not arrived early and was at this minute in his cabin or that word had been sent from paris to detain him they had let him alone to take his last fill of france but when he passed through the gates and was processed aboard there would be no turning back in an agony of indecision renzi waited until just two hours before departure then he rose paid the tavernkeeper and walked slowly to the hall there he handed in his passport and other papers which were notated and after guarded pleasantries he was escorted to his ship he mounted the gangway and stopped to breathe in the familiar tang of tar timber and shipboard odours a poignant moment after his recent travails nodding civilly to the dour captain he enquired casually if any americans were on board it seemed there were not and none expected it was hard to take and with a sinking heart renzi watched the lines singled up the capstan bars shipped for warping out two hours had become one in despair he allowed himself to be shepherded below with the other passengers in preparation for the awkward manoeuvre out into the stream hearing the clunks and slithers of ropehandling above the businesslike squeals of the boatswains calls and sharp orders then came the shuddering creaks as the hull took up after the lines were thrown off it was all over they were on their way out as the first dip and heave of the sea took the vessel renzi realised they were clearing calais roads shortly afterwards passengers were allowed on deck into a soft violet dusk the excited chatter of the others depressed him and he wandered forward to where the jib sheets were being hardened in the lines were belayed the seamen dispersed and then he became aware of another standing in the shadow of a staysail the man moved towards him youwhere thought id come aboard at the last minute just in case fulton said casually i didnt think as you would englishman ill have you know that an american is accounted a welcome guest in france as would any true republican which means i can come and go as i please renzi swallowed his anger just so now you are a guest of the king he regretted the words immediately but it was too late we won a war sos not to bend a knee to a kingand im not about to start now something made renzi answer quickly then why pray do you feel able to stand with us now you dont see it do you i beg your pardon as i said before my inventions are for mankindat one stroke to annihilate the present system of marine war by making it impossible for a navy bent on aggression to venture forth on the high seas by this we create a guarantee of the liberty of the seas for all men and where there is free trade there we will find the true sovereignty of the people but once the people have their emancipation they will throw off the yokes of oppressionyour monarchs politicians and other parasites with their standing armiesand at last stand free whoever makes my machines possible is of no account so long as they are created renzi paused some would say that the submarine boat is a barbaric weapon that pits innocent seamen against a foe that can never be seen fultons face shadowed that may be true but for the greater good it must be suffered i have started a revolution in the minds of engineers that cannot now be stopped and i must go forward to face my destiny sir chapter are we all assembled then well begin although only in his forties the prime minister the younger william pitt wore on his face the effect of years spent leading england in the long wars against the french this capable prime minister had resigned earlier on a matter of conscience but the lacklustre administration that had replaced his had stumbled on from an illadvised peace treaty through a hasty declaration of war to the current crisis now matters appeared to be reaching their climax but that did little to lift the mortal weariness that lay so heavily on him the others in the cabinet room regarded him with concern sir i feel i must express my profound sense of deliverance in seeing you once more in the chair that so rightfully belongs to you at the helm of state in these parlous times im sure i speak for us all when i say thank you lord harrowby pitt said to the new foreign secretary but business presses he looked meaningfully at the secretary of war my lord camden our confidential agent in the matter of the french plunging boat has just returned from france i have to tell you he confirms the reports concerning its effectiveness as only too true sir there was a general stir about the table go on it seems it is no mere philosophic curiosity before napoleon and his admirals in brest the inventor personally stalked a vessel from beneath the sea and exploded it to pieces in front of their eyes melville the first lord of the admiralty leaned forward sir if this device is ever perfected we stand under a nearinsuperable threat our navy being unsafe even in its own harbours renders our entire strategic situation questionable i cannot answer to the consequences it may not come to that pass sir lord camden said quietly this agent was successful in seducing the inventor from the french and at this moment he is in england awaiting our pleasure ah yes foreign secretary i have to bring to your attention gentlemen that my predecessor was in communications of a clandestine nature with this inventor in france as a condition of his quitting the country certain demands were made and agreed to that we are morally obliged to accept and these are among others that a committee be immediately convened to examine his plans for a greatly improved submarine boat to be constructed and deployed by us with a form of assistance from the royal dockyards and the navy to this end this seems reasonable enough pitt replied but ill wager theres somewhere a price in gold being asked a considerable sum was mentioned but this is contingent upon his satisfying the committee in the particulars then i see we have a way forward ask the gentleman concerned to prepare his plans for the craft which he will then present in due course this will satisfy the immediate problem er which is that prime minister that while he is working for us he is not for the french pitt said and we buy ourselves time to consider our position im not altogether convinced that this is something we a maritime nation of the first rank should necessarily be involved with he went on well give him his chance see what he comes up with well have a strong committeephilosophers scientificals engineers of note and all of some eminenceto judge his work then well decide what to do agreed at the polite murmuring he declared i shall ask the treasury to open a disbursement account against my discretionary funding for now this to include some form of emolument say a monthly subsistence draw and desire the navy board to afford him access to the dockyards and so forth oh and hes to have a place of work that shall be securewe cant discount that the french will seek to interfere with our new submarine navigator and to keep him under eye melville added drily of course dover castle springs to mind being convenient should he wish to try his toys on mr bonapartes flotilla there is one more consideration prime minister harrowby said smoothly it seems that mr francisas he wishes to be knownis rather in the nature of an american with decided republican views and er somewhat novel not to say whimsical ideas on marine war just so foreign secretary pitt reached wearily for the decanter of port ill bear it in mind as well he will be needing a form of regular liaison with the navy in an operational sense dont want him getting our admirals huffy a trials vessel too doverthats keiths bailiwick desire him to make a manowar and crew available for both purposes not too big yes prime minister and well have to find a commander who knows americans he said sourly shall we move on it had been more than a month but now teazer was complete kydd looked up from his journal as the door to his cabin opened it was renzi reporting for duty captain he said with a tired smile good god nicholas you look dreadful sit down dear fellow tysoe a hot negus on the instant for mr renzi pay no mind to me tom imits that im out of sorts is all renzi took the armchair and sank into it turning his face to catch the sun streaming in through teazers stern windows kydd rose so good t see you again even if a mort weathertorn he contemplated renzi then continued softly i dont wish t pry but a rather disagreeable episode i would much rather forget renzi said distantly then added but it was kind in you to remember the wordsworth the commanderinchief was not amused when i was hauled out of my ship by some rum coves from whitehall to answer some strange enough questions er they didnt say what it was all about nor should they im sworn to mortal secrecy still else i should tell you all it was a singular enough experience perhaps later he closed his eyes drained and it has put you to some measure o grief i fear renzi opened one eye it will pass should i be granted the sublimity of a space of peace and quietand a good book kydd knew renzi well enough to be disturbed by his manner what was it that he had endured more than a physical trial certainly for he was like a man returned from the dead that youll get nicholas he said warmly for his sins young calloway has been taking care o the ships booksif you find em out o kilter let me know kydd cleared his throat renzis tiny quarters in an operational shipofwar were not what was wanted to heal him after his nameless ordeal weve lately been with the downs inshore forces another having taken our place in the flying squadron so our days are not so exciting he said as breezily as he could but i do think youll find youll need more in the way of a constitutional he paused nicholas there is a favour id ask of you of course i want you to go to bath for the waters for as long as you neednot forgetting to hoist in some reading while youre there of course renzi sighed too tired to protest ithat is it is well taken and i confess im in sore need of respite i do believe ill take up your handsome offer dear brother the next morning kydd saw his friend safely off in the coach they had been through so much together and he was grateful he had the means to do this for him then his mind returned to the war sober estimates of the size of the invasion flotilla were now nearer two thousand than one and the flying squadron had taken a recent mauling that had left two shattered wrecks on the dunes near calais fortunately the battleships of the french fleet had not ventured from port but this was widely held to be their admiral husbanding his forces until such time as they would be called on to lock in mortal combat with the british at the grand climax of the invasion the threat could not have been greater but kydd and teazer were kept back on the shores of england in the second tier of defences and he felt the frustration acutely at last the summons came a peremptory order to report to the commanderinchief for redeployment keith kept him waiting for twenty minutes then called him in mr kydd youre of this hour relieved of duty in these inshore waters why should the commanderinchief himself tell him that he was to resume in a flying squadron the usual order pack would normally suffice kydd felt uneasy tell me does the record speak true while you were on the north american station you were sent ashore in the united states to resolve some dispute that ended well enough then spent a little time at sea in their new navy i did sir so therefore it would be true to say that you know americans well sir i capital you and your sloop are stood down from active duty on this station my condolences on the loss of opportunity for distinction but we all have our cross to bear sir may i know since you have shown yourself inclined to furtive intrigue i have given you over to the foreign office in their service at kydds evident shock keith gave a cold smile dont imagine youll be out on some wild adventure i gather its to be acting as dogsbody to some american charlatan inventor youll remain in my command mr kyddas inspector of fencibles surely not the sea fenciblesa homedefence force of dabblers and seamen past their prime at one stage the doughty earl st vincent first lord of the admiralty had muttered dismissively the sea fencibles are there only to calm the fears of old ladies both within and without parliament what had he done as a fighting seaman that he should be relegated to this kydd bit his lip in frustration aye aye sir he said bleakly keith waved his hand in dismissal flags will tell you the rest how things had changed from service in the very front line of the war at sea to nursemaid of wellmeaning amateurs and whoever the american was the flaglieutenant was unable to add much sympathetically he explained that the commanderinchief had received his orders from a higher level and had complied with kydd the unlucky choice it was apparently a discreet affair and while his line of responsibility lay with whitehall his appointment as inspector of fencibles was to give him cover and keep him administratively within keiths command a gentleman from london was however in attendance to explain he was at pains to make clear the contractual arrangements between his majestys government and the american a mr fulton who also went by the name of francis which in the main appeared to be the production of plans for a contrivance of his inventing to be scrutinised in due course by a learned committee kydds role was to act as intermediary between the inventor and the navy providing assistance of a practical nature to include advice concerning operational procedures and administrative support at all levels this latter was of particular importance it seemed bearing as it did on weighty matters including the proper form of indenting for dockyard stores requested by mr fulton and lines of responsibility back to mr hammond undersecretary of state with responsibility for the project this contrivance the functionary was not certain leaving it up to kydd to pursue details as he wished with the contractor all costs must be fairly accounted for and rendered in the proper form and a journal to be kept voice lowered the man went on to inform kydd that the contract being of a confidential nature all elements pertaining should be kept from public view security for the principal of the contract and his workings would not be his responsibility however except in so far as unforeseen events dictated francis not fulton was the name on the contract he was a gentleman of singular views and would need sensitive handling work space was being provided in dover castle any sea trials would probably take place locally and other than that well kydd was expected to work closely and supportively with the man provided always that the interests and prerogatives of the crown were upheld numb with rage kydd made his way back to his ship a sloopofwar of the first rank and a commander royal navy at the beck and call of some moneygrubbing projectorit was infamous england needed every sailofwar to face napoleon he swallowed his bitterness mr hallum we have new orders sir the mans grey subservience irritated kydd we weigh within the hour for doverand strike the blue ensign he snapped sstrike god damn it kydd roared take it down i said hoist a red un in its place he went on grimly as of now were an unattached private ship so we fly a red hands t turn to unmoor ship mr hallum it would be remarked all over the anchorage hms teazer was standing down from the fight during the short trip south to dover kydd brooded he had no choice other than to do his duty but all his warrior instincts were to face the enemy what he had heard at the admiralty had shaken him and to be absent from the field in his countrys time of trial was almost too much to bear he had never been to dover the harbour to the west of the town was small and had no naval presence to speak of but brazenly atop the towering white cliffs was the mightiest fortress in the south dover castle the town nestled snugly in a fold of the white cliffs after he had taken one look at the roads winding up the steep hills kydd hired a carriage to take him to the castle despite his savage mood he was impressed by the sight of it the giant central keep within the near half a mile of protecting ramparts and bastions spoke of defiance and ageold puissance in a world gone mad it had been a symbol of tenacity looking out to englands enemies for nearly eight centuries and yet again had come to be a major element in the forward defence of the kingdom entering through the constables gate his spirits rose the red coats of soldiers everywhere others in fatigues with pickaxes and carts more drilling at their heavy cannon showed it to be an active fortress of a truly majestic size feeling conspicuous in his naval uniform among all the soldiers kydd was marched by a genial sergeant inside the walls and his pass was verified then an officer was produced who knew of the castles distinguished guest it was not to the towering keep that he was taken instead they walked seaward over the grassy slopes of the hill and approached the edge of the cliff then unexpectedly it was an abrupt descent into the bowels of the earth and a dark world of medieval tunnels passages and steps here there were subterranean barrack rooms kitchens work places storerooms sleeping quarters and guard rooms then the blessed sight of sunlightnot above but at the end of casemates long fortified chambers much as kydd had known in gibraltar but this time rather than a view across a dusty plain into spain he found himself looking out from a height over the sparkling sea towards the centre of the complex of casemates the officer stopped youll find your mr francis in there he said pointing to one kydd entered the long cavity and made his way towards a figure arranging desk and drawers at the end mr francis the man turned abruptly whore you it was odd to hear the american twang he had last encountered in connecticut in such surroundings commander kydd royal navy and youre to be my keeper fulton grunted and went back to his sorting the desk was well sited for detailed work the sunlight streaming in through the iron grille at the end of the casemate not so sir kydd said my orders are to furnish you with such assistance as the navy can provide and the services of my ship the brigsloop teazer fulton paused why thats right handsome of their lordships he said i guess for passage trials that sort of thing as will promote the success of your work to be a victim a what kydd said irritably if im to be creating a submarine boat it will need a victim to practise upon wouldnt you say kydd stopped a submarine boat you have no idea do you your government is paying me thousands for a plunging boat and they dont see fit to tell their man he shook his head mr francis i was hauled off my ship in the middle of a war to be told im to assist a private contractor make a hill of money not what he has to do to earn it fulton waited for the outburst to subside then leaned towards kydd if i tell you how your mr boney will be stopped in his tracks by this one deviceagainst which there is no defencewill that be enough for you the submarine kydd said sarcastically if youre going to tell me now that youre the only one in the world can design it ive built such a one and ive used itagainst the british navy fultons cold certainty was disconcerting go on in a short time kydd had the sense of it a submarine craft that was able to navigate silently under the waves completely out of the sight and knowledge of men until it had delivered its deathblow and against which there could truly be no defence what gun could pierce to the oceans depths as fulton revealed more kydd fought off the unreality that was closing in on him this was more than yet another crazy idea it was a new reality that threatened the world of ships and the sea that was at the centre of his life it promised to render useless the great fleets that were the bulwark of britains defences and and he needed time to think to make sense of what he had just heard kydd took to his cabin telling hallum and tysoe that he was not to be disturbed and let his thoughts run free should he even be party to such a devilish scheme if he refused the duty there would quickly be another found and in any case the question hinged on deeper considerations it was barbaric and not to be contemplated by any gentlemanbut was it morally wrong probably but did that mean it should be immediately discarded by any civilised country that was the nub if all nations refused such weapons the answer was yes but if this were so then any weaker that ignored the pact might easily prevail over a stronger by their introduction thus logically all should acquire them to preserve the balance it was a melancholy but irrefutable fact the genie was now out of the bottle and could not be put back what was invented could not be uninvented the future of war at sea therefore would now be one of submarines and sudden death of the defenceless there was however one question that to kydd put all others aside was this going to be the means to get at the invasion flotilla skulking in harbour and put to an end the mortal threat that hung over england once and for all if it was then damn it he would give it all he had chapter kydd filed in and sat next to fulton others took position around them and all rose when the chairman george hammond undersecretary of state for the foreign office entered and took the head of the table thank you gentleman and especially you er mr francis for affording us your valuable time he shuffled some papers then looked up sharply the purpose of this meetingthis informal meetingi should remind you is to discover how the committee for the examination of the submarine boat be most effectively constituted so as to give a true and fair view of its prospects in service a large man next to him gave an illtempered harrumph which was ignored i shall introduce you all this is mr jackson an engineer of some repute major wardle for the ordnance board captain gresham for the royal navy the large man nodded and glared around the table and of course mr francis himself hammond looked enquiringly at kydd but before he could say anything fulton said firmly mr kydd of the navy whos my keeper and liaison man if needs be hell be advising methats so isnt it commander er yes in accordance with mr franciss conditions in coming to england im to assist in any way i can to facilitate his work by way of explaining our operational practices and arranging procedural matters on his request very well hammond said crisply to business mr pitt strongly believes that the importance of this project demands that only men of the highest eminence need be asked to sit on this committee therefore i ask that you do consider deeply your separate professions as to who might best be approached he paused for instance the name of sir joseph banks has been mentioned as chairman kydd was impressed the wellborn naturalist who had sailed with cook to the south seas president of the royal society and adviser to governments and kingsthis was eminence indeed hammond continued mr jackson might we start with yourself who in the practice of engineering would you consider in this regard the pleasantfaced man appeared perplexed as im not well acquainted with what mr francis proposes to do im at a stand sir if its shipbuilding no sir it is not fulton said energetically this is a new departure in the marine arts as such it damn it all for a lunatic charade captain gresham will someone please explain to me why on earth were contemplating creeping about under the sea in these contraptions like some verminous highwayman in the woods when weve got the mightiest and best navy the worlds ever seen because the prime minister desires we shall hammond retorted mr jackson please continue oh yes i would think that let me answer our salty son of the briny fulton broke in abruptly were contemplating a submarine because not even all your kings horses and all your kings men can defend a battleship against even one of these if ever you stopped to think mr francis i have to rule you out of order im afraid hammond came in youre here in an advisory capacity and may only address the meeting when called upon to answer a particular technical question mr jackson as i was saying youd be well served by a dockyard engineer theyre a canny breed quite at home with curious sea machines im thinking of mr benthamthats samuel not his brother and in course mr rennie thank you sir major wardle who in the view of the ordnance board would be suitable who has not heard of thomas blomefield or the younger william congreve there is a gratifying superfluity of persons of an ordnance persuasion sir ready to do their duty indeed i should perhaps at this stage make mention that mr henry cavendish has indicated his willingness to allow us the benefit of his observations in the scientifical line cavendish gresham asked his neighbour rum covefactitious airs the electric fluid mr lavoisiers hydrogen the man replied fulton leaned back restlessly these philosophical gents are all very well mr chair but your most significant man will be your seaman who knows the sea a whole navy to choose from sirwho will it be hear hear rumbled gresham our american friend and i are at last in agreement we need one of weighty experience knows the crackpot from the plain lunatic quite so not an admiral as is set in his ways been at sea moren a dogwatch smelled a mort of powdersmoke rather similar in fact to yourself sir if you insist mr chairman gresham said with oily satisfaction it will be considered in due course hammond said and turned to fulton mr francis this committee is convened upon your request do you have any objection to the names mentioned as having the competence to adjudge your work only one fulton said looking pointedly at gresham that is noted the names sir will be put forward to the prime ministers office and selection made you will be informed of course thank you gentlemen with a shuffling of feet the meeting adjourned in the hubbub following jackson crossed to speak to fulton but gresham stopped kydd a junior commander is it then mr kydd i do hope youve wits enough to see through this crafty rogue the navy doesnt want his kind about when weve got more pressing engagements if you see what i mean i have m duty sir and thats to give mr francis a clear hawse in the matter of designing a submarine boat kydd said pointedly dont take that tone with me sir you have your duty and its to the service not to some jumpedup yankee projector whos got ideas as will bring about the ruination of the profession the navy expects you to stand by its traditions with courage and rightthinking not go chasing after harebrained schemes that mr kydd fulton called loudly across the room i find im hardpressed and must leaveif youre ready at all in the street outside he pulled on his gloves savagely and jammed on his hat god save you from all his tribe he said bitterly else youll be aseeing mr bonaparte marching down this very street before long the committees not yet selected mr fulton it might be hes not on it he will be lets wait and see no we wonti dont like waiting i must get to work a few days later kydd returned to the casemate this time taking in more of the details halfway up a sheer cliff its slatted wooden decking was probably to guard against the damp and mould of the vast chalk cavern the only entry apart from the one he had used which was through an army barracks was a small exit to the open air barred with a grille it was perfectly chosen for the purpose of securing fulton and his plans from the outside worldor acting as his prison fulton beckoned him in he was trying to heave round his desk and kydd hastened to take the other end manhandling it into place as close as possible to the light and air streaming through the grille it will serve fulton panted ive worked in far worse and times not on my side it was beginning to shape up the drawing desk across the mouth of the casemate shelves down each side and stowages resembling ships seachests in strategic locations this was where the war at sea was going to be changed utterly fulton glanced at kydd and seemed to come to a decision do you desire to see how a submarine is constructed sir i do rummaging in his chests fulton came up with a clutch of long papers which he smoothed out on the desk hmmthese are construction details for the workmen each to his own and never the whole to be comprehended by one man then he took out a smaller drawing and spread it in front of kydd but with this you may see my nautilus in all her glory kydd leaned over intently his first view of what lay in the future for the world and which promised to save england from napoleon bonaparte or plunge the realm of the mariner into unthinkable undersea warfare for ever before him was a sectioned craft as unlike a ship as it was possible to be long and sinister tubular with a conical bow and small protruding dome it seemed to be filled with cranks and wheels and above it like a giant bats wing an apparatus of rigging theres no waterline marking on the plan kydd said searching for something to say then cursed himself as he remembered that for a submersible waterlines had no meaning on the surface shes nearly awash only this little tower for conning the ship to be seen ifif shes made of wood wont she just float her hull is of ellipsoid section copper sheeting over iron frames but a fair question i reserve space in the keel for ballast and as she progresses under the sea a crewman drives a horizontal rudder of sorts to send her deeper while two more turn the cranks which operate this fourbladed propelling paddle here and this thats a window into the deepi can see the minute hand on my watch at twentyfive feet fulton said proudly kydd tried to visualise what it must be to exist in the gloom and stench far beneath the waves the immensity of the sea pressing in the knowledge of the coming detonation wreckage torn bodies is itwhat is it like er tolerable tolerable fulton said absently i find it takes but two minutes only to unrig for diving and when deep i navigate by compass in the usual way even in the open sea when its a damn relief to get down to the peace of the abyss where theres no hurry and rush of the waves ccan you see mermaids and such sailors set great store on such things kydd said his eyes widening none seen by meits naught but dull green down there it goes on for ever as youd never conceive fulton said black rocks looming up of a suddengives you the frights to see em close to like that kydd struggled for words as he grappled with the images er do you not fear it when your air is er used up as to that carbonic acid and lime has been promoted but i find a trusty copper globe of air as ive prepared under pressure answers better just tap off what we need four hours and twenty on the seabed with myself and three crew and it was boredom that drove us up in the end soso this is your nautilus as as i constructed trialled before napoleon bonaparte himself and used to blow to flinders a brig before the eyes of all his admirals he said grimly and may i ask where she lies now in pieces sold for scrap value dont worry ive left nothing behind you english have no fear he can make another he slapped the drawings together again right now ive work to do a seagoing nautilus with doublesized crew provisioned for a patrol of three weeks at a time nine torpedoes thisll make em sit up it was a fearful and wondrous creation but kydd was damned if hed show how awestruck he was well then shall i leave you to it mr francis or is there anything you need no i crave to be left alone for a space sketch out some thoughts ill be sure to let you know a caustic letter arrived from keith suggesting that as an inspector of sea fenciblesalbeit not a regularbuilt oneperhaps it was time kydd earned his keep as a sea officer of some experience possibly an active tour of the lessfrequented posts a revealing report to follow it was not a formal order but for all that a call to dutyand despite his feelings about the fencibles kydd welcomed the chance to do something seamanlike something he could understand while fulton worked on his plans he spread out the operational chart of the south on it were marked the defences including all those manned by the sea fenciblesharbour batteries inshore gunboats signal stations and all his for the rousing hed make sure theyd hear of him and teazer on the coast where to begin he could not stray too far from fulton in dover but a days sail was half the south coast and even round north foreland if the wind was kind and the southeast was both the closest to france and the most exposed to invasion perhaps here hard by the notorious smugglers haunt of romney marsh a small coast signal station on the flat lonely shingle promontory of dungeness little expecting visitors hms teazer eased inshore off dymchurch and hove to while her gig was put in the water and stroked briskly ashore curious onlookers were puzzled that when the sloop sailed away two of her company were left there they wore plain clothing so there was nothing to alarm the sleepy little village and kydd with midshipman calloway found no difficulty in hiring horses soon they were clopping along the road between the marsh and the sea but instead of following it as it curved inland to snargate they struck out on a poor track across the stark bleakness of the promontory for several miles they crossed the flat landscape not a rise not a tree intruding until they came to the tiny settlement of lydd in its centre then they followed a barely visible path through the salt marsh and shingle out to a distant solitary hut at the very tip of the promontory their approach from inland was covered by the ceaseless muffled roar of the sea and they had time to note the old ships topmast with its extended staff and gaff to suspend signal hoists a good eighty feet above the hut was in rough wood finished in tar and ochre with a liberal sanddash smoke swirled from a makeshift chimney and kydd handed the reins to calloway while he stepped over a tiny plot of greens at his knock the weathered wooden door creaked open and an old man in carpet slippers appeared with a steaming mug looking at kydd in astonishment why gennelmen what can i do fr you he wheezed from within the hut a stronger voice called irritably who th devils out at this hour george kydd held his temper and said levelly commander kydd inspector of sea fencibles come t visit we aint heard nothing o no inspection came the voice from inside bid the bugger begone thats enough kydd barked fetch your lieutenant he ordered the old man paused then drew himself up with pathetic dignity i am he sir kydd pushed past him contemptuously into the hut a pot simmered over a smoky fire in the corner and there were two rooms made snug with rickety furniture a table stood across the single window looking out to sea a wellworn telescope in brackets above it from the other room two resentful seamen appeared one in underclothes the other kydd demanded there should have been three manning the hut as hes got his head down aint he one said truculently wheeling on the lieutenant kydd ordered your log if y please the man shuffled over to the table and found the book but did not offer it kydd strode across and took it for himself if it was not in order he would see the man dismissed instantly for crass incompetence these old officers might be long retired from worthy service at sea but it was vital to the country that ceaseless vigilance was maintained when every hour could see an invasion fleet lift menacingly above the horizon he flicked the pages and was surprised to see it entered up with more than a score of vessels sighted that day alone a busy day then he said mollified then suspicion crept in it was a cosy billet this ancient lieutenant when closed up was earning eight shillings a day for his trouble near as much as kydds full naval pay the men two shillings for every day on muster the same as an able seaman facing the rigours of the sea and the malice of the enemyand with it protection from the pressgang was it impossible to believe they could have fabricated the only evidence of honest labour a list of imaginary ships to justify their existence hed soon find out he consulted his fob watch and noted the time with satisfaction stepping outside he watched steadily to the left and right on time teazer came slowly past the point so what happens now mr lieutenant kydd said with relish the man stood there regarding him steadily well thats number twentyeight is it not kydd said testily name of vessel passing is required or am i mistaken a finite number of signals could be sent from a coast signal station in their own code which teazer also carried and with which she must respond the lieutenant glanced at the older seaman and nodded the man turned and went outside to hoist the two flags then came back to wait beside him well exploded kydd the log find out if the private signal is correct the name of the ship then enter it up decide if this is an alarmget moving damn you for a mumping set o lubbers the lieutenant folded his arms and said quietly yon ship is the brigsloop teazer captain kydd downs squadron having been on the coast these last two months if n you wish me to make entry of our own forces as are already known to admiral keith i will or should you want an alarm raised he was quite right of course and in a way that suggested kydd had underestimated the ragged band they were localsfishermen smugglers whateverand could be relied upon to know exactly what was afoot on their own doorstep could it be a much more effective system than bringing in highly trained manowars men who would have no idea of local conditions only if they knew the rest tell me an enemy flotilla is making t land at winchelsea beach what is your action red pennant at the masthead three black balls at the peak the man said calmly and at night touch off the faggots in the fireframe lanterns and a blue light where is it he raised an arm and pointed to a twelvefoot post near the waters edge it had a deep iron basket at the top which it was ready charged with combustibles a wave of contrition came over kydd these men had the loneliest task in the navy miles from any other humanity but at the very bullseye of the invasions target on this flat desolation exposed to cutting winds and driving rain there was no escape from the tedium of duty noting details of ships interrogated as they passed such that lesser evils such as privateers and others were caught out and instantly reported down the line the source no doubt of so much of the cryptic intelligence that had sent teazer and her sisters off in righteous pursuit quite right kydd said with a sudden smile well sir i find your attention t duty a caution to us ill bid you good day he turned to go then paused fumbled in his pocket and found a guinea god bless you all and heres rhino enough to drink the health of that fine barky you see out there ramsgate was a bustling trading port at the southeast tip of england wellfavoured by those of means to embarking on ocean voyages even the mysterious cartel ships returning from france disembarked on harbour parade this was no benighted outoftheway exile for the sea fencibles all the comforts of home and town were there and no danger of being caught short by the weather with the abundance of taverns on hand kydd saw what he wanted as soon as teazers boat passed the stubby piers at the entrance and told poulden to lay alongside the seaweedcovered steps on the inner side watched curiously by idle promenaders he cast a professional eye over two prime pieces a pair of twentyfourpounders atop the wall each side of the entrance with a field of fire to seaward he went to the nearer one it was fitted with a tompion and a stout lead apron promising gunlocks in action and was finished in traditional seaservice black an officiallooking small building stood where the pier joined the shore and kydd strode over to it where are the sea fencibles i mean to see em drill he said to a man lounging at the entrance puffing a clay pipe conscious of admiring glances at his commanders uniform from passing ladies he asked again their lieutenant then the man looked at him then slowly removed the pipe how in blue blazes would i know admiral im th revenoo only customs and excise men were immune to the press or kydd would have been sorely tempted stalking past he entered and got the information he wanted then dispatched his menand waited it was nearly two hours before a sullen and resentful gun crew were all closed up still in their shopmans aprons seajerseys and tradesmens smocks an elderly lieutenant in morning clothes arrived redfaced in vexation so kind in mr bonaparte to wait upon you sir kydd said sarcastically and now may we see some action pray muster your equipment one of the men turned on the lieutenant an its toosday and satday only we drill whats th meaning o thisn its a special muster for the officer here and youll see your silver right enough the lieutenant snarled by now a knot of people had gathered the exercise promised a pleasing diversion for the ramsgate seafront kydd pulled out his watch pointedly the lieutenant called them to attention and made the gun numbers sing out their duties that done the order was given to cast loose the gun and rig tackles there was another wait while the side tackles and other equipment were located in store and brought out it took some looking to find the ringbolts to take the breeching and more for the training tackle before the gun was ready it was a hot day but kydd was taking no nonsense and the gun crew bent to their labours out tompion run out the gun point your gun fire worm and sponge the ageold orders rang out but it was not an impressive sight even without the heavy real twentyfourpound shot and cartridges the flat space atop the pier was not best suited to close exercise but kydd was mercilessif the french came they would be serving their piece whatever the conditions pity help you sir when we go to live firing kydd said sorrowfully to the lieutenant live firing yes i will have at least one round from you kydd had noticed that the vent hole was blocked by a neat little spider funnel proof enough of how much the gun had been used why sir you object itsits not done sir the noise it would frighten the ladies and people would think the french to have come one round if you please the lieutenant looked about helplessly then muttered stubbornly i havent the keys to the magazine as i must apply to the colonel of militia kydd could hardly believe his ears but said then we can oblige you sir poulden send to teazer for a twentyfourpounder carronade ball cartridge wadding and gunners pouch there sir he added genially you shall have your fun the expectant spectators were now several deep and an excited murmur went round mr austen wont half be in a takin sir one member of the gun crew said fiddling with a tackle fall and looking anxiously at the lieutenant whose face had paled sir dont you rather think that bonapartes hordes could be upon you at any time and you hesitate at a live practice a grinning gun crew arrived with the requirements do you stand back the teazers well be leaving it to these fine men to show us how to serve a gun are you ready sir well i clear the area you men kydd told his boats crew who shooed the interested audience off the pier to a safe distance there was now a sizeable crowd lining the esplanade the first time in dumb show kydd said encouragingly then the real firing the fencibles gun crew mumbled to themselves as they addressed their iron beast soon to bellow its defiance to the world come come gentlemen in halfhearted show a dummy run was performed then in deathly silence the gun was loaded cartridge wad a gleaming black shot and another wad priming quill tubeand the gun captain stood ready looking unhappily at the lieutenant point your gun then kydd said impatiently when the men with the crow stood about looking confused he added at the french you lubbersthere the coast of france was a grey line on the far horizon stand by the lieutenants order sounded thin and nervous the entire amphitheatre of the harbour went still a final glance at the implacable kydd and the order was given fire a fraction of a second later there came the bursting thunderclap of sound and a vast gouting of powdersmoke the crash echoed around the harbour sending a dense cloud of seagulls screaming skyward as onlookers clutched each other the swirling smoke finally cleared leaving a stupefied gun crew standing in horror at what they had achieved there so now you know what a real battle is like kydd said happily it remained to make acquaintance with the seagoing fencibles and he pulled out the chart once more it did not take long to find somewhere squarely within the invasion area but sufficiently small so as not to warrant too senior a presence rye guiltily kydd knew that an element of his choice was his curiosity to see the place it was an ancient town of the medieval cinque ports and therefore entitled to right of soc and sac blodwit and fledwit pillory and tumbril infangentheof and outfangentheof mundbryce flotsam and jetsam and probably the oldest port in england so old in fact that the town lay far inland where centuries of silt from the river had extended the coastline out several miles into a flat reedy estuary teazer let go her anchor in a lively sea pivoting immediately to meet the waves but when her boat reached the narrow mouth of the rother it grew quickly peaceful the river was dead straight for more than a mile the result of untold years of striving to keep the port open as the land extended itself rye harbour was at the first bend a pair of gunboats should have been maintained there by the sea fencibles to throw into any last desperate clash off the beaches kydd braced himself for what he might find the boat swept round the bend but then he was confronted with the last thing he expected along the gnarled old timber quay were lined up men in smart jackets and trousers that would not have been out of place in a manowar at divisions and as the gig glided in an officer in fulldress fencibles uniform called his men to order and swept off his hat welcome to rye harbour mr kydd he said i do hope well not disappoint collecting himself kydd suspected that word of his mission had been passed ondungeness suggested itself but anyway this was all to the good in the greater scheme of things a fine body o men lieutenant i shall inspect them they were a stout crew fit well turned out direct eye gaze capable seeming all the signs of a good officer looking after his men satisfied kydd turned to their charges the gunboats were secured to improvised trots out in the stream and kydd summoned them alongside one was in a pattern of the last war but wonderfully kept gunboats were numbered but this one sported a nameplate on the bow with vixen of rye picked out in gold on scarlet kydd dropped down into it doubleended and capable of rigging a lateen on a folding mast it mounted a respectable eighteenpounder on a slide on the foredeck and a handy carronade aft he went forward to the gun the officer hovering anxiously he inspected the boreit was an old pattern requiring a quickmatch to fire it rather than a gunlock kydd used the old gunners trick of reflecting sunlight from the back of his fob watch into the bore but there was no sign of kibes the bright metal of a flaw made by a shot loose in the bore striking along its length the ventwork was in pristine condition and the rest of the boat quite up to it so there was little kydd could find to criticise the other vessel of similar vintage and named wolf of winchelsea was in the same fine shape sensing kydds pleased surprise the lieutenant rubbed his hands together theyre to your satisfaction sir he asked most certainly then it will be my pleasure to invite you to our usual meeting at the george in mermaid street sir not so fast sir i desire you should now attack my ship aattack i shall be towing a barrel a cable astern that will be your mark you have powder shot the young mans face beamed with pleasure why certainly then shall we say half a league offshore in one hour out in the bay the seas were as lively as ever but there would be no allowances this onshore blow was ideal for a fast french crossing and they would have to cope vixen emerged first her plain lugsail set taut and making to seaward of teazer in a swash of white bowwave the smaller wolf remained inshore but both bucketed along in the brisk seas kydd nodded approvingly when at the winds eye to teazer the first lowered her long yard at the run and manned sweeps before long her single cannon opened up the powdersmoke whipped away in the strong breeze the ball however tore up the sea only a dozen yards ahead of the small vessel too much motion for em was the general opinion of interested watchers wolf was not much better her shot went somewhere into the unknown and vixens second passed close overhead with a vicious whuup kydd winced but these were keen and valuable men who could not be expected to know how a gun was pointed in the open sea with no one to show them it was time to take a hand mr duckitt kydd told teazers gunner you and mr stirk each are to go aboard and teach em how to point a gun in anything of a seaway then to spare teazers hide well set the barrel adrift and you lie off half a mile a pistolshot apart to await the signal then well have our sport shot b shot youll advance on the target and see wholl be first to hit as they drew closer it would be easier and thus one would eventually be sure to strike with suitable effect on their confidence oh and tell em that the winner will be presented with mr duckitts very own gun lanyard as will er be worked with a threeway turks head and other proper ceremonials the barrel was cast off bobbing jauntily and teazer hove to at a safe distance to await events her sides lined with seamen pleased at the entertainment and no doubt happily placing wagers on the outcome the two gunboats squared off and at the signal first vixen and then wolf let fly it would not have answered in a prime manowar but at least the sudden plumes arising were in sight trying to wield rammers and gunpowder in the bluster out to sea without injury was a triumph in itselfbut kydd had seen it done before and by the french off calais some sort of fishing boat i think sir hallum pointed to a small craft under a single lugsail emerging from the river if the codshead cant see what were about he soon will kydd laughed watching one lucky shot skim the tops of the waves to miss the cask narrowly i do conceive he wishes to speak us hallum said apologetically looking at the direct course steered and the dark figure angrily gesturing by the forestay he thinks were frightening th fish purchet chuckled on balance kydd thought that vixen was making better practice for wolf was gamely taking seas over the bow which must have been making it hard to keep a footing at the gun er it seems theres a naval officer aboard said hallum give that t me kydd said snatching the telescope the gesturing figure of a hatless postcaptain leaped into view man the sideweve a visitor youll give me an explanation sir this minute fumed the officer after he had heaved himself energetically aboard i beg your pardon sir kydd said coldly austen captain francis austen district captain of the sea fencibles and ill have your explanation as to why youre stirring up my command to no purpose kydd allowed his gaze to move to the final stages of the engagement where to the raucous joy of the seamen wolfs next shot smashed the barrel to flying wreckage i have a roving appointment from admiral keith as inspector of sea fencibles and inspector and you a commander austen said in disbelief shall we go below sir id be happy to explain it took all of a bottle of kydds best claret to make good his position that the inspectoring was no more than a cover for a deeper game but that he had to make a good show of it austen made clear his conviction that the sea fencibles by taking the second line of defence were releasing the navy for their aggressive first line at the french coast and furthermore by being parttime were able to support themselves between times providing fish for the nation and at no cost to the government as to the business at ramsgatewhich had sent him after kydd in hot pursuitausten pointed out that the fencibles had their own range and gun for live practice safely out of the way near north foreland any dilatoriness kydd had seen in mustering at the harbour was because their instructions were that in the event of an alarm maroon rockets would boom over the town and each then would know his duty only after it was discovered that both had fought at the nile and shared an admiration for horatio nelson did the atmosphere thaw and austen accept the convenience of a passage back to ramsgate and youll oblige me exceedingly dear fellow should you now allow my sea fencibles to go about their business without alarums and anxieties please believe theyre a fractious crew if they see themselves practised upon ceased as of this minute and my report will be a warm one you may be assured sir idly picking up a book lying on the sideboard austen raised his eyebrows descartes regulae ad directionem ingeniirules for the direction of the mind no less i find i must admire your choice of literature mr kydd oh er that belongs to my ships clerk and particular friend hes a prime wordgrinder renzi and is now engaged in writing a book goodness me how curious i wish he could meet my sister janeshe takes such satisfaction in scratching away and swears she will be published some day bless her heart austen said fondly chapter nicholas take a seat m friend it seems the waters o bath are in truth a sovereign cure you looking so well renzi sat in his usual chair by the stern windows and stretched lazily such a quantity of women each with a tongue that simply could not be still that a man must find peace in a manowar is a singular thing then he gave kydd a quizzical look far be it for me to lay criticism at the feet of my worthy commander but did i not see a gaudy red at the ensign staff supplanting the pristine blue of our noble admiral keith aye you did for now we are an unattached ship while i top it the inspector of fencibles oh well you should know this is b way of a blind while we are on a secret tasking renzi jerked upright why nothing t remark kydd told him in fact were not to trouble the french in any wise the irish no oh im sanguine youll hear of it in time but ill ask you t keep it in confidence our real task is to act as trials ship and navy liaison to an american cove whos been inventing a submarine boat was this by any chance a man called fulton renzi asked with a curious note in his voice er yes but here hes known as mr francis renzis face tightened i didnt think to see that man again in dawning realisation kydd said thenthen it was you conducted him to england yes how didyou were in france paris kydds face was grave nicholas now the french know you did there is nothing to connect my quitting the country with fultons departing its rather him that stands into danger the french may now rue his leaving and take steps to silence him is he guarded yes in dover castle then kydd challenged why do you dislike the man did i say that renzi came back defensively hes a genius whos going to give us the means t get at boneys flotillas kydd said stoutly hes a mendacious and deluded fool who covers his motives for creating his evil machines with absurd nonsense about saving the world from itself kydd blinked in surprise at renzis intensity hes said some strange things ill agree but if hes going to provide us with have you not considered the nature of what he is doing pray he desires we send out these submarines like assassins in the night to fall upon unsuspecting victims who are powerless to defend themselves this is never within the usages of war of any civilisation worth the name well nicholas kydd said lightly trying to lift the mood if it is so dreadful no navy will want to put to sea and there youll have your universal peace do not insult my intelligence renzi said in earths bloody history there will always be found those who place their lust for domination over any consideration of ethics or humanity and would without hesitation subject the world to a reign of terror for their own cruel ends are you meaning that our employing this against boney is immoral by your lights kydd snapped damn it i am and im surprisedvery surprisedthat you should see fit to encourage such a means of waging war so out of notions of honour we should lay aside the weapon that saves us from bonaparte renzi did not reply at once as if he were considering his response carefully if were speaking of honour consider this little analogy what is the difference may i ask between he who faces another squarely in a duel and the one who waits until darkness to break into his opponents house to slaughter him in his bed desperate situations call for radical measures there must be limits to acceptable behaviour in war or were lost as a species and pitting a man sword in hand against an unarmed blindfolded adversary is nothing but contemptible you are of course hoist b your own petard nicholas do go on renzi said stiffly before you said that therell always be found those so lost t honour whod think to employ such a means by logic therefore we must ourselves acquire the same or the godly must surely be overcome by the unrighteous thats as may be but it does not make it an acceptable course for an honourable nation he paused then with a twisted smile he added and yet you see you have omitted one small matter oh and whats that if this should be the manner of war then where might distinction be won by the valiant where is the triumph the victory in the mass destruction of unwary sailors be that as it may kydd said tightly but tell me this if you feel as you do why did you take such pains t bring the man to england renzi sighed so as not to leave him to the french the main reason andand he has created a wondrous undersea chariot with which to visit neptunes kingdom that might yet be of incalculable value to science kydd said nothing and renzi continued since returning i have had time to consider and now ive come to realise i loathe to the depths of my being what he is visiting on the world i fear i cannot face him again if he comes aboard i must tell you i will not sit at the same table with such a man troubled kydd could see that more than duty and morality had now entered his friends thinking but was there any other way to get at bonapartes menace kydd found fulton in his casemate head in his hands is there a problem mr francis are you not well fulton lifted his head and kydd could see the ravages of fatigue in his face im as well as i can be he croaked nothing to worry of are the plans near complete at all kydd ventured dont concern yourself mr kydd if thats the purpose of your visit my calculations show a working depth of thirtyfive feet and an increase to thirty in the number of submarine bombs she can carry in her deck compartmentsand you cannot but admire my undersea observation ports in the dome before he could look fulton pushed the plans to one side and swivelled round to kydd his eyes burned with a feverish glow tell me mr sea captain what is it youre thinking that im mad or a quackthat this is all a humbug to win gold from your king go on say away kydd felt for the man youve been at your scribbling for weeks now have you had any bear you a hand theres no one on gods earth thats in any kind of position to help me i conceive of it i test the idea do the calculations and then the draughting who else so all this time youve been here fulton slumped in the chair wearily ive worked every hour god gives so help me night and day meals brought in dont wash dont sleep much then he sat up energised its just so damned breathtaking dazzling to the mind working on the beast i cant leave it here was a man entirely on his own in a foreign country grappling with devices and concepts far beyond the wisest philosopher and conjuring into being a mechanical seabeast to plunge into the depths so that man could for the first time be truly a child of neptune ill tell you what im thinking about your submarine boat mr francis but not here kydd said youll first hoist inboard a square meal as we say in the navy then talk i cant kydd gave a friendly smile im not without means itll be entirely at my pleasure sir the snug of the white horse inn was unoccupied and fulton devoured his steak and ale pie in privacy expressing every degree of satisfaction with the victuals he dabbed his mouth with his napkin then prompted so what then is your feeling sir ive had space t think about it mr francis therefore i say to you its the most fearful and wonderful thing ive ever seen and im persuaded its the future sir fulton gave him a penetrating look then threw back his head and laughed until the tears came at lastat last a believer and dare i hazard one whos ready to go with my nautilus into that future whatever it brings no matter that some name me a murderer of sailors a charlatan and projector you are to be congratulated then sir kydd was discomfited by his ardour and took a pull at his drink he caught the eye of the potboy and signalled for another round then asked as casually as he could have you heard anything of the committee sir ah yes i meant to speak to you about it they have constituted it and id be pleased to hear your opinions as to its members we have sir joseph banks its chairman whom i met once henry cavendish a scientist banks of course is of some eminence i know but little of cavendish kydd said who will be the naval representative gresham i suppose not at all note was taken hes not on it but id wager its not the last well hear from the gentleman no its to be one popham a high captain of sorts popham then youve a right cunning fellow therehe has distinguished service and is a scientifical and inventor too hes introducing a completely new method o signalling into the navy if theres anyone to convince itll be he umm then theres rennie dockyards and a redcoat congreve from an ordnance department of some sort seems sound enough but im not sure i can add much ah well fulton took a pull of beer do you have plans o business as will see your nautilus aswim one man on his own yes said fulton crisply i do the prime need is to get one party interested enough to fund my design in this case your admiralty she builds and off she goes under licence to my company and starts among the enemy like a tiger let loose i will have a contract that says for every ship of size i put down theres a royaltytonnage or guns i dont care with these proceeds i build more and better its cheap pays for itself so other countries take a note and next thing theres submarine boats in every navy you said before as your intention is universal peace and liberty for all b making it impossible for warships to put t sea just so when all have my vessels how can they some kind of mutualdestruction war i dont think so therefore the high seas are made free for any and every man i see said kydd then i should wish you good fortune mr francis look my friends call me tootwill you oh er of course um toot kydd warmed to the mans need to reach out he was alone in the country yet with such worldshattering plans in his head thank you sir and you well im thomas kydd thomas paine kydd after the radical as charmed my parents fulton chortled tom paine ill have you know the old fellers been a good friend to me living in paris all this time returned to new york only a year or so past so right readily ill call you tom my friend kydd grinned fultons enthusiasm was infectious and he raised his beer in salute to nautilus as will be it was time the plans were ready to present kydd and fulton boarded the canterbury coach to london kydd took rooms in the white hart as before but fulton rejected offers of assistance in the matter of lodging insisting he preferred the independence and freedoms of more humble quarters in the minories on the pretence of it being close by america square on the due day they waited together in a discreet anteroom of somerset house fulton clutching his flat case of plans and in high spirits do you think one guinea a ton royalty an excessive figure he asked kydd being a fraction of what it costs to build as you sense the mood of the meeting id suggest kydd replied with what he hoped was a reassuring smile no doubt the illustrious chairman would be taken with the novelty the dockyard representative would be interested in the technology the scientist with prospects for natural philosophybut the one who stood capable of bringing down fulton and his scheme was the representative of the navy captain popham if being creative and inventive in his own right he took against fulton for reasons of jealousy or perhaps adopted a high moral stand then he had the power to ruin the enterprise kydd was well aware of what that would mean to the courageous inventor the door to the meeting room opened the committee will see you now mr francis a secretary said quietly kydd rose as well this is a closed meeting sir the man said firmly ushering fulton in and closing the door kydd knew there was no real requirement for him to remain his duties were mainly of a liaison nature but he wanted to see the thing through and hallum would be keeping teazer in order for him there was not long to wait in less than twenty minutes the presentation was over and the members streamed out talking excitedly kydd stoodthe major in regimentals had to be congreve a reclusiveseeming gentleman in thick glasses the man of science and there was popham a strongfaced figure in naval uniform striding out and looking thoughtful nodding gravely to kydd as he passed when fulton came out he was beaming a good meeting my friendthey listened and learned and when the sceptics opened fire i was ready god was i ready he chuckled and i just told the fools that theyre whistling in the winda submarine is not to be doubted for its been built proved its already happened theyll be getting a much more advanced craft is all he laughed again fair took the breeze from their sailscouldnt say boo to a goose after that so what happens now they go away and think about it talk among emselves promised to get back to me without delay so you began kydd but a large wealthylooking gentleman walking painfully with an ivory stick had come out it could only be sir joseph banks interesting damned interesting he said genially regarding fulton keenly not your common diving bell but a locomoting plunging boat fascinating with a quick glance at kydd he continued it would gratify me much if youd consent to come to my little gathering tonight therell be some present whod be with child to hear of itupon such short notice i know but while youre in town most certainly sir joseph be glad to and your friend ill send my carriage where oh the white hart in charles street sir kydd intervened before fulton could respond excellent shall we say six o clock it was only a small soirée but the grosvenor street mansion was of an intimidating quality why sir joseph your leg is still troubling you said a stately lady solicitously elegantly working her fan the trials of age my dear said banks then turned to fulton this american gentleman is mr francis and this is mr kydd his friend while in england kydd essayed his best bowbut fultons was deeper and more extravagant gentlemen the lady broughton he continued mr francis is here for a particular and quite diverting purpose bethany im sanguine youll never guess it in a hundred years the fan stopped mr francis do tell what is it brings you to these shores the conjuring of a submarine boat as will swim beneath the waves with the fishes that will disport with the porpoise and sea lion and altogether put a frightener on our mr bonaparte fulton said in lordly tones iim not sure i follow you sir banks interjected he means to say he is constructing a species of plunging boat that might creep along the seabed to rise up on unwary ships aslumber at their anchor and explode them to atoms is that not so mr francis indeed it is sir at home both in the stygian depths and ranging the oceans looking for prey but as well the intrepid crew might peer through their port and be witness to sights in the depths until now seen only by drowning sailors and neptune himself goodness gracious lady broughton said staring at fulton through her quizzing glass in awe ah toot perhaps we should not bore the ladies with such talk kydd said uncomfortably er and is not the character of your work to be accounted secret quite so banks agreed but the lady broughton here may never be thought your common french spy kydd i can personally vouch for her may i not bethany why thank you sir joseph then she pressed fulton but does not your submarine boat frighten the fishes or do they not recognise such aa thing and then you open a little door and spring out upon the poor unsuspecting creatures fulton replied in ringing tones that echoed around the room others came over to listen to the newfound social celebrity eventually kydd and fulton left with firm invitations to the theatre a fête champêtre in hyde park and various illdefined assembliesbut kydd was growing concerned by fultons flamboyant behaviour a note had arrived by hand from captain boyd of the admiralty remembering kydds earlier visit and cordially inviting him to an evening affairhis friend would be made welcome these are the gentlemen you have to convince toot kydd told him seriously as they arrived theyll be the ones finding men for your submarine and sending them off to fight in it theyll need to be confident in your plans im thinking the two mounted the stone steps into the admiralty kydd in deference to his companion not in uniform boyd greeted him effusively so good to see you again ive heard you had a brisk time of it in the downs may i introduce mr francis hes undertaking some work for yes ive heard welcome to london sir a larger officer with a face of granite loomed behind it was gresham we meet again sir he said loudly to fulton how convenient i was just trying to explain to my friend noakes here how you propose to pay for your little toy no mystery sir fulton said icily theyre selffunded after the first as any who attended the committee now knows kydd do explain to these worthy mariners if theyre still confused he gave the smallest of bows and turned his back look here sir captain gresham mr francis is under pressure t complete his design im sure hell explain to me now how an untried and unworkable gimcrack contraption is going to save us all from boney or ill gentlemen gentlemen boyd said this is a social occasion not the place to air professional disagreements now can i press you both to a glass of punch the elderly noakes shifted uncomfortably but seemed determined to have his say nonetheless id be obliged for a steer in the matter of the morality of all this as i understand it if the plunging boat works as advised were being asked to sneak up on the enemy like common burglars and good god fulton exploded as he turned back abruptly do you want to beat the french or no you think a bunch of cow farmers in red coats is going to stop napoleon if he landstheres two thousand invasion craft over there stuffed to the gunnels with boneys best your only hope is to top em in their harbours before they sail id have thought it plain enough for any simpleton he folded his arms and glared at gresham who said with a sneer but its all to no account where are we going to find crews enough to man all these deathtraps among our honest tars theyve more sense than to come mr kydd fulton snarled i find theres more important work i have to do captain boyd ill thank you for your hospitality and we must leave goodnight he pushed his way to the door and out into the street toot this is not the way to they were waiting for me ill not stand to be a punchbag for all the doubtin loobies in the british navy im away to do my work ill call a carriage no i need to walk he stormed off down the road and kydd hurried behind at an ornate gate kydd suggested they cut across the park hoping the pleasant trees and shrubs would calm his mood after a while fulton eased his pace you really should not provoke em like that toot kydd told him they have the ear of popham whos very senior and fulton drew a long breath its hard damnable hard he sighed ive worked on this for years and still im fighting to make em understand when will it all end kydd had no easy answer fultons hopes of his creation coming alive had already been dashed after months of french bureaucracy was the same thing to happen again and would britains only chance to deal directly with bonapartes deadly threat vanish the committee is a true one itll give you a good report im sure just he froze behind them tapping steps had broken into a run kydd spun round as two men rushed towards them he threw fulton to the ground and stood astride him whipping out his smallsword just in time to catch the first attacker with his weapon the man gave a howl of pain dropped his knife and ran for the bushes the other stopped and drew out a heavy pistol hesitating whether to kill kydd first a sharp crack rang out he clutched his bloody face and fell kicking what in hell fulton said brandishing his pocket pistol as he heaved himself to his feet ive never seen robbers french assassins kydd said grimly ive got t get you under protection m friend he looked round it were better they were not found on the scene and he dragged fulton through the bushes to another path fulton pulled himself free ill not have a posse of redcoats at my tail he snorted then youll have to stay somewhere a mort safer than your minories until we get word from the committee youll be a guest aboard my ship fulton hesitated wheres she at not london id say in the downs only a few hours away have no fear toot deal is a gay enough town with quantities of ladies to be entertained however i do believe youll be safer in teazer for the present kydd had sensed his reluctance to leave the capitalthe lionising and awe must be a heady brew for one so far from home and on the brink of fame and fortune mr hallum teazer has an important guest arriving shortly itll only be for a few days and your cabin renzi took the news coldly and announced that he would be detained by his studies fulton arrived and immediately took over the great cabin spreading out his plans and scratching away at new ideas for nautilus and his other devices he was a figure of mystery and excitement for the ships company and lurid rumours flew about the messdecks he appeared on deck only once in the next few days kydd followed companionably a few steps behind him as he paced with a distracted air men stopped their work and stared wonderingly at him then broke into animated talk after he had passed when he reached the focsle fulton stopped bewildered a brawny seaman took him gently turned him round and grinning broadly sent him on his way aft for kydd this little incident with the unsuspecting sailor in his act of kindnesssecure in his wooden world yet unaware that fulton was planning its destructiontouched on all the elements of what was gathering pace and soon to break on the brotherhood of the sea did fulton truly understand what was being wrought kydd turned on his heel and went to his cabin the next day fulton was full of spirit well ive solved it he chortled a torpedo detonation without human intervention yes quite unseen and deadly certain kydd could summon little interest in the detail but asked of it politely fulton gave him a pleased grin wagged his finger then made a mysterious reference to a horn atop nautiluss conning dome kydd persuaded fulton to accept an invitation to a musical evening given by a marchioness in honour of the valiant defenders to be held at downlands hall nestling in the gently rising swell of the north downs it was the prettiest country house kydd had seen above the sprawling village of nethersoke it turned out to be a splendid affair the scarlet and gold of regimentals vying with the dark blue and gold of naval uniforms among the most fashionable gowns of the age all in the breathless heat of a still evening under the coruscating gold and crystal of the chandeliers there were indeed quantities of ladies as the guests mingled before the performance and kydd saw fulton disappear quickly into the throng he accepted an iced confection and was just about to enter a conversation when he was startled by the distinct thud of a distant gun the noise of happy gossip and repartee tailed off and the officers looked at each other meaningfully in the sudden quiet another gun sounded and a corporal of yeomanry burst into the room the beacons there was pandemonium as everyone struggled for the doors and flooded out into the garden strident shouts came from some with the occasional wellbred female shriek and the hoarse bellow of command rising above the excitement atop the nearest hill the stuttering glow of a beacon strengthened and in the far distance the orange point of another wavered kydds heart lurched was this napoleon bonaparte at last a trumpet sounded in the village below an urgent tantara that had the soldiers girding their swords and hurrying away the church bell began a continuous tocsin unnerving in its dissonance a sudden shout drew all eyes seaward in the dusky blue light along the edge of the horizon hundreds of pale sails could be seen too far away to make out details but heartchilling in their import the naval officers shouted for their carriages and nearby the nervous rattle of a drum indicated local volunteers beating to arms and forming up kydd was conscious that to be caught ashore was every captains nightmarebut where the devil was fulton hallum would have the sense to send in a boat doublemanned to get him back aboard but he had to get through chaos to make deal and the beach kydd cast about for fulton cursing that he had not kept closer to the man downlands hall was still a blaze of lights he went back inside and hurried through the deserted rooms calling him a bugle quavered near the villagehad he gone to see the militia turn out it was out of the question to leave him on his own when teazer sailed who knew when she would return and if fresh french agents would have their orders toot he bawled again into the evening as the last carriage left at full tilt there was now nothing for it but to get to the village on foot see if fulton was there then find a horse or some other conveyance panting he arrived at the square it was packed with a milling crowd tearful women saying their farewells to menfolk humping muskets militia crashing to attention fearful old people and children wailing it was hopeless calling for fulton against the bedlam so kydd reluctantly gave up his search and looked about for some means to get to deal the militia marched off and a harassed clergyman implored the women with children to form groups for their speedy transport inland outside the red lion a straggly line of agricultural yeomen hefted pitchforks and scythes growling defiance as a squire with a fowling piece joined them the first carts turned into the square and the children clambered up mollified at the prospect of a ride some mothers joining them with cloth bundles of food then with a crash of hoofbeats on cobbles a troupe of yeomanry thundered past more followed and kydd saw his chance he stepped out and waved his arms they slid to an undignified halt in the name o the king kydd bellowed the corporal in charge looked at his splendid naval dress uniform in astonishment i demand you yield your horse t me kydd told him why sir i must attend at walmer wiout delay sir then take me kydd replied and without waiting hauled himself up behind the man carry on he ordered fulton must now take his chancesif this was bonaparte there would be more important matters to attend to in a very short time the corporal rallied his men and they clattered on into the gathering darkness the roads were choked with people fleeing and the horses shied at their presence but they made good progress and wheeled onto beach street where kydd jumped down sore after the ride people looked with curiosity at his now dishevelled appearance he ignored them and hurried to the kings naval yard where he found his boat patiently waitingand standing beside it fulton where the he began i was worried for you toot atop the signal tower the semaphore clacked furiously in the last of the light fulton smiled sardonically i thought to find a grand seat for the performance to come mr kydd calloway came up to kydd and politely removed his hat sir well an alarm is it not kydd said peevishly aware of his appearance er no sir some farmer burning off his bean straw a coastal convoy becalmed offshore and the lobsterbacks got excited word came that a decision from the committee about future submarine plans was imminent fulton would not be held back so he and kydd posted to london the same day as soon as they alighted from the coach fulton threw off his travelling cloak and hurriedly went to the hallstand at the minories three waiting letters were cast aside but he seized on the fourth this is bankss writing he said bore open the seal and went into the poky drawing room to read it kydd followed fulton scanned it then with a set face he read it again see for yourself he commanded thrusting it at kydd and turning away it was a short but courteous note thanking fulton for his exertions and expressing every admiration for the genius of his design but thinking it only right to advise him in advance of the formal communication that the committee while agreeing on the probable technical feasibility of the submersible had decided that there would be insufficient time to develop the means to overcome its operational limitations given the imminence of the invasion threat for which it was designed it concluded with further warm compliments and the suggestion that an early approach to the treasury for a settlement of accounts would be in order given that unhappily this must be regarded as a termination of relations kydd looked up in consternation this means the fools barked fulton the benighted imbeciles the codsheaded hidebound jackasses cant they seedont they realise he broke off pounding his fists and choking at the enormity of it all fultons world had collapsed on him the two biggest naval powers in the world were locked in a death struggle yet neither wanted to take further his invention in effect it was a conclusive vote of noconfidence in the device kydd knew it was now unlikely that fulton would ever secure further development funding and must god blast em for aa set o stinkin skunks fulton croaked anger gripped kydd that such a gifted inventor should be so treated by the world toot this is not the end m friend well find out what it is ails em then before he could finish fulton snatched a decanter of brandy swigged deeply from it then rounded on kydd be damned to it he gasped wiping his chin i should have known thisd happen i throw in with the british he took another gulp that was why we cast off the shackles damn it his face crumpled god rot the villains i need fresh air he pushed past kydd into the street the ancient greywhite bulk of the tower of london loomed to the south he flew toward its rear wall where he beat his fists helplessly against the darkweathered stone bastards fucksters he cried ill see you in hades you pigging rogues passersby stared in shock and kydd tried to drag him away but he pulled himself free and looked around wildly the dilapidated timber edifice of the royal mint was on the other side of little tower hill he made to storm across but then scorning it plunged past into the maze of smithfields streets kydd tried to reason with him but fulton shook him off pushing faster into the crowds of market porters butchery stalls and stinking squalor this is no place for us toot he shouted lets go back and ill to blazes with it fulton said savagely you can go to hell im after finding some real people the company of common folk he tore away from kydd and disappeared ahead jostling against the tide of humanity vainly searching for a glimpse of fultons bright green coat it became all too clear to kydd that the man had vanished he tried to think to the left was the haunt of the apothecary and chirurgeonno commoners there to the right was the high rear wall of the new london docksor there but beyond kydd hurried forward along the line of the wall to where it stopped abruptly and headed back to the thames this was where fulton was goingdocklands the stews of wapping and shadwell the maritime rookery that accompanied the greatest concourse of shipping on earththe pool of london beyond the rickety tenements and streets of chandlery sailmakers slopsellers and breweries there was a thick forest of masts and rigging this was where ships from every corner of the globe found rest and could discharge their cargoes of tea spices cocoa tobacco cotton and goods of every conceivable description whose pungency lay heavily on the air the nature of the crowds changed in place of the clerk and bookseller now there were wharflumpers sackmakers draymen and sailors going about their business in the narrow cobbled streets kydd thought he glimpsed fultons green coat and redoubled his pace now he was coming to the thames waterfront the haunt of the crimp the scufflehunter and mudlark and his fears for fulton grew then he saw him looking up at the faded sign of the dog and duck before he could reach him he had gone inside kydd hurried to the door just in time to hear him declaim to the astonished topers on their stools that he was a friend to all the oppressed the common folk the honest labourer and he was prepared to stand a brimmer with any whod drink with him to the greatest submarine inventor ever made whats it do then cock one called derisively make eggs o brass or somethin a craft as swims like a fish beneath the waves and can explode any of your nelsons battleships to splinters any time it chooses kydd thrust into the taproom heavy with the odours of liquor sawdust and rank humanity heads turned his way a grog for every man he roared and threw the tapster two guineas in the riot that followed he yanked fulton out on to the street what do you think youre doing toot he demanded only too aware that they stood out in their quality garb and that his sword was with his baggage fulton tore free and ran down towards another waterfront tavern the blue anchor but before he could reach it a hardfaced man in leggings appeared from a doorway in front of him standing astride and smacking a cudgel into his palm kydd swung round another was moving on them from behind in desperation he glanced about him and saw a bundle of building laths among materials for repair he dived for it and whipped one out it was an absurdly thin and insubstantial piece of wood but kydd held it before him at the ready like a sword and advanced on the first man who stopped in surprise then lifted his heavy bludgeon with a snarl that was just as kydd had wanted he lunged forward in a perfect fencing crouch the point of the lath stabbing unerringly for the mans face it gouged into bone and with a shriek his attacker dropped his weapon staggering back the other shied away unsure of what had happened go go for your life kydd bawled at fulton they headed instinctively for the water running feet and hoarse shouts followed them as they plunged through the narrow stinking passages and across clattering footbridges at the edge of the river suddenly the vista opened up but kydd had eyes only for one thingthe stone steps of wherry stairs a waterman dozing in the sternsheets of his boat woke at their shouts and they shoved off quickly leaving their frustrated pursuers behind chapter fulton hung his head in dejection its over he said in a low voice ill never see nautilus swim in my lifetime kydd moved his chair closer how can you say that toot the committee havent given it enough thought is all so who will bring em to their senses gresham isnt alone damn his soul for its in the nature of the mariner to distrust new things no im one man against a whole tribe of noahs pity me tom kydd grimaced at the street noises outside fultons small rooms loud and unceasing they were a sad distraction for any thinking man fulton deserved better but obviously could not afford it then a thought came could he himself fund the development fulton was proud and independent and would allow it only under contract as a form of investment shares in his company perhaps but as a venture the yield would be considerable even as much as what was he thinking to profit by the murder of sailors however logically necessary his mind shied away in horror however he now knew that he believed in fultons ability to bring to reality a warchanging weapon of historic significance and if this were so then standing outside the situation was not an option if britain were to possess it and if he had any influence or power to bring it about his duty was clear toot were going t see this through the first thing well do is find what made em cautious im to see captain popham i believe wait fulton stood up and went to the window ii dont think itll fadge pray why not my purse is now uncommon lightat low water as you sailors will say if im to toot youll honour me by accepting a small accommodation as will see you secure for now youll have my note of hand directly mr kydd fulton said woodenly and looked away kydd was ushered into a small tastefully ornamented drawing room why mr kydd a very good morning to you popham said pleasantly do be seated thank you sir after the usual pleasantries had been exchanged kydd came straight to the point er youd oblige me much by gratifying my curiosity in respect of mr fultonor should i say mr francis oh a very fascinating cove indeed challenging ideas not your common projector if thats what you mean would it be impertinent of me to ask what the committee found objectionable in his plans popham hesitated then looked at kydd quizzically do i take it you have an interest of sorts in the fellow as a serving officer it would be quite improper of me to take advantage of quite so if popham was the one to have objected on moral or other grounds kydd knew he was sailing close to the wind but the man continued yet one might take a professional interest dont you think did this mean kydd pressed his case it appears t me sir that if there is anything of substance in the design then were dutybound to discover its limits it will set our notions of sea warfare on its head should he be successful yes sir but if this is going to be the future do we have the right to turn our backs on it without we know of it at the first hand there was no going back now ah do i see an enterprising and forwardlooking officer not affrighted by the original the radical then we are quite of a mind sir relieved kydd went on then may i know who objected to the submarine popham gave a lopsided grin there were several who did but one who quite swayed the meeting and discouraged all further discussion and he was myself i had to of course ii dont understand you sir reflect if you will mr pitt is asking for a steer in the matter of saving the country from the invasion fleet of mr bonaparte that at this time is his first duty he paused then said do you know much of the design of this submarine boat not a great deal kydd admitted stiffly in warfare the devils always in the detail popham said the general consensus among us was that the design may be technically feasible if not brilliant no mr kydd the problem does not in fact lie with our friends plan which might well end in a formidable and deadly craft it is in short workable but the target is the flotilla in boulogne and as you should know the sea depths to be found there are scant and with much tide scour yet the design calls for the submersible to pass under the victim i would suggest that even if this were possible in such cramped conditions it would be to the grievous hazard of the craft and i cannot find it in me to condemn its crew to such a horrible end i see sir kydd said yet it has to be admitted that such a weapon would give complete mastery of the sea to whoever is able to employ it popham eased into a smile which at present we already enjoy no sir the remit of the committee was the destruction of the boulogne invasion flotilla and none else this nautilus cannot achieve this therefore i cannot in all conscience recommend to the government that there be an expenditure on a device without specific utility to his majestys arms that was and is my duty to say sir then im afraid so but in the future the future may take care of itself kydd stood then i can only thank you for your time sir and my dear fellow i might appear to you unsympathetic but this would be far from the case i am a friend to any who can carry the war to the enemy and if mr francis had come to us with anything but a submarine boat he might have been more fortunate perhaps we shall look at it with interest but later if you see him again do extend to him my every expression of admiration for his achievement will you old fellow so as you can see it toot theres little can be done without it does for the invasion flotilla nautilus is not to be set aswim by usand thats the last word i fear fulton slumped in dejection all these years are not t be wasted kydd said forcefully theres still a chance no im not spending what remains of my days wheedling dullards who so youre to have done with submarines cast all the work aside im going back to america where theres a great need of such kydd said tartly listen to me toot you can have your nautilus if first you can show em something as will stir their interest give em confidence in your inventions that will set em talking what said fulton bitterly can be more amazing than a submarine boat your torpedo machines did you not impress napoleon himself with em at brest with his admirals looking on fulton conceded then i cant conceive of anything more prime to launch against their invasion craft but without a submarine toot you contemplate your torpedoes and ill see what we can do to deliver em for you but might i know why you call them torpedo after the electric fish that strikes invisibly thats your atlantic torpedo of the torpedo nobiliana family well putting the name aside lets clap on all sail the admiralty will smile on any who can show a way to deal with the menace at boulogne your course is set work up plans for a superior species o torpedo and ill see it gets attention no time t be lost toot the promise of a means to deal with the crouching menace at boulogne was vital to securing the attention and interest fulton neededbut the original arrangement had run out and the committee had disbanded how were they to get a fair hearing on another invention popham would be the key kydd thought if he could capture the mans imagination persuade him to take an interest lead him on perhaps to a personal involvement then he most surely could take it to the higher levels fulton had sketches of the device he had used at brest with a few modifications it would bring attention against boulogne popham said with growing animation if these torpedoes can be relied on to sink a ship in a single blow we have an entirely new method of assaulting an enemy no more hours of battering away with broadsides at the hazard of life and limb thats as it seems sir he will find much of the service arrayed against him of course there are not a few inclined to oppose anything that is ingenious or not hallowed by the centuries including those who have a moral objection to the employment of such weapons well mr kydd if you ask my advice i would suggest you should batten down for a long and stormy voyage it does seem worthy of further trial but in this we have a perplexity sir mr francis is without means if he works on and feels he must on that account return to america i see it does occur to me sir that were his inventions to be put forward by one of unassailable standing in the navy it would not be mr francis alone to be resisted youre very persuasive mr kydd but i myself am much taken up with business in the last election im made the member of parliament for yarmouth but at the least i shall spy out the lie of the land for you true to his word a message of encouragement arrived not long afterwards followed by another requiring fulton and kydd to take coach to deal to meet popham at an unfashionably early hour in the kings naval yard with as many illustrations of the projected weapons as were available mystified they waited at the appointed place as morning blossomed into day popham arrived punctually thank you gentlemen he said with a mysterious air do join my carriage we are expected it was only a few minutes along the foreshore before they drew up at the quaint rounded edifice of walmer castle they were saluted by soldiers at the gatehouse then hustled inside to the comfortable residence within kydd supposed they must be going to meet the lord warden of the cinque ports upon whom popham clearly felt it worth his while to call kydd hoped the old gentleman would understand enough of what was being said the doors of a long corridor were flung wide and a striking young woman appeared my lady murmured popham with a bow this is mr kydd and mr francis gentlemen the lady hester stanhope youve not come with bad news i trust sir home she said sternly you know how uncle always takes it so personally she was dressed for the morning but in an individual white gown with a boldly coloured shawl no hester this is merely an entertainment she looked at him distrustfully mr francis is an american gentleman with diverting views on marine travel oh then i believe i shall stay come in and do remember uncles health is causing us some concern she ushered them into a small reception room cunningly fashioned within one of the ancient tudor bastions the men waited politely in easychairs for the lord warden to appear lady hester took firm direction of the arrangements as a small circular table was spread with various hot and cold dishes then the door opened and almost apologetically a lean drawn man shuffled in wearing a wellused corded green dressinggown and red slippers he nodded to popham and waved down the dutiful rising of the others please excuse he said in a voice not much above a whisper youll believe this is the only way i have to attend on you its kind in you to see us at such notice sir popham said respectfully then introduced kydd and fulton the two bowed and this gentlemen is william pitt the prime minister of great britain kydds eyes widened in astonishment hester my dear theres no need to tarry on my behalf no uncle i want to hear dear child i rather feel they have a matter of some delicacy to discuss after his niece had departed pitt brushed aside pophams background introduction of fulton i know of you sir he said my condolences on the committees decision which in all fairness does appear to me to be the right one popham leaned forward earnestly mr francis recognises that his plunging boat may be delayed a while but he has since been turning his mind to the presenting difficulty of the age mr bonapartes armada oh pitt toyed with a kipper but listened keenly he has produced a remarkable plan for submarine bombs which may be launched unseen from a distance requiring but one to sink a ship and which appear to me eminently suited to an assault on boulogne have you details mr francis has brought his plans to show you sir spreading out the drawings over a chaiselongue fulton launched into an explanation the artistic quality of the illustrations and his colourful metaphors brought a smile to the ailing statesman so these torpedoes might be prepared using existing naval materials and ready within no more than three months indeed so if we make immediate arrangements for a monthly stipend of say two hundred pounds while you are so employed with a capital sum against expenditure of naval stores ofwhat five to seven thousand poundsyou would be prepared to begin should i receive the unqualified support of the navy and a satisfactory agreement entered into regarding my recompense being the sum of one hundred thousand pounds to release the plans under licence to your government and a royalty payment of forty thousand for every decked french vessel destroyed by my weapons one hundred thousand your engines come dear sir the loss of this kingdom the dearer pitt gave a tight smile very well i shall instruct the treasury to draw up a contract of such a nature and er agree the financial details with you pitt broke off to cough into his handkerchief not omitting that his majestys dockyards and arsenals be charged with assisting where sought and mr francis it is my fervent desire that you should begin without delay outside fultons eyes shone and popham observed drily youll agree there are some compensations in being a member of parliament mr kydd however it might be that in going above the heads of the admiralty were on a lee shore to them but be that as it may to work i suggest that in this i shall be the one speaking with the admiralty and navy board and you mr kydd do take station as before on our american friend admiral keith will no doubt agree to your continuing with trials and close liaison agreed kydd stepped gingerly into fultons crowded casemate it was now more a workshop than a design office with three benches and workmen with sheets of copper an industrious carpenter and a cooper sighting along his staves fulton was bending over his plans and turned to greet kydd now were getting somewhere he rubbed his hands together im to start all over again before i had my nautilus with its horn slowly rising under the victim to strike now it must be another way i have my ideas im sure you do kydd said hastily i came to know if theres any service i can perform there is as you can see i proceed cautiously trying and testing for nothing will serve unless it can be seen nobly to meet the oceans billows your stout vessel will have its hour at the final trials but for now i need to conduct experiments of a privy nature explosions and the like kydd considered the request who better to ask about a quiet retreat for activities of a stealthy nature than a revenue officer over a friendly jug of ale he had his answer the coast t romney marsh is the worst in the kingdom fr smuggling reckon i cn find you a tuckedaway little spot as will meet yr needs how about marthas cope just a little ways off kydd went to view it sure enough at the base of the soaring chalk cliffs close to dover there was a tall cleft and several lofty pinnacles standing out to sea a flat area in their lee and a dark cave into the rock a token of its more usual visitor it would do admirably the towering cliffs would deflect the sound and would ensure their security as only boats could approach the area a mooring buoy laid offshore would make for convenience and marines posted at either shore approach would keep all wouldbe visitors at bay let the trials commence pleased he went below to detail his intentions to keith and found renzi at his books in the great cabin as kydd entered he looked up so youve found a portion of gods good earth on which to test your infernal machines then he said acidly as you will see kydd said neutrally not wishing to find himself in yet another argument and your mr francis is ready with his inventions he works like the devil himself but they will need proving first nicholas of course you see the true reason for his industry to save us from boney kydd said shortly not as wed recognise renzi replied with a measure of venom he merely wants to see his diabolic devices created and cares not a damn who pays for them that is a reason why we should turn our back on em in our hour of need you are a gentleman youve reached a level of politeness in discourse and delicacy of perception that are a shining credit to you it escapes me why it should be that you do encourage the man in his mass destruction of sailors its an inviolable maxim of conduct in war that ones enemy is met on the field face to face that the issue be decided nobly by courage resolution and skillatarms failing that the mastery of the profession of war is set at naught and we descend into a base hackeryor the promiscuous exploding of bodies unknown stung kydd replied and its escaped me why you will not see that its happened this is the future for all men now whether you like it or no and we must learn the new arts not so my friend oh then there is recollect before fulton there was no one with a deadly submersible like nautilus he has attempted to interest the french in it without success mainly on account of their distaste for it and what it represents it has been turned down as well by ourselves and i cannot readily see who else in this terraqueous globe might be moved to expend their treasure in order to exploit it in fine as we look around in the absence of any other of such inventive persuasion it would appear that mr fulton and his ingenious contrivances are destined to appear as a curious footnote to history he the only one of his kind and the world will with a grateful sigh revert to civilised conduct once more that is if the gentleman is not rashly encouraged you would not grieve it if he disappeared from the face o the earth tomorrow since you ask it no the first trial was simple teazer lay submissively to her buoy over on the seaward side and a strange ceremony took place under the interested gaze of her entire crew fulton prepared his first experiment with a short stubby barrel well caulked canvas covered and heavy it was lowered over the side on a marked line which fulton paid out slowly observing it sinking lazily from sight into the bright summer sea at the first mark he hauled in it seemed unaffected but fulton shook it carefully listening for water inside satisfied he entered something on his notepad and repeated the action to the second mark it wasnt until the fourth that the dripping barrel came up ugly with imploded staves the buzz of conversation rose when a second barrel was produced this time larger and tarblack it lasted to the seventh mark ill trouble you now for a length of slowmatch mr kydd fulton requested in another cask of the same type duckitt the gunner coiled slowmatch close down on the ballast inside a flint and steel had the end settling to a red smoulder and stepping aside he allowed the header to be thumped in without delay fulton lowered it rapidly over the side to the fourth mark before drawing it up again the boatswain himself knocked out the headerbut the match inside was dead he looked up at duckitt wryly fulton appeared unperturbed this was not vitiated air he murmured thoughtfully the candles lasted for hours in nautilus i rather think the next day saw a successful submerging and a triumphant return fulton waved the glowing end about the air in great satisfaction lead lining and no condensationthats the ticket he crowed it was only the start the barrels elongated and grew now the size of hogsheads and half the height of a man significant looks passed between the watching sailors as they considered the implications of such when crammed with powder and set off more than one turned his back faces set and went below the unwieldy beasts needed tackles to sway them overside and in the water required extra ballast the first returned as an untidy clutch of splintered timbers the second brutishly fighting the training lines submergence was not all that was expected they should as well pass silently through the sea on their deadly occasions fulton worked throughout the daylight hours at his experimenting or figuring in a corner of the deck kydd became impatient he waited his moment and confronted him toot answer me this i heard you say that you demonstrated one of these in brest before generals and admirals why do we start again when you successfully destroyed a whole ship even then ah well that was as we must say a demonstration only fulton said cheerfully as would meet expectations a simple barrel on a rope overstuffed with gunpowder and um suitably deployed in our present contract we look to the palpable reality where men must strive unseen against others and will not stand unless their apparatus is without flaw agreed kydd nodded reluctantly it seems reasonable given that any future contract would be at hazard were your engines found wanting on the field of battle toot later in the day a naval officer in plain clothes came aboard teazer kind in you to see me kydd im here dispatched by our lord and master to top it the spy concerning your infernal machines he admitted kydd gave a wry smile this way there was no official notice being taken of the activities of a private contractor but as the commander with operational responsibility keith had a moral right to be in the know im not certain i can tell you much he replied the trials are at an early stage only whats watertight ballast required that sort of thing the officer turned grave as i feared he shifted uncomfortably you see old chap keith is put under notice by the politicos to make a sally against the french using these infernals to satisfy the mob that bonaparte is being dealt with severelyyou do understand i know kydd thought despairingly of fultons painstaking progress and when is this assault planned t be well yesterday would best suit but any time close after will serve im not the one t say but youre asking for the moon am i then dear fellow if you have any influence over the chap do impress on him the need for celerity and that sort of thing wont you i have the feeling that keith will press on whatever state the contrivances are in did you know that our new first lord of the admiralty lord melville himself bless him fully intends to take part in the assault so consequential is the action believed to be well do our best for you kydd replied strongly stout fellow the officer said you get along splendidly with americans im told best of luck it put a new and graver complexion on the situation was it a measure of desperation at the highest levels that the august head of the navywho was certainly not expected to tread a deck let alone smell powdersmokeshould feel obliged to be a part of it fulton took the news calmly but retreated to his casemate demanding that a soldiers camp bed be placed next to his desk and set to work by morning he had sketches ready his mechanics turned to and he requested that teazer be made available again at marthas cope it became clear that the character of the trials had now taken a more serious turn the gunner was asked to provide material for live charges and after a nod from kydd assembled the makings into an arms chest and brought it up the impedimenta was rowed ashore in the launch and prepared over there fulton decided it was a low flat rock lapped by waves close by loomed the pinnacles of chalk that gave the tiny cove its name post your men kydd told the sergeant of royal marines and two sentries were sent marching stolidly under the vertical white cliffs in opposite directions to seal off the approaches in complete silence the first experiment was assembled a simple contraption was erected a metal hemisphere pointing cup down at the end of a hinged arm twelve feet long braced by two legs whats this then toot it gives a measure of the vehemence of a blast observe here where there is a scale at the hinge with exactly the same charge a variation in the confining of the igniting powder will result in a different force he laid down a metal plate and lowered the cup over it see here first powder quite unrestrained a cascade of black grains poured from the measuring funnel and settled in a pyramid mr duckitt clear the range every man stepped back to a safe distance fire the charge the gunner blew on his portfire and touched off the powder it flared up high in a bright fireworklike glare with a vigorous but impotent hiss when they tramped back to the apparatus the gauge had not moved without comment fulton produced a coconutsized sphere charge this if you please he said to the gunner and explained to kydd this is then the same amount within a halfinch clay jacket match was inserted and lit the onlookers retired hastily it detonated with a satisfying flash and a clap of thunder that echoed back from the soaring cliffface after a moment pieces of the jacket were heard skittering about fulton plunged into the eddying smoke and inspected the result noting down the reading one inch clay he intoned resetting the indicator this time the explosion had a vicious ring and the shattered clay whipped through the air overhead falling into the shallows in myriad splashes fulton took the reading from the canted arm then became thoughtful id hoped the effect would scale but it does not this is not double the impetus meaning to multiply this force and be sure to sink a wellfound manowar will take either a mort more powder or a jacket so heavy as to cause the torpedo to sink i must think again the next day a threeinch jacket was tested which confirmed the problem a larger charge in the same case had the puzzling result of a lower indication on the gauge than expected i wonder if its the greater bulk of the powder smothering the speed of burning fulton mused beg pardon sir duckitt interjected an have ye considered corned powder atall whats that new like sifted mill cakes hardened n rolled in graphite makes fr rare consistent firing have we any kydd asked aye sir costs a pretty pennywe keeps it fr the chase guns only duckitt was dispatched to find it and kydd asked fulton if the explosion is within the sea will not the water pressing on your er container act t tamp it like the clay jacket coffer thats what we call em he replied distracted why yes im supposing it will but how do i take the measure of an underwater blast pray nowhere in kydds experience in the navy had he ever come across explosions occurring beneath the surface his question however seemed to have sparked something in fulton for the next trial was with small submersible casks from the boat if you please the match was started and the cask head thumped home then the whole was allowed to sink on a line to an improvised buoy nervous oarsmen sparing nothing to make certain the boat was nowhere near the spot in a deathly silence all eyes were on the barely ruffled innocent surface of the water a subsea thump was more felt than heard followed a second later by the bursting upward of a white geyser which subsided to an ugly roiling scar in the sea we take it by the height of the splash fulton said defensively selecting another larger cask well see if this scales up there was another tense wait and once more the plume rose skyward better fulton said with relief lowering his improvised quadrant kydd pulled out his pocket watch and consulted it pointedly dont worry mr firebrand im satisfied an will now move forward so this means at that moment a naval cutter was sighted making her way prettily towards them a very good morning to you gentlemen popham said breezily when he had stepped onto the shore do i see your new curiosities performing to satisfaction fulton busied himself obstinately among the apparatus in the arms chest leaving it to kydd to answer mr francis is moving forward this day sir on account he has achieved satisfaction in the matter of the er coffer splendid popham said heartily as it will please their lordships to hear his tone became more serious the descent on boulogne has been sanctioned at the highest and time is now of the essence is there anything whatsoever that i might do for your american kydd detected a note of anxiety and guessed that there was more to the question than had been said but before he could answer fulton swung round his face dark yes there is mr englishmanperhaps youd keep clear of the works theres enough to worry on without we have sightseers popham gave a wintry smile do tell me your concerns im no stranger to novelties of a mechanical nature sir he encouraged fulton hesitated its the fault of your committee without i have a submarine how do i attack with a torpedo if its agreed that it be done unseen do they propose i use ships boats splashing along with oars in full sight of the enemy or like the ancient greeks by swimmers with a torpedo under each arm there are other ways of approaching a prey popham responded flying over it in a balloon im reminded of my service off the coast of the coromandel there we encountered nightly the thievery of the native peoples captain im very engaged today if youve who could approach unseen to within close hail except in the brightest moonlight swimming no mr francis in a species of native craft called a catamaran this has the property that it lies very close to the water being of two hull forms joined by a central bracing im sanguine it can be made strong enough to deliver your torpedoes low in the water inches only then we have a possibility fulton looked speculatively at popham who hastened to add leave it to me i know an amiable shipwright who will be persuaded to produce one immediately for our consideration in the meanwhile you shall be free to concentrate on your curiosities it wont do i calculate well need all of thirty minutes if not the hour to make our approach by stealth an if thats with slowmatch itll die of suffocation long since a different kind o fuse toot there isnt any not using fire damn it all to hell if we were going in with a submarine thered be none of this kydds heart went out to him to be pressured so and in a situation not of his making was taking its toll can you nota mechanical fuse o sorts fulton looked up with redrimmed eyes theres no such not even wait i have it he laughed why not mechanicalan automatic selfigniter he pulled out his notepad and with hurried strokes sketched in a gear train and cams then a striker plate and cocking detent yes does not consume air and can do its deadly work in secret deep beneath the waves until it knows its time has come then without warning heroically sacrifices itself in one hellish detonation kydd shuddered at the picture but he had to see things through it must be made of brass or some such else the seawater will turn it to rust in quick time and thatll cost you not a little hang the cost set the price of one squiddy bit of brass clockwork against that of a manowar theres no argument my friend despite his disquiet kydd found fultons sudden enthusiasm infectious ive some drawings to make fulton continued and id be much obliged should you scare up a watchmaker wholl relish a challenge kydd was later entertained by the sight of fulton explaining to the bemused craftsman the operation of a delay mechanism that at its culmination instead of setting off an alarm actuated something that looked suspiciously like a gunlock so we have figures on depth to tamping effect for a given charge as may be scaled up a form of watertight carcass has been devised proof to the depths it will be used and if our crafty captain is to be believed a near invisible means of launching the beasts now with our automatic fuse in construction we can turn our minds to assembling them all into a fearsome weapon of war the first torpedo was impressively huge more than twelve feet long square sectioned and with symmetrically sharp front and rear it was ballasted to ride just beneath the sea surface and had within it twenty watertight compartments ready to receive their lethal cargo of explosives my friend i do intend now to test its force just for this i wont be needing either the catamarans or the automaton igniter however the concussion will set up such a commotion that id rather be elsewhere than here further away from the ladies of dover in their parlours it was eventually agreed that shell ness a few hours sail around north foreland at the tip of the isle of sheppey would suit it was low scrubby and desolate with nothing but one or two empty shepherds huts teazers deck bore three torpedoes lashed down securely long tardark coffers that in their deadly menace made hardened seamen tiptoe nervously past them it was necessary to wait at anchor while their promised victim a decrepit fishingboat was towed into the bleak mudflats it was old but of a size and to kydd seemed to assume a pathetic dignity as it was led to its place of sacrifice no time was wasted the coffer was lowered into the sea grappled by the pinnace crew and manhandled round to face the target the men strained at their oars the torpedo wallowing sullenly after them until they reached the vessels side where it was left the gunner in the gig then gingerly started the match fuse and hastily pulled away an expectant hush fell over teazer as all aboard waited and stared at the tethered victim in horrified fascination kydd aimed his telescope while fulton had his improvised quadrant trained ready time passed in breathless silence suddenly the sea at the waterline shot up in a huge pall of white suffused with gunflash and smoke and a clap of thunder rolled round the bay sending countless seabirds to flight fulton grunted in satisfaction as he noted the height of the plume and grinned sideways at kydd but when it had subsided the fishingboat was still there motioning the gig alongside kydd went out with him to inspect the result part of the vessels side was stove in and gaping but otherwise only a large area of scorched timber gave evidence of the cataclysmand she was still afloat what in hades fulton said almost to himself as he poked at the scarified hull and peered up at the crazily hanging gaffyard then he collected himself and added calmly but then this is our sea in its tamping it works to satisfaction yet directs its force in the main to the line of least resistance which is to the vertical hmm this is a setback i cannot deny it yet by the time they had returned to teazer fulton had his answer we use two torpedoes one each side and crush the ship between their vehemence the two remaining coffers were swayed down and put in the water but at the longsuffering victim another difficulty presented itself mr duckitt they must explode together as near as you please this was a tall order but the gunner bent his best efforts in cutting the match to the exact same mark he borrowed a boatswains call to sound the precise time to the gunners mate on the opposite side to light the fuse a double roar saw the vessel hidden in smoke and spray but when it dissipated there was the satisfying sight of blackened wreckage settling beneath the waves the coffer size must increase of course but with an automatic fuse we will have a good result fulton said briskly the catamaran was as strange a craft as kydd had ever seen two long slender hulls joined with an open framework the two oarsmen would take position on a narrow bench running fore and aft set well downin fact they would be sitting in the sea their silhouette would be inches high only a cunning device to allow them to close invisibly with the target before launch popham was clearly pleased and accepted the flattering comments about his contribution then motioned the vessel to be brought alongside shall we make trial of it kydd said jovially come now you men wholl volunteer as always in the navy the outofroutine had instant appeal and this promised at the very least a skylark in the summer sea for the lucky pair selected they settled into their subsea seats to much ribaldry and it was quickly clear that barely head and shoulders above the surface they would be more difficult to spot even than a small ships boat the testing time was as night drew in for some reason the darkling sea took on a feeling of looming menace unknown shadows moving restlessly whos to come forward then you idlers kydd called encouragingly to the knot of onlookers this time there were no takers that fine pair of this afternoon youve had your amusement so step up my lads and see what its like to earn your grog the two detached from the others and came to the ships side looking down in consternation at the flimsy contraption in the darkness come along then kydd said gruffly salt water never harmed anyone in you go hand over hand they lowered themselves exclaiming aloud at the chill of the night water as they immersed good god spluttered popham leaning over the side for the cold plunging pool at tunbridge wells youd damn well need to find five guineasthe navys giving you your health cure at no cost the oarsmen seemed not to appreciate the joke but popham turned to kydd and said damme thats what ill call the beasts my plungers kydd watched the shivering pair shove off and awkwardly ply their sculls to take them into the anonymous blackness they were under instructions to circle teazer out in the moonless night then close in from a random direction keep a bright lookout ahoy kydd roared up at the men in the tops much hung on this as everyone knew and a wary silence settled some minutes later there was a call from aftboooat ahoooy away t starbd it was some time before kydd could pick out the low form that the sharp eyes of a ships boy had spotted around again they were ordered and this time coming in directly on teazers bow they penetrated easily within a ships length splendid popham declared there he told fulton you have your means of delivery sir chapter it had been frustrating in the extreme hours spent in journeying to london two days explaining reassuring promising kydd waiting outside and the solitary fulton sitting at one side of a long table with the seniority of the admiralty assembled along the other popham had assured kydd and fulton it was necessary but in their eyes there were more pressing concerns and now more hours in a coach on the return kydd pondered the extraordinary turn of events and the irony that he had now the wealth and the opportunity finally to take his place in higher society but the grave situation in which england stood made it all but meaningless even a small estate was beyond his grasp as an active captain he could give it no real attentionand he had no lady to rule it he watched the neat rolling hills of the weald of kent passing by almost gardenlike in their loveliness next to him fultons eyes were closed and opposite a merchant and his prim lady kept aloof his thoughts turned inevitably to the war there was no question but that in a short time there would be a reckoning would he play his part with honour when the time came of course then doubt flooded in did honour include the stealthy blasting to atoms of sailors was it so necessary to support fulton as he did or had he as renzi believed crossed a moral rubicon troubled he crushed the thoughts did not the situation demand extreme measures was not the coach lurched to a grinding stop the horses whinnying in protest there were sharp voices outside and kydd leaned out of the window two horsemen stood athwart their path both masked and each with a heavy pistol one walked his mount to the window of the coach and leaned down flourishing his weapon the menout highwaymen rage filled kydd that these vermin were still at their trade when the countrys peril was so real his sword was in the rack above the seat but it would be useless in the face of the big horse pistol pointing steadily at him now the voice was flat with no emotion and left little choice but to obey kydd climbed out looking tensely for the slightest chance but these were clearly professionals one stood back to cover the other while he dismounted kydd tried to peer into the mask but there was only the glitter of dark eyes the three male passengers stood together and faced the two riders it was odd that they were ignoring the lady for she surely had the richest pickings ii hhhave a wwatch the merchant stuttered reaching for his fob he was ignored the highwayman still mounted trained his pistol on each in turn then rapped which of you is fulton in an instant it became clear these were french agents sent to find the inventor fulton glanced at kydd with a lopsided smile neither spoke the merchant looked bewildered and afraid the rider motioned meaningfully at his accomplice who threw open the coach door out he snarled at the woman holding his weapon to her head she screamed and the man cuffed her to the ground still with the pistol aimed at her he cocked it which is fulton if the french took back the inventor they would know in detail what was planned against them and take appropriate defensive measures then they would undoubtedly build infernals of their own it could not be risked i am kydd said and stepped forward in french the mounted man demanded answer quickly what rank does gaspard mongé hold under the emperor kydd was unable to answer you said the man pointing to fulton with his pistol come here his accomplice swiftly cut the traces of the coach horses and slapped their rumps sending them galloping away over the heath then he resumed his horse but kept his pistol out up behind fulton obeyed awkwardly they cantered into the woods and out of sight it was a catastropheand kydd was responsible it had taken half an hour to catch one of the horses and now he was riding south bareback thrashing it as hard as it could go kydd knew that the agents would be in urgent flight to the coast to spirit fulton to france at a village he hired the best mount he could find and thundered madly down the road hoping against hope to see the riders ahead then under the goading of urgency he headed instinctively for his ship tired and sore he left the exhausted animal at the kings naval yard in deal as kydd slumped down wearily renzi looked up from his reading is there ive lost fulton kydd said simply lost we were bailed up on the highway from london b french agents not three hours ago they took fulton i have t do something with every minute gone they would be that much closer to france renzi put down his book you will be considering alerting the admiral damn it o course kydd forced himself to concentrate id wager theyll want to get him over just as soon as they can the closest place is right here i feel it in m bonestheyre about somewhere it was an allornothing throw that they would have made for this place of all the possible escape ports and additionally that they were here still if he was wrong the consequences could not be more serious but the same instincts that had made him a successful privateer captain were reassuring him coolly that he was not mistaken the typical latesummer calm was preventing their final flight to franceto the land that was so plainly in sight across the channel but in an hour or two an afternoon offshore breeze would pick up and they would make a run for it if indeed they were here restless kydd got up went to the stern windows and flung one open in the downs it was a calm placid day the sun glittering on a glassy sea upwards of two hundred ships of all sizes were peacefully at anchor waiting for a wind lifting to the slight swell a charming picture what better place to conceal but in the middle of all those renzi murmured over his shoulder it will be hard to flush them even with every boat in the squadron out kydd came to a decision no im not telling the admiral he said firmly theres no time t rummage so many shipsand besides who knows fulton to recognise him no were to wait out the calm and when they make their run we go after them if he was wrong it would be disaster for england he went on deck to make his dispositions mr hallum i want both watches turned up theyre t keep a tight lookout for er any craft making sail towards the gull passage that was the direct route past the goodwins to calais five guineas to the man as sights it time hung the sun beamed down in a show of warm beneficence the lazy slap of water under teazers counter and irregular creaking below were the only sounds to disturb kydds dark thoughts at noon he sent one watch for a hurried meal then the other he himself stayed on deck unable to contemplate food then more than an hour later the first zephyr touched the water in playful catspaws hardly enough to lift the feathered wind vane in the shrouds teazers moorings had long since been buoyed ready to slip instantly and her sails were in their gear held only by rope yarns that would be cut to let them tumble down at a little after three bells there was a definite lift and flurry in the breeze enough to set lines from aloft slatting in expectation the shadow of windflaws ruffling the glittering sea surface as they moved forward it died but then returned to settle to a playful warm offshore whisper kydd longed to send men to the yards but this would give the game away to their quarry the wait was agonising and to make things worse it appeared that the whole anchorage was stirring in preparation for departure inshore small craft were putting off from the shingle beach and larger ones shaking out sails the fishingboat sir hallum said doubtfully indicating a twomasted lugger that had detached from the main body of the anchorage and seemed to be heading for the goodwins it was the same as many seiners at this end of the channelhigh curved bow and perfectly suited to conditions where it could blow up so quickly fishingboat thats him kydd said savagely sir hallum said puzzled lay out n loose damn you he roared at the stupefied crew then turned to hallum in glee what kind of fisherfolk think the fish are biting now nearer sunsets more the mark in minutes teazer had slipped and her every sail was setbut the breeze was sadly lacking in strength favouring the smaller boat which was also directly before it teazer needed to cover the halfmile to the gull closehauled before she could square away after the chase in barely a ripple they glided along at a slow walking pace in weather that would have the folk ashore bringing out a picnic kydd pounded his palm in frustration wet the sails he spluttered and the clanking of the deckpumps was heard as buckets were filled and swayed up water cascaded darkly down the light canvas from the yards but there was no real increase in speed the lugger was comfortably under way and beginning to shape up for the gull gaining with every minute and showing no sign of noticing them was it indeed their quarry or an innocent tide on the turn and no current to assistit would be a closerun thing at last teazer was able to put down her helm and fell in astern of the lugger but almost immediately it was apparent that they were losing the race renzi appeared at kydds side his face was grave it was unlikely that the languorous breeze would strengthen in the near term and by the time teazer had sufficient wind to haul in the smaller vessel too much lead would have been established in the race for the bluegrey line that was the french coast were losing him kydd said in a low voice watching the lugger spread her wings for the open sea his mind searched feverishly for answers rig teazers sweeps and row it was unlikely they could make much more over the ground than they were doing ditch guns water and so on these were moves more suited to a longprotracted chase when fractions of a knot could add up over the miles no what was needed was a miraculous intervention that would see them catching up in just the next few hours a bow chaser skilfully laid to take down a mast no fultons safety could not be put at risk a stray recollectionand he had it put us about mr dowse he said take us back this instant there were disbelieving cries but kydd was having none of it get those men moving he bellowed ignoring renzis bewilderment under the impetus of her rapidly spinning helm teazer swung right round the wind until hard up heading back for the deal foreshore as speedily as she could boat in the water the instant were within soundings kydd ordered sudden understanding spread around the deck their captain was going cap in hand back to the admiral disappointment replaced frustration but kydd seemed unaffected i want a particular boats crew he demanded and named among others stirk poulden and mr midshipman calloway the mystified men padded aft kydd waited until they were mustered a wisp of a smile playing on his face then he stiffened and snapped barkers and slashers answering grins surfacedpistols and cutlasses could only mean kydd expected to close with the french in the very near future as teazer slewed to the wind and stopped the men tumbled into the launchbut before kydd could be the last to board renzi pushed past and clambered in nicholas this is not your fight m friend he said in a low voice in the past renzi had been insistent on detaching himself from the naval hierarchy reserving the right only to take up arms if the very ship was threatened youve a fine idea as im sanguine will prove diverting old fellow you wouldnt begrudge me the entertainment the boat shoved off and poulden took the tiller after him sir he said watching the lugger with a frown although the light breeze was only sending the vessel along at walking pace it was beyond even the stoutest hearts to come up to it under oars no take us in kydd ordered ignoring the puzzled looks the boat grounded lightly in the shingle and kydd was away up the beach immediately he knew where to go and quickly told the man what he wanted now or sooner mr cribben and itll be three guineas the man the lazy afternoon on the deal foreshore turned suddenly into a scene of activity urgent shouts broke the stillness as small boys raced away hovellers stumbled blinking from their huts others from the grogshops all converging on one long shed amid the sprawl of shanties further along the beach cribben muttered angrily to the knot of locals who stood glaring at the kings men suspiciously eventually thrusting past them and throwing open the shed doors a surge followed then from inside came the lusty call alaw boat haaauuul and out from the gloom under the urging of a score of men appeared the darkvarnished sharp prow of a long low oared craft this was quite a different matter from the iron sturdiness of the hovelling lugger there in unaccustomed daylight for all to see was the notorious deal galleypunt low and mean in build it could make the french coast in two hours with twenty men at the oars in good weather and was known to be much favoured by smugglers and others of like need when the vessel was afloat in the gently lapping sea the navy men were sent forward while the oarsmen scrambled in and then they were off with low feathering strokes that were quick and efficient at night these would leave no telltale white splashes they skimmed across the balmy seas and kydd dared hope the rowers had quickly fallen into a rhythm and the strokes lengthened to produce a breathtaking dash across the waters but several miles ahead the fishingboat had won the open sea and now nothing was between it and calais already in plain sight stretch out for your lives kydd roared at the men of deal who made a show of increasing speed then wise in the ways of sailors he added you catch em and its a cask o beer and another guinea each leaving england to sink into anonymity astern the rowers laboured on and on in a uniform dip and pull that was regular to the point of hypnotic studied blankness on their faces as they concentrated on the effort there was no doubt that they were catching the fishingboat but would they be in time when the rolling dunes and cliffs of calais were in stark clarity it was nevertheless clear that the race would be won pale faces appeared at the stern and kydds men prepared themselves stirk had a wicked grin as he tightened his red bandanna around his head and eased the pistols in his belt kydd waited for the right moment and bawled across the last dozen yards in the kings name come to or we fire into you faces showed again and raised voices were heard but the lugger did not vary its course lay us alongside aft kydd hissed the rowers panted and sweated but the freshening breeze now cooling them was at the same time their enemy under its gathering strength the lugger dipped and swayed daintily then began slowly to pull aheadit was agonising stirk the grapnel kydd barked it was a last chancebut at thirty feet stirk stood braced in the foresheets coiling the line deliberately the main turns in his left hand the grapnel and flying turns in his right and began his swing casting wider and faster and then at precisely the right moment he flung out the grapnel sailed acrossand clunked firmly on the luggers plain transom well done toby kydd gasped watching stirk complete his feat by deftly taking turns around the little samson post and belay letting the rope take up to allow them to be towed by the fishingboat haul in willing hands leaned out and heaved but as they neared the vessel a face appeared above the transom with a heavy pistol it firedand renzi was flung backwards into the bottom of the boat an instant later three pistols returned the shot the man threw up his hands and slumped over the stern kydd dropped to his friendbut renzi was already pulling himself up his lower thigh wet with blood from an ugly scoring along his side damn the fellow he said faintly ruined a good pair of breeches reassured kydd looked up to where the transom was being rapidly hauled in poulden was first over in a lightning heave and leap kydd and stirk followed landing on the cluttered after deck and scuttling over to the side to take in the situation it was deserted except for right forward where fulton was kneeling bound and gagged over him a man stood with a cocked pistol at his head get back he barked harshly jabbing fulton with the muzzle get back in the boatnow kydd froze to be so near to success a dead fulton would be a disasterbut perhaps that would be preferable to allowing bonaparte to take possession of the inventor he hesitated but the decision was taken out of his hands behind him renzi had hauled himself painfully on board he drew out his sword a lowly hanger and hobbled forward purposefully nicholasno kydd blurted was he through his beliefs contemptuous of fultons life hell die the man shouted the muzzle at fultons ear renzi took no notice and came steadily on he diesnow the pistol aimed and the finger tightened but renzi did not waver still moving forward coldly he detached the weapon from the mans hand and tossed it in the sea stunned the others rushed up and seized the agent releasing fulton who fell retching what in blazesnicholas no mystery dear fellow their orders were to recover fulton for bonapartes service it stands to reason that no servant of the emperor would dare destroy him out of spite if theres a chance he might be secured later kydd chuckled you took a risk on it nicholas m friend not so much renzi said with perfect equanimity for if he killed me with but one shot in his pistol fulton would still be safe and i flatter myself he could be certain your vengeance was sure and if fulton was not then alas i could not forgive myself that the world would then be deprived of a most terrible new submarine boat in the deathly silence nothing could be heard but a tiny tick tick tick it came from a neat but incredibly complex brass mechanism secured in a vice which the three men were watching suddenly with a loud clack a sear rotated to allow a hammer arm to spring forward tugging a lanyard there was an instant fizz of priming and a small column of smoke which rose and hung as if to mark the passing of a moment of portent there i give you twentynine minutes gentlemen fulton grunted lowering his fob watch and can thereby guarantee a detonation timed almost to the very minute kydd glanced at the expressionless face of the old watchmaker and murmured to time to the instant when an unknowing man must be launched into eternitythis is our achievement fulton looked at him sharply we progress he said coldly as we must kydd said heavily then pulled himself together so whats our standing in the venture now fulton first addressed the watchmaker thank you mr jones therell be one or two small changes then im content to recommend the placing of an order for say fifty mechanisms to be delivered without delay wwhat hhow many did you say he stuttered it willsir i cannot possibly then i must find someone who can no no sir ii will hire every watchmaker in kent if need be butbut this will cost um it will be expensive no matter leave it with our mr hammond fulton said airily and turned to answer kydd well now we have all the design testing complete there will be some adjustments to my plans and then you may inform your masters that the production of ordnance may begin adjustments a few ive decided we must field all three designs of torpedo the large coffer against which even a shipotheline cannot stand a small coffer for the lesser breeds and a hogshead carcass as will be used against the flotilla he pondered a little and added this is all supposing your friends catamarans are equal to the task of course the extra charge weight is not insignificant but we may say teazers task is complete for the moment as soon as kydd entered the three kings it was obvious that the atmosphere had changed dyer of falcon and mills of bruiser were slumped opposite each other at an empty fireplace and an officer he didnt know stood with a glass gazing moodily out over the anchorage there was no sign of savery ahoy there the bruisers kydd called cheerily the man looked the other way but dyer nodded wearily captain savery not at his friday occasion he asked signalling to the steward a supernaculum for my friends as need a recuperative he ordered looking about genially to mark their preference capn savery is not here mr kydd mills said suddenly swivelling to look at him oh well i hes up agin the french coast i wasnt aware where hes been at the last month without even hes hauled off for a purgation the officer at the window turned to look curiously at kydd are you new on the coast sir not so kydd said nettled at his reception ive been lately detained with secret matters touching on boneys invasion plans secret hah your meaning sir kydd asked mills all the world knows o these wild motions wi infernal machines dammit not as if you was out o sight over wi the french since y know so much of my business mills then youd also know that mr pitt himself authorised emon account that in one blow we can put the fear o god into johnny crapaud as nothing else will er hows that sir the young officer had come over to listen he had refined sensitive features that is if youre at liberty to tell ohlamb out of locust gunbrig well mr lamb as well be going against the flotilla with em quite shortly you have a right t know a very ingenious american has invented a submarine boatand built one mark youwhich can swim underwater until it reaches its victim then reach out and explode the vessel above without warning good god lamb said quietly and the sailors aboard it kydd flushed in war they must expect casualties in course but thatthats no better than massacre by assassination its the future mr lamb and we must subscribe to such practices sir this is neither courageous nor honourable i cannot we have bonaparte to beat kydd said what would you have us do tell the inventor to go away were too delicate lamb did not respond standing stiff and pale but then its to no account kydd continued as in the event well not have the services of a submarine instead it will be itll be your infernals o course if they work heard the fishermen in shell ness say as the flounder still havent returned you explodin carcasses under water for gods sake mills spluttered so then what is your suggestion sir kydd asked as a twelvemonth of war sees napoleons flotilla untouched by us in the usual run o fighting gentlemen gentlemen said dyer with a sigh we have enough to do contending with the french without we assail each other for myself if we are given any weapon that promises confusion to the enemy then i vow ill not hang back from using it kydd returned to his ship in a foul mood it was not his fault that he and teazer had been kept out of the fighting and he felt the implied slights keenly there was one course however that would see them both to rights later that afternoon he left keiths cabin with the promise of active employment until he was required and within the day had his orders in view of his acquaintance with the ordnance central to the upcoming assault hms teazer would be the one to carry out the necessary reconnaissance of boulogne he remembered the sight from the sea of the boulogne hills stretching away under the sinister blanket of troop encampments and the crush of craft in the inner harbour this time there was nothing for it but to crowd in as close as he could daring everything to bring back vital information for the attack the orders as well entailed the embarking of major lovett of the th rifles knowledgeable about napoleons military dispositions and requesting an observation of boulogne two days later teazer weighed in the morning and stood out for france in an easy earlyautumn westerly breeze before long they were shortening sail off the dunes of boulogne kydd turned to his guest youve been here before major lovettan older man with an air of detachmentlowered his fieldglass i have sir many times and you know the purpose of my reconnaissance not altogether im afraid we shall be assaulting the port shortly with experimental weapons torpedoes we call em which require we close with the enemy before we launch them ill be taking an interest in tide states depth o water over the bassure banks lines of sight into the port that kind o thing quite so lovett raised his fieldglass again ah i see that the corps de garde have increased their numbersover to the left by the tour de croy it was raised ground a mile or two north do you know much of boulogne sir ive read the reports kydd said briefly scanning the ridges with his pocket telescope may i give you my appreciation by all means well as you know the salient feature is the river liane upon which boulogne resides disgorging to the sea between the hills a contemptible waterway of some fifty yards breadth only it is nevertheless the main route for the invasion of england from seaward it was easy to make out the narrow entrance as well as to glimpse the forest of masts that was the armada in its specially constructed assembly basins within what caused kydd much unease was a quartermilelong endless chain of ships moored head to stern across the river mouth parallel with the shore guns trained outwards marshal soults headquarters is beyond the fortchâtillonon the rise to the right his troops will be first to embark neys corps is at montreuil also to the right twenty thousand men alone and davoût with his fourteen regiments and batavians to the left embarking at ambleteuse thats a total of eighty thousand men within your sight mr kydd and guns marmont calls this the coast of iron and bronze and with good reason lovett continued drily for between fort de lheurt therehe indicated a squat round edifice atop an island to the rightand la crèche there to the north the guns are waiting the bombardiers monstrous mortars and howitzers at the waters edge guarded in depth by the chasseurs with the grenadiers twentyfourpounder cannon mounted on special carriages at the foreshore all in advanced firing positions and any number of field pieces deployed at will by the horse artillerysome several hundreds of significant ordnance within that single league before you kydd said nothing here too we have history lovett continued expansively the ruined tower of dordre just to the left of the entrance and up was constructed by the sainted caligula to save the souls of mariners he paused but getting back to the present napoleon it seems has found more sinister uses for it the batterie de la république is a perfect nest of artillery set to play upon any who will make motions towards the egress of the flotilla or such as dare interfere with it and that is all lovett ignored kydds ironical tone well we have the railliement to mock our approach with six and twelvepounders but beyond that there is only the concentrated musketry of those eighty thousand troops kydds face tightened it was utter madness what were fultons curiosities against this overwhelming strength would the men flinch as they were ordered into this inferno of fire the future of the world depended on the answers we shall attack at night of course kydd said hoping his voice held conviction the darkness might help conceal them but it made the task of the torpedo launchers more difficult by eye kydd plotted an approach from the westsouthwestthe critical fivefathom line at datum was a mile offshore according to the chart of all possibilities it was the least discouraging there was the fire of the fort de lheurt to be endured but place us with le portel at soueast b east mr dowse kydd ordered there was one way to find out what they faced and that was to track down this approach and see what came their way aye aye sir dowse replied tersely the first guns opened up on teazer as they crossed the fivefathom line under cautious sail on a line of bearing for the narrow estuary of the sluggish river from various points along the sandhills and beaches a lazy puff and thump announced a battery taking the opportunity of exercising on a live target kydd had calloway and the masters mate moyes noting the precise position and estimated weight of metal of each notwithstanding the likelihood that the heavier guns would be reserved for worthier targets the plash of strikes appeared in the sea but kydd was too experienced to let it worry him most were close but all around them and he knew that the only ones to worry about were those in line but shortthey revealed a gun laid true and the likelihood that they would be struck on the ricochet how close could he go only a fraction of the guns were firing a brigsloop would be a common enough sight as enterprising young officers tried to steal a quick glimpse at the threats within suddenly there was a sharp slap and a hole appeared in teazers foretopsail their angling approach had the advantage of reducing fire from the further coast but at the cost of an increasing tempest from the nearer which now showed in its true numbers in the continuous rolling thunder roils of powdersmoke viciously pierced by gunflashes and the tearing whuup sound of passing shot it became clear that nothing more would be accomplished by daylight at least they could return with their personal report of what faced the attackers that will do mr dowse do you now bear away for he never finished the order for with a sudden thump and an appalling longdrawnout splintering crash teazer came to a sudden stop slewing drunkenly sideways and throwing everyone to the deck the foretop and maintopgallant masts tumbled down in ruinous confusion smothering men in canvas and snarls of rope there was an instants terrified incomprehension then cries and shouts erupted from all parts of the ship kydd fought his way from under the mad flapping folds knowing what must have happened a collision in broad daylight and fair weather it was bafflinginconceivable kydd did not remember another ship within miles of teazer he discarded the last of the torn sail and looked round wildly where was the other vessel was it sunk throw off all tacks n sheets he bellowed frantic to take the strain off a motionless vessel under full sail purchet stormed about the canted deck with a ropes end bringing back order while others picked themselves up from where they had been thrown ignoring the imploring hallum kydd tried furiously to work out what had happened but then he saw the wreckage alongsidedark seawet timbers planks over framing welling up sullenly that could only have come from another ships hull and alien to teazers build olderproof that they had collided with another ship and crushed her underfoot to be mercilessly swallowed by the sea his mind reeled there had been no sighting no sudden cries from the doomed shipwhy had they not then he had it traces of seaweed on the timbers an even scatter of barnaclesthis was not another ship they had collided with but a recent wreck lying off the port they had piled into there was little time for a moment of relief though kydd became aware of redoubled fire from the shore clear away this raffle he threw at purchet i mean t get away before the french come there was nothing more certain than that gunboats galleys even would be quickly on the scene these could stand off and batter the immovable sloop to ruin in minutes with icy foreboding kydd tried to think of a way outtraditional moves such as lightening by heaving water leaguers overside would not work in time and if he jettisoned his guns he would be rendered helpless should he tamely surrender it was the humane thing to do in a hopeless situation such as this there were things that must be done moyesduck down and ask the cook to get his fire going sir he said blinking to destroy the signal books and confidentials kydd rapped impatiently and what else must he do in this direful extremity find his commission this would be proof to those taking him prisoner of his officer status but what was there to say to his crew they were certain to spend the rest of the war in misery locked fast in one of the prison fortresses a rising tide of rage threatened his reason this was not how it should be teazer had a destiny in the coming final struggle two foot in the well the carpenter had broken in on his thoughts could be much worsen that he said without conviction but if the sloop was shattered they would have been swimming for it by now theyre comin sir the ship was directly opposite the river entrance and through the outer line of moored ships beetling shapes of oared gunboats now made towards them the tide mr dowse the holding was good and if they were granted time to stream a kedge they could conceivably haul off if only itll be falling in a halfhour mr kydd it meant they were in slack water at the height of the tide and then a settling on the wreck below and the gunboats were clear of the line of ships and on their way bitter thoughts came but kydd knew that very soon he had a decision to maketo fight hopelessly or haul down his flag then as if by a miracle teazer stirred a protracted groaning from deep within her bowels and a jerking realignment that saw her shifting by inches to be more parallel to the shore could this be were being shoved offan its b courtesy o france itself dowse said gleefully and pointed to the port entrance it took kydd a moment or two to grasp it but then he laughed why so we are i should have smoked it hands t set sail if y please sir if youd be so good to explain hallum said plaintively of course mr hallum you see yonder thats boulogne and the river liane were directly opposite so the current from the river is pressing us to seaward we cannot resist it will have its way and soon we will be carried off our place of resting and then were homeward bound chapter to the intense satisfaction of her captain and the relief of her crew hms teazer sailed from sheerness dockyard two weeks later the shipwrights there proving more than a match for the damage sustained the town was much as kydd remembered from the time of the great mutiny seven years before bleak windswept and far from any civilisation worth the name even hardened seamen were weary of the squalor of blue town and the stink of the marshes the sloop rounded the promontory for the nore then sailed south for north foreland and the downs kydds blood was up production of the ordnance must be close to completion and now teazer was ready to play her part in a fever of anxiety he made his number with the flagship and lost no time in reporting aboard keith seemed preoccupied but acknowledged teazers accession to his forcesand disclosed that production of the munitions was at such an advanced stage that staff planning had begun for the operation kydd should hold himself in readiness for a councilofwar at which he might expect a role it was on his charge as nursemaid to fulton was at an end and now he would rejoin the war a very different one from that of the past torpedoes submarines stealth destructionif this was the future he was dutybound to prepare himself to be a part of it the operation was to be led by popham in view of his interest in the new weapons and his role in developing the catamarans he had gone to the admiralty to discuss strategy kydd felt left in suspense but then was called to a conference with keith gentlemen the admiral said flatly to his officers around the table i have been apprised that the ordnance is ready sufficient to make an initial descent on the flotilla i have no doubt you realise that time is not on our side the season is far advanced and the weather cannot always be relied on to be in our favour there was a murmur of agreement and besides it may well be in bonapartes mind to launch his invasion before the weather closes in and prevents it any means to deter this until the spring may be accounted worth the attempting kydd was one of three commanders at the conference the others eight postcaptains were far his senior only two of whom popham and savery he recognised keith continued like it or no we must make our move at the next favourable timea strong spring tide on the flood in the early darkness and no moon the next of which being in eight days time this left precious little time for preparation to the operation itself i have to inform you all that as a consequence of the gravity of the situation the first lord of the admiralty lord melville himself is to be present at the engagement and i myself will take personal command in monarch pophams head jerked up sir i have to say i shall be in command and thats an end to it sir clearly keith was under pressure at the highest level now this action has clear and definite aims the reduction of bonapartes invasion flotilla by any and all means after an eventful reconnaissance by teazer i have come to the conclusion that a direct assault against the port is not to be considered there were murmurs of heartfelt agreement nelsons bloody failure at the same task had been all too recent but a further investigation by locust has shown that the ships moored across the entrance are not a defensive squadron they are the overplus vessels of the flotilla unable to find room within the port the formidable barrier was only troopcarrying transports with makeshift armament this was a different matter entirely one hundred and fifty sailand these shall be the target of the first onslaught from our new weapons gentlemen a babble of interjection arose put down firmly by the unsmiling keith i go further this entire action is to be considered a proving of the torpedoes and coffers no engagement is contemplated of the regular kind astonishment and jealousy in turn showed on the faces of those assembled as it became clear that any distinction won would be with torpedoes other weapons merely defensivetheir keepers the attacking force will be in three divisions the torpedoes in the centre defended on either side by a strong force from my squadron myself in monarch to seaward three sixtyfours and two fiftygun ships with five frigates flanking them at depth if there was enemy interference with the cumbersome craft in the act of launching their torpedoes it would turn into a bloodbath the torpedoes in turn will be in three divisions the centre with catamarans of mr pophams invention which are near invisible and have the chance of penetrating to the closest and these shall be armed with the er hogsheads in column on either side will be launches towing the coffers the largest of which i have been reliably informed are now of two tons weight with the colossal charge of the equivalent of forty barrels of powder each he ignored the gasps of incredulity further to complete and make certain our descent we will employ four explosion ships which will carry similar amounts and will be set on course to intersect the enemy line before they are abandoned these with all our engines of destruction will be fitted with the new mechanical timing machine that will be set to detonate the charges at precisely the right position this was as unlike any prebattle council that kydd had ever experienced and the glances of consternation among the others revealed that he was not the only one to feel as he did there had been no appeal to lay ones ship alongside the enemy no talk of conduct becoming the traditions of the service no detail of complex signals enjoining complicated manoeuvres and worst of all it promised to be a battle in the night the defenders not even brought face to face in the encounter the torpedoes doing their work unseen it was unreal and disturbing to many in a navy whose traditions were resolutely to close and grapple with an enemy until the issue was decided keith seemed to sense the unease and his tone took on a stiff joviality i leave it to you gentlemen to conceive of the terror in the hearts of the french at the destruction wrought in their midst by unknown and superior weapons thus i do confide in you my hopes for a good success in this enterprise queries and doubts were voiced concerning responsibilities timing command but all responses came down in the end to a single task of getting the torpedoes to their target when the questions had tailed off keith resumed i have mentioned the three divisions of torpedoes at the seaward head of each column a dispatching sloop will be responsible for sending them in the central being the catamarans will be in overall command with responsibility for pressing home the assault he looked round grimly then settled his gaze on kydd as the only one of us with experience of these devices this task is assigned to commander kydd exultant but more than a little fearful kydd considered his position carefully in effect he was a mini commodore placed above another two commanders in the most important job in the operation and under the direct eye of the commanderinchiefnot only him but the first lord of the admiralty too under no circumstance must he fail he retired to his great cabin and began his planning but as the list of priorities and concerns grew so did his anxieties the articles of war required whole ships of men officers included to obey his every order without questioneven if they were mistaken or illthoughtthrough and once the deadly machines were put into motion they could neither be summoned back nor even signalled to his orders had better be the right ones the first vital matter was to establish the characteristics of the weapons handling firing or whatever this would form the basis of the training and operational orders and would give him time to think portsmouth mr hallum its there well make trial of our infernals the catamarans now being at lymington the torpedoes produced at priddys hard o course the overnight voyaging saw teazer enter the familiar harbour early the next day but this time passing beyond the great dockyard into the large enclosed expanse of shallow water beyond it was deserted but for a line of ships in ordinary in the deeper water along the western side well suited for trials of a secret weapon teazer sailed on as far as she could in the shallowing water and picked up moorings at the head of a channel through the mudflats horsea island she waited patiently but it took some hours for a dockyard hoy to bring the weapons across the water from priddys hard an interested but wary ships company had their first sight of the new weapons of war ugly beasts kydd murmured to hallum who seemed lost for words as he stared down at them low in the water alongside and within a canvas screen they were dormant in the evening light submerged until the upper surfaces were nearly awash one of each type black deadly and evil fulton arrived as the sun was lowering in a fluster after some disagreement with officials of the ordnance board he and kydd with duckitt went over the side and into a low punt this is your hogshead fulton said and slapped its swelling bulk affectionately it reverberated sullenly a black parody of a large barrel of beer next to it floated a low cylindrical device its exterior smooth blackpainted copper but much bigger than the first with a single line and grapnel the small coffer then outside them all lay a crocodilian shape all of twenty feet long its dark menace barely visible under the surface the large coffer fulton said lightly and stepped on to it from the punt it barely gave betraying its tremendous weight er how heavy is it toot no moren two tons get him going at the enemy theres nothing on gods earth will stop him sir duckitt asked quietly an how do we er fire em good question youve to throw aside all notions o firing these dont mess with slowmatchwe use a modern mechanism an how cn we be sure see here fulton pointed out a slightly recessed indentation inside is your timing engine screw in the plug and for every turn the explosion takes place five minutes later he demonstrated twisting deftly kydd started surely fulton had not initiated the detonation three turns fifteen minutes this handsome machine is charged and armed and will explode in a quarterhour duckitt caught his breath were it not for this fulton flourished an object very similar to a miniature belaying pin the safety peg it comes from herehe pointed to a tiny hole next to the timing screw fortunately occupied by an identical oneand so long as he sleeps in his hole all is tranquil withdraw it and whatever is set on the timing will be the moment of destiny for the coffer no one spoke but fulton grinned inanely a contrivance of beauty and perfection dont you think kydd needed timemuch more than the days he had keiths orders were clear and sound he was keeping back his conventional warships on outer guard tasks to allow the torpedoes clear sight of the enemy a prudent and sensible measure given the disaster that would eventuate in the fog of war if a ship in the night chaos were to plough through the slowmoving and nearinvisible catamarans but it meant as well that he alone was responsible for devising the technique that would see them to the launch point and a successful conclusion the first worry was the size of the beasts the large coffer would need the biggest of ships boats to get it going against inertia and water resistance and he could not see how a small coffer could be brought aboard the catamaran even the hogsheads were huge and unhandy it would be asking a lot of the crews a soft sunset had finally faded into the advancing night they could begin pipe the launchs crew to muster he ordered expecting the order they quickly appeared poulden he said to the coxswain firmly this is not a time for volunteers theyll be called on the night were to attack at this time i want a measure of how well these infernals swim it had slipped outit couldnt be helped take the large coffer in tow six fathoms astern when you reach a cable or so off slew it around and at the bosuns pipe lay out with all your heart clear poulden could be relied on to get the best out of his men but he dropped his eyes and mumbled um sir is it as who should say tender in its motions if youre worried about it exploding precipitate like dont the safety peg is in however er do keep clear of its hawse its armed and has a full charge uncharacteristically muted the boats crew tumbled into the launch secured the coffer and bent to their oars straining and tugging produced only the slightest movement and it was long minutes before they were able to heave it off into the darkness it was a clear night and a quartermoon was rising at a cables length when the boat made its turn gingerly kydd was dismayed to see its beetling black shadow clearly against the glittering moonpath as promised though the torpedo was all but invisible he took out his watch and held it to catch the light from the binnacle lamp the boatswain raised his call ready pipe he said the distant rowers started in a flurry of strokes but slowed immediately to a near stop pouldens frenzied hazing could be heard floating across the waterit made kydd smile but on the night it would not do twenty minutes on the return this was dismaying hes a pig t steer sir poulden reported after returning aboard worsen a bull in a paddock as is shy o the knife a catamaran was available now and it was brought round as kydd had suspected there was no possibility that the small coffer could be raised and carried on the flimsy gratings fore and aft it would require ships boats as well load with hogsheads kydd said after the two reluctant oarsmen had taken their place at the stubby sculls one was swayed across and lashed in place the catamaran settled at an angle until the other was aboard and then with a heavy reluctance the ungainly craft shoved off same as the others if y please kydd told them they made slow progress but this was due to their near comic performance at the sculls so close to the water they turned and started back this was more encouraginginches above the water only it was difficult indeed to make them out but it was hard going helped aboard the two oarsmen soaked from the shoulders down shuddered uncontrollably every man as pulls a plunging boat is entitled to a double tot if he wants it kydd ordered get em dry and see its served out immediately too much hung on their efforts for rest and the remainder of the night was spent in timed trials with two boats on the coffer then three the smaller with the pinnace at an angle to the launch and the carcass between and of course the procedure for recovering the operations crew after the launch it was done he had the facts now for the figuring but when he awoke later in the morning doubts and anxieties flooded in send them in as a broad wave or in stealthy column the coffers first or the catamarans request some kind of diversionary tactic would volunteers step forward when the time came and the orders his orders the first he had ever given as a squadron commander as in reality he was he bent to the task nibbling his quill so much to plan and decide its madness is what i say exploded mills settin these vile contraptions afloat wi a quarterton of powder an two men sailing t meet the enemy ive never heard such have a care mr mills kydd barked these are my orders and i mean them to be obeyed if you have objections im sure admiral keith would like t hear them with mens lives in the balance only trust and teamwork would see it through he resolved to catch mills privately later teazers great cabin seemed an incongruous setting for such a briefing kydd had seen this room dappled by waterreflected moonlight from warm and exotic mediterranean harbours it had been the scene of his hopes and fearsand now was to be the place of his disposing of so many destinies containing his emotions he resumed his orders the large coffers will have two boats each and will set off first on either side of the designated channel the faster catamarans will then move forward and past the coffers being able to penetrate unseen up to the french line where the torpedoes will be launched he paused conscious his words had rung with false confidence then went on the recovery of the catamaran crews will be the responsibility of mr lamb and his little fleet o gigs the whole operation should take less than two hours how do we give coverin fire if were laying off t seaward growled mills kydd bit his lip now was not the time for a confrontation you dont the whole point is to stand clear of the channel of approach and let the torpedoes go in and do their work quietly youre a dispatch vessel crew the catamarans and boats and send em on their way only no play with the gunsis that clear lamb seemed troubled and dyers face showed resignation but they paid attention while the remaining details were laid outelementary signals concerning the start and others for cancellation of the assault provision for an assemblyanddispatch sequence launch timing accounting for munitions expended the order of night mooring kydd tried to end on an upbeat note in the morning theres to be practice with the catamarans and my gunner mr duckitt will instruct on the timing engine and other now gentlemen this is our chance t give boney a drubbing as he cant be expecting lets make it a good un shall we it seemed so thin so fragile but was this because he didnt really believe in the infernalsor himself the final conference was in monarch and keith wasted no words im sailing at noon to anchor before boulogne at sunset i want the assaulting division to be ready for launch three hours after sunset namely nine pm mr kydd aye aye sir savery coughed er sir to appear in force in full view of the enemy before sunset theyll surely know somethings afoot cant be helped the torpedo craft need to know where we are in the darkness so they will fix our position while daylight reigns they wont do that if were tacking and veering about all the time and it hardly needs pointing out that weve not been strangers to this coast and while well be arriving in force the enemy has no conceiving of the nature of our assault we attack as planned weighed down with anxieties kydd returned to his ship now there would be the call for volunteers an advisement to his dispatch sloopsit was all but committed he swung over the bulwark touching his hat to the boatswain at his call renzi stood there his face grave then we sail against the flotilla he said quietly he was using a cane to support his wounded leg we do kydd said then added nicholas this is not your wari want you ashore ashore of course not theres youll go and thats my order he said harshly staring his friend down very well then i must do as im bid renzi said softly he slowly held out his hand can imay i sincerely wish that you do fare well in what must come kydds bleak expression did not alter he took the hand briefly then turned and hurried below hms teazer led the torpedo squadron to sea for kydd the overcast autumn day had a particularly oppressive and lowering undertone some five miles off boulogne the fleet assembled about the flagshipfrigates minor shipsoftheline sloops cutters and at the centre what gave it its purpose before sunset the fleet had formed up opposite the port the approach channel for the catamarans was resolved the dispatch sloops positioned to seaward and aboard each the process of arming the torpedoes was put in train locust moved up between them put its borrowed cluster of gigs in the water and suddenly there was nothing further to do a sombre dusk fell among the hills the campfires of napoleons host twinkled into existence their myriad expanse a feral menace that seemed to reach right out to them the last of the days radiance hardened into a moonless night a dark almost dense enough to touch surrounding ships lost their outline and were swallowed in the blackness leaving only the single riding lights of the british fleet and the red and gold dots along the hills kydd could only wait his plans were straightforward enough but what were they next to the reality before him the catamarans were already in the water but not the hogsheads which must be swayed aboard fully armed and struck down on their gratings by feelno lights could be allowed to betray warlike activity the watch mustered and the volunteers sailors who had willingly stepped up when called upon that afternoon who had trusted him in the matter of riding these infernal machines to victory against the foe or a lump rose in his throat would any of them survive the night with false jollity jokes were cracked in the ageold way as they pulled on their black guernseys laced on dark caps and rubbed galley soot into their faces some yawned a sure sign of prebattle nerves sirflagship the usual three riding lights in the tops of monarch were replaced by four as they watched the fourth was dimmed the signal into the catamarans the volunteers kydd ordered crisply trying to conceal his feelings without speaking the first two went down the side and with gasps at the cold took their places in the catamaran scheduled to lead the attack as i live and breathe hallum whispered this is something i could not do i confess it it was too much in a rising tide of feeling kydd leaned over and called hoarsely timmins out o the boatim the one to lead the catamarans the group on the quarterdeck fell back in shock kydd wasted no time in stripping to his breeches and when the dripping timmins appeared on deck he took the mans guernsey and cap then went hastily over the side only remembering at the last minute to throw at the openmouthed lieutenant you have the ship mr hallum the sea was shockingly cold as kydd settled into the little underwater seat and oriented himself so close to the water the restless wavelets now held spite and teazer loomed in the darkness her barnacles and seagrowth so close there were voices then stirk was claiming the place of the other in the catamaran he clambered into the forward seat cursing vigorously at the cold thank ye toby kydd said in a low voice if n yere going mr kydd yell need one as knows th buggers like stirk grunted and signalled up to the deck as gunners mate he had helped duckitt instruct the others the first hogshead came to be grappled by stirk and struck down on the gratings he made an expert slippery hitch then gave another signal to the deck the other came down aft and kydd struggled to ease the monstrous bulk onto its grating numb fingers passed the lashing and finished with the hitch to release it shove off he growled pushing at the huge ships side with his light scull almost subsurface the catamaran was a heavy awkward thing and he panted with the effort of getting it going this was going to be near impossible he thought in despair they cleared teazers side and pulled out into the channel low hails came from others in the vicinity kydd looked about carefully shivering all the while with the bitter cold there seemed no betraying noise or bustle in the anchored fleet and turning shorewards he saw no sign of any french alarm then he peered into the blackness towards the distant and barely visible line of ships that were their target no indications of suspicionbut then the french had every reason to suppose that if there was an assault it would be at dawn in the usual way he looked behindnothing ahead the line of ships we go he hissed and dug in his sculls it was an unreal and frightening world of cold darkness and beckoning danger stroke after stroke double feathered and as silent as possible onward towards the target muffled splashes from behind told him that the others had fallen into line with him stroke pull return stroke on and on then quite suddenly they were close enough to individual ships that they needed conscious alterations of course to head towards themthey were nearing the launch point and still no alarm it was time to select a victim curiously there was no feeling only the calculated judgement of range and bearing hssst stirk stopped rowing what is it whispered kydd urgently i thought i heardits a frenchy then kydd made out a regular creak and splash of oars in the blackness to the left the enemy was rowing guard on the moored ships in a pinnace get down they bent as low as they could faces slapped by the cold sea and waited should he give orders to retreat now while they could kydd wondered if they were discovered it would be slaughter with no mercy shivering violently he heard the sound approach then cross and with no change of rhythm move away to the right apart from the ceaseless rustling of the night waters there was nothing more than a faraway peal of merriment a shouted hail between sentries anonymous sounds it was time for the climax cast off the line tobyits secured to the other it was part of fultons plan to squeeze a ship between two explosions by connecting the two hogsheads with a line and cork float which on the incoming tide would fetch up on their victims anchor cable and inexorably draw in the charges on both sides set for twenty minutes toby he called softly and waited while the turns were made thatll do he said as casually as he could well launch now pull the peg cuffin there was a jerk and stirk turned and handed him the safety pin kydds orders were that all pegs should be returned as a surety that the torpedoes had been launched properly after a quick tug on the hitch and persuasion with both feet the giant carcass plunged into the sea with a shattering splash they dug in their sculls to move out the requisite hundred feet but a sputtering and popping of muskets started urgently from the line of shore they had been discovered the sound grew and was joined by heavier guns pull kydd gasped they were moving parallel with the shore to launch the second hogshead but the firing grew steadily in intensity the timing mechanism was already primed so he fumbled with the safety peg and footed the monstrous thing clear to splash weightily in the sea they had done it torpedoes away nothing could stop their rapid retreat but they found themselves stroking into a strong floodtide the riding lights at the masthead of the flagship were just dimly visible but now the shore artillery had added its weight to the barrage and the entire foreshore of boulogne was alive with gunflash it was only a matter of time before they were spottedand the venom of a hundred guns unleashed on them they passed another catamaran going in the other direction resolutely pressing forward into the inferno to its launch position with others on their way behind kydds eyes pricked at their bravery it was some minutes before he realised that surprisingly with all the blazing guns there was no shotstrike nearby miraculously they had a chance the gunners were nightblinded by the flash of their own guns and without a knowledge of what their targets were even with fixed lines of fire they were aiming high presuming a usual form of attack go to it toby he bawled stretching out until his muscles burned then blessedly they were up with the gigs and being pulled into the boats with words of rough sailorly sympathy they fell back on the dispatch sloops kydd was hauled aboard his ship utterly exhausted but insisted on remaining on the upper deck where he sat in a chair shivering under a cloak it should be at any time now with the sky and sea a fiery pandemonium it was difficult to make out anything the french were firing wildly into the night not understanding what was going on they would soon find out thought kydd grimly then something clutched at his heart so many brave sailors would before long be blasted to piecesat his hand the rage and fervour of battle ebbed a little was renzi right that this furtive creeping and stealthy detonating were no better than coldblooded murder with a dull spirit kydd waited for the first cataclysmbut none came perhaps it was asking too much of the delicate watchmaking art to function in this wet chaos but then the sudden thump and roar of a colossal explosion tore at his senses its flash lighting the sea in sharp relief for miles the firing dying away in awe at the spectacle anotherthis time an even larger one which seemed to be on the far side of the defensive line morethen a gigantic roar in the centre and more fultons infernals had worked to perfection but at each detonation kydds heart wrung at where mans ingenuity and creative spirit had led himand that the world must now change the last explosion died the guns petered out and suddenly there was nothing left but to return to the downs and home when teazer had picked up her moorings opposite the slumbering town of deal and sea watches had been stood down kydd went to his cabin and collapsed into his cot exhaustion and reaction made sleep impossible and his thoughts raced on into nightmarebattles in the future fought under water and englands mighty shipsoftheline replaced by swarms of catamarans and for ever the fear that any stout ship brought to her rest after hard voyaging might without warning be blown to splinters with all her crew he drifted off but was gently woken by renzi dear brother im desolated to intrude on your rest but admiral keith does require your attendance er what o clock is it then kydd asked struggling awake eleven kydd pulled himself up then this is the first reconnaissance now returned i must go he would soon be faced with the product of his nights work the tally of blood that would hang about his neck for the rest of his life he slipped to the deck catching sight of himself in the mirror grey drawn and old teazers boat bore him to the flagship the bright morning a mockery of what had gone before gravely welcomed by the flaglieutenant he was shown to the great cabin with the others there were few pleasantries and keith entered grimfaced ive first to thank you all for a stout and bravely executed action of the last eveningbeing as it was in the best traditions of the service he paused letting his gaze move about the seated officers further ive to inform you of the results of the first reconnoitre now to hand a ripple of interest went round but keiths bleak countenance did not change gentlemen the torpedo contrivances exploded to expectationseach and every one the chill of dread stole over kydd as he steeled himself for the news keith leaned forward and i have to tell you they did so to no effect none nothing whatsoever the flotilla remains as it did before kydds mind reeled none he had personally i find that at great hazard to our seamen the torpedoes were launched to order and further that they were correctly armed and prepared resulting as weve seen in their successful exploding what was not in expectation was that the method of their delivery to the target has signally failed us and quite frankly i cannot readily conceive of any other the sudden buzz of talk was cut short by keith who went on and now the french are aroused and no doubt preparing a mode of defence to meet them this can only be construed as nothing less than a catastrophic failure of the weapons gentlemen as a direct result well not be troubling you with such contrivances any further that is all the meeting broke up in a babble of noise but keith called mr kydd a word with you sir still shocked kydd made his way through the hubbub sir you should know that i believe your part in last nights action was entirely to my satisfaction thank you sir but now it is over done with you are forthwith relieved of your duties with the american and will rejoin my downs squadron flags will attend to the consequentials understood sir stumbling out into the bright sunlight kydd in his tiredness did not notice the lonely figure waiting by the mainmast all he knew was that he had failed his brave little fleet had achieved a derisory nothing the enemy was untouched no greater condemnation of a warriors endeavours could be made tom tom old friend fulton took his shoulder and swung him round what have you heard did you give the french a quilting kydd looked up dully no nothing touched yyou mean they exploded but without effect we did our bestbut im to be taken off duties with you toot your contract will be at hazard id believe fulton staggered back theythey cant im promised tom my friend if youll stay with me speak with your high and mighty friends in the admiralty im sorry you tried your besti tried it wasnt enough wait ive some newsome ideas as will stretch the mind will change everything youll see i wish you well toot but its finished i have t go now the world hasnt heard the last of me ive only begun to conjure ideas listen but kydd had reached the side and with a last wave left to return to his old existence you knew kydd said when renzi hobbled into his cabin with a brandy i did your sailor is not a retiring sort when stepping ashore after a hard action kydd said nothing holding his glass and staring unseeingly nicholas i have to live with this failure for all of my life he said with a catch in his voice not at all renzi began but kydd cut him off is there any more disgrace than a commander of men who leads them on intonothing savagely he drained his brandy and slapped the glass down ill be a laughing stock its not you theyll laugh at brother what do you mean nicholas speak up the men ashore theyre singing glees about the infernalsabout frogtoasters and catamarans that can do no better than entertain the enemy to an expensive fireworks show thats unfair fulton tried they are right dear fellow renzi said firmly he triedand failed the time is not ripe for such dread weapons the wit is there but the substance to work with is too frail it is too new the mechanicals not so advanced in sophistication he regarded kydd with an odd smile there will be a time im persuaded when a submarine boat will be a common sightand no doubt huge and with a steam engine to boot your torpedoes will probably come with paddlewheels that allow them to seek out the enemy at a far distancebut not now their moment is not yet kydd closed his eyes in thought then opened them youre in the right of it nicholas m friend yet while there was a chance to hammer the invasion flotilla we had to try renzi gave a halfsmile and i now concede there was no other coursefor englands sake kydd knew what this admission meant for someone of renzis moral code hes a genius is toot give him the chance and hell conjure infernal contrivances as will make the world stare its time we dont have renzi interrupted even with all the resources of a plundered continent napoleon bonaparte cannot maintain his colossal army in idleness for much longer he must make his move and this will be to clear the way for the invasion by overwhelming force to this end he will assemble the greatest fleet ever seen on this earth to crush our battle squadrons with such numbers as we cannot prevail then the world will witness such a clash of giants as will ring down the ages to resound in the history of nations as the day of destiny for all he continued relentlessly i cannot say when still less where but in my very bones i feel that within the compass of months the issue will be decided for all of time the solemn pronouncement hung in the silence for long moments and neither friend looked at the other then kydd sprang suddenly to his feet ha so its no more the enemy skulkin away where we cant get at em boneyll have t step into the ring and fight it out man to man he gave a wolfish grin bring em on authors note invasion is somewhat of a milestone in my literary career my th book in printone million words when i look back to that day in april when i held a copy of kydd in my hands for the first time i can only wonder at the enrichment thomas kydd has brought to my life since then my wife kathy and i were able to give up the day jobs and work together as a creative team and weve travelled the globe delving into the captivating world of the eighteenthcentury sailor at sea and on land weve met thousands of readers and booksellers and people from all walks of life have enthusiastically shared their specialist knowledge these range from professor jack lynch in the us an authority on georgian speech patterns to expert knottyer ken yalden in the uk to joseph muscat in malta with his deep understanding of mediterranean sailing craft i have seen the kydd books translated into japanese french russian and many other languages and published as ebooks in braille as audiobooks and in largeprint my monthly newsletter the bosuns chronicle exceeds a worldwide subscriber base of and my website now celebrates all aspects of neptunes realm thanks to regular input and feedback from readers one of the most popular pages is the shipmates album which features photographs of some of my fans from around the world including one reading seaflower on his honeymoon another with kydd on a dangerous expedition up the amazon im often asked whether my original conception of the series and its characters has changed much as ive gone onand the answer is no with the exception of perhaps two things when i first put pen to paper i thought the series would run to books now i can see it reaching at the very least to as ive delved more deeply into the period i have found theres just so much rich material in the historical record to stimulate an authors imagination the other main change is the character of renzi initially he was just to be a means of articulating in a way that the uneducated sailor could not and act as a foil to kydd however hes grown into his own character in some ways as interesting as kydd himself kathy actually tells me i am half kydd half renzi just how much an authors personal experiences influence his writing is of course very hard to say but she may have something there writing about the sea in all its moods gives me special pleasure i take great pains to ensure my prose is as accurate as possible and make daily use of ships electronic sea charts and my nowvast reference library as well as regularly consulting the various experts ive discovered over the years of course having been a professional sailor myself helps enormously in bringing to mind the sights smells and sounds of deep sea when old salts tell me theyve really felt the heave of a deck under their feet as they read my books i feel especially chuffed and whenever i can i take the opportunity to get in a bit of sea time whether in tall ships or putting to sea with the modern royal navy whose ships may be steam and steel but many of the traditions from kydds day are still honoured aboard although i have rough outlines for all the books the period of research and fleshing out of the plot at the beginning of each writing year is especially enjoyable often one tiny obscure fact will suggest a nice twist in a particular aspect of the story lineand the hunt is on to find out more about half of the year is devoted to this initial work during the other half its down to solid writing in my case about words a day kathy keeps a watchful eye on this as i go along and is always on hand with invaluable insights if required we sometimes go for a walk in the lovely woodlands along the banks of the nearby river erme to toss around ideas if i find i am writing myself into a cornerand its never failed me yet would i like to have lived in the eighteenth century i think the answer must be yes it was a far more colourful and individual time than it is today the kind of characters who walked the georgian stage will not be seen again and some of the great naval feats of the napoleonic wars will never be repeated it was also a more romantic and personally fulfilling time i feel im always taken with the soft effects of candlelight around a dinner table of the art of conversation of making your own musical entertainments in the evening these the georgians did very well in doing my research on historical people i have been fascinated by what has been discovered by modern scholarshipbut at times what we dont know about some of these personalities is more intriguing robert fulton the maverick american inventor who appears in this book is certainly a good example of this there are several biographies of fulton which i consulted extensively but he was one of those largerthanlife figures whose persona generates more questions the deeper you dig fultons nickname of toot was widely used but i can find no definitive reason for it some have suggested it derives from the whistle of the steamboat for which hes known but it seems his nickname was used before this fulton was very gifted but difficult to penetrate as a person naïve but intense a maryland farm boy he came to england by invitation and for a time lived as a portrait painter in devon near where i live he reached the status of having his work hung at the royal academy so he was no amateur but then went across to revolutionary france and extraordinarily within a year he was working on his incredible submersibles its on record that he actually met bonaparte face to face and demonstrated a working submarine the first nautilus it remained on the bed of the seine for an hour to the horror of the assembled dignitaries fulton later took it out on several armed war patrols against the british he destroyed it when the french delayed in making a commercial arrangement along the lines i spell out in the book fultons proposed machines were the first weapons of mass destructiondeliberately designed to blow up humans without warning or a chance to fight back and caused as much stir then as wmds do today did he really believe in what he said about freeing the worlds oceans with the threat of mutual destruction or was this to assuage his feelings of guilt the record is not clear and i can only guess at the answers to these questions and well never know whether if fulton had been given full backing he would have succeeded it took another century before the world saw the first practical submarine but his terminology submarine torpedo conning tower is still in use today how did it all end for him he scraped together resources for one more try and succeeded in frightening the wits out of admiralty officials gathered for a demonstration off deal but a fortnight later the battle of trafalgar took place and effectively ended his dreams fulton returned in penury to the us but went on to become famous with the first commercial steamship there ironically he later began building another submarine this time against the british who were blockading new york in the war of but he died before it was finished other characters in this book may seem at first reading to be the product of a vivid imagination but there really was a mysterious mr smith who detached fulton from napoleon to transfer his allegiance to england there is very little known on this episode so i took what i felt was likely to have occurred and put renzi in smiths place likewise the famed parisian savant laplace was indeed a friend of fultons i enjoy jane austens works and it was on a literary whim that i decided to mention her in invasion via her brother who actually was in post there at the time she in fact had two sailor brothers francis who kydd meets in the course of his acquaintance with the fencibles and charles both later advanced to become admirals and jane no doubt consulted them when she created william price in mansfield park and captain wentworth in persuasion as usual i owe a huge debt of gratitude to many people i cannot acknowledge them all for space reasons but deep thanks are due to rowena willardwright and joanne gray of english heritage who arranged special access to dover castle fultons base while he was working on his inventions and walmer castle where pitt lived and which he used as a secretariat for his clandestine operations against the french and of course i would be remiss not to mention my literary agent carole blake and my new editor at hodder stoughton anne clarke
