robert jordan a crown of swords there can be no health in us nor any good thing grow for the land is one with the dragon reborn and he one with the land soul of fire heart of stone in pride he conquers forcing the proud to yield he calls upon the mountains to kneel and the seas to give way and the very skies to bow pray that the heart of stone remembers tears and the soul of fire love from a muchdisputed translation of the prophecies of the dragon by the poet kyera termendal of shiota believed to have been published between fy and fy prologue serpent and wheel lightnings from the tall arched window close onto eighty spans above the ground not far below the top of the white tower elaida could see for miles beyond tar valon to the rolling plains and forests that bordered the broad river erinin running down from north and west before it divided around the white walls of the great island city on the ground long morning shadows must have been dappling the city but from this prominence all seemed clear and bright not even the fabled topless towers of cairhien had truly rivaled the white tower certainly none of tar valonвђs lesser towers did for all that men spoke far and wide of them and their vaulting skybridges this high an almost constant breeze lessened the unnatural heat gripping the world the feast of lights past snow should have covered the ground deep yet the weather belonged in the depths of a hard summer another sign that the last battle approached and the dark one touched the world if more were needed elaida did not let the heat touch her even when she descended of course the breeze was not why she had had her quarters moved up here despite the inconvenience of so many stairs to these simple rooms plain russet floor tiles and white marble walls decorated by a few tapestries could not compare with the grandeur of the amyrlinвђs study and the rooms that went with it far below she still used those rooms occasionally вђ they held associations with the power of the amyrlin seat in some minds вђ but she resided here and worked here more often than not for the view not of city or river or forests though of what was beginning in the tower grounds great diggings and foundations spread across what had been the wardersвђ practice yard tall wooden cranes and stacks of cut marble and granite masons and laborers swarmed over the workings like ants and endless streams of wagons trailed through the gates onto the tower grounds bringing more stone to one side stood a wooden working model as the masons called it big enough for men to enter crouching on their heels and see every detail where every stone should go most of the workmen could not read after all вђ neither words nor masonвђs drawn plans the working model was as large as some manor houses when any king or queen had a palace why should the amyrlin seat be relegated to apartments little better than those of many ordinary sisters her palace would match the white tower for splendor and have a great spire ten spans higher than the tower itself the blood had drained from the chief masonвђs face when he heard that the tower had been ogierbuilt with assistance from sisters using the power one look at elaidaвђs face however set master lerman bowing and stammering that of course all would be done as she wished as if there had been any question her mouth tightened with exasperation she had wanted ogier masons again but the ogier were confining themselves to their steddingfor some reason her summons to the nearest stedding jentoine in the black hills had been met with refusal polite yet still refusal without explanation even to the amyrlin seat ogier were reclusive at best or they might be withdrawing from a world full of turmoil ogier stayed clear of human strife firmly elaida dismissed the ogier from her mind she prided herself on separating what could be from what could not ogier were a triviality they had no part in the world beyond the cities they had built so long ago and seldom visited now except to make repairs the men below crawling beetlelike over the building site made her frown slightly construction went forward by inches ogier might be out of the question yet perhaps the one power could be used again few sisters possessed real strength in weaving earth but not that much was required to reinforce stone or bind stone to stone yes in her mind the palace stood finished colonnaded walks and great domes shining with gilt and that one spire reaching to the heavens her eyes rose to the cloudless sky to where the spire would peak and she let out a long sigh yes the orders would be issued today the towering case clock in the room behind her chimed third rise and in the city gongs and bells pealed the hour the sound faint here so high above with a smile elaida left the window smoothing her redslashed dress of cream silk and adjusting the broad striped stole of the amyrlin seat on her shoulders on the ornately gilded clock small figures of gold and silver and enamel moved with the chimes horned and snouted trollocs fled from a cloaked aes sedai on one level on another a man representing a false dragon tried to fend off silver lightning bolts that had obviously been hurled by a second sister and above the clockface itself above her head a crowned king and queen knelt before an amyrlin seat in her enameled stole with the flame of tar valon carved from a large moonstone atop a golden arch over her head she did not laugh often but she could not help a quietly pleased chuckle at the clock cemaile sorenthaine raised from the gray had commissioned it dreaming of a return to the days before the trolloc wars when no ruler held a throne without the towerвђs approval cemaileвђs grand plans came to naught however as did cemaile and for three centuries the clock sat in a dusty storage room an embarrassment no one dared display until elaida the wheel of time turned what was once could be again wouldbe again the case clock balanced the door to her sitting room and her bedchamber and dressing room beyond fine tapestries colorful work from tear and kandor and arad doman with threadofgold and threadofsilver glittering among the merely dyed hung each exactly opposite its mate she had always liked order the carpet covering most of the tiles came from tarabon patterned in red and green and gold silk carpets were the most precious in each corner of the room a marble plinth carved in unpretentious verticals held a white vase of fragile sea folk porcelain with two dozen carefully arranged red roses to make roses bloom now required the one power especially with the drought and heat a worthwhile use in her opinion gilded carving covered both the only chair вђ noone sat in her presence now вђ and the writing table but in the stark style of cairhien a simple room really with a ceiling barely two spans high yet it would do until her palace was ready with the view it would the tall chairback held the flame of tar valon picked out in moonstones above her dark head as she sat nothing marred the polished surface of the table except for three boxes of altaran lacquerwork arranged just so opening the box covered with golden hawks among white clouds she removed a slim strip of thin paper from atop the pile of reports and correspondence inside for what must have been the hundredth time she read the message come from cairhien by pigeon twelve days ago few in the tower knew of its existence none but she knew its contents or would have a glimmer of what it meant if they did the thought almost made her laugh again the ring has been placed in the bullвђs nose i expect a pleasant journey to market no signature yet she needed none only galina casban had known to send that glorious message galina whom elaida trusted to do what she would have trusted to no one else save herself not that she trusted anyone fully but the head of the red ajah more than any other she herself had been raised from the red after all and in many ways still thought of herself as red the ring has been placed in the bullвђs nose rand alвђthor вђ the dragon reborn the man who had seemed on the point of swallowing the world the man who had swallowed entirely too much of it вђ rand alвђthor was shielded and in galinaвђs control and none who might support him knew even a chance of that and the wording would have been different by various earlier messages it seemed he had rediscovered how to travel a talent lost to aes sedai since the breaking yet that had not saved him it had even played into galinaвђs hands apparently he had a habit of coming and going without warning who would suspect that this time he had not gone but been taken something very like a giggle rose in her inside another week two at most alвђthor would be in the tower closely supervised and guided safely until tarmon gaiвђdon his ravaging of the world stopped it was madness to allow any man who could channel to run free but most of all the man prophecy said must face the dark one in the last battle the light send that it lay years off yet in spite of the weather years would be needed to arrange the world properly beginning with undoing what alвђthor had done of course the damage he had wrought was nothing beside what he could have caused free not to mention the possibility that he might have gotten himself killed before he was needed well that troublesome young man would be wrapped in swaddling and kept safe as an infant in his motherвђs arms until time to take him to shayol ghul after that if he survived elaidaвђs lips pursed the prophecies of the dragon seemed to say he would not which undeniably would be for the best mother elaida almost gave a start as alviarin spoke entering without so much as a knock i have word from the ajahs mother slim and coolfaced alviarin wore the keeperвђs narrow stole in white matching her dress to show she had been raised from the white but in her mouth вђmotherвђ became less a title of respect and more an address to an equal alviarinвђs presence was enough to dent elaidaвђs good mood that the keeper of chronicles came from the white not the red always served as a biting reminder of her weakness when she was first raised some of that had been dispelled true but not all not yet she was tired of regretting that she had so few personal eyesandears outside andor and that her predecessor and alviarinвђs had escaped вђ been helped to escape they must have had help вђ escaped before the keys to the amyrlinвђs great network could be wrested out of them she more than wanted the network that was hers by right by strong tradition the ajahs sent to the keeper whatever dribbles from their own eyesandears they were willing to share with the amyrlin but elaida was convinced the woman kept back some of even that trickle yet she could not ask the ajahs for information directly bad enough to be weak without going begging to the world the tower anyway which was as much of the world as really counted elaida kept her own face every bit as cool as the other womanвђs acknowledging her only with a nod while she pretended to examine papers from the lacquered box slowly she turned them over one by one returned them to the box slowly without really seeing a word making alviarin wait was bitter because it was petty and petty ways were all she had to strike at one who should have been her servant an amyrlin could issue any decree she wished her word law and absolute yet as a practical matter without support from the hall of the tower many of those decrees were wasted ink and paper no sister would disobey an amyrlin not directly at least yet many decrees required a hundred other things ordered to implement them in the best of times that could come slowly on occasion so slowly it never happened and these were far from the best alviarin stood there calm as a frozen pond closing the altaran box elaida kept out the strip of paper that announced her sure victory unconsciously she fingered it a talisman has teslyn or joline finally deigned to send more than word of their safe arrival that was meant to remind alviarin that no one could consider herself immune nobody cared what happened in ebou dar elaida least of all the capital of altara could fall into the sea and except for the merchants not even the rest of altara would notice but teslyn had sat in the hall nearly fifteen years before elaida had commanded her to resign her chair if elaida could send a sitter вђ a redsitter вђ who had supported her rise off as ambassador to a flyspeck throne with no one sure why but a hundred rumors flowering then she could come down on anyone joline was a different matter she had held her chair for the green only a matter of weeks and everyone was sure the greens had selected her to show they would not be cowed by the new amyrlin who had handed her a fearsome penance that bit of insolence could not be allowed to pass of course and had not been everyone knew that too it was meant to remind alviarin that she was vulnerable but the slim woman merely smiled her cool smile so long as the hall remained as it was she wasimmune she riffled through the papers in her hand plucking one out no word from teslyn or joline mother no though with the news you have received so far from the thrones that smile deepened into something dangerously close to amusement they all mean to try their wings to see if you are as strong as as your predecessor even alviarin had enough sense not to speak the sanche womanвђs name in her presence it was true though every king and queen even mere nobles seemed to be testing the limits of her power she must make examples glancing at the paper alviarin went on there is word from ebou dar however through the gray had she emphasized that to drive the splinter deeper it appears elayne trakand and nynaeve alвђmeara are there posing as full sisters with the blessings of the rebel embassy to queen tylin there are two others not identified who may be doing the same the lists of who is with the rebels are incomplete or they may just be companions the grays are uncertain why under the light would they be in ebou dar elaida said dismissively certainly teslyn would have sent news of that the gray must be passing along rumors now tarnaвђs message said they are with the rebels in salidar tarna feir had reported siuan sanche there too and logain ablar spreading those vicious lies no red sister could lower herself to acknowledge much less deny the sanche woman had a hand in that obscenity or the sun would rise in the west tomorrow why could she not simply have crawled away and died decently out of sight like other stilled women it required effort not to draw a deep breath logain could be hanged quietly as soon as the rebels were dealt with most of the world thought him dead long since the filthy slander that the red ajah had set him up as a false dragon would die with him when the rebels were dealt with the sanche woman could be made to hand over the keys to the amyrlinвђs eyesandears and name the traitors who had helped her escape a foolish hope to wish that alviarin would be named among them i can hardly see the alвђmeara girl running to ebou dar claiming to be aes sedai much less elayne can you you did order elayne found mother as important as putting a leash on alвђthor you said when she was among three hundred rebels in salidar it was impossible to do anything but she will not be so well protected in the tarasin palace i have no time for gossip and rumors elaida bit off each word with contempt did alviarin know more than she should mentioning alвђthor and leashing i suggest you read tarnaвђs report again then ask yourself whether even rebelswould allow accepted to pretend to the shawl alviarin waited with visible patience for her to finish then examined her sheaf again and pulled out four more sheets the gray agent sent sketches she said blandly proffering the pages he is no artist but elayne and nynaeve are recognizable after a moment when elaida did not take the drawings she slipped them under the rest elaida felt the color of anger and embarrassment rising in her cheeks alviarin had led her down this path deliberately by not bringing out those sketches at the first she ignored that вђ anything else would only be more embarrassing still вђ but her voice became cold i want them taken and brought to me the lack of curiosity on alviarinвђs face made elaida wonder again how much the woman knew that she was not supposed to the alвђmeara girl might well provide a handle on alвђthor coming from the same village all the sisters knew that just as they knew that elayne was daughterheir of andor and that her mother was dead vague rumors linking morgase to the whitecloaks were so much nonsense for she would never have gone to the children of the light for help she was dead leaving not even a corpse behind and elayne would be queen if she could be wrested away from the rebels before the andoran houses put dyelin on the lion throne instead it was not widely known what made elayne more important than any other noble with a strong claim to a throne aside from the fact that she would be aes sedai one day of course elaida had the foretelling sometimes a talent many thought lost before her and long ago she had foretold that the royal house of andor held the key to winning the last battle twentyfive years gone and more as soon as it became clear that morgase trakand would gain the throne in the succession elaida had fastened herself to the girl as she was then how elayne was crucial elaida did not know but foretelling never lied sometimes she almost hated the talent she hated things she could not control i want all four of them alviarin the other two were unimportant certainly but she would take no chances send my command to teslyn immediately tell her вђ andjoline вђ that if they fail to send regular reports from now on they will wish they had never been born include the information from the macura woman her mouth twisted around that last the name made alviarin shift uneasily too and no wonder ronde macuraвђs nasty little infusion was something to make any sister uncomfortable forkroot was not lethal вђ at least you woke if you drank enough to sleep вђ but a tea that deadened a womanвђs ability to channel seemed aimed too directly at aes sedai a pity the information had not been received before galina went if forkroot worked on men as well as it seemed to on women it would have made her task considerably easier alviarinвђs ill ease lasted only a moment a mere instant and she was all selfpossession again unyielding as a wall of ice as you wish mother i am sure they will leap to obey as of course they should a sudden flash of irritation swept elaida like fire in dry pasture the fate of the world in her hands and petty stumbling blocks kept rising beneath her feet bad enough that she had rebels and recalcitrant rulers to handle but too many sitters still brooded and grumbled behind her back fertile ground for the other woman to plow only six were firmly under her own thumb and she suspected as many at least listened closely to alviarin before they voted certainly nothing of importance passed through the hall unless alviarin agreed to it not open agreement not with any acknowledgment that alviarin bore a shred more influence or power than a keeper should but if alviarin opposed at least they had not gone so far as to reject anything elaida sent them they simply dragged their feet and too often let what she wanted starve on the floor a pitifully small thing for which to be happy some amyrlins had become little more than puppets once the hall acquired a taste for rejecting what they put forward her hands clenched and a tiny crackle came from the strip of paper the ring has been placed in the bullвђs nose alviarin looked as composed as a marble statue but elaida no longer cared the shepherd was on his way to her the rebels would be crushed and the hall cowed alviarin forced to her knees and every fractious ruler brought to heel from tenobia of saldaea who had gone into hiding to avoid her emissary to mattin stepaneos of illian who was trying to play all sides at once again trying to agree with her andthe whitecloaks and with alвђthor for all she knew elayne would be placed on the throne in caemlyn without her brother to get in the way and with a full knowledge of who had set her there a little time back in the tower would make the girl damp clay in elaidaвђs hands i want those menrooted out alviarin there was no need to say who she meant half the tower could talk of nothing but those menin their blacktower and the other half whispered about them in corners there are disturbing reports mother alviarin looked through her papers once more but elaida thought it was only for something to do she did not pluck out any more pages and if nothing else disturbed the woman for long this unholy midden outside caemlyn must morerumors do you believe the tales of thousands flocking to caemlyn in answer to that obscene amnesty not the least of what alвђthor had done but hardly cause for worry just a pile of filth that must be safely cleared before elayne was crowned in caemlyn of course not mother but вђ toveine is to lead this task belongs properly to the red toveine gazal had been fifteen years away from the tower until elaida summoned her back the other two red sitters who had resigned and gone into a voluntary retreat at the same time were nervouseyed women now but unlike lirene and tsutama toveine had only hardened in her solitary exile she is to have fifty sisters there could not be more than two or three men at this blacktower actually able to channel elaida was certain fifty sisters could overwhelm them easily yet there might be others to deal with hangerson camp followers fools full of futile hopes and insane ambitions and she is to take a hundred вђ no two hundred вђ of the guard are you certain that is wise the rumors of thousands are certainly madness but a green agent in caemlyn claims there are over four hundred in this black tower a clever fellow it seems he counted the supply carts that go out from the city and you are aware of the rumors mazrim taim is with them elaida fought to keep her features smooth and barely succeeded she had forbidden mention of taimвђs name and it was bitter that she did not dare вђ did not dare вђ impose the penalty on alviarin the woman looked her straight in the eyes the absence of so much as a perfunctory mother this time was marked and the temerityof asking whether her actions were wise she was the amyrlin seat not first among equals the amyrlin seat opening the largest of the lacquered boxes revealed carved ivory miniatures laid out on gray velvet often just handling her collection soothed her but more like the knitting she enjoyed it let whoever was attending her know their place if she seemed to give more attention to the miniatures than to what they had to say fingering first an exquisite cat sleek and flowing then an elaborately robed woman with a peculiar little animal some fantasy of the carver almost like a man covered in hair crouched on her shoulder at length elaida chose out a curving fish so delicately carved that it seemed nearly real despite the aged yellow of the ivory four hundred rabble alviarin she felt calmer already for alviarinвђs mouth had thinned just a fraction but she savored any crack in the womanвђs faгade if there are that many only a fool could believe that more than one or two can channel at most in ten years we have found only six men with the ability just twentyfour in the last twenty years and you know how the land has been scoured as for taim the name burned her mouth the only false dragon ever to escape being gentled once in the hands of aes sedai not a thing she wanted in the chronicles under her reign certainly not until she decided how it should be recorded at present the chronicles told nothing after his capture she stroked her thumb along the fishвђs scales he is dead alviarin else we would have heard from him long since and not serving alвђthor can you think he went from claiming to be the dragon reborn to servingthe dragon reborn can you think he could be in caemlyn without davram bashere at least trying to kill him her thumb moved faster on the ivory fish as she reminded herself that the marshalgeneral of saldaea was in caemlyn taking orders from alвђthor what wastenobia playing at elaida held it all inside though presenting a face as calm as one of her carvings twentyfour is a dangerous number to speak aloud alviarin said with an ominous quiet as dangerous as two thousand the chronicles record only sixteen the last thing needed now is for those years to rear up again or for sisters who know only what they were told to learn the truth even those you brought back hold their silence elaida put on a bemused look so far as she knew alviarin had learned the truth of those years only on being raised keeper but her own knowledge was more personal not that alviarin could be aware of that not for certain anyway daughter whatever comes out i have no fear who is going to impose a penance on me and on what charge that skirted truth nicely but apparently it impressed the other woman not at all the chronicles record a number of amyrlins who took on public penance for some usually obscure reason but it has always seemed to me that is how an amyrlin might have it written if she found herself with no choice except вђ elaidaвђs hand slapped down on the table enough daughter i amtower law what has been hidden will remain hidden for the same reason it has for twenty years вђ the good of the white tower only then did she feel the bruise beginning on her palm she lifted her hand to reveal the fish broken in two how old had it been five hundred years a thousand it was all she could do not to quiver with rage her voice certainly thickened with it toveine is to lead fifty sisters and two hundred of the tower guards to caemlyn to this black tower where they will gentle any man they find able to channel and hang him along with as many others as they can take alive alviarin did not even blink at the violation of tower law elaida had spoken the truth as she meant it to be with this with everything she wastower law for that matter hang up the dead as well let them be a warning to any man who thinks of touching the true source have toveine attend me i will want to hear her plan it will be as you command mother the womanвђs reply was as cool and smooth as her face though if i may suggest you might wish to reconsider sending so many sisters away from the tower apparently the rebels found your offer wanting they are no longer in salidar they are on the march the reports come from altara but they must be into murandy by now and they have chosen themselves an amyrlin she scanned the top sheet of her sheaf of papers as if searching for the name egwene alвђvere it seems that alviarin had left this the most important piece of news until now should have made elaida explode in fury instead she threw back her head and laughed only a firm hold on dignity kept her from drumming her heels on the floor the surprise on alviarinвђs face made her laugh harder till she had to wipe her eyes with her fingers you do not see it she said when she could speak between ripples of mirth as well you are keeper alviarin not a sitter in the hall blind as you are within a month the others would be holding you in a cabinet and taking you out when they needed your vote i see enough mother alviarinвђs voice held no heat if anything it should have coated the walls with frost i see three hundred rebel aes sedai perhaps more marching on tar valon with an army led by gareth bryne acknowledged a great captain discounting the more ridiculous reports that army may number over twenty thousand and with bryne to lead they will gain more at every village and town they pass i do not say they have hope of taking the city of course but it is hardly a matter for laughter high captain chubain should be ordered to increase recruiting for the tower guard elaidaвђs gaze fell sourly on the broken fish and she stood and stalked to the nearest window her back to alviarin the palace under construction took away the bitter taste that and the slip of paper she still clutched she smiled down on her palacetobe three hundred rebels yes but you should read tarnaвђs account again at least a hundred are on the point of breaking already she trusted tarna to some extent a red with no room in her head for nonsense and she said the rebels were ready to jump at shadows quietly desperate sheep looking for a shepherd she said a wilder of course yet still sensible tarna should be back soon and able to give a fuller report not that it was needed elaidaвђs plans were already working among the rebels but that was her secret tarna has always been sure she could make people do what it was clear they would not had there been an emphasis in that a significance of tone elaida decided to ignore it she had to ignore too much from alviarin but the day would come soon as for their army daughter she says two or three thousand men at most if they had more they would have made sure she saw them to overawe us in elaidaвђs opinion eyesandears always exaggerated to make their information seem more valuable only sisters could be truly trusted red sisters anyway some of them but i would not care if they did have twenty thousand or fifty or a hundred can you even begin to guess why when she turned alviarinвђs face was all smooth composure a mask over blind ignorance you seem to be conversant with all the aspects of tower law what penalty do rebels face for the leaders alviarin said slowly stilling she frowned slightly skirts swaying just barely as her feet shifted good even accepted knew this and she could not understand why elaida asked very good for many of the rest too perhaps the leaders might themselves escape that most of them if they submitted properly the minimum penalty in law was to be birched in the grand hall before the assembled sisters followed by at least a year and a day in public penance yet nothing said the penance must be served all at once a month here a month there and they would still be atoning their crimes ten years from now constant reminders of what came of resisting her some would be stilled of course вђ sheriam a few of the more prominent socalled sitters вђ but only sufficient to make the rest fear putting a foot wrong again not enough to weaken the tower the white tower had to be whole and it had to be strong strong and firmly in her grasp only one crime among those they have committed demandsstilling alviarin opened her mouth there had been ancient rebellions buried so deep that few among the sisters knew the chronicles stood mute the lists of stilled and executed confined to records open only to amyrlin keeper and sitters aside from the few librarians who kept them elaida allowed alviarin no opportunity to speak any woman who falsely claims the title of amyrlin seat mustbe stilled if they believed they had any chance of success sheriam would be their amyrlin or lelaine or carlinya or one of the others tarna reported that romanda cassin had come out of her retirement romanda surely would have seized the stole with both hands if she saw the tenth part of a chance instead they have plucked out an accepted elaida shook her head in wry amusement she could quote every word of the law setting out how a woman was chosen amyrlin вђ she had made good use of it herself after all вђ and never once did it require that the woman be a full sister obviously she mustbe so those who framed the law never stated it and the rebels had squirmed through that crack they know their cause is hopeless alviarin they plan to strut and bluster try to dig out some protection against penalty for themselves then yield the girl as a sacrifice which was a pity the alвђvere girl was another possible handle on alвђthor and when she reached her full strength in the one power she would have been one of the strongest in a thousand years or more a true pity gareth bryne and an army hardly sound like strutting to me it will take their army five or six months to reach tar valon in that time high captain chubain could increase the guard вђ their army elaida sneered alviarin was such a fool for all her cool exterior she was a rabbit next she would be spouting the sanche womanвђs nonsense about the forsaken being loose of course she did not know the secret but just the same farmers carrying pikes butchers with bows and tailors on horseback and every step of the way thinking of the shining walls that held artur hawkwing at bay no not a rabbit a weasel yet soon or late she would be weaselfur trim on elaidaвђs cloak the light send it soon every step of the way they will lose a man if not ten i would not be surprised if our rebels appear with nothing more than their warders too many people knew of the division in the tower once the rebellion was broken of course it could be made to seem all a ploy a part of gaining control of young alвђthor perhaps an effort of years that and generations before memories faded every last rebel would pay for that on her knees elaida clenched her fist as though she held all the rebels by the throat or alviarin i mean to break them daughter they will split open like a rotten melon her secret assured that however many farmers and tailors lord bryne hung on to but let the other woman think as she would suddenly the foretelling took hold of her a certainty about things she could not see stronger than if they had been laid out before her she would have been willing to step blindly over a cliff on that certainty the white tower will be whole again except for remnants cast out and scorned whole and stronger than ever rand alвђthor will face the amyrlin seat and know her anger the black tower will be rent in blood and fire and sisters will walk its grounds this i foretell as usual the foretelling left her trembling gasping for breath she forced herself to stand still and straight to breathe slowly she never let anyone see weakness but alviarin her eyes were wide as they could open lips parted as if she had forgotten the words she meant to speak a paper slid from the sheaf in her hands and almost fell before she could catch it that recalled her to herself in a flash she regained her serene mask a perfect picture of aes sedai calm but she definitely had been jolted to her heels oh very good let her chew on the certain surety of elaidaвђs victory chew and break her teeth elaida drew a deep breath and seated herself behind her writing table again putting the broken ivory fish to one side where she did not have to look at it it was time to exploit her victory there is work to be done today daughter the first message is to go to the lady caraline damodred elaida spun out her plans enlarging on what alviarin knew revealing some that she did not because at the last an amyrlin did have to work through her keeper however much she hated the woman there was a pleasure in watching alviarinвђs eyes watching her wonder what else she still did not know but while elaida ordered divided and assigned the world between the aryth ocean and the spine of the world in her mind frolicked the image of young alвђthor on his way to her like a caged bear to be taught to dance for his dinner the chronicles could hardly record the years of the last battle without mentioning the dragon reborn but she knew that one name would be written larger than all others elaida do avriny aвђroihan youngest daughter of a minor house in the north of murandy would go down in history as the greatest and most powerful amyrlin seat of all time the most powerful woman in the history of the world the woman who saved humankind the aiel standing in a deep fold in the low browngrass hills seemed carved figures ignoring sheets of dust sweeping ahead of a gusting wind that snow should have been deep on the ground this time of year did not bother them none had ever seen snow and this oven heat with the sun still well short of its peak was less than where they came from their attention remained fixed on the southern rise waiting for the signal that would announce the arrival of the destiny of the shaido aiel outwardly sevanna looked like the others though a ring of maidens marked her out resting easily on their heels dark veils already hiding their faces to the eyes she also waited and more impatiently than she let on but not to the exclusion of everything else that was one reason why she commanded and the rest followed the second was that she saw what could be if you refused to let outworn custom and stale tradition tie your hands a slight flicker of her green eyes to the left showed twelve men and one woman each with round bullhide buckler and three or four short spears garbed in grayandbrown cadinвђsorthat blended as well with the terrain here as in the threefold land efalin short graying hair hidden by the shoufawrapped around her head sometimes glanced sevannaвђs way if a maiden of the spear could be said to be uneasy efalin was some shaido maidens had gone south joining the fools capering around rand alвђthor and sevanna did not doubt others talked of it efalin must be wondering whether providing sevanna with an escort of maidens as if she had been far dareis maionce herself was enough to balance that at least efalin had no doubts where true power lay like efalin the men led shaido warrior societies and they eyed one another between watching the rise especially blocky maeric who was seia doon and scarfaced bendhuin of far aldazar din after today no longer would anything hold back the shaido from sending a man to rhuidean to be marked as the clan chief if he survived until that happened sevanna spoke as the clan chief since she was the widow of the last chief of the last two chiefs and let those who muttered that she carried bad luck choke on it gold and ivory bracelets clattered softly as she straightened the dark shawl over her arms and adjusted her necklaces most of those were gold and ivory too but one was a mass of pearls and rubies that had belonged to a wetlander noblewoman вђ the woman now wore white and hauled and fetched alongside the other gaiвђshainback in the mountains called kinslayerвђs dagger вђ with a ruby the size of a small henвђs egg nestled between her breasts the wetlands held rich prizes a large emerald on her finger caught sunlight in green fire finger rings were one wetlander custom worth adopting no matter the stares often aimed at hers she would have more if they matched this one for magnificence most of the men thought maeric or bendhuin would be first to receive the wise onesвђ permission to try rhuidean only efalin in that group suspected that none would and she only suspected she also was astute enough to voice her suspicions circumspectly to sevanna and not at all to anyone else their minds could not encompass the possibility of shedding the old and in truth if sevanna was impatient to don the new she was also aware that she must bring them to it slowly much had changed already in the old ways since the shaido crossed the dragonwall into the wetlands вђ still wet compared to the threefold land вђ yet more would change once rand alвђthor was in her hands once she had wed the carвђaвђcarn the chief of chiefs of all the aiel вђ this nonsense of the dragon reborn was wetlander foolishness вђ there would be a new way of naming clan chiefs and sept chiefs as well perhaps even the heads of the warrior societies rand alвђthor would name them pointing where she told him of course and that would be only the beginning the wetlander notion of handing down rank to your children and their children for instance the wind swept higher for a moment blowing south it would cover the sound of the wetlandersвђ horses and wagons she shifted her shawl again then suppressed a grimace at all costs she must not appear nervous a glance to the right stilled worry as soon as begun over two hundred shaido wise ones clustered there and normally at least some would be watching her like vultures but their eyes were all on the rise more than one adjusted her shawl uneasily or smoothed bulky skirts sevannaвђs lip curled sweat beaded on some of those faces sweat where was their honor that they showed nerves before every gaze everyone stiffened slightly as a young sovin naiappeared above them lowering his veil as he scrambled down he came straight to her as was proper but to her irritation he raised his voice enough for all to hear one of their forward scouts escaped he was wounded but still on his horse the society leaders began to move before he finished speaking that would never do they would lead in the actual fighting вђ sevanna had never more than held a spear in her life вђ but she would not let them forget for a moment who she was throw every last spear against them she ordered loudly before they can ready themselves they rounded on her as one every spear bendhuin demanded incredulously you mean except for the screens вђ glowering maeric spoke right on top of him if we keep no reserve we can be вђ sevanna cut them both off every spear these are aes sedai we dance with we must overwhelm them immediately efalin and most of the others schooled their faces to stillness but bendhuin and maeric frowned ready to argue fools they faced a few dozen aes sedai a few hundred wetlander soldiers yet with the more than forty thousand algaiвђdвђsiswaithey had insisted on they still wanted their screens of scouts and their spears in reserve as if they faced other aiel or a wetlander army i speak as the clan chief of the shaido she should not have to say that but a reminder could do no harm they are a handful she weighted every word with contempt now they can be run down if the spears move quickly you were ready to avenge desaine this sunrise do i smell fear now fear of a few wetlanders has honor gone from the shaido that turned their faces to stone as intended even efalin showed eyes like polished gray gems as she veiled her fingers moved in maiden handtalk and as the society leaders sprinted up the rise the maidens around sevanna followed thatwas not what she had intended but at least the spears were moving even from the bottom of the fold she could see what had seemed bare ground disgorging cadinвђsorclad figures all hurrying south with the long strides that could run down horses there was no time to waste with a thought to have words with efalin later sevanna turned to the wise ones chosen from the strongest of the shaido wise ones who could wield the one power they were six or seven for every aes sedai around rand alвђthor yet sevanna saw doubt they tried to hide it behind stony faces but it was there in shifting eyes in tongues wetting lips many traditions fell today traditions old and strong as law wise ones did not take part in battles wise ones kept far from aes sedai they knew the ancient tales that the aiel had been sent to the threefold land for failing the aes sedai that they would be destroyed if ever they failed them again they had heard the stories what rand alвђthor had claimed before all that as part of their service to the aes sedai the aiel had sworn to do no violence once sevanna had been sure those stories were lies but of late she believed the wise ones knew them for truth none had told her so of course it did not matter she herself had never made the two journeys to rhuidean required to become a wise one but the others had accepted her however reluctant some had been now they had no choice but to go on accepting useless traditions would be carved into new aes sedai she said softly they leaned toward her in a muted clatter of bracelets and necklaces to catch her low words they hold rand alвђthor the carвђaвђcarn we must take him from them there were scattered frowns most believed she wanted the carвђaвђcarntaken alive in order to avenge the death of couladin her second husband they understood that but they would not have come here for it aes sedai she hissed angrily we kept our pledge but they broke theirs we violated nothing but they have violated everything you know how desaine was murdered and of course they did the eyes watching her were suddenly sharper killing a wise one ranked with killing a pregnant woman a child or a blacksmith some of those eyes were verysharp theravaвђs rhialeвђs othersвђ if we allow these women to walk away from that then weare less than animals wewill have no honor ihold my honor on that she gathered her skirts with dignity and climbed the slope head high not looking back she was certain the others would follow therava and norlea and dailin would see to that and rhiale and tion and meira and the rest who had accompanied her a few days past to see rand alвђthor beaten and put back into his wooden chest by the aes sedai her reminder had been for those thirteen even more than the others and they dared not fail her the truth of how desaine had died tied them to her wise ones with their skirts looped over their arms to free their legs could not keep up with the algaiвђdвђsiswaiin cadinвђsorhowever hard they ran though race they did five miles across those low rolling hills not a long run and they topped a crest to see the dance of spears already begun after a fashion thousands of algaiвђdвђsiswaimade a huge pool of veiled grayandbrown surging around a circle of wetlander wagons which itself surrounded one of the small clumps of trees that dotted this region sevanna drew an angry breath the aes sedai had even had time to bring all of their horses inside the spears encircled the wagons pressed in on them showered arrows toward them but those at the front seemed to push against an invisible wall at first the arrows that arched highest passed over this wall but then they too began striking something unseen and bouncing back a low murmur rose among the wise ones you see what the aes sedai do sevanna demanded as though she also could see the one power being woven she wanted to sneer the aes sedai were fools with their vaunted three oaths when they finally decided they must use the power as a weapon instead of just to make barriers it would be too late provided the wise ones did not stand too long staring somewhere in those wagons was rand alвђthor perhaps still doubled into a chest like a bolt of silk waiting for her to pick him up if the aes sedai could hold him then she could with the wise ones and a promise therava take your half to the west now be ready to strike when i do for desaine and the tohthe aes sedai owe us we will make them meet tohas no one ever has before it was a foolish boast to speak of making someone meet an obligation they had not acknowledged yet in the angry mutters from the other women sevanna heard other furious promises to make the aes sedai meet toh only those who had killed desaine on sevannaвђs orders stood silent theravaвђs narrow lips tightened slightly but finally she said it will be as you say sevanna at an easy lope sevanna led her half of the wise ones to the east side of the battle if it could be called that yet she had wanted to remain on a rise where she could have a good view вђ that was how a clan chief or battle leader directed the dance of spears вђ but in this one thing she found no support even from therava and the others who shared the secret of desaineвђs death the wise ones made a sharp contrast with the algaiвђdвђsiswaias she lined them up in their white algodeblouses and dark wool skirts and shawls their glittering bracelets and necklaces and their waistlength hair held back by dark folded scarves for all their decision that if they were to be in the dance of the spears they would be in it not on a rise apart she did not believe they yet realized that the true battle today was theirs to fight after today nothing would be the same again and tethering rand alвђthor was the smallest part among the algaiвђdвђsiswaistaring toward the wagons only height quickly told men from maidens veils and shoufahid heads and faces and cadinвђsorwas cadinвђsoraside from the differences of cut that marked clan and sept and society those at the outer edge of the encirclement appeared confused grumbling among themselves as they waited for something to happen they had come prepared to dance with aes sedai lightning and now they milled impatiently too far back even to use the horn bows still in leather cases on their backs they would not have to wait much longer if sevanna had her way hands on hips she addressed the other wise ones those to the south of me will disrupt what the aes sedai are doing those to the north will attack forward the spears with the command she turned to watch the destruction of the aes sedai who thought they had only steel to face nothing happened in front of her the mass of algaiвђdвђsiswaiseethed uselessly and the loudest sound was the occasional drumming of spears on bucklers sevanna gathered her anger winding it like thread from the spinning she had been so sure they were ready after desaineвђs butchered corpse was displayed to them but if they still found attacking aes sedai unthinkable she would chivvy them to it if she had to shame them all till they demanded to put on gaiвђshainwhite suddenly a ball of pure flame the size of a manвђs head arched toward the wagons sizzling and hissing then another dozens the knot in her middle loosened more fireballs came from the west from therava and the rest smoke began to rise from burning wagons first gray wisps then thickening black pillars the murmurs of the algaiвђdвђsiswaichanged pitch and if those directly in front of her moved little there was a sudden sense of pressing forward shouts drifted from the wagons men yelling in anger bellowing in pain whatever barriers the aes sedai had made were down it had begun and there could be only one ending rand alвђthor would be hers he would give her the aiel to take all of the wetlands and before he died he would give her daughters and sons to lead the aiel after her she might enjoy that he was quite pretty really strong and young she did not expect the aes sedai to go down easily and they did not fireballs fell among the spears turning cadinвђsorclad figures to torches and lightnings struck from a clear sky hurling men and earth into the air the wise ones learned from what they saw though or perhaps they already knew and had hesitated before most channeled so seldom especially where anyone besides wise ones could see that only another wise one knew whether any given woman could whatever the reason no sooner did lightning begin to fall among the shaido spears than more struck toward the wagons not all reached its target balls of fire streaking through the air some large as horses now silver lightning stabbing toward the ground like spears from the heavens sometimes suddenly darted aside as if striking an invisible shield or erupted violently in midair or simply vanished altogether roars and crashes filled the air warring with shouts and screams sevanna stared at the sky in delight it was like the illuminatorsвђ displays she had read about suddenly the world turned white in her eyes she seemed to be floating when she could see again she was flat on the ground a dozen paces from where she had stood aching in every muscle struggling for breath and covered with a scattering of dirt her hair wanted to lift away from her other wise ones were down as well around a ragged hole a span across torn in the ground thin tendrils of smoke rose from the dresses of some not everyone had fallen вђ the battle of fire and lightning continued in the sky вђ but too many she had to throw them back into the dance forcing herself to breathe she scrambled to her feet not bothering to brush off the dirt push spears she shouted seizing estalaineвђs angular shoulders she started to drag the woman to her feet then realized from her staring blue eyes that she was dead and let her fall she pulled a dazed dorailla erect instead then seized up a spear from a fallen thunder walker and waved it high forward the spears some of the wise ones seemed to take her literally plunging into the mass of algaiвђdвђsiswai others kept their heads better helping those who could rise and the storm of fire and lightning continued as she raged up and down the line of wise ones waving her spear and shouting push spears forward the spears she felt like laughing she did laugh with dirt all over her and the battle raging she had never been so exhilarated before in her life almost she wished she had chosen to become a maiden of the spear almost no far dareis maicould ever be clan chief any more than a man could be a wise one a maidenвђs route to power was to give up the spear and become a wise one as wife of a clan chief she had been wielding power at an age when a maiden was barely trusted to carry a spear or a wise oneвђs apprentice to fetch water and now she had it all wise one and clan chief though it would take some doing yet to have that last title in truth titles mattered little so long as she had the power but why should she not have both a sudden scream made her turn and she gaped at the sight of a shaggy gray wolf ripping doseraвђs throat out without thought she plunged her spear into its side even as it twisted to snap at the spear haft another waisttall wolf bounded past her to hurl itself onto the back of one of the algaiвђdвђsiswai then another wolf and more tearing into cadinвђsorclad figures wherever she looked superstitious fear lanced through her as she pulled her spear free the aes sedai had called wolves to fight for them she could not take her gaze from the wolf she had killed the aes sedai had no no it could change nothing she would not let it finally she managed to pull her eyes away but before she could shout encouragement to the wise ones again something else stilled her tongue and made her stare a knot of wetlander horsemen in red helmets and breastplates laying about them with swords thrusting with long lances in the middle of the algaiвђdвђsiswai where had theycome from she did not realize she had spoken aloud until rhiale answered her i tried to tell you sevanna but you would not listen the flamehaired woman eyed her bloody spear distastefully wise ones were not supposed to carry spears she ostentatiously laid the weapon in the crook of her elbow the way she had seen chiefs do as rhiale went on wetlanders have attacked from the south wetlanders and siswaiвђaman she imbued the word with all the scorn proper for those who would name themselves spears of the dragon maidens as well and and there are wise ones fighting sevanna said incredulously before realizing how it sounded if she could toss out decayed custom surely those sunblinded fools to the south who still called themselves aiel could as well she had not expected it though no doubt sorilea had brought them that old woman reminded sevanna of a landslide plunging down a mountain carrying all before it we must attack them at once they will not have rand alвђthor or ruin our vengeance for desaine she added when rhialeвђs eyes widened they are wise ones the other woman said in a flat tone and sevanna understood bitterly joining the dance of spears was bad enough but wise one attacking wise one was more than even rhiale would countenance she had agreed that desaine must die вђ how else could the other wise ones not to mention the algaiвђdвђsiswai be brought to attack aes sedai which they must do to put rand alвђthor in their hands and with him all the aiel вђ yet that was done in secret surrounded by likeminded women this would be before everyone fools and cowards all of them then fight those enemies you can bring yourself to fight rhiale she bit off every word with as much scorn as she could but rhiale merely nodded adjusted her shawl with another glance at the spear on sevannaвђs arm and returned to her place in the line perhaps there was a way to make the other wise ones move first better to attack by surprise but better anything than that they should snatch rand alвђthor from her very hands what she would not give for a woman who could channel and would do as she was told without balking what she would not give to be on a rise where she could see how the battle went keeping her spear ready and a wary eye out for wolves вђ those she could see were either killing men and women in cadinвђsoror were dead themselves вђ she returned to shouting encouragement to the south more fire and lightning fell among the shaido than before but it made no difference that she could tell that battle with its explosions of flame and earth and people continued unabated push spears she shouted waving hers push spears among the churning algaiвђdвђsiswaishe could not make out any of the fools who had tied a bit of red cloth around their temples and named themselves siswaiвђaman perhaps they were too few to alter the course of events the knots of wetlanders certainly seemed few and far between even as she watched one was swarmed under men and horses by stabbing spears push spears push spears exultation filled her voice if the aes sedai called ten thousand wolves if sorilea had brought a thousand wise ones and a hundred thousand spears the shaido would still emerge victorious today the shaido and herself sevanna of the jumai shaido would be a name remembered forever suddenly a hollow boom sounded amid the roar of battle it seemed to come from the direction of the aes sedai wagons but nothing told her whether they had caused it or the wise ones she disliked things she did not understand yet she was not about to ask rhiale or the others and flaunt her ignorance and her lack of the ability all here had save her it counted for nothing among themselves but another thing she did not like was for others to have power she did not a flicker of light among the algaiвђdвђsiswai a sense of something turning caught the corner of her eye but when she turned to look there was nothing again the same thing happened a flash of light seen on the edge of vision and again when she looked there was nothing to see too many things she did not understand shouting encouragement she eyed the line of shaido wise ones some appeared bedraggled head scarves gone and long hair hanging loose skirts and blouses covered with dirt or even singed at least a dozen lay stretched out in a row groaning and seven more were still shawls laid over their faces it was those on their feet that interested her rhiale and alarys with her rare black hair all awry someryn who had taken to wearing her blouse unlaced to show even more generous cleavage than sevanna herself and meira with her long face yet more grim than usual stout tion and skinny belinde and modarra as tall as most men one of them should have told her if they did something new the secret of desaine bound them to her even for a wise one revelation of that would lead to a lifetime of pain вђ and worse shame вђ trying to meet toh if the one revealed was not simply driven naked into the wilderness to live or die as she could likely to be killed like a beast by any who found her even so sevanna was sure they took as much delight as the rest in concealing things from her the things that wise ones learned during their apprenticeships and in the journeys to rhuidean something would have to be done about that but later she would not display weakness by asking what they did now turning back to the battle she found the balance changing and in her favor it appeared to the south fireballs and lightning bolts plummeted as heavily as ever but not in front of her and it seemed not to the west or north either what struck toward the wagons still failed to reach the ground more often than not yet there was a definite slackening of the aes sedaiвђs efforts they had been forced onto the defensive she waswinning even as the thought flushed through her like pure heat the aes sedai went silent only to the south did fire and lightning still fall among the algaiвђdвђsiswai she opened her mouth to shout victory and another realization silenced her fire and lightning stormed down toward the wagons stormed down and crashed against some unseen obstruction smoke from burning wagons was beginning to outline the shape of a dome as it streamed up and finally billowed from a hole in the top of the invisible enclosure sevanna whirled to confront the line of wise ones her face such that several flinched back from her and maybe from the spear in her hand she knew she looked ready to use it she was ready why have you let them do this she raged why you were to obstruct whatever they did not allow them to make more walls tion looked ready to empty her stomach but she planted her fists on broad hips and faced sevanna directly it was not the aes sedai not the aes sedai sevanna spat then who the other wise ones i told you we must attack them it was not women rhiale said her voice faltering it was not вђ face pale she swallowed sevanna turned slowly to stare at the dome only then remembering to breathe again something had risen through the hole where the smoke gushed out one of the wetlander banners the smoke was not enough to obscure it completely crimson with a disc half white and half black the colors divided by a sinuous line just like the piece of cloth the siswaiвђamanwore rand alвђthorвђs banner could he possibly be strong enough to have broken free overwhelmed all the aes sedai and raised that it had to be the storm still battered at the dome but sevanna heard murmurs behind her the other women were thinking of retreat not her she had always known that the easiest path to power lay through conquering men who already possessed it and even as a child she was sure she had been born with the weapons to conquer them suladric clan chief of the shaido fell to her at sixteen and when he died she chose out those most likely to succeed muradin and couladin each believed he alone had captured her interest and when muradin failed to return from rhuidean as so many men did one smile convinced couladin that he had overwhelmed her but the power of a clan chief paled beside that of the carвђaвђcarn and even that was nothing beside what she saw before her she shivered as if she had just seen the most beautiful man imaginable in the sweat tent when rand alвђthor was hers she would conquer the whole world press harder she commanded harder we will humble these aes sedai for desaine and she would have rand alвђthor abruptly there was a roar from the front of the battle men shouting screaming she cursed that she could not see what was happening again she shouted for the wise ones to press harder but if anything it seemed the fall of flame and lightning against the dome lessened and then there was something she could see close to the wagons cadinвђsorclad figures and earth erupted into the air with a thunderous crash not in one place but in a long line again the ground exploded and again again each time a little farther from the encircled wagons not a line but a solid ring of exploding ground and men and maidens that she had no doubt ran all the way around the wagons again and again and again ever expanding and suddenly algaiвђdвђsiswaiwere pushing past her buffeting through the line of wise ones running sevanna beat at them with her spear flailing at heads and shoulders not caring when the spearhead came away redder than before stand and fight stand for the honor of the shaido they rushed by unheeding have you no honor stand and fight she stabbed a fleeing maiden in the back but the rest just trampled over the fallen woman abruptly she realized that some of the wise ones were gone and others picking up the injured rhiale turned to run and sevanna seized the taller womanвђs arm threatening her with the spear she did not care that rhiale could channel we must stand we can still have him the other womanвђs face was a mask of fear if we stand we die or else we end chained outside rand alвђthorвђs tent stay and die if you wish sevanna i am no stone dog ripping her arm free she sped eastward for a moment more sevanna stood there letting the men and maidens push her this way and that as they streamed by in panic then she tossed down the spear and felt her belt pouch where a small cube of intricately carved stone lay well that she had hesitated over throwing that away she had another cord for her bow yet gathering her skirts to bare her legs she joined in the chaotic flight but if all the rest fled in terror she ran with plans whirling through her head she wouldhave rand alвђthor on his knees before her and the aes sedai as well alviarin finally left elaidaвђs apartments as cool and collected as ever on the surface inside she felt wrung out like a damp cloth she managed to keep her legs steady down the long curving flights of stairs marble even in the very heights liveried servants bowed and curtsied as they scurried about their tasks seeing only the keeper in all her aes sedai serenity as she went lower sisters began to appear many wearing their shawls fringed in the colors of their ajahs as if to emphasize by formality that they werefull sisters they eyed her as she passed uneasy often as not the only one to ignore her was danelle a dreamy brown sister she had been part of bringing down siuan sanche and raising elaida but lost in her own thoughts a solitary with no friends even in her own ajah she seemed unaware that she had been shoved aside others were all too aware berisha a lean and hardeyed gray and kera with the fair hair and blue eyes that appeared occasionally among tairens and all the arrogance so common to greens went so far as to curtsy norine made as if to then did not bigeyed and nearly as dreamy as danelle at times and as friendless she resented alviarin if the keeper came from the white in her eyes it should have been norine dovarna the courtesy was not required toward the keeper not from a sister but no doubt they hoped she might intercede with elaida should that become necessary the others merely wondered what commands she carried whether another sister was to be singled out today for some failure in the amyrlinвђs eyes not even reds went within five levels of the amyrlinвђs new apartments unless summoned and more than one sister actually hid when elaida came below the very air seemed heated thick with a fear that had nothing to do with rebels or men channeling several sisters tried to speak but alviarin brushed past barely polite hardly noticing worry bloom in their eyes when she refused to pause elaida filled her mind as much as theirs a woman of many layers elaida the first look at her showed a beautiful woman filled with dignified reserve the second a woman of steel stern as a bared blade she overwhelmed where others persuaded bludgeoned where others tried diplomacy or the game of houses anyone who knew her saw her intelligence but only after a time did you realize that for all her brains she saw what she wanted to see would try to make true what she wanted to be true of the two indisputably frightening things about her the lesser was that she so often succeeded the greater was her talent for foretelling so easy to forget that erratic and infrequent it had been so long since the last foretelling that the very unpredictability made it strike like a thunderbolt no one could say when it would come not even elaida and no one could say what it would reveal now alviarin almost felt the womanвђs shadowy presence following and watching it might be necessary to kill her yet if so elaida would not be the first she had killed in secret still she hesitated to take that step without orders or at least permission she entered her own apartments with a sense of relief as though elaidaвђs shade could not cross the threshold a foolish thought if elaida had a suspicion of the truth a thousand leagues would not keep her from alviarinвђs throat elaida would expect her to be hard at work personally penning orders for the amyrlinвђs signature and seal вђ but which of those orders were actually to be carried out had yet to be decided not by elaida of course nor by herself the rooms were smaller than those elaida occupied though the ceilings reached higher and a balcony looked over the great square in front of the tower from a hundred feet up sometimes she went out on the balcony to see tar valon spread out before her the greatest city in the world filled with countless thousands who were less than pieces on a stoneвђs board the furnishings were domani pale striped wood inlaid with pearlshell and amber bright carpets in patterns of flowers and scrolls brighter tapestries of forest and flowers and grazing deer they had belonged to the last occupant of these rooms and if she retained them for any reason beyond not wanting to waste time choosing new it was to remind herself of the price of failure leane sharif had dabbled in schemes and failed and now she was cut off from the one power forever a helpless refugee dependent on charity doomed to a life of misery until she either ended it or simply put her face to the wall and died alviarin had heard of a few stilled women who managed to survive but she would doubt those stories until she met one not that she had the slightest desire to do so through the windows she could see the brightness of early afternoon yet before she was halfway across her sitting room the light suddenly faded into dim evening the darkness did not surprise her she turned and went to her knees immediately great mistress i live to serve a tall woman of dark shadow and silver light stood before her mesaana tell me what happened child the voice was crystal chimes on her knees alviarin repeated every word that elaida had said though she wondered why it was necessary in the beginning she had left out unimportant bits and mesaana knew every time demanded everyword every gesture and facial expression plainly she eavesdropped on those meetings alviarin had tried to work out the logic of it and failed some things did work to logic though she had met others of the chosen whom fools called the forsaken lanfear had come within the tower and graendal imperious in their strength and knowledge making it clear without words that alviarin was far beneath them a scullery maid to run errands and wriggle with pleasure if she received a kind word beвђlal had snatched alviarin away in the night while she slept вђ to where she still did not know she had wakened back in her own bed and that had terrified her even more than being in the presence of a man who could channel to him she was not even a worm not even a living thing just a piece in a game to move at his command first had been ishamael years before the others plucking her out of the hidden mass of the black ajah to place her at its head to each she had knelt saying that she lived to serve and meaning it obeying as they commanded whatever the command after all they stood only a step below the great lord of the dark himself and if she wanted the rewards of her service the immortality it seemed they already possessed it was well to obey to each she knelt and only mesaana had appeared with an inhuman face this cloak of shadow and light must be woven with the one power but alviarin could see no weave she had felt the strength of lanfear and graendal had known from the first instant how much stronger in the power they were than she but in mesaana she sensed nothing as if the woman could not channel at all the logic was clear and stunning mesaana hid herself because she might be recognized she must reside in the tower itself on the face of it that seemed impossible yet nothing else fit given that she must be one of the sisters surely she was not among servants bound to labor and sweat but who too many women had been out of the tower for years before elaidaвђs summons too many had no close friends or none at all mesaana must be one of those alviarin very much wanted to know even if she could make no use of it knowledge was power so our elaida has had a foretelling mesaana chimed and alviarin realized with a start that she had reached the end of her recital her knees hurt but she knew better than to rise without permission a finger of shadow tapped silver lips thoughtfully had she seen any sister make that gesture strange that she should be so clear and so erratic at the same time it was always a rare talent and most who had it spoke so only poets could understand usually until it was too late to matter at least everything always became clear then alviarin kept silent none of the chosen conversed they commanded or demanded interesting predictions the rebels breaking вђ like a rotten melon вђ was that part of it i am not certain great mistress she said slowly вђ had it been вђ but mesaana only shrugged either it is or it is not and either way can be used she is dangerous great mistress her talent could reveal what should not be revealed crystalline laughter answered her such as you your black ajah sisters or perhaps you think to safeguard me you are a good girl sometimes child that silvery voice was amused alviarin felt her face heat and hoped that mesaana read the shame not the anger do you suggest that our elaida should be disposed of child not yet i think she has her uses still at least until young alвђthor reaches us and very likely after write out her orders and see to them watching her play her little games is certainly amusing you children almost match the ajahat times will she succeed in having the king of illian and the queen of saldaea kidnapped you aes sedai used to do that didnвђt you but not for вђ what вђ two thousand years who will she try to put on the throne of cairhien will the offer of being king in tear overcome the high lord darlinвђs dislike of aes sedai will our elaida choke on her own frustration first a pity she resists the idea of a larger army iвђd have thought her ambitions would leap at that the interview was coming to a close вђ they never lasted longer than for alviarin to report and be given her own orders вђ but she had a question yet to ask the black tower great mistress alviarin wet her lips she had learned much since ishamael appeared to her not least that the chosen were neither omnipotent nor allknowing she had risen because ishamael killed her predecessor in his wrath at discovering what jarna malari had begun yet it had not ended for another two years after the death of another amyrlin she often wondered whether elaida had had any hand in the death of that one sierin vayu certainly the black ajah had not jarna had had tamra ospenya the amyrlin before sierin squeezed like a bunch of grapes вђ obtaining little juice as it turned out вђ and made her appear to have died in her sleep but alviarin and the other twelve sisters of the great council had paid in pain before they could convince ishamael they had no responsibility for it the chosen were not allpowerful and they did not know everything yet sometimes they knew what no one else did asking could be dangerous though why was the most dangerous the chosen never liked to be asked why is it safe to send fifty sisters to deal with them great mistress eyes glowing like twin full moons regarded her in silence and a chill slid up alviarinвђs spine jarnaвђs fate flashed into her mind publicly gray jarna had never shown any interest in the terвђangrealno one knew a use for вђ until the day she became snared in one untried for centuries how to activate it remained a mystery still for ten days no one could reach her only listen to her throatwrenching shrieks most of the tower thought jarna a model of virtue when what could be recovered was buried every sister in tar valon and every one who could reach the city in time attended the funeral you have curiosity child mesaana said finally that can be an asset properly directed wrongly directed the threat hung in the air like a gleaming dagger i will direct it as you command great mistress alviarin breathed hoarsely her mouth was dry as dust only as you command but she would still see that no black sisters went with toveine mesaana moved looming over her so she had to crane her neck to look up at that face of light and shadow and suddenly she wondered whether the chosen knew her thoughts if you would serve me child then you must serve and obey me not semirhage or demandred not graendal or anyone else only me and the great lord of course but me above all save him i live to serve you great mistress that came out in a croak but she managed to emphasize the added word for a long moment silvery eyes stared down at her unblinking then mesaana said good i will teach you then but remember that a pupil is not a teacher i choose who learns what and i decide when they can make use of it should i find you have passed on the smallest scrap or used even a hair of it without my direction i will extinguish you alviarin worked moisture back into her mouth there was no anger in those chimes only certainty i live to serve you great mistress i live to obey you great mistress she had just learned something about the chosen that she could hardly credit knowledge was power you have a little strength child not much but enough a weave appeared seemingly from nowhere this mesaana chimed is called a gateway pedron niall grunted as morgase placed a white stone on the board with a smile of triumph lesser players might set two dozen more stones each yet but he could see the inevitable course now and so could she in the beginning the goldenhaired woman seated on the other side of the small table had played to lose to make the game close enough to be interesting for him but it had not taken her long to learn that that led to obliteration not to mention that he was clever enough to see through the subterfuge and would not tolerate it now she plied all her skill and managed to win nearly half their games no one had beaten him so often in a good many years the game is yours he told her and the queen of andor nodded well she would be queen again he would see to that in green silk with a high lace collar brushing her chin she looked every inch a queen despite the sheen of perspiration on her smooth cheeks she hardly appeared old enough to have a daughter elayneвђs age though much less a son gawynвђs you did not realize i saw the trap you were laying from your thirtyfirst stone lord niall and you took my feint from the fortythird stone to be my real attack excitement sparkled in her blue eyes morgase liked to win she liked playing to win it was all meant to lull him of course the playing at stones the politeness morgase knew she was a prisoner in the fortress of the light in all but name albeit a luxuriously pampered prisoner and a secret one he had allowed stories of her presence to spread but issued no proclamations andor had too strong a history of opposing the children of the light he would announce nothing until legions moved into andor with her their figurehead morgase certainly knew that as well very probably she also knew he was aware of her attempts to soften him the treaty she had signed gave the children rights in andor they had never possessed anywhere except here in amadicia and he expected that she already planned how to lighten his hand on her land how to remove his hand altogether as soon as she could she had only signed because he backed her into a corner yet confined in that corner she fought on as skillfully as she maneuvered on a stones board for one so beautiful she was a tough woman no she was tough and that was that she did let herself be caught up for the pure pleasure of the game but he could not count that a fault when it gave him so many pleasant moments had he been even twenty years younger he might have played more to her true game long years as a widower stretched behind him and the lord captain commander of the children of the light had little time for pleasantries with women little time for anything except beinglord captain commander had he been twenty years younger вђwell twentyfive вђ and she not trained by the tar valon witches it was easy to forget that in her presence the white tower was a sink of iniquity and the shadow and she touched deeply by it rhadam asunawa the high inquisitor would have tried her for her months in the white tower and hanged her without delay had niall allowed it he sighed regretfully morgase kept her victorious smile but those big eyes studied his face with an intelligence she could not hide he filled her goblet and his own with wine from the silver pitcher sitting in a bowl of cool water that had been ice a little while ago my lord niall the hesitation was just right the slim hand halfstretched across the table toward him the added respect in how she addressed him once she had called him simply niall with more contempt than she would have handed a drunken groom the hesitation would have been just right had he not had the measure of her my lord niall surely you can order galad to amador so i may see him just for a day i regret he replied smoothly that galadвђs duties keep him in the north you should be proud he is one of the best young officers among the children her stepson was a lever to use on her at need one best used now by keeping him away the young man wasa good officer perhaps the best to join the children in niallвђs time and there was no need to put strains on his oath by letting him know his mother was here and a guest only by courtesy no more than a slight tightening of her mouth quickly gone betrayed her disappointment this was not the first time she had made that request nor would it be the last morgase trakand did not surrender just because it was plain she was beaten as you say my lord niall she said so meekly that he nearly choked on his wine submissiveness was a new tactic one she must have worked up with difficulty it is just a motherвђs вђ my lord captain commander a deep resonant voice broke in from the doorway i fear i have important news that cannot wait my lord abdel omerna stood tall in the whiteandgold tabard of a lord captain of the children of the light bold face framed by wings of white at his temples dark eyes deep and thoughtful from head to toe he was fearless and commanding and a fool though that was not apparent at a glance morgase drew in on herself at the sight of omerna so small a motion most men would not have noticed she believed him spymaster for the children as everyone did a man to be feared almost as much as asunawa perhaps more even omerna himself did not know he was but a decoy to keep eyes away from the true master of spies a man known only to niall himself sebban balwer niallвђs dry little stick of a secretary yet decoy or not something useful did pass through omernaвђs hands on occasion on rare occasions something dire niall had no doubts what the man had brought nothing else except rand alвђthor at the gates would have sent him barging in this way the light send it was all a rug merchantвђs madness i fear our gaming is done for this morning niall told morgase standing he offered her a slight bow as she rose and she acknowledged it by inclining her head until this evening perhaps her voice still held that almost docile tone that is if you will dine with me niall accepted of course he did not know where she was leading with this new tactic вђ not where an oaf might suppose he was sure вђ but it would be amusing to find out the woman was full of surprises such a pity she was tainted by the witches omerna advanced as far as the great sunflare of gold set in the floor that had been worn by feet and knees over centuries it was a plain room aside from that and the captured banners that lined the walls high beneath the ceiling agetattered and worn omerna watched her skirt around him without really acknowledging his presence and when the door closed behind her he said i have not yet found elayne or gawyn my lord is thatyour important news niall demanded irritably balwer reported morgaseвђs daughter in ebou dar still mired to her neck with the witches orders concerning her had already been sent to jaichim carridin her other son still toiled with the witches as well it seemed in tar valon where even balwer possessed few eyesandears niall took a long swallow of cool wine his bones felt old and brittle and cold of late yet the shadowspawned heat made his skin sweat enough and dried his mouth omerna gave a start ah no my lord he fumbled in a pocket of his white undercoat and pulled out a tiny bone cylinder with three red stripes running its length you wanted this brought as soon as the pigeon arrived in the вђ he cut off as niall snatched the tube this was what he had been waiting for the reason a legion was not already on its way to andor with morgase riding at its head if not leading if it was not all varadinвђs madness the ravings of a man unbalanced by watching tarabon collapse into anarchy andor would have to wait andor and maybe more i i have confirmation that the white tower truly has broken omerna went on the the black ajah has seized tar valon no wonder he sounded nervous speaking heresy there was no black ajah all of the witches were darkfriends niall ignored him and broke the wax sealing the tube with his thumbnail he had used balwer to start those rumors and now they came back to him omerna believed every rumor his ears caught and his ears caught them all and there are reports that the witches are conferring with the false dragon alвђthor my lord of course the witches were conferring with him he was their creation their puppet niall shut out the foolвђs blather and moved back to the gaming table while he drew a slim roll of paper from the tube he never let anyone know more of these messages than that they existed and few knew that much his hands trembled as they unrolled the thin paper his hands had not trembled since he was a boy facing his first battle more than seventy years ago those hands seemed little more than bone and sinew now but they still possessed enough strength for what he had to do the writing was not that of varadin but of faisar sent to tarabon for a different purpose niallвђs stomach twisted into a knot as he read it was in clear language not varadinвђs cipher varadinвђs reports had been the work of a man on the brink of madness if not over yet faisar confirmed the worst of it and more much more alвђthor was a rabid beast a destroyer who must be stopped but now a second mad animal had appeared one that might be even more dangerous than the tar valon witches with their tame false dragon but how under the light could he fight both it it seems that queen tenobia has left saldaea my lord and the the dragonsworn are burning and killing across altara and murandy i have heard the horn of valere has been found in kandor still halfdistracted niall looked up to find omerna at his side licking his lips and wiping sweat from his forehead with the back of his hand no doubt he hoped for a glance at what was in the message well everyone would know soon enough it seems one of your wilder fancies wasnвђt so wild after all niall said and that was when he felt the knife go in under his ribs shock froze him long enough for omerna to pull the dagger free and plunge it in again other lord captain commanders had died this way before him yet he had never thought it would be omerna he tried to grapple with his killer but there was no force in his arms he hung on to omerna with the man supporting him the pair of them eye to eye omernaвђs face was red he looked ready to weep it had to be done it had to be you let the witches sit there in salidar unhindered and as if suddenly realizing that he had his arms around the man he was murdering he pushed niall away strength had gone from niallвђs legs now as well as his arms he fell heavily against the gaming table turning it over black and white stones scattered across the polished wooden floor around him the silver pitcher bounced and splashed wine the cold in his bones was leaching out into the rest of him he was not certain whether time had slowed for him or everything really did happen so quickly boots thudded across the floor and he lifted his head wearily to see omerna gaping and wideeyed backing away from eamon valda every bit as much the picture of a lord captain as omerna in his whiteandgold tabard and white undercoat valda was not so tall not so plainly commanding but the dark manвђs face was hard as ever and he had a sword in his hands the heronmark blade he prized so highly treason valda bellowed and drove the sword through omernaвђs chest niall would have laughed if he could breath came hard and he could hear it bubbling in the blood in his throat he had never liked valda вђ in fact he despised the man вђ but someone had to know his eyes shifted found the slip of paper from tanchico lying not far from his hand it might be missed there but not if his corpse clutched it and that message had to be read his hand seemed to crawl across the floorboards so slowly brushing the paper pushing it as he fumbled to take hold his vision was growing misty he tried to force himself to see he had to the fog was thicker part of him tried to shake that thought there was no fog the fog was thicker and there was an enemy out there unseen hidden as dangerous as alвђthor or more the message what what message it was time to mount and out sword time for one last attack by the light win or die he was coming he tried to snarl valda wiped his blade on omernaвђs tabard then suddenly realized the old wolf still breathed a rasping bubbling sound grimacing he bent to make an end вђ and a gaunt longfingered hand caught his arm would you be lord captain commander now my son asunawaвђs emaciated face belonged on a martyr yet his dark eyes burned with a fervor to unnerve even those who did not know who he was you may well be after i attest that you killed pedron niallвђs assassin but not if i must say that you ripped open niallвђs throat as well baring teeth in what could pass for a smile valda straightened asunawa had a love of truth a strange love he could tie it into knots or hang it up and flay it while it screamed but so far as valda knew he never actually lied a look at niallвђs glazed eyes and the pool of blood spreading beneath him satisfied valda the old man was dying may asunawa the high inquisitorвђs gaze burned hotter as asunawa stepped back moving the snowy cloak away from niallвђs blood even a lord captain was not supposed to be that familiar i said may my son you have been oddly reluctant to agree that the witch morgase must be given to the hand of the light unless you give that assurance вђ morgase is needed yet breaking in gave valda considerable pleasure he did not like questioners the hand of the light as they called themselves who could like men who never met an enemy not disarmed and in chains they held themselves apart from the children separate asunawaвђs cloak bore only the scarlet shepherdвђs crook of the questioners not the flaring golden sun of the children that graced his own tabard worse they seemed to think their work with racks and hot irons was the only true work of the children morgase gives us andor so you cannot have her before we have it and we cannot take andor until the prophetвђs mobs are crushed the prophet had to be first preaching the coming of the dragon reborn his mobs burning villages too slow to proclaim for alвђthor niallвђs chest barely moved now unless you want to trade amadicia for andor instead of holding both i mean to see alвђthor hung and the white tower ground to dust asunawa and i did not go along with your plan just to see you toss it all on the midden asunawa was not taken aback he was no coward not here with hundreds of questioners in the fortress and most of the children wary of putting a foot wrong around them he ignored the sword in valdaвђs hands and that martyrвђs face took on a look of sadness his sweat seemed to be tears of regret in that case since lord captain canvele believes that the law must be obeyed i fear вђ ifear canvele agrees with me asunawa since dawn he did since he realized that valda had brought half a legion into the fortress canvele was no fool the question is not whether i will be lord captain commander when the sun sets today but who will guide the hand of the light in its digging for truth no coward asunawa and even less a fool than canvele he neither flinched nor demanded how valda thought to bring this about i see he said after a moment and then mildly do you mean to flout the law entirely my son valda almost laughed you can examine morgase but she is not to be put to the question you can have her for that when i am done with her which might take a little time finding a replacement for the lion throne one who understood her proper relationship to the children as king ailron did here would not happen overnight perhaps asunawa understood and perhaps not he opened his mouth and there was a gasp from the doorway niallвђs pinchfaced secretary stood there pursemouthed and knobby narrow eyes trying to stare at everything except the bodies stretched out on the floor a sad day master balwer asunawa intoned his voice sorrowful iron the traitor omerna has slain our lord captain commander pedron niall the light illumine his soul not an advance on the truth niallвђs chest no longer moved and killing him had been treason lord captain valda entered too late to save him but he did slay omerna in the full depth of his sin balwer gave a start and began drywashing his hands the birdlike fellow made valda itch since you are here balwer you may as well be useful he disliked useless people and the scribbler was the very form of uselessness carry this message to each lord captain in the fortress tell them the lord captain commander has been murdered and i call for a meeting of the council of the anointed his first act on being named lord captain commander would be to boot the driedup little man out of the fortress boot him so far he bounced twice and choose a secretary who did not twitch whether omerna was bought by the witches or the prophet i mean to see pedron niall avenged as you say my lord balwerвђs voice was dry and narrow it shall be as you say he apparently found himself able to look on niallвђs body at last as he bowed himself out jerkily he hardly looked at anything else so it seems you will be our next lord captain commander after all asunawa said once balwer was gone so it seems valda answered dryly a tiny slip of paper lay next to niallвђs outstretched hand the sort used in sending messages by pigeon valda bent and picked it up then exhaled in disgust the paper had been sitting in a puddle of wine whatever had been written on it was lost the ink a blur and the hand will have morgase when your need for her is done that was not in the slightest a question i will hand her to you myself perhaps a little something might be arranged to sate asunawaвђs appetite for a while it might make sure morgase remained amenable too valda dropped the bit of rubbish on niallвђs corpse the old wolf had lost his cunning and his nerve with age and now it would be up to eamon valda to bring the witches and their false dragon to heel flat on his belly on a rise gawyn surveyed disaster beneath the afternoon sun dumaiвђs wells lay miles to the south now across rolling plain and low hills but he could still see the smoke from burning wagons what had happened there after he led what he could gather of the younglings in breaking out he did not know alвђthor had seemed well in charge alвђthor and those blackcoated men who appeared to be channeling taking down aes sedai and aiel alike it had been the realization that sisters were fleeing that told him it was time to go he wished he could have killed alвђthor for his mother dead by the manвђs doing egwene denied it but she had no proof for his sister if min had spoken the truth вђ he should have made her leave the camp with him whatever she wanted there was too much he should have done differently today вђ if min was right and elayne loved alвђthor then that dreadful fate was reason enough to kill maybe the aiel had done the work for him he doubted it though with a sour laugh he raised the tube of his looking glass one of the golden bands bore an inscription from morgase queen of andor to her beloved son gawyn may he be a living sword for his sister and andor bitter words now there was not much to see beyond sere grass and small scattered clumps of trees the wind still gusted raising waves of dust occasionally a flash of movement in a crease between squat ridges spoke of men on the move aiel he was sure they blended with the land too well to be greencoated younglings the light send that more had escaped than those he had brought out he was a fool he should have killed alвђthor he had to kill him but he could not not because the man was the dragon reborn but because he had promised egwene not to raise a hand against alвђthor as a lowly accepted she had vanished from cairhien leaving gawyn only a letter that he had read and reread until the paper was ready to tear along the folds and he would be unsurprised to learn she had gone to aid alвђthor in some way he could not break his word least of all to the woman he loved never his word to her whatever the cost to himself he hoped she would accept the compromise he had made with his honor he had raised not a hand to harm but none to help either the light send she never asked that of him it was said that love addled menвђs brains and he was the proof suddenly he pressed the looking glass to his eye as a woman galloped a tall black horse into the open he could not make out her face but no servant would be wearing a dress divided for riding so at least one aes sedai had managed to escape if sisters had made it out of the trap alive maybe more of the younglings had too with luck he could find them before they were killed in small groups by the aiel first there was the matter of this sister though in many ways he would rather have gone on without her but leaving her alone maybe to take an arrow she never saw coming was not an option he could allow himself as he started to rise and wave to her though the horse stumbled and fell pitching her over its head he cursed then again when the looking glass showed him an arrow standing up from the blackвђs side hastily he scanned the hills and bit down on another curse maybe two dozen veiled aiel stood on a crest staring toward downed horse and rider less than a hundred paces from the aes sedai quickly he glanced back the sister rose unsteadily to her feet if she kept her wits and used the power there should be no way a few aiel could harm her especially if she took shelter against more arrows behind the fallen horse even so he would feel better when he had gathered her in rolling away from the crest to lessen the chances of the aiel seeing him he slid down the reverse slope until he could stand he had brought five hundred and eightyone younglings south almost every one who was far enough along in training to leave tar valon but fewer than two hundred waited on their horses in the hollow before disaster struck at dumaiвђs wells he was certain there had been a plot afoot to see that he and the younglings died without returning to the white tower why he did not know nor whether the scheme came from elaida or galina but it had succeeded well enough if not exactly in the way its devisers had thought small wonder that he would have preferred to go on without aes sedai had he any choice he stopped beside a tall gray gelding with a young rider young as indeed all the younglings were вђ many did not need to shave beyond every third day and a few still only pretended even that вђ but jisao wore the silver tower on his collar marking him a veteran of the fighting when siuan sanche was deposed and scars beneath his clothes from fighting since he was one of those who could skip the razor most mornings his dark eyes belonged to a man thirty years older though what did his own eyes look like gawyn wondered jisao we have a sister to pull out of the вђ the hundred or so aiel who came trotting over the low rise to the west recoiled in surprise at finding the younglings below but neither surprise nor the younglingsвђ superior numbers held them back in a flash they veiled and plunged down the slope darting in with spears stabbing at horses as often as riders working in pairs yet if the aiel knew how to fight men on horseback the younglings had recently had rough lessons in how to fight aiel and slow learners did not live long in their ranks some carried slender lances ending in a foot and a half of steel with a crossguard to prevent the head penetrating too deeply and all could use their swords as well as any but a blademaster they fought in twos and threes each man watching anotherвђs back keeping their mounts moving so the aiel could not hamstring the animals only the quickest aiel managed to get inside those circles of flashing steel the wartrained horses themselves were weapons splitting skulls with their hooves seizing men with their teeth and shaking them like dogs worrying rats jaws tearing away half a manвђs face the horses screamed as they fought and men grunted with effort shouted with the fever that overtook men in battle the fever that said they were alive and would live to see another sunrise if they had to wade waistdeep in blood they shouted as they killed shouted as they died there seemed little difference gawyn had no time to watch or listen though the only youngling afoot he attracted attention three cadinвђsorclad figures dodged through the horsemen rushing at him with spears ready perhaps they thought him easy meat three on one he disabused them his sword left the scabbard smoothly as smoothly as he flowed from the falcon stoops to the creeper embraces the oak to the moon rises over the lakes three times he felt the shock in his wrists of blade meeting flesh and that quickly three veiled aielmen were down two still moving weakly but they were out of the fight as much as the other the next to confront him was a different matter a lean fellow overtopping gawyn by a hand he moved like a snake spear flickering while his buckler darted and slanted to deflect sword strokes with a force gawyn could feel to his shoulders the wood grouse dances became folding the air became the courtier taps his fan and the aielman met each of them at the cost of a slash along his ribs while gawyn took a gash on his thigh that only a quick twist kept from being a stab clean through they circled one another oblivious to whatever happened around them blood oozed hot down gawynвђs leg the aielman feinted hoping to draw him off balance feinted again gawyn shifted from stance to stance sword now high now low hoping the man would extend one of those halfthrusts just a little too far in the end it was chance that decided matters the aielman abruptly stumbled a step and gawyn ran him through the heart before he even saw the horse that had backed into the man once he would have felt regret he had grown up believing that if two men must fight the duel should proceed honorably and cleanly more than half a year of battles and skirmishes had taught him better he put a foot on the aielmanвђs chest and wrenched his blade free ungallant but fast and in battle slow was often dead only when his sword was free there was no need for speed men were down younglings and aielmen some groaning some still and the rest of the aiel streaming away to the east harried by two dozen younglings including some who should know better hold he shouted if the idiots allowed themselves to become separated the aiel would cut them to dogmeat no pursuit hold i said hold burn you the younglings pulled up reluctantly jisao reined his gelding around they just thought to cut a path through us on the way wherever theyвђre going my lord his sword dripped red from half its length gawyn caught the reins of his own bay stallion and swung into the saddle not waiting to clean or sheath his blade no time to see who was dead who might live forget them that sister is waiting for us hal keep your halftroop to look after the wounded and watch those aiel just because theyвђre dying doesnвђt mean they have quit the rest follow me hal saluted with his sword but gawyn was already digging in his spurs the skirmish had not lasted long yet too long however short when gawyn reached the crest only the dead horse was to be seen its saddlebags turned out scanning through his looking glass revealed not a sign of the sister the aiel or anything else living all that moved was windblown dust and a dress on the ground near the horse stirring in the gusts the woman must have sprinted to be so completely out of sight so quickly she canвђt have gone far even running jisao said we can find her if we fan out weвђll search after we see to the wounded gawyn replied firmly he was not about to split up his men with aiel roaming loose only a few hours yet till sunset and he wanted a tight camp on high ground before then it might be as well if he did manage to find a sister or two someone was going to have to explain this catastrophe to elaida and he would as soon it was an aes sedai facing her wrath not him turning his bay with a sigh he rode back down to see what the butcherвђs bill had been this time that had been his first real lesson as a soldier you always had to pay the butcher he had a feeling there would be bigger bills due soon the world would forget dumaiвђs wells in what was coming chapter wolf high chasaline the wheel of time turns and ages come and pass leaving memories that become legend legend fades to myth and even myth is long forgotten when the age that gave it birth comes again in one age called the third age by some an age yet to come an age long past a wind rose in the great forest called braem wood the wind was not the beginning there are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the wheel of time but it was abeginning north and east the wind blew as the searing sun rose higher in a cloudless sky north and east through parched trees with brown leaves and bare branches through scattered villages where the air shimmered from the heat the wind brought no relief no hint of rain much less snow north and east it blew past an ancient arch of finely worked stone that some said had been a gateway to a great city and others a monument to some long forgotten battle only weathered illegible remnants of carving remained on the massive stones mutely recalling the lost glories of storied coremanda a few wagons trundled by in sight of the arch along the tar valon road and folk afoot shielded their eyes from dust raised by hooves and wagon wheels and driven by the wind most had no idea where they were going only that the world seemed to turn somersaults all order ending where it was not gone already fear drove some on while others were drawn by something they could not quite see and did not understand and most of them were afraid too onward the wind traveled across the graygreen river erinin heeling ships that still carried trade north and south for there had to be trade even in these days though none could be sure where it was safe to trade east of the river the forests began to thin giving way eventually to low rolling hills covered in brown tinderdry grass and dotted sparsely with small clumps of trees atop one of those hills stood a circle of wagons many with the canvas scorched or else completely burned away from the iron hoops on a makeshift flagstaff trimmed from a young tree dead in the drought and lashed to a bare wagon hoop for more height waved a crimson banner a blackandwhite disc in its heart the banner of light some called it or alвђthorвђs banner others had darker names and shivered as they spoke them in whispers the wind shook the banner hard and was gone quickly as if glad to be away perrin aybara sat on the ground with his broad back against a wagon wheel wishing the wind lingered it had been cooler for a moment and the wind from the south had cleared the scent of death from his nostrils a scent that reminded him where he was supposed to be the last place he wanted to be much better here inside the wagon circle his back to the north where he could forget after a fashion the surviving wagons had been hauled up to the hilltop yesterday in the afternoon once men could find strength to do more than thank the light they still breathed now the sun climbed again and the heat with it irritably he scratched at his short curly beard the more he sweated the more it itched sweat rolled down the face of every man he could see except the aiel and water lay nearly a mile away to the north now but so did the horrors and the smells most considered it a fair trade he should have been doing his duty yet the touch of guilt did not move him today was high chasaline and back home in the two rivers there would be feasting all day and dancing all night the day of reflection when you were supposed to remember all the good things in your life and anyone who voiced a complaint could find a bucket of water upended over his head to wash away bad luck not something anybody wanted when the weather was cold as it should be a bucket of water would be a pleasure now for a man lucky to be alive he found it remarkably hard to pull up any good thoughts he had learned things about himself yesterday or maybe it had been this morning after it was all done he could sense a few of the wolves still a handful of those that survived and were now on their way elsewhere far from here far from men the wolves were still the talk of the camp uneasy speculation over where they had appeared from and why a few believed rand had called them most thought the aes sedai had the aes sedai did not say what they thought no blame came from the wolves вђ what had happened had happened вђ but he could not match their fatalism they had come because he called them shoulders wide enough to make him seem shorter than he was slumped under the weight of responsibility now and then he heard other wolves that had not come speak with scorn to those that had this was what came of mixing with the twolegs nothing else could be expected it was a strain to keep his thoughts to himself he wanted to be home in the two rivers small chance of that perhaps ever again he wanted to howl that the scornful ones were right he wanted to be with his wife anywhere at all and everything the way it was before the chances of which seemed little better maybe worse far more than the yearning for home more even than the wolves worry about faile ate inside him like a ferret trying to burrow out of his middle she had actually seemed glad to see him leave cairhien what was he to do about her he could not think of words to describe how much he loved his wife and needed her but she was jealous where she had no cause hurt where he had done nothing angry where he could not see why he must do something but what the answer eluded him careful thought was all he had while faile was flashing quicksilver the aiel should put some clothes on them aram muttered primly scowling at the ground he squatted nearby patiently holding the reins of a rangy gray gelding he seldom went far from perrin the sword strapped to his back jarred with his greenstriped tinker coat hanging undone for the heat a rolled kerchief tied around his forehead kept sweat from his eyes once perrin had thought him almost too goodlooking for a man a bleak darkness had settled in him though and now he wore a scowl as often as not it isnвђt decent lord perrin perrin put aside thoughts of faile reluctantly with time he could puzzle it out he had to somehow it is their way aram aram grimaced as if he might spit well it isnвђt a decent way it keeps them under control i suppose вђ nobody would run far to make trouble like that вђ but it isnвђt decent there were aiel all over the place of course tall aloof men in grays and browns and greens their only bit of color the scarlet strip of cloth tied around their temples with the blackandwhite disc on their foreheads siswaiвђaman they called themselves sometimes that word tickled the edge of his memory like a word he should know ask one of the aielmen and he looked as if you had babbled nonsense but then they ignored the strips of cloth too no maiden of the spear wore the scarlet headband whether whitehaired or looking barely old enough to leave her mother every maiden stalked about giving the siswaiвђamanchallenging stares that seemed somehow selfsatisfied while the men looked back flateyed with a smell almost of hunger a matter of jealousy by the scent of all of them though over what perrin could not begin to imagine whatever it was it was not new and it did not seem likely to come to blows a few of the wise ones were inside the wagons as well in bulky skirts and white blouses wearing their dark shawls in defiance of the heat glittering bracelets and necklaces of gold and ivory making up for the plainness of the rest of their clothes some appeared amused by the maidens and the siswaiвђaman and others exasperated all of them вђ wise ones maidens and siswaiвђamanвђ ignored the shaido the way perrin would have a stool or a rug the aiel had taken two hundred or so shaido prisoners yesterday men and maidens вђ not many considering the numbers involved вђ and they moved about freely in a manner of speaking perrin would have been a lot more comfortable had they been guarded and clothed instead they fetched water and ran errands naked as the day they were born with other aiel they were meek as mice anyone else received a proudly defiant stare for noticing them perrin was not the only one who tried not to notice them and aram not the only one to mutter a good many of the two rivers men in camp did one or both a good many of the cairhienin nearly had apoplexy whenever they saw one of the shaido the mayeners just shook their heads as though it were all a joke and ogled the women they had as little shame as the aiel the mayeners gaul explained it to me aram you know what a gaiвђshainis donвђt you about jiвђeвђtohand serving a year and a day and all that the other man nodded which was a good thing perrin did not know much himself gaulвђs explanations of aiel ways often left him more confused gaul always thought it all selfevident well gaiвђshainarenвђt allowed to wear anything one of the algaiвђdвђsiswaimight wear вђ that means вђspear fightersвђ he added at aramвђs questioning frown suddenly he realized he was looking straight at one of the shaido as she trotted in his general direction a tall young woman goldenhaired and pretty despite a long thin scar down her cheek and other scars elsewhere very pretty and very naked clearing his throat roughly he pulled his eyes away he could feel his face heating anyway that is why they are the way they are gaiвђshainwear white robes and they donвђt have any here itвђs just their way burn gaul and burn his explanations he thought they could cover them with something perrin goldeneyes said a womanвђs voice carahuin sends to know whether you wish water aramвђs face went purple and he jerked himself around in his squat presenting his back to her no thank you perrin did not need to look up to know it was the goldenhaired shaido woman he kept peering off at nothing in another direction aiel had a peculiar sense of humor and maidens of the spear вђ carahuin was a maiden вђ had the most peculiar they had quickly seen how the wetlanders reacted to the shaido вђ they would have needed to be blind not to вђ and suddenly gaiвђshainwere being sent to wetlanders left and right and aiel all but rolling on the ground at the blushes and stammers and even the shouting he was sure that carahuin and her friends were watching now this was at least the tenth time one of the gaiвђshainwomen had been sent to ask him whether he wanted water or had a spare whetstone or some such bloody fool thing abruptly a thought struck him the mayeners were seldom bothered this way a handful of cairhienin plainly enjoyed looking if not so openly as the mayeners and some of the older two rivers men who should have known better the point was none of them had had a second spurious message that he knew of those who reacted the most on the other hand cairhienin who had shouted the loudest about indecency and two or three of the younger two rivers men who stammered and blushed so hard they looked ready to melt had been pestered until they fled the wagons entirely with an effort perrin looked up at the gaiвђshainвђs face at her eyes focus on her eyes he thought frantically they were green and large and not at all meek her scent was pure fury thank carahuin for me and tell her you could oil my spare saddle if she doesnвђt mind and i donвђt have a clean shirt if she wouldnвђt mind you doing some laundry she will not mind the woman said in a tight voice then turned and trotted off perrin whipped his eyes away though the image did stay in his head light aram was right but with luck he might just have stopped any more visitations he would have to point this out to aram and the two rivers men maybe the cairhienin would listen too what are we going to do about them lord perrin still looking away aram no longer spoke of gaiвђshain that is randвђs to decide perrin said slowly satisfaction fading it might be odd to think of people wandering about naked as a small problem but this was definitely a bigger and one he had been avoiding as hard as he had what lay to the north on the far side of the wagon circle nearly two dozen women sat on the ground all welldressed for travel many wore silk most with light linen dustcloaks but not a bead of sweat showed on any face three appeared young enough that he might have asked them for a dance before he married faile if they werenвђt aes sedai anyway he thought wryly once he had danced with an aes sedai and nearly swallowed his tongue when he realized who he swung about and she had been a friend if that word applied to aes sedai how new does an aes sedai have to be for me to put an age to herthe others looked ageless of course maybe in their twenties maybe their forties changing from one glance to the next always uncertain that was what their faces said though several showed gray in their hair you just could not tell with aes sedai about anything at least those are no danger anymore aram said jerking his head toward three of the sisters a little apart from the rest one wept face on her knees the other two stared haggardly at nothing one of them plucking aimlessly at her skirt they had been much the same since yesterday at least none was screaming any longer if perrin had the straight of it which he was not sure he did they had been stilled somehow when rand broke free they would never channel the one power again to aes sedai it was probably better to be dead he would have expected the other aes sedai to comfort them care for them somehow but most ignored the three entirely although a little too studied in looking anywhere and everywhere else for that matter the stilled aes sedai refused to acknowledge the rest either in the beginning at least a few of the other sisters had approached each by herself calm to the eye yet smelling sharply of aversion and reluctance but they got nothing for their pains not word or glance none had gone near this morning perrin shook his head the aes sedai seemed to do a lot of ignoring of what they did not want to admit for instance the blackcoated men standing over them there was an ashaвђman for each sister even the three who had been stilled and they never seemed to blink for their part the aes sedai looked past the ashaвђman or through them they might as well not have existed it was quite a trick he could not make himself disregard the ashaвђman and he was not under their guard they ranged from fuzzcheeked boys to grayhaired balding gansers and it was not their grim highcollared black coats or the sword each wore at his hip that made them dangerous every ashaвђman could channel and somehow they were keeping the aes sedai from channeling men who could wield the one power a thing of nightmares rand could of course but he was rand and the dragon reborn besides these fellows made perrinвђs hackles rise the captive aes sedaiвђs surviving warders sat some distance off under their own guard thirty or so of lord dobraineвђs armsmen in bellshaped cairhienin helmets and as many mayener winged guards in red breastplates each sharpeyed as if guarding leopards a good attitude under the circumstances more warders than there were aes sedai a number of the prisoners were green ajah apparently more guards than warders a good many more and maybe few enough at that the light send we donвђt see any more grief from that lot perrin muttered twice during the night the warders had tried to break free in truth those outbreaks had been suppressed more by the ashaвђman than by the cairhienin or mayeners and they had not been gentle none of the warders had been killed but at least a dozen nursed broken bones none of the sisters had yet been allowed to heal if the lord dragon cannot make the decision aram said quietly maybe it should be made by somebody else to protect him perrin gave him a sidelong look what decision the sisters told them not to make another attempt and theyвђll obey their aes sedai broken bones or no unarmed as they were hands tied behind their backs the warders still looked like a wolfpack awaiting the lead wolfвђs command to attack none would rest easy until his aes sedai was free maybe until all of the sisters were free aes sedai and warders a stack of wellaged oak ready for a flame but even warders and aes sedai had proved no match for ashaвђman i did not mean the warders aram hesitated then shuffled closer to perrin and lowered his voice further to a hoarse whisper the aes sedai kidnapped the lord dragon he canвђt trust them not ever but he wonвђt do what he has to either if they died before he knew it вђ what are you saying perrin almost choked as he sat bolt upright not for the first time he wondered whether there was any tinker left in the other man theyвђre helpless aram helpless women they are aes sedai dark eyes met perrinвђs golden stare levelly they cannot be trusted and they cannot be turned loose how long can aes sedai be held against their will theyвђve been doing what they do far longer than the ashaвђman they must know more theyвђre a danger to the lord dragon and to you lord perrin i have seen them look at you across the wagon circle the sisters were talking among themselves in whispers even perrin could not hear mouths held close to ears now and again one did look at him and aram at him not aram he had caught a double handful of names nesune bihara erian boroleos and katerine alruddin coiren saeldain sarene nemdahl and elza penfell janine pavlara beldeine nyram marith riven those last were the young sisters but young or ageless they watched him with faces so serene it seemed they had the upper hand despite the ashaвђman defeating aes sedai was not easy making them admit defeat lay on the far side of impossible he forced his hands to unknot and rest on his knees giving an appearance of calm he was nowhere near feeling they knew he was taвђveren one of those few the pattern would shape itself around for a time worse they knew he was tied to rand in some way nobody understood least of all himself or rand or mat mat was in that tangle too another taвђveren though neither of them as strongly as rand given half a chance those women would have him вђ and mat вђ inside the white tower as fast as they would rand tethered like goats until the lion came and they hadkidnapped rand mistreated him aram was right about one thing they could not be trusted but what aram suggested вђ he would not вђ could not вђ countenance such a thing the thought made him queasy iвђll hear no more of that he growled the onetime tinker opened his mouth but perrin cut him off not a word aram do you hear me not one word as my lord perrin commands aram murmured inclining his head perrin wished he could see the manвђs face there was no anger in the smell of him no resentment that was the worst of it there had been no anger scent even when aram suggested murder a pair of two rivers men climbed up on the wheels of the next wagon peering across the wagon bed and down the hill toward the north each wore a bristling quiver on his right hip and a stout longbladed knife almost a shortsword on his left a good three hundred men from home had followed perrin here he cursed the first to call him lord perrin cursed the day he had stopped trying to quash it even with the murmurs and noises usual in a camp this size he had no trouble hearing the pair tod alвђcaar a year younger than perrin let out a long breath as if seeing what lay below for the first time perrin could almost sense the lanky manвђs lantern jaw working todвђs mother had willingly let him go only for the honor of her son following perrin goldeneyes a famous victory tod said finally thatвђs what we won wasnвђt it jondyn grizzled jondyn barran gnarled as an oak root was one of the few older men among the three hundred a better bowshot than anyone in the two rivers except master alвђthor and a better hunter than anyone at all he was one of the two riversвђ less distinguished residents jondyn had not worked a day more than he had to since he was old enough to leave his fatherвђs farm the forests and the hunt were all he cared about that and drinking too much at feastdays now he spat loudly if you say so boy was those bloody ashaвђman won it anyway and welcome to it i say too bad they donвђt take it and go someplace else to celebrate they arenвђt so bad tod protested i wouldnвђt mind being one myself that sounded more boast and bluff than truth smelled it too without looking perrin was sure he was licking his lips likely todвђs mother had used tales of men who could channel to frighten him not so many years ago i mean to say rand вђ that is the lord dragon вђ it still sounds odd doesnвђt it rand alвђthor being the dragon reborn and all tod laughed a short uneasy sound well he can channel and it doesnвђt seem so вђ he doesnвђt вђ i mean he swallowed loudly besides what could we have done about all those aes sedai without them that came out in a whisper he smelled afraid now jondyn what are we going to do i mean aes sedai prisoners the older man spat again louder than before he did not bother to lower his voice either jondyn always said what he thought no matter who heard another reason for his bad repute better for us if theyвђd all died yesterday boy weвђll pay for that before itвђs done mark me weвђll pay large perrin shut out the rest no easy task with his ears first aram and now jondyn and tod if not so directly burn jondynno the man might make mat look industrious but if he spoke it others thought it no two rivers man would willingly harm a woman but who else wished the aes sedai prisoners dead and who might try to achieve the wish he scanned the wagon circle uneasily the thought that he might have to protect the aes sedai prisoners was not pleasant but he did not shirk it he had little fondness for any aes sedai least of all for these but he had grown up in the unspoken certainty that a man would put himself at risk to protect a woman as far she allowed whether he liked her or even knew her was beside the point true an aes sedai could tie any man she chose into a knot nine ways from next feastday but cut off from the power they became like anyone else that was the struggle whenever he looked at them two dozen aes sedai two dozen women who might not know howto defend themselves without the power for a bit he studied the ashaвђman guards every one wearing a face like grim death except the three overseeing the stilled women they tried to appear as somber as the rest but under the attempt lay something else satisfaction maybe if only he was close enough to catch a scent of them any aes sedai was a threat to the ashaвђman perhaps the reverse was true too perhaps they would only still them from the little he had picked up stilling an aes sedai amounted to a killing that just took a few years for the corpse to lie down whatever the case he decided reluctantly he had to leave the ashaвђman to rand they spoke only to each other and the prisoners and perrin doubted they would listen to anyone but rand the question was what would rand say and what could perrin do if he said the wrong thing putting that problem aside he scratched his beard with one finger the cairhienin were too nervous about aes sedai to consider harming them and the mayeners too respectful but he would keep an eye on them anyway who would have thought jondyn would go as far as he had among the cairhienin or mayeners he possessed some influence though it would surely vanish if they once thought he was really just a blacksmith after all that left the aiel perrin sighed he was not certain how much influence even rand truly had with the aiel it was difficult picking out individual scents with so many people around but he had grown used to telling as much by smells as by what his eyes told him the siswaiвђamanwho came close enough smelled calm but alert a smooth strong scent they hardly appeared to notice the aes sedai the maidensвђ aromas were spiky with suppressed fury and grew spikier when they looked at the prisoners and the wise ones every wise one who had come here from cairhien was able to channel though none had the ageless face he supposed they used the one power too seldom still smoothcheeked like edarra or as leatheryfaced as whitehaired sorilea they carried themselves with a selfpossession easily matching the aes sedaiвђs graceful women for the most part most of them tall as nearly all aiel were they seemed to ignore the sisters completely sorileaвђs eyes passed across the prisoners without pausing and she went right on talking softly to edarra and another wise one a lean yellowhaired woman he did not know by name if only he could make out what they were saying they walked by not a line changing on those three unruffled faces but their scents were another matter when sorileaвђs gaze swept over the aes sedai the smell of her went cold and distant grim and purposeful and as she spoke to the other two their scents changed to match hers a fine bloody stew he growled trouble aram asked sitting up straighter on his heels right hand poised to dart for the wolfheadpommeled sword hilt jutting above his shoulder he had become very good with that sword in a very short time and he was never loath to use it thereвђs no trouble aram that was not quite a lie jolted out of his glum brooding perrin really looked at the others for the first time at all of them together he did not like what he saw and the aes sedai were only part cairhienin and mayeners watched aiel suspiciously which was no more than the aielвђs return suspicion especially toward the cairhienin no real surprise there aiel did have a certain reputation after all for being none too friendly to anyone born this side of the spine of the world cairhienin least of all simple truth was aiel and cairhienin hated each other about as hard as it was possible to hate neither side had really put their enmity aside вђ the best that could be said was that it was on a loose leash вђ yet up to now he had been convinced they would hold it in for randвђs sake if no other reason a mood hung in the camp though a tension that had wound everyone tight rand was free now and temporary alliances were just that after all temporary aiel hefted their spears when they looked at the cairhienin and the cairhienin grimly fingered their swords so did the mayeners they had no quarrel with the aiel had never fought them except for the aiel war when everybody had but if it came to a fight there was little doubt which side they would be on the two rivers men too probably the dark mood had settled deepest into the ashaвђman and the wise ones though the blackcoated men paid no more heed to the maidens and the siswaiвђamanthan to cairhienin or mayeners or two rivers men but they studied the wise ones with faces almost as dark as those they directed at the aes sedai very likely they made small distinction between one woman who could wield the power and another any could be an enemy and dangerous thirteen together were deadly dangerous and there were better than ninety wise ones in the camp or nearby fewer than half the number of ashaвђman but still enough to do damage if they chose women who could channel yet they seemed to follow rand they seemed to follow rand yet they were women who could channel the wise ones looked at the ashaвђman only a trifle less coldly than they did the aes sedai the ashaвђman were men who could channel but they followed rand they followed rand but rand was a special case according to gaul his channeling was not mentioned in the prophecies about their carвђaвђcarn but the aiel seemed to pretend that inconvenient fact did not exist the ashaвђman were not in those prophecies at all though it must be like discovering you had a pride of rabid lions fighting on your side how long would they remain loyal maybe it would be better to put them down now his head fell back against the wagon wheel eyes closed and his chest heaved in silent mirthless laughter think of the good things on high chasaline burn me he thought wryly i should have gone with rand no it was best to know and better soon than late but what in the light was he to do if the aiel and the cairhienin and mayeners turned on one another or worse the ashaвђman and the wise ones a barrel full of snakes and the only way to find out which were vipers was to stick your hand in light i wish i was home with faile and a forge to work and nobody calling me bloody lord your horse lord perrin you didnвђt say whether you wanted stepper or stayer so i saddled вђ at perrinвђs goldeneyed glare kenly maerin shied back into the dun stallion he was leading perrin made a soothing gesture not kenlyвђs fault what could not be mended had to be endured easy lad you did right stepper will do just fine you chose well he hated speaking to kenly that way short and stocky kenly was barely old enough to marry or leave home вђ and certainly not old enough for the patchy beard he was trying to cultivate in imitation of perrin вђ yet he had fought trollocs at emondвђs field and done well yesterday but he grinned broadly at praise from lord perrin bloody goldeneyes rising perrin took his axe from where he had propped it under the wagon out of sight and for a little while out of mind and thrust the haft through the loop on his belt a heavy halfmoon blade balanced by a thick curving spike a thing made for no other purpose than killing the axe haft felt too familiar to his hands for comfort did he even remember what a good forgehammer felt like there were other things besides lord perrin that it might be too late to change a friend had once told him to keep the axe until he began to like using it the thought made him shiver in spite of the heat he swung into stepperвђs saddle shadowed by aram with the gray and sat facing south into the wagon circle at least half again as tall as even the tallest of the aiel loial was just stepping carefully over crossed wagon tongues with the size of him he did look as though he might break one of the heavy wooden shafts with a heedless step as usual the ogier had a book in his hand a thick finger marking his place and the capacious pockets of his long coat bulged with more he had spent the morning in a tiny clump of trees he called restful and shady but whatever the shade among those trees the heat was affecting him too he looked tired and his coat was undone his shirt unlaced and his boots rolled down below his knees or maybe it was more than the heat just inside the wagons loial paused peering at the aes sedai and the ashaвђman and his tufted ears quivered uneasily eyes big as teacups rolled toward the wise ones and his ears vibrated again ogier were sensitive to the mood of a place when he saw perrin loial came striding across the camp sitting his saddle perrin was two or three hands shorter than loial standing perrin loial whispered this is all wrong it isnвђt right and it is dangerous besides for an ogier it was a whisper he sounded like a bumblebee the size of a mastiff some of the aes sedai turned their heads could you speak a little louder perrin said almost under his breath i think somebody in andor didnвђt hear in the west of andor loial looked startled then grimaced long eyebrows brushing his cheeks i do know how to whisper you know this time it was unlikely anyone could hear clearly more than three paces away or so what are we going to do perrin it is wrong holding aes sedai against their will wrong and wrongheaded too i have said that before and i will again and that isnвђt even the worst the feel here one spark and this place will erupt like a wagonload of fireworks does rand know about this i donвђt know perrin said to both questions and after a moment the ogier nodded reluctantly someone has to know perrin someone has to do something loial looked north over the wagons behind perrin and perrin knew there was no putting it off longer unwillingly he turned stepper he would rather have worried over aes sedai and ashaвђman and wise ones till his hair fell out but what had to be done had to be done think of the good on high chasaline chapter ravens the butcherвђs yard at first perrin did not look downslope toward where he would ride where he should have gone with rand this morning instead he sat his saddle at the edge of the wagons and sent his eyes anywhere else though the view everywhere made him want to sick up it was like being hit in the belly with a hammer hammerstroke nineteen fresh graves atop a squat hill to the east nineteen two rivers men who would never see home again a blacksmith seldom had to see people die because of his decisions at least the two rivers men had obeyed his orders there would have been more graves otherwise hammerstroke rectangles of newly turned earth blanketed the next slope over from that as well near to a hundred mayeners and more cairhienin who had come to dumaiвђs wells to die never mind causes or reasons they had followed perrin aybara hammerstroke the ridgeface to the west seemed solid graves maybe a thousand or more a thousand aiel buried standing upright to face each sunrise a thousand some were maidens the men tied his stomach into knots the women made him want to sit down and cry he tried telling himself that they all had chosen to be here that they had hadto be here both things were true but he had given the orders and that made the responsibility for those graves his not randвђs not the aes sedaiвђs his the living aiel had only stopped singing over their dead a short while ago haunting songs sung in parts that lingered in the mind life is a dream вђ that knows no shade life is a dream вђ of pain and woe a dream from which вђ we pray to wake a dream from which вђ we wake and go who would sleep вђ when the new dawn waits who would sleep вђ when the sweet winds blow a dream must end вђ when the new day comes this dream from which вђ we wake and go they appeared to find comfort in those songs he wished he could too but as far as he could see the aiel truly did not seem to care whether they lived or died and that was mad any sane man wanted to live any sane man would run as far as he could from a battle run as hard as he could stepper tossed his head nostrils flaring at the smells from below and perrin patted the dunвђs neck aram was grinning as he looked at what perrin tried to block out loialвђs face had so little expression it might have been carved from wood his lips moved slightly and perrin thought he heard light let me never see the like again drawing a deep breath he made his eyes follow theirs to dumaiвђs wells in some ways it was not as bad as the graves вђ he had known some of those people since he was a child вђ but it all crashed down on him at once anyway like the scent in his nose made solid and smashing him between the eyes the memories he wanted to forget came rushing back dumaiвђs wells had been a killing ground a dying ground but now it was worse less than a mile away the charred remains of wagons stood around a small copse of trees nearly hiding the low stone copings of the wells and surrounding that a seething sea of black vultures and ravens and crows in tens of thousands swirling up in waves and settling again concealing the broken earth for which perrin was more than grateful the ashaвђmanвђs methods had been brutal destroying flesh and ground with equal impartiality too many shaido had died to bury in less than days even had anyone cared to bury them so the vultures gorged and the ravens and the crows the dead wolves were down there too he had wanted to bury them but that was not the wolvesвђ way three aes sedai corpses had been found their channeling unable to save them from spears and arrows in the madness of battle and half a dozen dead warders too they were buried in the clearing near the wells the birds were not alone with the dead far from it blackfeathered waves rose around lord dobraine taborwin and over two hundred of his mounted cairhienin armsmen and lord lieutenant havien nurelle with all that remained of his mayeners aside from the guards on the warders conwith two white diamonds on blue picked out the cairhienin officers all but dobraine himself and the mayenersвђ red armor and redstreamered lances made a brave show amid the carnage but dobraine was not the only one who held a cloth to his nose here and there a man leaned from the saddle trying to empty a stomach already emptied earlier mazrim taim almost as tall as rand was afoot in his black coat with the blueandgold dragons climbing the sleeves and maybe a hundred more of the ashaвђman some of them heaved up their bellies too there were maidens by the score more siswaiвђamanthan cairhienin and mayeners and ashaвђman combined and several dozen wise ones to boot all supposedly in case the shaido returned or perhaps in case some of the dead were only shamming though perrin thought anyone who pretended at being a corpse here would soon go insane all centered around rand perrin should have been down there with the two rivers men rand had asked for them spoken about trusting men from home but perrin had made no promises heвђll have to settle for me and late he thought in a little bit when he managed to steel himself to the butcherвђs yard below only butcher knives did not mow down people and they were tidier than axes tidier than vultures the blackcoated ashaвђman faded into the sea of birds death swallowed by death and ravens and crows surging up hid the others but rand stood out in the tattered white shirt he had been wearing when rescue came though perhaps he hardly needed deliverance by that time the sight of min close beside rand in pale red coat and snug breeches made perrin grimace that was no place for her or anyone but she stayed closer to rand since the rescue than even taim did somehow rand had managed to free both himself and her well before perrin broke through or even the ashaвђman and perrin suspected she saw randвђs presence as the only real safety sometimes as he strode across that charnel ground rand patted minвђs arm or bent his head as if speaking to her but not with his main attention dark clouds of birds billowed around them the smaller darting away to feed elsewhere the vultures giving ground reluctantly some refusing to take wing extending featherless necks and squawking defiantly as they waddled back now and then rand stopped bending over a corpse sometimes fire darted from his hands to strike down vultures that did not give way every time nandera who led the maidens or sulin her second argued with him sometimes wise ones did too from the way they tugged at the bodyвђs coat as if demonstrating something and rand would nod and move on not without backward glances though and only until another body caught his attention what is he doing demanded a haughty voice at perrinвђs knee by scent he knew her before he looked down statuesque and elegant in a green silk riding dress and thin linen dustcloak kiruna nachiman was sister to king paitar of arafel and a powerful noble in her own right and becoming aes sedai had done nothing to dampen her manner trapped in what he was watching he had not heard her approach why is he down in that he should not be not all the aes sedai in the camp were prisoners though those who were not had been keeping out of sight since yesterday talking among themselves perrin suspected and trying to figure out what had happened at the last maybe trying to figure some way around it now they were out in force bera harkin another green stood at kirunaвђs shoulder a farmwife by looks despite her ageless face and fine woolen dress but every scrap as proud as kiruna in her own way this farmwife would tell a king to scrape his boots before coming into her house and be sharp about it she and kiruna together led the sisters who had come to dumaiвђs wells with perrin or perhaps passed leadership back and forth between them it was not exactly clear which was hardly unusual with aes sedai the other seven stood in a covey not far away or maybe in a pride lionesses not quail by their air of being in charge their warders were arrayed behind them and if the sisters were all outward serenity the warders made no bones of their feelings they were disparate men some in those colorshifting cloaks that seemed to make parts of them disappear but whether short or tall thick or thin just standing there they looked like violence on a frayed leash perrin knew two of those women well verin mathwin and alanna mosvani short and stout and almost motherly at times in a distracted way when she was not studying you like a bird studying a worm verin was brown ajah alanna slim and darkly pretty though a little haggard around the eyes of late for some reason was green altogether five of the nine were green once some time ago verin had told him not to trust alanna too far and he more than took her at her word nor did he trust any of the others including verin neither did rand for all they had fought on his side yesterday and despite what had happened at the end which perrin still was not sure he believed even though he had seen it a good dozen ashaвђman lounged by a wagon about twenty paces from the sisters a cocky fellow named charl gedwyn had charge of them this morning a hardfaced man who swaggered standing still all wore a pin in the shape of a silver sword on their tall coat collars and four or five besides gedwyn had a dragon in goldandred enamel fastened on the other side perrin supposed that had to do with rank in some way he had seen both on some of the other ashaвђman not precisely guards they managed to be wherever kiruna and the others were just taking their ease and keeping a sharp eye open not that the aes sedai took any notice not that you could see even so the sisters smelled wary and puzzled and infuriated part of that had to be because of the ashaвђman well kirunaвђs dark eyes flashed impatience he doubted that many people kept her waiting i donвђt know he lied patting stepperвђs neck again rand doesnвђt tell me everything he understood a little вђ he thought he did вђ but he had no intention of telling anyone that was randвђs to reveal if he chose every body that rand looked at belonged to a maiden perrin was convinced of it a shaido maiden without a doubt but he was not sure how much difference that made to rand last night he had walked away from the wagons to be by himself and as the sound of men laughing because they were alive faded behind him he found rand the dragon reborn who made the world tremble sitting on the ground alone in the dark his arms wrapped around himself rocking back and forth to perrinвђs eyes the moon was nearly as good as the sun but right then he wished for pitch blackness randвђs face was drawn and twisted the face of a man who wanted to scream or maybe weep and was fighting it down with every scrap of his fiber whatever trick the aes sedai knew to keep the heat from touching them rand and the ashaвђman knew too but he was not using it now the nightвђs heat would have done for a morethanwarm summer day and sweat slid down randвђs cheeks as much as perrinвђs he did not look around though perrinвђs boots rustled loudly in the dead grass yet he spoke hoarsely still rocking one hundred and fiftyone perrin one hundred and fiftyone maidens died today for me i promised them you see donвђt argue with me shut up go away despite his sweat rand shivered not you perrin not you i have to keep my promises you see have to no matter how it hurts but i have to keep my promise to myself too no matter how it hurts perrin tried not to think about the fate of men who could channel the lucky ones died before they went mad the unlucky died after whether rand was lucky or unlucky everything rested on him everything rand i donвђt know what to say but вђ rand seemed not to hear back and forth he rocked back and forth isan of the jarra sept of the chareen aiel she died for me today chuonde of the spine ridge miagoma she died for me today agirin of the shelan daryne there had been nothing for it but to settle on his heels and listen to rand recite all one hundred and fiftyone names in a voice like pain stretched to breaking listen and hope rand was holding on to sanity whether or not rand was still completely sane though if a maiden who came to fight for him had been missed down there somehow perrin was sure that not only would she be buried decently with the others on the ridge there would be one hundred and fiftytwo names in that list and that was none of kirunaвђs business not that or perrinвђs doubts rand had to stay sane or sane enough anyway and that was that light send it so and the light burn me for thinking it so coldly perrin thought from the corner of his eye he saw her full mouth tighten momentarily she liked not knowing everything about as well as being made to wait she would have been beautiful in a grand sort of manner except that hers was a face used to getting what it wanted not petulant just absolutely certain that whatever she wanted was right and proper and must be with so many crows and ravens in one place there are certainly hundreds perhaps thousands ready to report what theyвђve seen to a myrddraal she made no effort to mask her irritation she sounded as though he had brought every bird there himself in the borderlands we kill them on sight you have men and they have bows it was true a raven or crow was all too likely to be a spy for the shadow but disgust welled up in him disgust and weariness to what point with that many birds the two rivers men and the aiel could shoot every arrow they had and spies would still report most times there was no way to tell whether the bird you killed was the spy or the one that flew away hasnвђt there been enough killing there will be more soon enough light woman even the ashaвђmanare sated eyebrows rose among the onlooking clutch of sisters no one spoke to aes sedai that way not a king or a queen bera gave him a look that said she was considering hauling him out of the saddle and boxing his ears still peering toward the shambles below kiruna smoothed her skirts her face coldly determined loialвђs ears trembled he had a deep but uneasy respect for aes sedai close to twice as tall as most of the sisters sometimes he behaved as though one might step on him without noticing if he got in her way perrin gave kiruna no chance to speak give an aes sedai a finger and she took your whole arm unless she decided to take more youвђve been staying clear of me but i have a few things to say to you you disobeyed orders yesterday if you want to call it changing the plan he pushed on when she opened her mouth then call it that if you think that makes it better she and the other eight had been told to stay with the wise ones well back from the actual fighting guarded by the two rivers men and the mayeners instead they had plunged right into the thick of it wading in where men were trying to cut one another into dogmeat with swords and spears you took havien nurelle with you and half the mayeners died for it you donвђt go your own way with no regard anymore i wonвђt see men die because you suddenly think you see a better way and the dark one take what everyone else thinks do you understand me are you finished farmboy kirunaвђs voice was dangerously calm the face she turned up to him might have been carved from some dark ice and she reeked of affront standing on the ground she somehow made it seem that she was looking down at him not an aes sedai trick that he had seen faile do it he suspected most women knew how i will tell you something though the meanest intelligence should be able to reason it out by the three oaths no sister may use the one power as a weapon except against shadowspawn or in defense of her life or that of her warders or another sister we could have stood where you would have had us and watched until tarmon gaiвђdon without ever being able to do anything effective not until we were in danger ourselves i do not like having to explain my actions farmboy do not make me do it again do youunderstand loialвђs ears wilted and he stared straight ahead so hard that it was plain he wished he were anywhere but here even with his mother who wanted to marry him off aramвђs mouth hung open and he always tried to pretend aes sedai did not impress him at all jondyn and tod climbed down from their wagon wheel just a touch too casually jondyn managed to stroll away but tod ran looking back over his shoulder her explanation sounded reasonable it was probably the truth no by another of the three oaths it wasthe truth there were loopholes though like not speaking the whole truth or talking around it the sisters might well have put themselves in danger so they could use the power as a weapon but perrin would eat his boots if they had not also been thinking they could reach rand before anybody else what would have happened then was anyoneвђs guess but he was certain their plans had not included anything like what actually happened heвђs coming loial said suddenly look rand is coming dropping to a whisper he added be careful perrin for an ogier it truly was a whisper aram and kiruna probably heard quite clearly and maybe bera but certainly no one besides they did not swear anything to you his voice went back to its normal boom do you think he might talk to me about what went on inside the camp for my book he was writing a book about the dragon reborn or at least taking notes for one i really didnвђt see much once the the fighting began he had been at perrinвђs side in the thick of it wielding an axe with a haft nearly as long as he was tall it was hard to take note of much else when you were trying to stay alive if you listened to loial you would think he was always somewhere else when things became dangerous do you think he might kiruna sedai kiruna and bera exchanged looks then without a word glided across the ground to verin and the others peering after them loial heaved a sigh a wind through caverns you really should have a care perrin he breathed youвђre always so hasty with your tongue he sounded like a bumblebee the size of a cat instead of a mastiff perrin thought he might learn to whisper yet if they spent enough time around aes sedai he motioned the ogier to be quiet though so he could listen the sisters began talking right away but not a sound reached perrinвђs ears clearly they had erected a barrier with the one power clear to the ashaвђman as well they went from lounging to up on their toes in a heartbeat every line of them focused on the sisters nothing said they had taken hold of saidin the male half of the true source but perrin would have wagered stepper they had by gedwynвђs angry sneer he was ready to use it too whatever obstruction the aes sedai had raised they must have dropped it they folded their hands turning to look down the slope in silence glances passed among the ashaвђman and finally gedwyn waved them back to apparent indolence he looked disappointed growling irritably perrin turned back to look beyond the wagons rand was strolling up the slope with min on his arm patting her hand and talking with her once he threw back his head and laughed and she ducked hers to do the same brushing back dark ringlets that hung to her shoulders you might have thought him a countryman out with his girl except that he had belted on his sword and sometimes he ran his hand down the long hilt and except for taim right at his other shoulder and the wise ones following almost as close behind and the rings of maidens and siswaiвђaman cairhienin and mayeners that completed the procession what a relief that he would not have to ride down into that shambles after all but he needed to warn rand about all the tangled enmities he had seen this morning what would he do if rand did not listen rand had changed since leaving the two rivers most of all since being kidnapped by coiren and that lot no he hadto be sane when rand and min entered the wagon circle most of the procession remained outside though they hardly came alone but with quite an assembly in its own right taim shadowed rand of course dark and slightly hooknosed and what perrin supposed most women would consider goodlooking a number of the maidens had certainly given him second looks and third they were forward about that sort of thing as taim stepped inside he glanced to gedwyn who shook his head just a hair a grimace flashed across taimвђs face gone as soon as it appeared nandera and sulin were right at randвђs heels equally of course and perrin wondered they did not bring twenty more maidens they hardly seemed to let rand bathe without maidens guarding the tub that perrin could see he did not understand why rand put up with it each had her shoufadraped around her shoulders baring short hair cut with a tail at the back nandera was a sinewy woman hair more gray than yellow but her tough features managed to be handsome if not beautiful sulin вђ wiry scarred leathery and whitehaired вђ made nandera look pretty and almost soft they glanced at the ashaвђman too without exactly seeming to then scanned both groups of aes sedai just as circumspectly nanderaвђs fingers flashed maiden handtalk not for the first time perrin wished he could understand it but a maiden would give up the spear to marry a toad before teaching their handtalk to a man a maiden perrin had not noticed sitting on her heels against a wagon a few paces from gedwyn answered the same way and so did another who until that moment had been playing at catвђs cradle with a spearsister near the prisoners amys brought the wise ones in and took them aside to confer with sorilea and a few of the others who had stayed inside the wagons despite a face too young for her waistlong white hair amys was an important woman second among the wise ones to sorilea they used no one power tricks to shield their talk but seven or eight maidens immediately encircled them and began singing softly to themselves some sat some stood some squatted on their heels each by herself and all happenstance if you were a fool it seemed to perrin that he sighed a great deal since he became mixed up with aes sedai and wise ones maidens too women in general just seemed to give him fits of late dobraine and havien leading their horses and minus their soldiers brought up the rear havien had finally seen a battle perrin wondered whether he would be so eager to see the next about the same age as perrin he did not look as young today as the day before yesterday dobraine with the front of his long mostly gray hair shaved in the style of cairhienin soldiers definitely was not young and yesterday definitely had not been his first battle yet the truth was he looked older too and worried so did havien their eyes sought out perrin another time he would have waited to see what they wanted to talk about but now he slipped from his saddle tossed stepperвђs reins to aram and went to rand others were there ahead of him only sulin and nandera held their silence kiruna and bera had moved the moment rand stepped inside the wagons and as perrin approached kiruna was saying grandly to rand you refused healing yesterday but anyone can see you are still in pain even if alanna was not ready to leap out of her вђ she cut off as bera touched her arm but she picked up again almost without pause perhaps you are ready to be healed now that had the sound of perhaps you have come to your fool senses the matter of the aes sedai must be settled without any more delay carвђaвђcarn amys said formally right atop kiruna they should be given into our care rand alвђthor sorilea added at the same time that taim spoke the aes sedai problem does need to be settled my lord dragon my ashaвђman know how to handle them they could be held at the black tower easily dark slightly tilted eyes flickered toward kiruna and bera and perrin realized with a shock that taim meant allthe aes sedai not just those who were prisoners now for that matter though amys and sorilea frowned at taim the looks they directed at the two aes sedai meant the same kiruna smiled at taim at the wise ones a thin smile to fit her lips it was maybe a fraction harder when directed at the man in the black coat but she seemed not to realize his intent yet it was enough that he was who he was what he was under the circumstances she said coolly i am certain that coiren sedai and the others will give me their parole you have no more need to worry вђ the others spoke all at once these women have no honor amys said contemptuously and this time it was clear she included all of them how could their parole mean anything they вђ they are daвђtsang sorilea said in a grim voice as though pronouncing sentence and bera frowned at her perrin thought that was something in the old tongue вђ again the word seemed almost something he should recognize вђ but he did not know why it should make the aes sedai scowl or why sulin should suddenly nod agreement with the wise one who went on like a boulder rumbling downhill they deserve no better than any other вђ my lord dragon taim said as if belaboring the obvious surely you want the aes sedai all of them in charge of those you trust those you know can deal with them and who better вђ enough rand shouted they fell silent as one but their reactions were very different taimвђs features went blank though he smelled of fury amys and sorilea exchanged glances and adjusted their shawls in near unison their scents were identical too and matched their faces in pure determination they wanted what they wanted and intended to have it carвђaвђcarnor no looks passed between kiruna and bera as well speaking such volumes that perrin wished he could read them the way his nose read scent his eyes saw two serene aes sedai in command of themselves and anything else they wished to be in command of his nose smelled two women who were anxious and more than a little afraid of taim he was sure they still seemed to think they could deal with rand one way or another and with the wise ones but taim and the ashaвђmanput the fear of the light into them min tugged at randвђs shirtsleeve вђ she had been studying everybody at once and the scent of her was almost as worried as the sisters he patted her hand while glaring hard at everyone else including perrin when he opened his mouth everybody in the camp was watching from the two rivers men to the aes sedai prisoners though only a few aiel stood close enough to hear anything people might watch rand but they tended to stay clear of him too if they could the wise ones will take charge of the prisoners rand said at last and sorilea suddenly smelled so satisfied that perrin knuckled his nose vigorously taim shook his head in exasperation but rand rounded on him before he could speak he had tucked a thumb behind the buckle of his sword belt a dragon etched and gilded and his knuckles were white from gripping it his other hand worked on the dark boarhide of his sword hilt the ashaвђman are supposed to train вђ and recruit вђ not stand guard especially on aes sedai perrinвђs hackles stirred as he realized what aroma wafted from rand when he looked at taim hatred touched with fear light he had to be sane taim gave a short reluctant nod as you command my lord dragon min glanced uneasily at the blackcoated man and moved closer to rand kiruna smelled of relief but with one last glance at bera she drew herself up in stubborn certainty these aiel women are quite worthy вђ some might have done well had they come to the tower вђ but you cannot simply hand aes sedaiover to them it is unthinkable bera sedai and i will вђ rand raised a hand and her words stopped in their tracks maybe it was his stare like bluegray stone or maybe it was what showed clearly through his torn sleeve one of the redandgold dragons that wound around his forearms the dragon glittered in the sunlight did you swear fealty to me kirunaвђs eyes popped as though something had struck her in the pit of her stomach after a moment she nodded however unwillingly she looked as disbelieving now as she had the day before when she knelt down there by the wells at battleвђs end and swore beneath the light and by her hope of salvation and rebirth to obey the dragon reborn and serve him until the last battle had come and gone perrin understood her shock even without the three oaths had she denied it he would have doubted his own memories nine aes sedai on their knees faces aghast at the words coming out of their mouths reeking of disbelief right now beraвђs mouth was puckered up as though she had bitten a bad plum an aielman joined the small group a tall man about the same height as rand with a weathered face and touches of gray in his dark red hair who nodded to perrin and touched amysвђ hand lightly she might have pressed his hand for a moment in return rhuarc was her husband but that was about as much affection as aiel displayed in front of others he was also clan chief of the taardad aiel вђ he and gaul were the only two men who did not wear the siswaiвђamanheadband вђ and since last night he and a thousand spears had been out scouting in force a blind man in another country could have sensed the temper around rand and rhuarc was no fool is this the right moment rand alвђthor when rand motioned him to speak he went on the shaido dogs are still fleeing east as fast as they can run i saw men with green coats on horses to the north but they avoided us and you said to let them go unless they gave trouble i think they were hunting any aes sedai who escaped there were several women with them cold blue eyes glanced at the two aes sedai anvil flat and anvil hard once rhuarc had walked lightly around aes sedai вђ any aiel had вђ but that had ended yesterday if not before good news iвђd give almost anything to have galina but still good news rand touched the hilt of his sword again eased the blade in its dark scabbard the action seemed unconscious galina a red had been in charge of the sisters who held him prisoner and if he was calm about her today yesterday he had been in a fury that she had gotten away even now his calm was icy the sort that could hide smoldering rage and his scent made perrinвђs skin crawl they are going to pay every one of them there was nothing to say whether rand meant the shaido or the aes sedai who had escaped or both bera moved her head uneasily and he turned his attention back to her and kiruna you swore fealty and i trust that he held up his hand thumb and forefinger nearly touching to show how far aes sedai always know better than anybody else or so they think so i trust you to do what i say but you wonвђt so much as take a bath without my permission or a wise oneвђs this time it was bera who looked as though she had been struck her light brown eyes swiveled to amys and sorilea with astonished indignation and kiruna quivered with the effort of not doing the same the two wise ones merely shifted their shawls but once again their aromas were identical contentment rolled off of them in waves a very grim contentment perrin thought it a good thing the aes sedai did not have his nose or they would have been ready to go to war right then and there or maybe run and dignity be hanged that was what he would have done rhuarc stood there idly examining the point of one of his short spears this was wise onesвђ business and he always said he did not care what the wise ones did so long as they kept their fingers out of clan chiefsвђ business but taim he made a show of not caring folding his arms and looking around the camp with a bored expression yet his scent was strange complex perrin would have said the man was amused definitely in a better humor than before the oath we took bera said at last planting her hands on her ample hips is sufficient to hold anyone but a darkfriend the twist she gave to oath was almost as bleak as the one she gave darkfriend no they did not like what they had sworn to do you dare to accuse us вђ if i thought that rand snapped you would be on your way to the black tower with taim you swore to obey well obey for a long moment bera hesitated then in an instant was as regal from head to toe as any aes sedai could be which was saying something an aes sedai could make a queen on her throne look a slattern she curtsied slightly stiffly inclining her head a fraction kiruna on the other hand made a visible effort to take hold of herself the calm she assumed hard and brittle as her voice must we then request permissionof these worthyaiel women to ask whether you are willing to be healed yet i know galina treated you harshly i know you are welts from shoulders to knees accept healing please even please sounded part of an order min stirred at randвђs side you should be grateful for it as i was sheepherder you donвђt like hurting somebody has to do it or else she grinned mischievously very nearly the min perrin remembered from before she was kidnapped or else you wonвђt be able to sit a saddle young men and fools nandera said suddenly to no one in particular sometimes bear pain they do not have to as a badge of their pride and their foolishness the carвђaвђcarn sulin added dryly also to the air is not a fool i think rand smiled back at min fondly and gave nandera and sulin wry looks but when he raised his eyes to kiruna again they were stone once more very well as she started forward he added but not from you her face grew so stiff it appeared ready to crack taimвђs mouth quirked in a wry almostsmile and he stepped toward rand but without taking his eyes from kiruna rand flung out a hand behind him from her come here alanna perrin gave a start rand had pointed straight to alanna with never so much as a glance that prickled something in the back of his head but he could not make out what it seemed to catch taim as well the manвђs face became a bland mask yet dark eyes flickered between rand and alanna and the only name perrin could put to the scent that writhed in his nose was puzzled alanna gave a start too for whatever reason she had been on edge ever since joining perrin on his way here her serenity at best a thin veneer now she smoothed her skirts shot a defiant stare at kiruna and bera of all people and glided around in front of rand the other two sisters watched her like teachers intending to make sure a pupil performed well and still not convinced she would which made no sense one of them might be the leader yet alanna wasaes sedai the same as they it all deepened perrinвђs suspicion mixing with aes sedai was too much like wading the streams in the waterwood near to the mire however peaceful the surface currents beneath could snatch you off your feet more undercurrents seemed to appear here every moment and not all from the sisters shockingly rand cupped alannaвђs chin turning her face up there was a hiss of indrawn breath from bera and for once perrin agreed rand would not have been so forward with a girl at a dance back home and alanna was no girl at a dance just as surprising her reaction was to blush and smell of uncertainty aes sedai did not blush in perrinвђs experience and they were never uncertain heal me rand said a command not a request the red in alannaвђs face deepened and anger touched her scent her hands trembled as she reached up to take his head between them unconsciously perrin rubbed the palm of his hand the one a shaido spear had laid open yesterday kiruna had healed several gashes in him and he had had healing before too it felt like being plunged headfirst into a freezing pond it left you gasping and shaking and weakkneed hungry too usually the only sign rand gave that anything had been done though was a slight shiver how do you stand the pain alanna whispered at him itвђs done then he said removing her hands and turned from her without a word of thanks seeming on the point of speaking he paused halfturning to look back toward dumaiвђs wells they have all been found rand alвђthor amys said gently he nodded then again more briskly itвђs time to be gone sorilea will you name wise ones to take over the prisoners from the ashaвђman and also as companions for kiruna and my other liegewomen for an instant he grinned i wouldnвђt want them to err through ignorance it shall be done as you say carвђaвђcarn adjusting her shawl firmly the leatherfaced wise one addressed the three sisters join your friends until i can find someone to hold your hands it was not unexpected that bera would frown indignantly or kiruna become frost personified alanna gazed at the ground resigned almost sullen sorilea was having none of it clapping hands sharply she made brisk shooing motions well move move reluctantly the aes sedai let themselves be herded making it seem they simply were going where they wished joining sorilea amys whispered something that perrin did not quite catch the three aes sedai apparently did though they stopped dead three verystartled faces looking back at the wise ones sorilea just clapped her hands again louder than before and shooed even more briskly scratching his beard perrin met rhuarcвђs eyes the clan chief smiled faintly and shrugged wise onesвђ business that was all very well for him aiel were fatalistic as wolves perrin glanced at gedwyn the fellow was watching sorilea lecture the aes sedai no it was the sisters he watched a fox staring at hens in a coop just out of his reach the wise ones have to be better than the ashaвђman perrin thought they have to be if rand noticed the byplay he ignored it taim you take the ashaвђman back to the black tower as soon as the wise ones have charge of the prisoners as soon as remember to keep an eye out for any man who learns too fast and remember what i said about recruiting i can hardly forget my lord dragon the blackcoated man replied dryly i will handle that trip personally but if i may bring it up again you need a proper honor guard we have been over that rand said curtly i have better uses for the ashaвђman if i need an honor guard those i amkeeping will do perrin will you вђ my lord dragon taim broke in you need more than a few ashaвђman around you randвђs head turned toward taim his face matched any aes sedai for giving nothing away but his scent made perrinвђs ears try to lie back razorsharp rage abruptly vanished in curiosity and caution the one thin and probing the other foglike then slashing murderous fury consumed both rand shook his head just slightly and his smell became stony determination nobodyвђs scent changed that fast nobodyвђs taim had only his eyes to go by of course and all they could tell him was that rand had shaken his head if just barely think you have chosen four dedicated and four soldiers you should have ashaвђman perrin did not understand that he thought they were allashaвђman you think i canвђt teach them as well as you randвђs voice was soft the whisper of a blade sliding in its sheath i think the lord dragon is too busy for teaching taim replied smoothly yet the anger smell rose again too important take men who need the least of it i can choose the furthest along вђ one rand cut in and i will choose taim smiled spreading his hands in acquiescence but the scent of frustration nearly overwhelmed anger again rand pointed without looking him this time he seemed surprised to find he was pointing directly at a man in his middle years sitting atop an upturned cask on the other side of the wagon circle paying no attention to the gathering around rand instead elbow on his knee and chin propped on his hand he was frowning at the aes sedai prisoners the sword and dragon glittered on the high collar of his black coat what is his name taim dashiva taim said slowly studying rand he smelled even more surprised than rand did and irritated too corlan dashiva from a farm in the black hills he will do rand said but he did not sound sure himself dashiva is gaining his strength rapidly but his head is in the clouds often as not even when it isnвђt he is not always entirely there maybe heвђs just a daydreamer and maybe the taint on saidinis touching his brain already better for you to chose torval or rochaid or вђ taimвђs opposition seemed to sweep away randвђs uncertainty i said dashiva will do tell him heвђs to come with me then turn the prisoners over to the wise ones and go i donвђt intend to stand here all day arguing perrin ready everyone to move find me when they are without another word he strode off min clinging to his arm and nandera and sulin like shadows taimвђs dark eyes glittered then he was stalking away himself shouting for gedwyn and rochaid torval and kisman blackcoated men came running perrin grimaced with everything he had to tell rand he had not opened his mouth once at that maybe it would come better away from the aes sedai and the wise ones and taim really there was not much for him to do he was supposed to be in charge since he had brought the rescue but rhuarc knew what needed doing better than he ever would and a word to dobraine and havien was sufficient for the cairhienin and mayeners they still wanted to say something though they held back until they were alone and perrin asked what it was then havien burst out lord perrin itвђs the lord dragon all that searching through the corpses вђ it seemed a little excessive dobraine interrupted smoothly we worry for him as you can understand a great deal depends on him he might look a soldier and he was but he was a cairhienin lord too and steeped in the game of houses with all its careful talk like any other cairhienin perrin was not steeped in the game of houses heвђs still sane he said bluntly dobraine simply nodded as if to say of course shrugged to say he had never intended to question but havien went bright red watching them go to their men perrin shook his head he hoped he was not lying gathering the two rivers men he told them to saddle their horses and ignored all the bowing most of which looked spurofthemoment even faile said that sometimes two rivers people carried bowing too far she said they were still working out how to behave with a lord he thought about shouting i am not a lord at them but he had done that before and it never worked when all the others rushed for their animals dannil lewin and ban alвђseen remained behind cousins both were beanpoles and they looked much alike except that dannil affected mustaches like downturned horns in the taraboner style while ban wore narrow lines of dark hair in the fashion of arad doman under a nose like a pickaxe refugees had brought a lot of new things into the two rivers those ashaвђman coming with us dannil asked when perrin shook his head he exhaled so hard in relief that his thick mustaches stirred what about the aes sedai ban said anxiously theyвђll go free now wonвђt they i mean rand is free the lord dragon that is they canвђt stay prisoners not aes sedai you two just have everybody ready to ride perrin said leave worrying about aes sedai to rand the pair even winced alike two fingers rose to scratch worriedly at mustaches and perrin jerked his hand away from his chin a man looked as if he had fleas when he did that the camp was abustle in no time everyone had been expecting to move soon yet everyone had things left undone the captive aes sedaiвђs servants and wagon drivers hurriedly loaded the last items into the wagons and began hitching teams with a jingle of harness cairhienin and mayeners seemed to be everywhere checking saddles and bridles unclothed gaiвђshainwent running every which way though there did not seem to be much for the aiel to ready flashes of light outside the wagons announced the departure of taim and the ashaвђman that made perrin feel better of the nine who remained another besides dashiva was in his middle years a stocky fellow with a farmerвђs face and one with a limp and a fringe of white hair might easily have been a grandfather the rest were younger some little more than boys yet they watched all the hubbub with the selfpossession of men who had seen as much a dozen times they did keep to themselves though and together except for dashiva who stood a few paces apart staring at nothing remembering taimвђs caution about the fellow perrin hoped he was daydreaming he found rand seated on a wooden crate with his elbows on his knees sulin and nandera squatted easily to either side of rand both studiously avoiding looking at the sword at his hip holding their spears and bullhide bucklers casually here in the midst of people loyal to rand they kept a watch on anything that moved near him min sat on the ground at his feet with her legs tucked under smiling up at him i hope you know what youвђre doing rand perrin said shifting the axe haft so he could drop to his heels no one was close enough to hear except for rand and min and the two maidens if sulin or nandera went running to the wise ones so be it without more preamble he launched into what he had seen so far this morning what he had smelled too though he did not say that rand was not among the few who knew about him and wolves he made it all seem what he had seen and heard the ashaвђman and the wise ones the ashaвђman and the aes sedai the wise ones and the aes sedai the whole tangle of tinder that might burst into flame any moment he did not spare the two rivers men theyвђre worried rand and if they are sweating you can be sure some cairhienin is thinking about doing something or a tairen maybe just helping the prisoners escape maybe something worse light i could see dannil and ban and fifty more besides helping them get away if they knew how you think something else would be that much worse rand said quietly and perrinвђs skin prickled he met randвђs gaze directly a thousand times he said in just as quiet a voice i wonвђt be part of murder if you will be iвђll stand in your way a silence stretched unblinking bluegray eyes meeting unblinking golden frowning at each of them in turn min made an exasperated sound in her throat you two woolheads rand you know youвђll never give an order like that or let anyone else give it either perrin you know he wonвђt now the pair of you stop acting like two strange roosters in a pen sulin chuckled but perrin wanted to ask min how certain she was although that was not a question he could voice here rand scrubbed his fingers through his hair then shook his head for all the world like a man disagreeing with somebody who was not there the sort of voice that madmen heard itвђs never easy is it rand said after a time looking sad the bitter truth is i canвђt say which would be worse i donвђt have any good choices they saw to that themselves his face was despondent but rage boiled in his scent alive or dead theyвђre a millstone on my back and either way they could break it perrin followed his gaze to the aes sedai prisoners they were on their feet now and all together though even so they managed to put a little distance between the three who had been stilled and the rest the wise ones around them were being curt with their orders by the gestures they made and the tight faces on the sisters maybe the wise ones were better than rand keeping them too if only he could be sure did you see anything min rand said perrin gave a start and directed a warning glance at sulin and nandera but min laughed softly leaning against randвђs knee she really did look the min he knew for the first time since finding her at the wells perrin they know about me the wise ones the maidens maybe all of them and they donвђt care she had a talent she kept hidden much as he did the wolves sometimes she saw images and auras around people and sometimes she knew what they meant you canвђt know what thatвђs like perrin i was twelve when it started and i didnвђt know to make a secret of it everybody thought i was just making things up until i said a man on the next street was going to marry a woman i saw him with only he was already married when he ran off with her his wife brought a mob to my auntsвђ house claiming i was responsible that iвђd used the one power on her husband or given the two of them some kind of potion min shook her head she wasnвђt too clear she just had to blame somebody there was talk of me being a darkfriend too there had been some whitecloaks in town earlier trying to stir people up anyway aunt rana convinced me to say i had just overheard them talking and aunt miren promised to spank me for spreading tales and aunt jan said sheвђd dose me they didnвђt of course вђ they knew the truth вђ but if they hadnвђt been so matteroffact about it about me just being a child i could have been hurt or even killed most people donвђt like somebody knowing things about their future most people donвђt really want to know it themselves not unless itвђs good anyway even my aunts didnвђt but to the aiel i am sort of a wise one by courtesy some can do things others cannot nandera said as if that was enough explanation min laughed again and reached out to touch the maidenвђs knee thank you settling her feet beneath her she looked up at rand now that she was laughing again she seemed radiant that held even after she became serious serious and not very pleased as for your question nothing of any use taim has blood in his past and blood in his future but you could guess that heвђs a dangerous man they seem to be gathering images like aes sedai a sidelong look through lowered eyelashes at dashiva and the other ashaвђman said who she meant most people had few images around them but min said aes sedai and warders always did the problem is what i can see is all blurry i think itвђs because theyвђre holding the power that often seems true with aes sedai and itвђs worse when theyвђre actually channeling kiruna and that lot have all sorts of things around them but they stay so close together that it all well jumbles together most of the time itвђs even muddier with the prisoners never mind the prisoners rand told her thatвђs what theyвђll stay but rand i keep feeling there is something important if i could only pick it out you need to know вђif you donвђt know everything you must go on with what you do knowвђ rand quoted wryly it seems i never do know everything hardly enough most of the time but thereвђs no choice but to go on is there that was not at all a question loial strode up bubbling with energy despite his obvious weariness rand they say theyвђre ready to go but you promised to talk to me while itвђs fresh abruptly his ears twitched with embarrassment and that booming voice became plaintive i am sorry i know it canвђt be enjoyable but i must know for the book for the ages laughing rand got to his feet and tugged at the ogierвђs open coat for the ages do writers all talk like that donвђt worry loial it will still be fresh when i tell you i wonвђt forget a grim sour scent flashed from him despite the smile and was gone but back in cairhien after we all have a bath and sleep in a bed rand motioned for dashiva to come closer the man was not skinny yet he moved in a hesitant creeping way hands folded at his waist that made him seem so my lord dragon he said tilting his head can you make a gateway dashiva of course dashiva began drywashing his hands flicking at his lips with the tip of his tongue and perrin wondered whether the man was always this jittery or just when speaking to the dragon reborn that is to say the mвђhael teaches traveling as soon as a student shows himself strong enough the mвђhael rand said blinking the lord mazrim taimвђs title my lord dragon it means вђleaderвђ in the old tongue the fellowвђs smile managed to be nervous and patronizing at the same time i read a great deal on the farm every book the peddlers brought by the mвђhael rand muttered disapprovingly well be that as it may make me a gateway to near cairhien dashiva itвђs time to see what the world has been up to while i was away and what i have to do about it he laughed then in a rueful way but the sound of it made perrinвђs skin prickle chapter flame of tar valon hill of the golden dawn on a wide low hilltop some miles north and east of the city of cairhien well away from any road or human habitation a thin vertical slash of pure light appeared taller than a man on a horse the ground sloped away in every direction undulating gently nothing more than occasional brush obscured the view for more than a mile all the way to the surrounding forest brown grass fell as the light seemed to rotate widening into a square opening in midair a number of the dead stems were slit lengthwise sliced finer than any razor could have by a hole in the air the instant the gateway was fully open veiled aiel poured out men and maidens spreading in every direction to encircle the hill almost hidden in the torrent four sharpeyed ashaвђman took up positions around the gateway itself peering toward the encircling woodland nothing stirred except with the wind dust tall grass and branches in the distance yet each ashaвђman studied the vista with the fervor of a starving hawk searching for a rabbit a rabbit watching for a hawk might have been as intent but never with that air of menace there was really no break in the flow one moment it was a flood of aiel the next mounted cairhienin armsmen galloping out two by two the crimson banner of light going up at their head as soon as it cleared the gateway without a pause dobraine drew his men aside and began forming them up a little down the slope helmeted and gauntleted in precise ranks lances raised to the same angle seasoned campaigners they were ready to wheel and charge in any direction at his gesture on the heels of the last cairhienin perrin rode stepper through the dun passing in one stride from the hill below dumaiвђs wells to the hill in cairhien and ducked in spite of himself the upper edge of the thing stood well above his head but he had seen the damage a gateway could do and had no wish to test whether they were safer standing still loial and aram followed close behind вђ the ogier afoot with his longhafted axe on his shoulder bent his knees вђ and then the two rivers men crouching on their saddles well beyond the gateway rad alвђdai carried the red wolfhead banner perrinвђs because everyone said it was and tell lewin the red eagle perrin tried not to look at those especially the red eagle the two rivers men wanted things both ways he was a lord so he had to have banners he was a lord but when he told them to get rid of those bloody banners they never vanished for long the red wolfhead named him something he was not and did not want to be while the red eagle more than two thousand years after manetheren died in the trolloc wars close to a thousand after andor swallowed part of what once had been manetheren that banner was still as good as an act of rebellion for an andorman legends still walked in some menвђs minds of course it had been a few generations since two rivers folk had had any notion that they were andormen but queensвђ minds did not change so easily he had met the new queen of andor what seemed a long time ago in the stone of tear she had not been queen then вђ and was not yet really until she was crowned in caemlyn вђ but elayne seemed a pleasant young woman and pretty though he was not partial to fairhaired women a bit taken with herself of course as daughterheir taken with rand too if snuggling in corners meant anything rand meant to give her not only the lion throne of andor but the sun throne of cairhien surely she would be grateful enough to let the flying of a flag pass when it did not really mean anything watching the two rivers men deploy behind those banners perrin shook his head it was a worry for another day in any case there was nothing like armsmenвђs precision in the two rivers men most boys like tod farmersвђ sons and shepherds yet they knew what to do every fifth man took the reins of four more horses while the other riders hurriedly dismounted longbows already strung and in hand those on the ground straggled together in rough lines looking around with more interest than anything else but they checked their quivers with practiced gestures and handled their bows with familiarity the great two rivers bows even when strung nearly as tall as the men who drew them with those bows not a man of them but could shoot farther than anyone outside the two rivers would believe and hit what he aimed at perrin hoped there would be none of that today sometimes he dreamed of a world where there never was and rand do you believe my enemies have been asleep while i was away rand had said suddenly as they stood waiting for dashiva to open the gateway he had on a coat rooted out of the wagons wellcut green wool but hardly what he usually wore now short of taking the coat off a warderвђs back or acadinвђsor from an aielman it was the only garment in the camp to fit him truth you would have thought he insisted on silk and fine embroidery the way he had had those wagons searched top to bottom yesterday and this morning the wagons stretched out in line teams hitched canvas covers and iron hoops taken down kiruna and the rest of the sworn sisters sat packed into the lead wagon and not happy they had ceased their protests as soon as they saw that protesting did no good but perrin could still hear coldly angry mutters at least they rode their warders surrounded the wagon afoot silent and stony while the aes sedai prisoners stood in a rigid sullen cluster ringed by every wise one who was hot with rand which was to say all but sorilea and amys the prisonersвђ warders glowered in another clump a hundred paces off cold death waiting despite their injuries andsiswaiвђaman guards except for kirunaвђs big black its reins held by rand and a mousecolored mare with fine ankles for min the aes sedaiвђs and wardersвђ horses not assigned to ashaвђman вђ or used to fill out wagon teamsthathad caused a commotion worse than making their owners walk вђ were all tied to long lead lines fastened to the wagonsвђ tailgates do you believe it flinn grady one of the ashaвђman waiting to go through first the stocky fellow with a farmerвђs face looked at rand uncertainly then at the leathery old man with the limp each wore a silversword pin on his collar but not the dragon only a fool thinks his enemies stand still when he isnвђt looking my lord dragon the old man said in a gruff voice he sounded like a soldier what about you dashiva dashiva gave a start surprised to be addressed i grew up on a farm he tugged his sword belt straight which it did not need supposedly they trained with the swords as much as with the power but dashiva did not seem to know one end from the other i donвђt know much about having enemies despite his awkwardness there was a kind of insolence to him but then the whole lot seemed weaned on arrogance if you stay near me rand said softly you will his smile made perrin shiver he smiled while he gave orders to go through the gateway as though they would be attacked on the other side there were enemies everywhere he told them always remember that there were enemies everywhere and you never knew who the exodus continued unabated wagons rumbled from dumaiвђs wells to cairhien the sisters in the first like statues of ice being lurched about their warders trotted alongside hands gripping sword hilts and eyes never resting on one spot clearly they thought their aes sedai needed protection as much from those already on the hill as from anyone who might appear the wise ones marched through herding their charges a number used sticks to prod the aes sedai along though the sisters made a good job pretending there were neither wise ones nor prods the shaido gaiвђshaincame trotting in a column four wide under the gaze of a single maiden she pointed to a place out of the way before darting to join the other far dareis mai and the gaiвђshainknelt there in lines naked as jaybirds and proud as eagles the remaining warders followed under their guard radiating a massed fury that perrin could smell over everything else then rhuarc with the rest of the siswaiвђamanand maidens and four more ashaвђman each leading a second horse for one of the first four and nurelle and his winged guards with their redstreamered lances the mayeners were puffed up over being the rear guard laughing and shouting boasts to the cairhienin of what they would have done had the shaido returned though in fact they were not last last of all came rand on kirunaвђs gelding and min on her mare sorilea and amys strode along to one side of the tall black horse nandera and half a dozen maidens to the other and dashiva led a placidlooking bay mare at their heels the gateway winked out and dashiva blinked at where it had been smiling faintly then scrambled clumsily into the mareвђs saddle he seemed to be talking to himself but it was probably because his sword tangled in his legs and he nearly fell surely he was not mad already an army covered the hill all arrayed for an attack that plainly was not coming a small army only a few thousand though it would have seemed fairsized before the aiel brought their numbers across the dragonwall guiding his horse slowly toward perrin rand scanned the countryside the two wise ones followed closely talking softly and watching him nandera and the maidens followed watching everything else had rand been a wolf perrin would have said he was testing the air he carried the dragon scepter across his high saddlebow a twofoot length of spearhead decorated with a greenandwhite tassel and carved with dragons and now and then he weighed it lightly in his hand as if to remind himself of it when rand reined in he studied perrin as intently as he had the surrounding country i trust you he said finally nodding min stirred in her saddle and he added and you min of course and you too loial the ogier shifted uncertainly with a hesitant glance for perrin rand looked around the hillside at the aiel and the ashaвђman and all the rest so few i can trust he whispered tiredly his scent was jumbled enough for two men anger and fear determination and despair and woven through it all weariness be sane perrin wanted to tell him hold on a wash of guilt held his tongue though because it was the dragon reborn he wanted to say it to not his friend since childhood he wanted his friend to stay sane the dragon reborn hadto stay sane my lord dragon one of the ashaвђman called abruptly he looked little more than a boy with dark eyes as big as any girlвђs and neither sword nor dragon on his collar but pride in his bearing narishma perrin had heard him called to the southwest a figure had appeared running out from the trees a mile or more away a woman with skirts hiked to her thighs to perrinвђs eyes she was clearly aiel a wise one he thought though there was no real way to tell at sight he was just certain the sight of her brought back all his edginess somebody out here just where they happened to come out of the gateway could not be good news the shaido had been troubling cairhien again when he set off after rand but to the aiel a wise one was a wise one whatever her clan they visited like neighbors over for tea while their clans killed one another two aiel trying to kill each other would step back to let a wise one pass between maybe yesterday had changed that and maybe not he exhaled wearily at best she could not be good news nearly everyone on the hill seemed to feel the same ripples of motion ran everywhere spears hefted arrows nocked cairhienin and mayeners shifted in their saddles and aram drew his sword eyes shining with anticipation loial leaned on his tall axe and fingered the edge regretfully the head was shaped like that of a huge woodaxe but engraved with leaves and scrolls and inlaid with gold the inlay was a trifle scuffed from the axeвђs late use if he had to use it again he would but with as much reluctance as perrin used his and for many of the same reasons rand simply sat his horse and watched face unreadable min edged her mare close enough to stroke his shoulder like someone trying to soothe a mastiff with its hackles up the wise ones also gave no sign of disturbance but neither did they stay still sorilea gestured and a dozen of the women guarding the aes sedai broke off to join her and amys well away from rand and out of even perrinвђs hearing few had any gray in their hair and sorileaвђs was the only lined face but then there was hardly a gray hair to be seen on any of the wise ones here the fact was not many aiel lived to have much gray hair these women had position though or influence however wise ones decided such things perrin had seen sorilea and amys confer with the same lot before though confer was not quite the word sorilea spoke with an occasional word from amys and the others listened edarra raised a protest but sorilea smothered it apparently without breaking stride then pointed out two of their number sotarin and cosain immediately they gathered their skirts over their arms and sped off toward the newcomer legs flashing perrin patted stepperвђs neck no more killing not yet the three wise ones met nearly half a mile from the hill and stopped they spoke just for a moment and then all came on at a run back to the hill and straight to sorilea the newcomer a youngish longnosed woman with a mass of incredibly red hair spoke hurriedly sorileaвђs face grew stonier by the word finally the redhaired woman finished вђ or rather sorilea cut her short with a few words вђ and the lot turned to face rand none made a move toward him though they waited hands folded at their waists and shawls looped over their arms inscrutable as any aes sedai the carвђaвђcarn rand muttered dryly under his breath swinging a leg over he slid from his saddle then helped min to the ground perrin climbed down too and led stepper after them to the wise ones loial trailed along and aram followed on his horse not dismounting until perrin motioned him to aiel did not ride not unless it was absolutely necessary anyway and they considered it rude for anyone to face them from horseback rhuarc joined them and gaul who wore a scowl for some reason it went without saying that nandera and sulin and the maidens came too the redhaired newcomer began as soon as rand drew near bair and megana set watches every way you might possibly come back to the treekillersвђ city carвђaвђcarn but in truth no one thought this would be вђ feraighin sorilea said sharply enough to draw blood the redhaired womanвђs teeth clicked as she snapped her mouth shut and she stared fixedly at rand with brilliant blue eyes avoiding sorileaвђs glare finally sorilea took a breath and turned her attention to rand there is trouble in the tents she said in a flat voice rumors began among the treekillers that you have gone to the white tower with the aes sedai who came gone to bend knee to the amyrlin seat none who know the truth dared speak or the result would have been worse and what is the result rand asked quietly he exuded tension and min began stroking his shoulder again many believe you have abandoned the aiel amys told him just as quietly the bleakness has returned every day a thousand or more throw down their spears and vanish unable to face our future or our past some may be going to the shaido for a moment disgust tinged her voice there have been whispers that the true carвђaвђcarnwould not give himself to the aes sedai indirian says if you have gone to the white tower it cannot be willingly he is ready to take the codarra north to tar valon and dance the spears with any aes sedai he finds or any wetlander he says you mast have been betrayed timolan mutters that if the tales are true you have betrayed us and he will take the miagoma back to the threefold land after he sees you dead mandelain and janwin hold their counsel but they listen to indirian and timolan both rhuarc grimaced sucking air between his teeth for an aiel that was as much as tearing his hair in despair itвђs not good news perrin protested but you make it sound a death sentence once rand shows himself the rumors are done rand scrubbed a hand through his hair if that was so sorilea wouldnвђt look like she had swallowed a lizard for that matter nandera and sulin looked as though their lizards were still alive on the way down what havenвђt you told me yet sorilea the leatherfaced woman gave him a thin approving smile you see beyond what is said good her tone stayed flat as worked stone though you return with aes sedai some will believe that means you did bend knee whatever you say or do they will believe you wear an aes sedai halter and that is before it is known you were a prisoner secrets find crevices a flea could not slip through and a secret known by so many has wings perrin eyed dobraine and nurelle watching with their men and swallowed queasily how many of those who followed rand did so because he had the weight of the aiel massed behind him not all certainly but for every man who had chosen because rand was the dragon reborn five or even ten had come because the light shone brightest on the strongest ranks if the aiel broke away or splintered he did not want to think about that possibility defending the two rivers had stretched his abilities as far as they would go maybe farther taвђverenor not he had no illusions he was one of those men who ended up in the histories that was for rand villagesized problems were his limit yet he could not help himself his mind churned what to do if the worst came lists ran up in his head who would remain loyal and who might try to slip away the first list was sufficiently short and the second sufficiently long to dry his throat too many people still schemed for advantage as if they had never heard of the prophecies of the dragon or the last battle he suspected some still would the day after tarmon gaiвђdon began the worst of it was most would not be darkfriends just people looking out for their own interests first loialвђs ears hung limp he saw it too no sooner did sorilea finish speaking to rand than her eyes whipped to one side in a glare to bore holes in iron you were told to remain in the wagon bera and kiruna came to an abrupt halt and alanna nearly stumbled into them you were told not to touch the one power without permission but you listened to what was said here you will learn that i mean what i say despite sorileaвђs auguring stare the three held their ground bera and kiruna with icy dignity alanna with smoldering defiance loialвђs huge eyes rolled toward them then toward the wise one if his ears had been limp before now they wilted completely and his long eyebrows dropped to his cheeks poring uneasily over his mental lists perrin wondered absently how far the aes sedai intended to push eavesdropping with the power they might find a reaction from the wise ones worse than sorileaвђs bark from rand too not this time however rand seemed unaware of them he looked right through sorilea or maybe listened to something nobody else could hear again what of the wetlanders he said finally colavaere has been crowned queen hasnвђt she it was not really a question sorilea nodded thumb tapping the hilt of her belt knife but her attention never left the aes sedai who was chosen king or queen among the wetlanders was of small concern to aiel especially among the treekilling cairhienin an icicle stabbed into perrinвђs chest that colavaere of house saighan wanted the sun throne was no secret she had schemed for it from the day galldrian riatin was assassinated before rand had even declared himself the dragon reborn and kept scheming after it became public knowledge that rand meant the throne for elayne few knew she was a coldblooded murderer however and faile was in the city at least she was not alone bain and chiad would be close to her they were maidens and her friends maybe almost what the aiel called nearsisters they would not let her be harmed the icicle would not go away though colavaere hated rand and by extension anyone close to rand such as perhaps the wife of a man who was randвђs friend no bain and chiad would keep her safe this is a delicate situation moving closer to rand remarkably kiruna ignored sorilea for such a scrawny woman the wise one had eyes like hammers whatever you do can have serious repercussions i вђ what has colavaere said about me rand asked sorilea in a toocasual tone has she harmed berelain berelain the first of mayene was who rand had left in charge of cairhien why did he not ask about faile berelain sur paendrag is well sorilea murmured without stopping her study of the aes sedai outwardly kiruna stayed calm despite being interrupted and ignored but the gaze she fixed on rand could have frozen a forgefire solid with the bellows pumping for the rest sorilea gestured to feraighin the redhaired woman gave a start and cleared her throat plainly she had not expected to be allowed a word she put dignity back on like a hastily donned garment colavaere saighan says you have gone to caemlyn carвђaвђcarn or maybe to tear but wherever you have gone all must remember that you are the dragon reborn and must be obeyed feraighin sniffed the dragon reborn was no part of aiel prophecies only the carвђaвђcarn she says you will return and confirm her on the throne she speaks often to the chiefs encouraging them to move the spears south in obedience to you she says she does not see the wise ones and hears only the wind when we speak this time her sniff was a fair approximation of sorileaвђs no one told the clan chiefs what to do but angering the wise ones was a bad way to start convincing the chiefs of anything it made sense to perrin though to the part of him that could think of anything besides faile colavaere probably had never paid enough attention to the savages to realize the wise ones did more than dispense herbs but she would want every last aiel out of cairhien the question was given the circumstances had any of the chiefs listened to her but the question rand asked was not the obvious what else has happened in the city anything youвђve heard feraighin maybe something that might only seem important to a wetlander she tossed her red mane contemptuously wetlanders are like sandflies carвђaвђcarn who can know what they find important strange things sometimes happen in the city so i have heard as they do among the tents people sometimes see things that cannot be only for a time what cannot be is men women children have died perrinвђs skin prickled he knew she meant what rand called bubbles of evil rising from the dark oneвђs prison like froth in a fetid swamp drifting along the pattern till they burst perrin had been caught in one once he never wanted to see another if you mean what the wetlanders do she went on who has time to watch sandflies unless they bite that minds me of one thing i do not understand it but perhaps you do these sandflies will bite sooner or later what sandflies wetlanders what are you talking about feraighin was not as good as sorilea at that level look yet no wise one that perrin had seen appreciated othersвђ impatience not even the chief of chiefsвђ thrusting her chin up she gathered her shawl and answered three days ago the treekillers caraline damodred and toram riatin approached the city they issued a proclamation that colavaere saighan is a usurper but they sit in their camp south of the city and do nothing except send a few people into the city now and then away from their camp a hundred of them will run from one algaiвђdвђsiswai or even a gaiвђshain the man called darlin sisnera and other tairens arrived by ship below the city yesterday and joined them they have been feasting and drinking ever since as if celebrating something treekiller soldiers gather in the city at colavaere saighanвђs command yet they watch our tents more than they do the other wetlandersвђ or the city itself they watch and do nothing perhaps you know the why of all this carвђaвђcarn but i do not nor does bair or megana or anyone else in the tents lady caraline and lord toram led the cairhienin who refused to accept that rand and the aiel had conquered cairhien just as high lord darlin led their counterparts in tear neither revolt amounted to much caraline and toram had been sitting in the foothills of the spine of the world for months making threats and claims and darlin the same down in haddon mirk but not any longer it seemed perrin found himself running a thumb lightly along the edge of his axe the aiel were in danger of slipping away and randвђs enemies were coming together in one place all it needed now was for the forsaken to appear and sevanna with her shaido that would put the cream on the honeycake yet none of it was any more important than whether somebody saw a nightmare walking faile had to be safe she just had to be better watching than fighting rand murmured thoughtfully listening to something unseen again perrin agreed with rand wholeheartedly вђ just about anything was better than fighting вђ but aiel did not see it that way not when it came to enemies from rhuarc to sorilea feraighin to nandera and sulin they stared as though rand had said sand was better to drink than water feraighin drew herself up practically on tiptoe she was not particularly tall for an aiel woman not quite to randвђs shoulder but she appeared to be trying to put herself nosetonose there are few more than ten thousand in that wetlander camp she said reprovingly and fewer in the city they can be dealt with easily even indirian remembers that you commanded no wetlander killed except in selfdefense but they will make trouble left to themselves it does not help that there are aes sedai in the city who can know what they вђ aes sedai the words came out cold randвђs knuckles white on the dragon scepter how many at the smell of him the skin between perrinвђs shoulders crawled suddenly he could feelthe aes sedai prisoners watching and bera and kiruna and the rest sorilea lost all interest in kiruna her hands planted themselves on her hips and her mouth narrowed why did you not tell me this you gave me no chance sorilea feraighin protested a touch breathily shoulders hunching blue eyes swung to rand and her voice firmed there may be as many as ten or more carвђaвђcarn we avoid them of course especially since back to sorilea and breathiness you did not want to hear about the wetlanders sorilea only our own tents you said so to rand her back straightening most of them stay beneath the roof of arilyn dhulaine carвђaвђcarn and seldom leave it to sorilea hunching sorilea you know i would have told you everything you cut me short as she realized how many were watching and how many beginning to smile among the wise ones anyway feraighinвђs eyes grew wild and her cheeks reddened her head swung between rand and sorilea and her mouth worked but no sound came out some of the wise ones began laughing behind their hands edarra did not bother with a hand rhuarc threw back his head and roared perrin certainly did not feel like laughing an aiel could find something funny in having a sword stuck through him aes sedai on top of everything else light he cut straight through to what was important feraighin my wife faile is she well she gave him a halfdistracted stare then visibly pulled together the tatters of her poise i think faile aybara is well seiвђcair she said with cool composure or almost she tried to sneak glances at sorilea from the corner of her eye sorilea was not amused or anything close to it arms folded she gave feraighin a perusal that made the one she had given kiruna seem mild amys put a hand on sorileaвђs arm she is not at fault the younger woman murmured too softly to reach any ears but the leathery wise oneвђs and perrinвђs sorilea hesitated then nodded the flaying glare faded to her usual cantankerousness amys was the only one perrin had seen able to do that the only one sorilea did not trample down when she got in her way well she did not trample rhuarc but with him it was more a boulder ignoring a thunderstorm amys could make it stop raining perrin wanted more of feraighin вђ she thoughtfaile was well вђ but before he could open his mouth kiruna bulled in with her usual tact now listen to me carefully she told rand gesturing emphatically under his nose i called the situation delicate it is not the situation is complex beyond your imagining so fragile a breath could shatter it bera and i will accompany you to the city yes yes alanna and you as well she waved away the slender aes sedai impatiently perrin thought she was trying that looming trick she did seem to be peering down her nose at rand though tall as she was he stood head and shoulders taller you must let yourself be guided by us one wrong move one wrong word and you may deliver to cairhien the same disaster you gave tarabon and arad doman worse you can do incalculable damage to matters about which you know almost nothing perrin winced the whole speech could not have been better designed to inflame rand but rand simply listened till she was done then turned to sorilea take the aes sedai to the tents all of them for now make sure everyone knows theyвђre aes sedai let it be seen that they hop when you say toad since you hop when the carвђaвђcarnsays it that should convince everybody iвђm not wearing an aes sedai leash kirunaвђs face grew bright red she smelled of outrage and indignation so strongly that perrinвђs nose itched bera tried to calm her without much success while shooting youignorantyounglout looks at rand and alanna bit her lip in an effort not to smile going by the odors drifting from sorilea and the others alanna had no reason to be pleased sorilea gave rand a slash of smile perhaps carвђaвђcarn she said dryly perrin doubted that she hopped for anyone perhaps it will she did not sound convinced with another shake of his head rand stalked off with min shadowed by the maidens and issuing orders as to who was to go with him and who with the wise ones rhuarc began ordering the siswaiвђaman alanna followed rand with her eyes perrin wished he knew what was going on there sorilea and the others watched rand too and they smelled anything but gentle feraighin was standing alone he realized now was his chance but when he tried to catch her up sorilea and amys and the rest of the council surrounded her neatly shouldering him away they moved some distance before they began showering her with questions the sharp looks directed at kiruna and the other two sisters leaving no doubt they would tolerate no further eavesdropping kiruna appeared to be considering it glowering till it seemed a wonder her dark hair was not standing on end bera was speaking to her firmly and without trying perrin heard sensible and patience cautious and foolish which applied to whom was not evident there will be fighting when we reach the city aram sounded eager of course not loial said stoutly his ears twitched and he peered uncomfortably at his axe there wonвђt be will there perrin perrin shook his head he did not know if only the other wise ones would leave feraighin alone just for a few moments what did they have to talk about that was so important women gaul muttered are stranger than drunken wetlanders what perrin said absently what would happen should he simply push through the circle of wise ones as if she had read his mind edarra gave him a pointed frown so did some of the others sometimes it did seem women could read menвђs minds well i said women are strange perrin aybara chiad told me she would not lay a bridal wreath at my feet she actually toldme the aielman sounded scandalized she said she would take me for a lover her and bain but no more another time that would have shocked perrin though he had heard it before aiel were incredibly free about such things as if i am not good enough for a husband gaul snorted angrily i do not like bain but i would marry her to make chiad happy if chiad will not make a bridal wreath she should stop trying to entice me if i cannot catch her interest well enough for her to marry me she should let me go perrin frowned at him the greeneyed aielman was taller than rand nearly a head taller than he what are you talking about chiad of course have you not been listening she avoids me but every time i see her she pauses long enough to make sure i have seen her i do not know how you wetlanders do it but with us that is one of the ways a woman uses when you least expect her she is in your eyes then gone i did not even know she was with the maidens until this morning you mean sheвђs here perrin whispered that icicle was back now a blade hollowing him out and bain here too gaul shrugged one is seldom far from the other but it is chiadвђs interest i want not bainвђs burn their bloody interest perrin shouted the wise ones turned to look at him in fact people all over the hillside did kiruna and bera were staring faces entirely too thoughtful with an effort he managed to lower his voice he could do nothing about the intensity though they were supposed to be protecting her sheвђs in the city in the royal palace with colavaere вђ with colavaere вђ and they were supposed to be protecting her scratching his head gaul looked at loial is this wetlander humor faile aybara is out of short skirts i know sheвђs not a child perrin drew a deep breath it was very hard keeping a level tone with his belly full of acid loial will you explain to this to gaul that our women donвђt run around with spears that colavaere wouldnвђt offer to fight faile sheвђd just order somebody to cut her throat or throw her off a wall or the images were too much he was going to empty his stomach in a moment loial patted him awkwardly on the shoulder perrin i know youвђre worried i know how iвђd feel if i thought anything happened to erith the tufts on his ears quivered he was a fine one to talk he would run as hard as he could to avoid his mother and the young ogier woman she had chosen for him ah well perrin faile is waiting for you safe and sound i know it and you know she can care for herself why she could care for herself and you and me and gaul as well his booming laugh sounded forced and it quickly faded to grave seriousness perrin perrin you know you canвђt always be there to protect faile however much you want to you are taвђveren the pattern spun you out for a purpose and it will use you for that purpose burn the pattern perrin growled it can all burn if it keeps her safe loialвђs ears went rigid with shock and even gaul looked taken aback what does that make meperrin thought he had been scornful of those who scribbled and scrabbled for their own ends ignoring the last battle and the dark oneвђs shadow creeping over the world how was he different from them rand reined the black in beside him are you coming iвђm coming perrin said bleakly he had no answer for his own questions but he knew one thing to him faile wasthe world chapter rising sun into cairhien perrin would have set a harder pace than rand did though he knew the horses could not have stood it long half the time they rode at a trot the other half ran alongside their animals rand seemed unaware of anyone else except that he always had a hand for min if she stumbled for the rest he was lost in some other world blinking in surprise when he noticed perrin or loial truth to tell nobody was any better dobraineвђs men and havienвђs stared straight ahead chewing their own worries over what they would find the two rivers men had soaked in perrinвђs dark mood they liked faile вђ truth be told some worshipped her вђ and if she had been hurt in any way even aramвђs eagerness grew bleak once he realized that faile might be in danger every man focused on the leagues before them toward the city ahead except for the ashaвђman anyway close behind rand like a cluster of ravens they studied the country the column crossed still wary of an ambush dashiva slumped in his saddle like a sack and muttered darkly to himself when he had to run he glared as if he hoped there was an ambush small chance of that sulin and a dozen far dareis maitrotted ahead of the column in perrinвђs sight with as many more farther ahead probing the way and an equal number on the flanks some had thrust their short spears into the harnesses that held their bow cases on their backs so the spearheads bobbed above their heads the short horn bows were out arrows nocked they kept equally sharp watch for anything that might threaten the carвђaвђcarnand on rand himself as though they suspected he might vanish again if any trap waited any danger approached they would find it chiad was one of the maidens with sulin a tall woman with dark reddish hair and gray eyes perrin stared at her back willing her to drop behind the others and speak to him now and then she spared him a glance but she avoided him as if he had three diseases all catching bain was not with the column most of the maidens followed much the same route with rhuarc and the algaiвђdвђsiswai but moving more slowly because of the wagons and prisoners faileвђs black mare trotted behind stepper her reins tied to his saddle the two rivers men had brought swallow from caemlyn when they joined him before dumaiвђs wells every time he looked at the mare prancing along behind him his wifeвђs face swelled in his thoughts her bold nose and generous mouth flashing dark eyes tilted above high cheekbones she loved the animal maybe almost as much as she did him a woman as proud as she was beautiful as fiery as she was proud davram bashereвђs daughter would not hide or even hold her tongue not for the likes of colavaere four times they stopped to rest the mounts and he ground his teeth at the delay taking good care of horses was second nature to him he checked stepper absently gave the stallion a little water by rote swallow he was more careful with if swallow reached cairhien safely a notion had planted itself in his mind if he brought her mare to cairhien faile would be all right it was ludicrous a boyвђs fancy a smallboyвђs foolishfancy and it would not go away at each of those stops min tried to reassure him with a bantering grin she said he looked like death on a winter morning just waiting for somebody to shovel his grave full she told him if he approached his wife with a face like that faile would slam the door on him but she had to admit that none of her viewings promised that faile was unharmed light perrin she said at last in exasperated tones snugging her gray riding gloves if anyone tries to harm the woman sheвђll make him wait out in the hall till she has time for him he very nearly growled at her it was not that the two disliked each other exactly loial reminded perrin that hunters for the horn could take care of themselves that faile had survived trollocs unscathed she is well perrin he boomed heartily trotting beside stepper with his long axe across his shoulders i know she is but he said the same twenty times and each time he sounded a little less hearty the ogierвђs final attempt at heartening went further than loial intended i am sure faile can look after herself perrin she is not like erith i can hardly wait for erith to make me her husband so i can tend her i think iвђd die if she changed her mind at the end of that his mouth remained open and his huge eyes popped ears fluttering he stumbled over his own boots and nearly fell i never meant to say that he said hoarsely striding along beside perrinвђs horse once more his ears still trembled i am not sure i want to вђ iвђm too young to get вђ swallowing hard he gave perrin an accusing look and spared one for rand up ahead too it is hardly safe to open your mouth with two taвђverenabout anything at all might come out nothing that might not have come off his tongue anyway as he well knew though it might have happened one time in a thousand or a thousand times a thousand without taвђverenthere loial knew that also and the fact of it seemed to frighten him as much as anything perrin had ever seen some considerable time passed before the ogierвђs ears stopped shaking faile filled perrinвђs mind but he was not blind not completely what he at first saw without seeing as they rode south and west began to seep in at the eyes the weather had been hot when he headed north from cairhien less than two weeks ago yet it seemed the dark oneвђs touch had gained a harder hold grinding the land more desperately than before brittle grass crackled beneath the horsesвђ hooves shriveled brown creepers spiderwebbed rocks on the hillsides and naked branches not merely leafless but dead cracked when the arid wind gusted evergreen pine and leatherleaf stood brown and yellow often as not farms had begun appearing after a few miles plain structures of dark stone laid out in squares the first in isolated clearings in the forest then coming more thickly as the woodland thinned to trees hardly deserving the name a cart road straggled there running over the shoulders and crests of hills accommodating stonewalled fields more than the terrain most of those early farms looked deserted here a ladderback chair lying on its side in front of a farmhouse there a rag doll by the roadside slatribbed cattle and lethargic sheep dotted pastures where frequently ravens squabbled over carcasses hardly a pasture but had a carcass or two streams ran in trickles down channels of dried mud cropland that should have been blanketed with snow looked ready to crumble to dust where it was not dust already blowing away a tall plume of dust marked the passage of the column until the narrow dirt way joined the broad stonepaved road that led from jangai pass here there were people though few and those often lethargic dulleyed with the sinking sun almost halfway down to the horizon now the air was an oven the occasional oxcart or horsedrawn wagon hurried off the road down narrow tracks or even into fields out of the way the drivers and the handful of farm folk in the open stood blankfaced as they watched the three banners pass close to a thousand armed men was reason enough to stare a thousand armed men heading somewhere in a hurry with a purpose reason enough to stare and be thankful when they passed out of sight at last when the sun had less than twice its own height yet to fall the road topped a rise and there two or three miles before them lay cairhien rand drew rein and the maidens all together now dropped to their heels where they were they kept those sharp eyes out though nothing could be seen moving on the nearly treeless hills around the city a great mass of gray stone sinking toward the river alguenya on the west squarewalled squaretowered and stark ships of all sizes lay anchored in the river and some tied to the docks of the far bank where the granaries were a few vessels moved under sail or long sweeps they gave an impression of peace and prosperity with not a cloud in the sky the light was sharp and the huge banners flying from the cityвђs towers stood plain enough to perrin when the wind unfurled them the scarlet banner of light and the white dragon banner with its serpentine creature scaled scarlet and gold the wavyrayed rising sun of cairhien gold on blue and a fourth given equal prominence with the rest a silver diamond on a field checked yellow and red lowering a small looking glass from his eye a scowling dobraine stuffed it into a workedleather tube tied to his saddle i hoped the savages had it wrong somehow but if house saighan flies with the rising sun colavaere has the throne she will have been distributing gifts in the city every day coin food finery it is traditional for the coronation festival a ruler is never more popular than for the week after taking the throne he eyed rand sideways the strain of speaking straight out hollowed his face the commoners could riot if they dislike what you do the streets could run with blood havienвђs gray gelding danced his riderвђs impatience and the man himself kept looking from rand to the city and back it was not his city he had made it clear earlier that he cared little what ran in the streets so long as his own ruler was safe for long moments rand studied the city or seemed to anyway whatever he saw his face was bleak min studied him worriedly maybe pityingly i will try to see they donвђt he said at last flinn remain here with the soldiers min вђ she broke in on him sharply no i am going where you go rand alвђthor you need me and you know it the last sounded more plea than demand but when a woman planted her fists on her hips that way and fixed her eyes to you she was not begging i am going too loial added leaning on his longhafted axe you always manage to do things when iвђm somewhere else his voice took on a plaintive edge it wonвђt do rand it will not do for the book how can i write about things if i am not there still looking at min rand halfraised a hand toward her then let it fall she met his gaze levelly this is madness holding his reins stiffly dashiva booted the plump mare closer to randвђs black reluctance twisted his features perhaps even ashaвђman worried at being too near rand all it needs is one man with a a bow or a knife and you donвђt see him in time send one of the ashaвђman to do what needs doing or more if you think itвђs necessary a gateway to the palace and it can be done before anyone knows what has happened and sit here past dark rand cut in reining his gelding around to face dashiva until they know this place well enough to open one that way brings bloodshed for sure theyвђve seen us from the walls unless theyвђre blind sooner or later they will send somebody to find out who we are and how many the rest of the column remained hidden behind the rise and the banners were down there too but men sitting their horses on a ridge with maidens for company would indeed attract curiosity i will do this my way his voice rose in anger and he smelled of cold fury nobody dies unless it canвђt be avoided dashiva iвђve had a bellyful of death do you understand me nobody as my lord dragon commands the fellow inclined his head but he sounded sour and he smelled perrin rubbed his nose the smell skittered dodging wildly through fear and hate and anger and a dozen more emotions almost too quickly to make out he no longer doubted the man was mad however good a face the fellow put on perrin no longer really cared either this close digging his heels into stepperвђs flanks he started for the city and faile not waiting for the rest barely noticing aram close behind he did not have to see aram to know he would be there all he could think of was faile if he got swallow safely into the city he made himself keep stepper at no more than a quick walk a galloping rider drew eyes and questions and delays at that pace the others caught up with aram and him fast enough those who were coming min had gotten her way it seemed and so had loial the maidens fanned out ahead some giving perrin sympathetic looks as they trotted by chiad studied the ground until she was beyond him i still donвђt like this plan havien muttered on one side of rand forgive me my lord dragon but i do not dobraine on randвђs other side grunted we have been over that mayener if we did as you want they would close the gates on us before we covered a mile havien growled something under his breath and danced his horse a few paces he had wanted every man to follow rand into the city perrin glanced over his shoulder past the ashaвђman damer flinn recognizable by his coat and a few of the two rivers men were visible on the ridge standing and holding their horses perrin sighed he would not have minded haying the two rivers men along but rand was probably right and dobraine had backed him up a few men could enter where a small army could not if the gates were shut the aiel would have to besiege the city if they still would and then the killing began anew rand had stuffed the dragon scepter into one of the geldingsвђ saddlebags so just the carved butt stuck out and that plain coat looked like nothing the dragon reborn would wear for the ashaвђman nobody in the city had any idea what a black coat meant a few men were easier to kill than a small army too even if most of them could channel perrin had seen an ashaвђman take a shaido spear through his belly and the man had died no harder than any other dashiva grumbled under his breath perrin caught hero and fool in equally disparaging tones without faile he might have agreed once rand peered toward the aiel encampment sprawled over the hills two or three miles east of the city and perrin held his breath but whatever thoughts rand had he kept on the road nothing mattered more than faile nothing whether or not rand saw it so a good halfmile short of the gates they rode into another camp one that made perrin frown it was big enough for a city itself a thick band of ramshackle brush huts and rickety tents made from scraps on burnedover ground clinging to the high gray walls as far as he could see this had been called foregate once warren of twisting streets and alleys before the shaido burned it some of the people stared in silence as the strange party passed at an ogier and aiel maidens but most scuttled about their business with wary sullen faces and a care to notice nothing that was not right in front of them the bright colors and often tattered castoff finery worn by foregaters mingled with the somber garb more usual for cairhienin the plain dark clothes of villagers and farmers the foregaters had been in the city when perrin left along with thousands of refugees from deeper inside the country many of those faces bore bruises and worse cuts and slashes often unbandaged colavaere must have put them out they would not have left the shelter of the walls on their own foregaters and refugees alike feared the return of the shaido the way a man who had been seared to the bone feared hot iron the road ran straight through the camp to the jangai gates three tall square arches flanked by towers helmeted men lounged up on the battlements peering down through the gaps in the stone teeth some stared off toward the men on the hilltop and here and there an officer with a conheld a looking glass to his eye randвђs small party drew inquiring glances men ahorseback and aiel maidens not common companions crossbows showed atop the serrated wall but no one raised a weapon the ironbound gates stood open perrin held his breath he wanted very much to gallop for the sun palace and faile just inside the gates sat a squat stone guardhouse where strangers to the city were supposed to register before entering a squarefaced cairhienin officer watched them pass with a disgruntled frown eyeing the maidens uneasily he just stood there watching as i told you dobraine said once they were by the guardhouse colavaere gave free access to the city for coronation festival not even someone under order of arrest can be denied or detained it is tradition he sounded relieved though min sighed audibly and loial let out a breath that could have been heard two streets over perrinвђs chest was still too tight for sighing swallow was inside cairhien now if he could only get her to the royal palace up close cairhien carried out what it had promised from afar the highest of the hills lay inside the walls but terraced and faced with stone till they no longer seemed hills at all broad crowded streets met at right angles in this city even the alleys made a grid the streets rose and fell reluctantly with the hills often simply cutting through from shops to palaces the buildings were all stark squares and severe rectangles even the great buttressed towers each wrapped in scaffolding on a hilltop the oncefabled topless towers of cairhien still being rebuilt after burning in the aiel war the city seemed harder than stone a bruising place and shadows stretching across everything heightened the effect loialвђs tufted ears twitched almost without stopping a worried frown creased his forehead and his dangling eyebrows brushed his cheek there were few signs of coronation festival or high chasaline perrin had no notion what the festival might entail but in the two rivers the day of reflection was a time of merriment and forgetting the bleakness of winter here a near hush hung in the air despite the number of people anywhere else perrin might have thought it the unnatural heat dragging peopleвђs spirits down but except for foregaters cairhienin were a sober austere lot on the surface at least what lay underneath he would as soon not think about the hawkers and cartpeddlers he remembered were gone from the streets the musicians and tumblers and puppet shows those people would be in the ragtag camp outside the walls a few closed darkpainted sedan chairs threaded through the quiet throngs some with house banners a little larger than constanding stiffly above they moved as slowly as the oxcarts with goadwielding drivers walking alongside axles squealing in the stillness outlanders stood out no matter how little color they wore because few except outlanders rode the almost inevitably shorter natives looked like palefaced crows in their dark garb aiel stood out too of course whether one alone or ten together they walked in clearings through the crowds eyes darted away and space just opened up around them wherever they went aiel faces turned toward the party as it made its slow way through the crowds even if not all recognized rand in his green coat they knew who a tall wetlander escorted by maidens must be those faces sent a chill down perrinвђs spine considering they made him thankful rand had left all of the aes sedai behind aside from the aiel the dragon reborn moved through a river of unconcern that parted for the maidens and closed in again behind the ashaвђman the royal palace of cairhien the sun palace the palace of the rising sun in splendor вђ cairhienin were great ones for names each more extravagant than the last вђ stood atop the highest hill in the city a dark mass of square stone with stepped towers looming over everything the street the way of the crown became a long broad ramp rising toward the palace and perrin drew a deep breath as they started up faile was up there she had to be and safe whatever else she had to be safe he touched the knot holding swallowвђs reins to a ring on his pommel stroked the axe at his waist the horsesвђ shod hooves rang loudly on the paving stones the maidens made no sound at all the guards on the great open bronze gates watched their slow approach and exchanged glances they were colorful for cairhienin soldiers ten men with the rising sun in gold on their dark breastplates and scarves in house saighanвђs colors tied below the heads of their halberds perrin could have written out their thoughts thirteen men on horseback but in no hurry and only two wearing armor one in mayener red any trouble would come from caraline damodred and toram riatin and mayeners had no place in that and there was a woman and an ogier surely they intended no trouble still three dozen or so maidens trotting ahead of the horses hardly looked as though they were coming for tea for an instant all hung balanced then a maiden veiled herself the guards jerked as if goosed and one slanted his halberd and darted for the gates two steps he took and stopped rigid as a statue every guard stood stiff nothing moved but their heads good rand murmured now tie off the flows and leave them for later perrin shrugged uncomfortably the ashaвђman had spread out behind taking up most of the width of the ramp they must be using the power very likely the eight of them could tear the whole palace apart maybe rand could have by himself but if those towers began spewing crossbow bolts they would die with everyone else caught in the open on this ramp that no longer seemed so wide nobody sped up any eyes at the tall narrow windows of the palace on the colonnaded walks high above must see nothing out of the ordinary sulin flashed maiden handtalk and the one who had veiled lowered the black cloth hurriedly face flushing a slow walk up the stone ramp some of the guardsвђ helmeted heads shook wildly eyes rolling one seemed to have fainted slumping upright with his chin on his chest their mouths strained open but no sound came out perrin tried not to think about what had gagged them a slow walk through the open bronze gates into the main courtyard there were no soldiers here the stone balconies around the courtyard stood empty liveried servants rushed out with downcast eyes to take the horsesвђ reins and hold stirrups stripes of red and yellow and silver ran down the sleeves of otherwise dark coats and dresses and each had the rising sun small oh the left breast that was more color than perrin had seen on a cairhienin servant before they could not see the guards outside and likely would have done little different if they had in cairhien servants played their own version of daes daeвђmar the game of houses but they pretended to ignore the doings of those above them taking too much notice of what happened among your betters вђ or at least being seen to take notice вђ might mean being caught up in it in cairhien maybe in most lands ordinary folk could be crushed unnoticed where the mighty walked a blocky woman led stepper and swallow away without really looking at him swallow was inside the sun palace and it made no difference he still did not know whether faile was alive or dead a fool boyвђs fool fancy shifting his axe at his hip he followed rand up the broad gray stairs at the far end of the courtyard and nodded when aram reached over his shoulder again to ease his sword liveried men swung open the great doors at the head of the stairs bronze like the outer gates and marked large with the rising sun of cairhien once the entry hall would have stunned perrin with its grandeur thick square columns of dark marble held a squarevaulted ceiling ten paces above floor tiles that alternated dark blue and deep gold gilded rising suns marched around the cornices and friezes carved in the walls showed cairhienin triumphs in battle the hall was empty save for a handful of young men clustered beneath one of the friezes who fell silent when perrin and the rest entered not all men he realized all wore swords but four of the seven were women in coats and snug breeches much like minвђs their hair cut short as the menвђs not that that was particularly short men and women alike had it gathered in a kind of tail that reached their shoulders tied with a dark ribbon one of the women wore green a little paler than normal for cairhienin and another bright blue all the rest were in dark colors with a few bright stripes across their chests they studied randвђs party вђ with an especial view for himself perrin realized his yellow eyes took people aback although he hardly noticed it anymore unless somebody jumped or made a commotion вђ studied in silence until the last of the ashaвђman was in and the doors swung shut the boom of the closing covered a moment of fierce whispering then they came swaggering closer the women strutting even more arrogantly than the men which took some doing even the way they knelt was arrogant the greenclad woman glanced at the one in blue who had her head down and said my lord dragon i am camaille nolaisen selande darengil leads our society she blinked at a fierce look from the woman in blue despite the glare selande smelled afraid to her bones if perrin was making out who was who properly clearing her throat camaille went on we did not think вђ we did not expect you to return вђ so soon yes rand said softly i doubt anyone thought i would return вђ so soon none of you has any reason to be afraid of me none at all if you believe anything believe that surprisingly he looked right at selande when he said that her head whipped up and as she stared at him the fear smell faded not completely but down to a tatter how had rand known it was there where is colavaere rand asked camaille opened her mouth but it was selande who answered in the grand hall of the sun her voice grew stronger as she spoke the scent of her fear growing weaker oddly a slight tinge of jealousy touched it once just for an instant when she glanced at min sometimes his sense of smell was more confusing than enlightening it is the third sunset convocation she went on we are not important enough to attend besides i think we of the societies make her uneasy the third dobraine muttered the ninth sunset after her coronation already she wasted no time at least they will all be together no one of any rank or pretension will miss it cairhienin or tairen drawing herself up on her knees selande managed to make it seem she was meeting rand eyetoeye we are ready to dance the blades for you my lord dragon sulin shook her head wincing and another maiden groaned audibly several looked and smelled ready to do some violence then and there the aiel could not decide what to make of these young wetlanders the problem in aiel eyes were that they were trying to be aiel in a way to follow jiвђeвђtoh their version of it anyway these seven were not the lot hundreds of the idiots at least could be found all over the city organized into societies in imitation of the aiel half the aiel perrin had heard mention them wanted to help the other half wanted to strangle them for himself he did not care whether they mangled jiвђeвђtohto mincemeat where is my wife he demanded where is faile the young fools exchanged guarded looks guarded she is in the grand hall of the sun selande said slowly she вђ she is one of queen вђ of colavaereвђs lady attendants put your eyes back in your head perrin min whispered she must have a good reason you know she must shrugging inside his coat perrin tried to gather himself one of colavaereвђs attendants whatever her reason it must be good that much he was sure of but what could it be selande and the others were passing those guarded looks about again one of the men a young fellow with a pointed nose whispered fierce and low we swore not to tell anyone not anyone on water oath before perrin could demand to be told rand spoke selande lead the way to the grand hall there will be no blades i am here to see justice done to all who deserve it something in his voice made perrinвђs hackles rise a hardness grim as a hammerвђs face faile didhave a good reason she had to chapter dragon a broken crown wide and tall as the corridors were they felt close and dim despite tall gilded standlamps with mirrors on every branch lit wherever daylight could not penetrate tapestries hung few and far between on the walls scenes of hunt or battle with people and animals arranged more precisely than ever nature had scattered niches held bowls and vases and now and then a small statue in gold or silver or alabaster but even the statues seemed to emphasize that they were stone or metal as if the sculptors had tried to banish curves the cityвђs hush was magnified here the sound of their boots on the floor tiles echoed a hollow foreboding march and perrin did not think it was so to his ears alone loialвђs quivered at every other step and he peered down crossing corridors as though wondering what might leap out min held herself stiffly and took ginger steps grimacing ruefully when she glanced at rand she seemed to make an effort not to walk closer to him and not particularly pleased with herself over it the young cairhienin started off swaggering like peacocks but that arrogance faded as the drumming of their heels reverberated even the maidens felt it sulin was the only one whose hand did not sometimes rise toward the veil hanging down her chest there were servants everywhere of course pale narrowfaced men and women in dark coats and dresses with the rising sun on the left breast and sleeves striped in colavaereвђs colors some gaped in recognition as rand passed by a handful dropped to their knees heads bowed most went on about their tasks after a small pause for deep bow or curtsy it was just as in the courtyard show proper respect to your betters whoever they are obey them and otherwise ignore what they do and perhaps you will not be entangled in it it was a way of thinking that set perrinвђs teeth on edge nobody should have to live that way two fellows in colavaereвђs livery standing before the giltcovered doors to the grand hall of the sun frowned at sight of the maidens and maybe at the young cairhienin older folk usually looked askance at the younglingsвђ carrying on every bit as much as the aiel did more than one parent had tried to put an end to it had ordered sons or daughters to give over instructed armsmen and servants to chase off othersвђ likeminded sons and daughters like common vagrants or street ruffians perrin would not have been surprised if these doormen slanted their gilded staffs to stop selande and her friends from going through the open doorways nobility or not and perhaps even the maidens few cairhienin still dared call aiel savages not where they could be heard but most thought it the pair gathered themselves drew deep breaths вђ and saw rand over the maidensвђ heads their eyes nearly popped out of their faces each man glanced sideways at the other and then they were on their knees one stared fixedly at the floor the other squeezed his eyes shut and perrin heard him praying under his breath so am i loved rand said softly he hardly sounded himself min touched his arm her face pained rand patted her hand without looking at her and for some reason that seemed to pain her even more the grand hall of the sun was immense with an anglevaulted ceiling a full fifty paces high at its peak and great golden lamps hung on gilded chains thick enough to move the gates of a fortress it was immense and it was full people crowding among massive square columns of blueblack veined marble that stood in two rows to either side of the center aisle the folk at the rear noticed the newcomers first in long coats and short some in bright colors or embroidered some travelworn they stared curiously intently the few women in the back of the hall wore riding dresses and had faces as hard as the men gazes as direct hunters for the horn perrin thought dobraine had said that every noble who could be there would and most hunters were nobly born or claimed to be whether or not they recognized rand they sensed something hands feeling for swords and daggers that were not there this evening more hunters than not sought adventure and a place in the histories along with the horn of valere even if they did not know the dragon reborn they knew danger when they saw it the others in the grand hall were less attuned to danger or rather more to intrigues and plots than to open hazard perrin was a third of the way down the long center aisle close on randвђs heels before gasps ran through the chamber like a wind pale cairhienin lords with colorful slashes across the chests of their dark silk coats some with the front of their heads shaved and powdered cairhienin ladies with stripes on their dark highnecked gowns and lace falls covering their hands their hair in intricate towers that often added a good foot of height tairen high lords and lords of the land with oiled beards trimmed to points in velvet hats and coats of red and blue and every color with puffy satinstriped sleeves tairen ladies in even more colorful gowns with wide lace ruffs and close caps studded with pearls and moonstones firedrops and rubies they knew perrin and they knew dobraine and even havien and min but most importantly they knew rand a ripple of knowing that kept pace up the hall with him eyes widening jaws dropping they went so stiff perrin almost thought the ashaвђman had bound them like the guards outside the palace the chamber was a sea of sweet perfumes and beneath that undercurrents of salty sweat but through it oozed fear a quivering sort of smell his attention was all on the far end of the hall though on the deep blue marble dais where the sun throne stood shining like its namesake with gilt the wavyrayed rising sun huge atop the high back colavaere rose slowly peering down the aisle over randвђs head her nearly black dress bore not a single stripe of nobility but the great mass of curls rising above her head had to have been dressed around the crown she wore the rising sun in gold and yellow diamonds seven young women flanked the sun throne in darkbodiced gowns with lace snugged under their chins and skirts striped vertically in colavaereвђs yellow and red and silver it seemed that cairhienin fashion was different for the queen and for the queenвђs attendants a flicker of motion behind the throne picked out an eighth woman hidden but perrin cared about neither colavaere nor anyone else except the woman to her immediate right faile her slightly tilted eyes fastened on him dark liquid moons yet not a line altered of her coolly decorous expression if anything her face grew tighter his nose strained for the scent of her but the perfume was too strong and the fear she had a reason for being there on the dais a good reason she did rand touched sulinвђs sleeve wait here he said scowling the scar on her leathery face standing out as white as her hair she scanned his face then nodded with obvious reluctance her free hand gestured anyway and another gasp ran through the chamber as the maidens veiled it was almost laughable the eight men in black coats trying to watch everywhere at once could probably kill them all before the first maiden drove home a spear but no one knew who or what they were no one looked at them twice a handful of men with their swords sheathed only at the maidens and rand hadnвђt they noticed that not a one of those men sweated a drop more than rand perrin felt as if he were bathing in his stepping past the maidens with min still close beside him rand stopped as first perrin then dobraine and havien joined him and aram of course like perrinвђs shadow rand studied them each in turn nodding slowly he studied perrin longest and took the longest time to nod the grayhaired cairhienin and the young mayener wore faces like death perrin did not know how his own looked but his jaw was locked tight no one was going to harm faile no matter what she had done no matter why no matter what he had to do to stop it their boots drummed loud in the silence as they crossed the huge golden mosaic of the rising sun in the bluetiled floor and approached the throne hands gripping her skirts colavaere wet her lips and her eyes darted between rand and the doors behind him looking for aes sedai randвђs voice echoed he smiled unpleasantly i sent them to the aiel camp if the aiel canвђt teach them manners no one can a shocked murmur rose and fell raggedly fear became stronger than the perfumes in perrinвђs nose colavaere gave a start why would i вђ drawing a deep breath she gathered dignity a more than handsome woman in her middle years without a touch of gray in her dark hair she bore a regal presence that had nothing to do with the crown she had been born to command to reign so she thought and her eyes weighing and measuring betrayed a hard intelligence my lord dragon she said making a curtsy so deep it nearly mocked itself i welcome you back cairhien welcomes you back the way she said it she seemed to be repeating herself slowly rand climbed the steps of the dais min halfmade to follow him then folded her arms perrin did follow to be nearer faile but only partway it was her gaze that stopped him a gaze that probed every bit as much as colavaereвђs at him as much as at rand perrin wished he could smell her not to try discovering why or what just for the smell of her the wash of perfumes and fright was too great why did she not speak why did she not come to him or smile just a smile colavaere stiffened a splinterвђs worth but only that her head came no more than level with randвђs chest though her towered hair rose almost as tall as he his eyes slid from her face and along the women lined up on either side of the throne he might have paused on faile perrin could not be sure rand rested his hand on one heavy arm of the sun throne you know i mean this for elayne trakand his voice was emotionless my lord dragon colavaere replied smoothly cairhien had been too long without a ruler a cairhienin ruler you yourself said you have no interest in the sun throne for yourself elayne trakand would have had some claim a small quick gesture dismissed such a claim if she were alive rumor says she is dead like her mother a dangerous thing to say a good many rumors said rand had killed both mother and daughter the woman was no coward elayne is alive the words were still flat as a planed board but randвђs eyes burned perrin could not pick out his smell any more than faileвђs but he did not need his nose to know rage bottled right in front of him she will have the crowns of andor and of cairhien my lord dragon what is done cannot be undone if anything has offended you вђ for all her dignity all her courage colavaere made a visible effort not to flinch as rand reached out and took hold of the sun crown there was a loud crack of metal snapping and the crown flexed hardly disarraying her tower of curls as it pulled away slowly straightening a few of the brilliant yellow stones popped from their settings and fell he held up the stretched arc of metal and slowly it bent back on itself until the ends met and maybe the ashaвђman could see what happened could understand but to perrin one moment the crown was broken the next it was whole again no one among the nobles made a sound not even a shuffling of boots perrin thought they might be afraid to to his nose stark terror was stronger than any other scent now it did not quiver it spasmed wildly whatever can be done rand said softly can be undone colavaereвђs face drained of blood the few wisps of hair that had escaped her coiffure made her seem wild at bay swallowing she opened her mouth twice before any words came out my lord dragon it was a breathy whisper but as she went on her voice became stronger and edged with desperation she seemed to forget anyone else was present i have kept the laws you made maintained your policies even those that go against the ancient laws of cairhien against all custom she probably meant the laws that had let a noble kill a farmer or craftsman and walk away my lord dragon the sun throne is yours to give i know that i вђ i was wrong to take it without your leave but i have the right to it by birth and blood if i must have it from your hand then give it to me by your hand i have the right rand only looked at her he said nothing he seemed to be listening but not to her perrin cleared his throat why was rand dragging this out it was done or nearly let whatever else had to be done be done then he could take faile away where they could talk did you have the right to murder lord maringil and high lord meilan perrin demanded there was no doubt in his mind she had had it done they had been her biggest rivals for the throne or she and they thought they were anyway why was rand just standing there he knew all of this where is berelain before the name was off his tongue he wanted to call it back faile only glanced at him her face still a cool mask of propriety but that glance could have set water aflame a jealous wife is like a hornetsвђ nest in your mattress the saying went no matter how you twitched you got stung you dare accuse me of so vile a crime colavaere demanded there is no proof there can be no proof not when i am innocent abruptly she seemed to become aware of where she was of the nobles crowded shouldertoshoulder among the columns watching and listening whatever else could be said of her she did have courage standing straight she did her best to stare rand in the eye without tilting her head too far back my lord dragon nine days ago at sunrise i was crowned queen of cairhien according to the laws and usages of cairhien i will keep my oath of fealty to you but i am queen of cairhien rand only stared at her silent and troubled perrin would have said my lord dragon i am queen unless you would rip all our laws away still silence from rand and an unblinking stare why doesnвђt he end itperrin wondered these charges against me are false they are mad only that silent stare for answer colavaere moved her head uneasily annoura advise me come annoura advise me perrin thought she spoke to one of the women with faile but the woman who stepped from behind the throne did not wear the striped skirts of an attendant a broad face with a wide mouth and a beak of a nose regarded rand from beneath dozens of long thin dark braids an ageless face to perrinвђs surprise havien made a sound in his throat and began grinning his own hackles were standing straight i cannot do this colavaere the aes sedai said in a taraboner accent shifting her grayfringed shawl i fear i have allowed you to misperceive my relationship to you drawing a deep breath she added there there is no need for this master alвђthor her voice became slightly unsteady for a moment or my lord dragon if you prefer i assure you i harbor no ill intentions toward you if i did i would have struck before you knew i was here you might well have died if you had randвђs voice was icy steel his face made it seem soft iвђm not who has you shielded aes sedai who are you why are you here answer me i donвђt have much patience with your kind unless you want to be hauled out to the aiel camp i wager the wise ones can make you speak freely this annoura was not slowwitted her eyes darted to aram then to the aisle where the ashaвђman stood and she knew they had to be who he meant in their black coats grim faces dry when every other but hers and randвђs glistened young jahar was watching her like a hawk watching a rabbit incongruously loial stood in the midst of them with his axe propped against his shoulder one big hand managed to hold an ink bottle and an open book pressed awkwardly against his chest while the other scribbled as fast as he could dip a pen fatter than perrinвђs thumb he was taking notes here the nobles heard rand as well as annoura did they had been watching the veiled maidens uneasily now they crowded back from the ashaвђman pressing together like fish in a barrel here and there someone sagged in a faint held up by the throng shivering annoura adjusted her shawl and regained all the vaunted aes sedai composure i am annoura larisen my lord dragon of the gray ajah nothing about her said that she was shielded and in the presence of men who could channel she seemed to answer as a favor i am the advisor to berelain first of mayene so that was why havien was grinning like a madman he had recognized the woman perrin did not feel like grinning at all this has been kept secret you understand she went on because of the attitude of tear both toward mayene and toward aes sedai but i think me the time for secrets it is past yes annoura turned to colavaere and her mouth firmed i let you think what you would think but aes sedai do not become advisors simply because someone tells them they are most especially when they already advise someone else if berelain confirms your story rand said i will parole you to her custody looking at the crown he seemed to realize for the first time that the spray of gold and gems was still in his hand very gently he set it on the silkcovered seat of the sun throne i donвђt think every aes sedai is my enemy not entirely but i wonвђt be schemed against and i wonвђt be manipulated not anymore itвђs your choice annoura but if you make the wrong one you will go to the wise ones if you live long enough i wonвђt hobble the ashaвђman and a mistake could cost you the ashaвђman annoura said calmly i quite understand but she touched her lips with her tongue my lord dragon colavaere plotted to break her oath of fealty perrin had wished so hard for faile to speak that he jumped when she did stepping out of the line of attendants choosing her words carefully she confronted the wouldbe queen like a stooping eagle light but she was beautiful colavaere swore to obey you in all things and uphold your laws but she has made plans to rid cairhien of the aiel to send them south and return all to as it was before you came she also said that if you ever returned you would not dare change anything she had done the woman she told these things maire was one of her attendants maire vanished soon after telling me i have no proof but i believe she is dead i believe colavaere regretted revealing too much of her mind too soon dobraine strode up the steps to the dais his helmet under his arm his face might have been cold iron colavaere saighan he announced in a formal voice that carried to every corner of the grand hall by my immortal soul under the light i dobraine high seat of house taborwin do arraign and censure you of treason the penalty for which is death randвђs head went back eyes closed his mouth moved slightly but perrin knew that only he and rand heard what was said no i cannot i will not perrin understood the delay now rand was searching for a way out perrin wished he could see one colavaere certainly did not hear but she wanted a way out too she looked around wildly to the sun throne to her other attendants to the assembled nobility as though they might step forward to defend her their feet could as well have been set in cement a sea of carefully blank sweaty faces confronted her and eyes that avoided hers some of those eyes rolled toward the ashaвђman but not too openly the already considerable space between nobles and ashaвђman widened noticeably lies she hissed hands knotted in her skirts all lies you sneaking little вђ she took a step toward faile rand stretched his arm between them though colavaere appeared not to see it and faile looked as though she wished he had not anyone who attacked her was in for a surprise faile does not lie perrin growled well not about something like this once again colavaere recovered herself slight as her height was she drew up every inch of it perrin almost admired her except for meilan and maringil and this maire and the light alone knew how many others i demand justice my lord dragon her voice was calm stately royal there is no proof of any of this this filth a claim that someone who is no longer in cairhien says i spoke words i never did i demand the lord dragonвђs justice by your own laws there must be proof how do you know she is no longer in cairhien dobraine demanded where is she i assume she has gone she addressed her answer to rand maire left my service and i replaced her with reale there she gestured toward the third attendant on the left i have no idea where she is bring her forward if she is in the city and let her make these ridiculous charges to my face i will fling her lies in her face faile looked murder at her perrin hoped she would not produce one of those knives she kept hidden about her she had a habit of doing that when she became angry enough annoura cleared her throat she had been studying rand much too closely for perrinвђs comfort she reminded him of verin suddenly that look of a bird examining a worm may i speak master ah my lord dragon at his curt nod she went on adjusting her shawl of young maire i know nothing except that one morning she was here and before nightfall she was nowhere to be found and none knew where she had gone but lord maringil and high lord meilan they are a different matter the first of mayene she brought with her two most excellent thiefcatchers men experienced in ferreting out crimes they have brought before me two of the men who waylaid the high lord meilan in the streets though both insist they only held his arms while others did the stabbing also they brought me the servant who put poison in the spiced wine lord maringil liked to drink at bedtime she also protests her true innocence her invalid mother would have died and she herself had lord maringil not so she says and in her case i believe she speaks truly her solace at confession was not false i think both the men and the woman agree in this the orders for their actions came from the mouth of lady colavaere herself word by word the defiance leached out of colavaere she still stood yet it seemed a wonder she appeared as limp as a damp rag they promised she mumbled to rand they promised you would never return too late she clamped both hands over her mouth her eyes bulged perrin wished he could not hear the sounds coming from her throat no one should make sounds like that treason and murder dobraine sounded satisfied those whimpered screams did not touch him the penalty is the same my lord dragon death except by your new law it is hanging for murder for some reason rand looked at min she returned his gaze with profound sadness not for colavaere for rand perrin wondered whether a viewing was involved i вђ i demand the headsman colavaere managed in a strangled voice her face sagged she had become old on the spot and her eyes were mirrors of stark terror but with nothing left she fought on for the scraps it is вђ it is my right i will not be hanged like some commoner rand seemed to struggle with himself shaking his head in that disturbing way when he spoke at last his words were winter cold and anvil hard colavaere saighan i strip you of your titles he drove the words like nails i strip of you of your lands and estates and possessions of everything but the dress you stand in do you own вђ did you own a farm a small farm each sentence staggered the woman she swayed drunkenly on her feet soundlessly mouthing the word farm as if she had never heard it before annoura faile everyone stared at rand in amazement or curiosity or both perrin not least a farm if there had been silence in the grand hall before now it seemed that no one even breathed dobraine did she own a small farm she owns owned many farms my lord dragon the cairhienin replied slowly clearly he understood no more than perrin did most are large but the lands near the dragonwall have always been divided into smallholdings less than fifty hides all of the tenants abandoned them during the aiel war rand nodded time to change that too much land has lain fallow too long i want to move people back there to farm again dobraine you will find out which farm of those colavaere owned near the dragonwall is the smallest colavaere i exile you to that farm dobraine will see youвђre provided with what is needed to make a farm work and with someone to teach you how to till the soil and with guards to see that you never go farther from it than you can walk in a day so long as you live see to it dobraine in a week i want her on her way a bewildered dobraine hesitated before nodding perrin could catch murmurs from the assembly behind him now this was unheard of none understood why she was not to die and the rest estates had been confiscated before but never all never nobility itself nobles had been exiled even for life but never to a farm colavaereвђs response was immediate eyes rolling up in her head she collapsed crumpling backward toward the steps perrin darted to catch her but someone was ahead of him before he had taken a full step her fall simply stopped she slumped in midair slanting over the steps to the dais head dangling slowly her unconscious form rose swung around and settled gently in front of the sun throne rand perrin was sure the ashaвђman would have let her fall annoura tsked she did not appear surprised or perturbed except that her thumbs rubbed her forefingers nervously i suspect she would have preferred the headsman i will see to her if you have your man your ashaвђman sheвђs not your concern rand said roughly she is alive and she is alive he drew a long ragged breath min was there before he let it out she only stood near him yet she looked as if she wanted to do something more slowly his face firmed annoura you will take me to berelain release her jahar sheвђll be no trouble not with one of her and nine of us i want to find out what has been going on while i was away annoura and what berelain means bringing you here behind my back no donвђt speak iвђll hear it from her perrin i know you want some time with faile i вђ randвђs gaze swept slowly around the hall over all the nobles waiting silently under his stare none dared move a muscle the scent of fear far outweighed any other convulsing sharply except for the hunters everyone there had given him the same oath as had colavaere perhaps just being in this gathering was treason too perrin did not know this audience is at an end rand said i will forget every face that departs now those at the front the highestranking the most powerful began their progress toward the doors without too much haste avoiding the maidens and the ashaвђman standing in the aisle while the rest waited their turn every mind must have been turning over what rand had said though what precisely did he mean by now purposeful strides quickened skirts were lifted hunters nearest the doors began slipping out first one at a time then in a flood and seeing them lesser nobles among the cairhienin and tairens darted ahead of the higher in moments it was a milling mass at the doors men and women pushing and elbowing to get out not one looked back at the woman stretched out before the throne she had held so briefly chapter wolf old fear and new fear rand passed through the struggling mob without any difficulty of course maybe it was the presence of the maidens and the ashaвђman or maybe rand or one of the blackcoated fellows did something with the power but the crowd parted for him with min holding to his arm and a very subdued annoura attempting to speak to him and loial who was still trying with some difficulty to write in his book andcarry his axe staring at one another perrin and faile missed their chance to join them before the crowd closed up again she said nothing for a time and neither did he not what he wanted to say not with aram there staring at them like some worshipful hound and dobraine frowning down at the unconscious woman put in his charge no one else remained on the dais havien had gone with rand to find berelain and as soon as rand went the other attendants had darted away toward the doors without a second glance at perrin or faile or colavaere without the first glance for that matter they just lifted their striped skirts and ran grunts and curses drifted from the pack not all in menвђs voices even with rand gone those people wanted to be elsewhere and now perhaps they thought perrin stayed to watch and report though had any glanced back they would have seen his eyes were not on them climbing the rest of the way he took faileвђs hand and breathed in the scent of her this close the lingering perfumes did not matter anything else could wait she produced a red lace fan from somewhere and before spreading it to cool herself touched first her cheek then his there was a whole language of fans in her native saldaea she had taught him a little he wished he knew what the cheektouching meant it must be something good on the other hand her scent carried a spiky shading he knew too well he should have sent her to the block dobraine muttered and perrin shrugged uncomfortably from the manвђs tone it was not clear whether he meant that that was what the law called for or that it would have been more merciful dobraine did not understand rand could have sprouted wings first faileвђs fan slowed to barely moving and she eyed dobraine sideways over the crimson lace her death might be best for everyone that is the prescribed penalty what will you do lord dobraine sidelong or not it still managed to be very direct a very meaningful gaze perrin frowned not a word for him but questions for dobraine and there was that undertone of jealousy in her aroma making him sigh the cairhienin gave her a level look in return while thrusting his gauntlets behind his sword belt what i was commanded to do i keep my oaths lady faile the fan snapped open and shut faster than thought he actually sent aes sedai to the aiel as prisoners disbelief tinged her voice some lady faile dobraine hesitated some swore fealty on their knees this i saw with my own eyes they went to the aiel too but i do not think they can be called prisoners i saw it too my lady aram put in from his place on the steps and a wide smile split his face when she glanced at him red lace described a fluttering hitch what she did with the fan seemed almost unconscious you both saw the relief in her voice вђ and in her scent вђ was so strong that perrin stared what did you think faile why would rand lie especially when everyone would know in a day instead of answering immediately she frowned down at colavaere is she still under not that it matters i suppose she knows more than i would say here everything we worked so hard to keep hidden she let that slip to maire too she knows too much dobraine thumbed one of colavaereвђs eyes open none too gently as if hit with a mace a pity she did not break her neck on the steps but she will go to her exile and learn to live as a farmer a brief jaggedy vexed smell wafted from faile abruptly it hit perrin what his wife had been proposing so obliquely what dobraine had rejected just as indirectly every hair on his body tried to stand from the start he had known that he had married a very dangerous woman just not how dangerous aram was peering at colavaere his lips pursed in dark thought the man would do anything for faile i donвђt think rand would like it if anything prevented her reaching that farm perrin said firmly eyeing aram and faile in turn iwouldnвђt like it either he felt rather proud of himself that was talking around the point as well as any of them aram bowed his head briefly вђ he understood вђ but faile tried to look innocent above her gently fluttering fan with no notion what he was talking about suddenly he realized not all the fear scent came from the people still milling at the door a thin quivering thread of it wafted from her fear under control yet it was there whatвђs the matter faile light youвђd think coiren and that lot had won instead of her face did not change but the thread grew thicker is that why you didnвђt say anything at first he asked softly were you afraid we had come back as puppets and them pulling the strings she eyed the rapidly diminishing crowd across the grand hall the nearest of them was a long way and all making a good deal of noise but she lowered her voice even so aes sedai can do that sort of thing iвђve heard my husband no one knows more than i that even aes sedai would find hard times trying to make you dance for a puppet much harder than a man whoвђs just the dragon reborn but when you walked in here i was more afraid than at any time since you left amusement trickled through in the first of that like tiny bubbles in his nose and warm fondness and love the smell of her clear and pure and strong but all of those faded by the end leaving that thin trembling thread light faile itвђs true every word rand said you heard dobraine and aram she smiled and nodded and worked her fan that thread still quivered in his nostrils though blood and ashes what does it take to convince herwould it help if he had verin dance the saвђsara she will if he tells her to he meant it for a joke all he knew of the saвђsarawas that it was scandalous вђ and that faile had once admitted knowing how to dance it though recently she sidestepped and all but denied it he meant it for a joke but she closed her fan and tapped it on her wrist he knew that one i am giving your suggestion serious thought i donвђt know what would be enough perrin she shivered slightly is there anything an aes sedai would not do or put up with if the white tower told her to i have studied my history and i was taught to read between the lines mashera donavelle bore seven children for a man she loathed whatever the stories say and isebaille tobanyi delivered the brothers she loved to their enemies and the throne of arad doman with them and jestian redhill she shivered again not so slightly itвђs all right he murmured wrapping her in his arms he had studied several books of history himself but he had never seen those names the daughter of a lord received a different education from a blacksmithвђs apprentice it really is true dobraine averted his eyes and so did aram though with a pleased grin she resisted at first but not very hard he could never be sure when she would avoid a public embrace and when welcome it only that if she did not want one she made it clear in no uncertain terms with or without words this time she snuggled her face into his chest and hugged him back squeezing harder if any aes sedai ever harms you she whispered i will kill her he believed her you belong to me perrin tвђ bashere aybara to me he believed that too as her hug grew fiercer so did the thorny scent of jealousy he almost chuckled it seemed the right to put a knife in him was reserved to her he would have chuckled except that filament of fear remained that and what she had said about maire he could not smell himself but he knew what was there fear old fear and new fear for the next time the last of the nobles forced their way from the grand hall without anyone being trampled sending aram off to tell dannil to bring the two rivers men into the city вђ and wondering how he was going to feed them вђ perrin offered faile his arm and led her out leaving dobraine with colavaere who was finally showing signs of awakening he had no wish to be around when she woke and faile with her hand on his wrist seemed not to either they walked quickly eager to reach their rooms if not necessarily for the same reasons the nobles apparently had not stopped their flight once they were out of the grand hall the corridors were empty except for servants who kept their eyes down at a silent rush but before they had gone very far perrin caught the sound of footsteps and realized they were being followed it seemed unlikely that colavaere had any open supporters still but if there were any they might think to strike at rand through his friend walking alone with his wife while the dragon reborn was elsewhere only when perrin spun about hand to his axe he stared instead of drawing the weapon it was selande and her friends from the entry hall with eight or nine new faces they gave a start when he turned and exchanged abashed glances some were tairens including a woman who stood taller than all but one of the cairhienin men she wore a manвђs coat and tight breeches just like selande and the rest of the women with a sword on her hip he had not heard that this nonsense had spread to the tairens why are you following us he demanded if you try to make me any of your woolhead trouble i vow iвђll kick the lot of you from here to bel tine he had had problems before with these idiots or some just like them anyway all they thought about was their honor and fighting duels and taking one another gaiвђshain that last really set the aielвђs teeth on edge attend my husband and obey faile put in sharply he is not a man to be trifled with gawking stares vanished and they backed away bowing competing over flourishes they were still at it when they vanished around a turn bloody young buffoons perrin muttered offering faile his wrist again my husband is wise in his years she murmured her tone was utterly serious her smell was something else again perrin managed not to snort true a few of them might be a year or two older than he but they all were like children with their playing at aiel now with faile in a good mood seemed as good a time as any to begin what they had to talk about what he had to talk about faile how did you come to be one of colavaereвђs attendants the servants perrin she spoke softly nobody two steps away could have heard a word she knew all about his hearing and the wolves that was nothing a man could keep from his wife her fan touched her ear admonishing caution in speech too many people forget servants are there but servants listen too in cairhien they listen far too much none of the liveried people he saw were doing any listening the few who did not duck down side corridors when they saw him and faile went by at a near run gazes on the floor and gathered in on themselves any sort of news spread quickly in cairhien events in the grand hall would have flown the word was in the streets by now probably on its way out of the city already without any doubt there were eyesandears in cairhien for the aes sedai and the whitecloaks and likely more thrones than not in that hushed voice she went on despite her caution to him colavaere could not be fast enough to take me in once she learned who i am my fatherвђs name impressed her as much as my cousinвђs she finished with a little nod as if she had answered everything it was a good enough answer almost her father was davram high seat of house bashere lord of bashere tyr and sidona guardian of the blightborder defender of the heartland and marshalgeneral to queen tenobia of saldaea faileвђs cousin was tenobia herself more than reason for colavaere to leap at faile for one of her attendants but he had had time to mull things over now and he prided himself that he was becoming used to her ways married life taught a man about women or about one woman anyway the answer she had not given confirmed something faile had no concept of danger not where she herself was concerned he could not speak of it there in the corridor of course whisper how he would she did not have his ears and doubtless she would insist every servant within fifty was listening holding his patience he walked on with her until they reached the rooms that had been set aside for them what seemed an age ago now the lamps had been lit making shimmers on the dark polished walls each tall wooden panel carved in concentric rectangles in the square stone fireplace the hearth was swept bare and laid with a few pitiful branches of leatherleaf they were almost green faile went straight to a small table where two golden pitchers stood beaded with moisture on a tray they have left us blueberry tea my husband and wine punch the wine is from tharon i think they cool the punch in the cisterns beneath the palace which would you prefer perrin unbuckled his belt and tossed belt and axe on a chair he had planned out what he had to say very carefully on the way here she could be a prickly woman faile i missed you more than i can say and worried about you but вђ worried about me she snapped spinning to face him she stood straight and tall eyes fierce as those of her falcon namesake and her fan made a coring motion toward his middle not part of the language of fans she made the same gesture with a knife sometimes when almost the first words from your mouth were to ask after that that woman his jaw dropped how could he have forgotten the smell filling his nostrils he nearly put a hand up to see whether his nose was bleeding faile i wanted her thiefcatchers be вђ no he was not stupid enough to repeat that name she said she had proof of the poison before i left you heard her i just wanted the proof faile it did no good that spiky stench softened not a whit and the thin sour smell of hurt joined it what under the light had he said to hurt her herproof what igathered went for nothing but her proof put colavaereвђs head on the block or should have that was his opening but she was not about to let him push a word in edgewise she advanced on him looking daggers her fan darting like one all he could do was back away do you know what story that woman put about faile almost hissed a black viper could not have dripped so much venom do you she said the reason you were not here was that you were at a manor not far from the city where she could visityou i told the story i prepared вђ that you were hunting and the light knows you spent enough days hunting вђ but everyone believed i was putting a good face on you and her together colavaere delighted in it i could believe she only took that mayener strumpet as an attendant to throw the two of us together вђfaile berelain come lace my gownвђ вђfaile berelain come hold the mirror for the hairdresserвђ вђfaile berelain come wash my backвђ so she could amuse herself waiting for us to claw one anotherвђs eyes out that is what i have put up with for you you hairyeared вђ his back thumped against the wall and something snapped inside him he had been frightened spitless for her terrified ready to face down rand or the dark one himself and he had done nothing had never encouraged berelain had done everything in his wits to chase the woman away for which his thanks was this gently he took her by the shoulders and lifted her until those big tilted eyes were level with his you listen to me he said calmly he tried to make his voice calm at least it came out more of a growl in his throat how dare you speak to me like that how dareyou i worried myself near to death for fear youвђd been hurt i love you and nobody else but you i want no other woman but you do you hear me do you crushing her to his chest he held her wanting to never let her go light he had been so afraid he shook even now for what might have been if anything happened to you iвђd die faile i would lie down on your grave and die do you think i donвђt know how colavaere found out who you are you made sure she found out spying she had told him once was a womanвђs work light woman you could have ended like maire colavaere knows youвђre my wife mywife perrin aybara rand alвђthorвђs friend did it ever occur to you she might be suspicious she could have light faile she could have abruptly he realized what he was doing she was making sounds against his chest but no words he could recognize he wondered that he did not hear her ribs creaking berating himself for an oaf he let her go arms springing apart but before he could apologize her fingers clutched his beard so you love me she said softly very softly very warmly she was smiling too a woman likes to hear that said the right way she had dropped the fan and her free hand drew fingernails down his cheek not far from hard enough to draw blood but her throaty laugh held heat and the smoldering in her eyes was as far from anger as possible a good thing you didnвђt say you never looked at another woman or i would think you had gone blind he was too stunned for words too stunned even to gape rand understood women mat understood women but perrin knew he never would she was always as much kingfisher as falcon changing direction faster than he could think yet this that thorny scent was gone completely and in its place was another smell of her he knew well a smell that was her pure and strong and clean add that to her eyes and any moment she was going to say something about farmgirls at harvest they were notorious apparently saldaean farmgirls as for you lying down on my grave she went on if you do my soul will haunt yours i promise you you will mourn me a decent time and then youвђll find yourself another wife someone iвђd approve of i hope with a soft laugh she stroked his beard you really arenвђt fit to take care of yourself you know i want your promise best not to crack his teeth on that say he would not and this wonderful mood might be swallowed in a firestorm quicksilver was not in it really say he would by the smell of her every word was the lightвђs pure truth but he would believe that when horses roosted in trees he cleared his throat i need to bathe i havenвђt seen soap in i donвђt know how long i must smell like an old barn leaning against his chest she drew a deep breath you smell wonderful like you her hands moved on his shoulders i feel as вђ the door banged open perrin berelain isnвђt вђ iвђm sorry forgive me rand stood shifting his feet not at all like the dragon reborn there were maidens in the hallway outside min put her head around the doorframe took one look grinned at perrin and ducked back out of sight faile stepped away so smoothly so stately that no one would ever have guessed what she had been saying a moment before or what she had been about to say there were spots of color in her cheeks though bright and hot so kind of you my lord dragon she said coolly to drop in so unexpectedly i apologize for not hearing your knock maybe those blushes were as much anger as embarrassment it was randвђs turn to blush and scrub a hand through his hair berelain isnвђt in the palace sheвђs spending the night on that sea folk ship anchored in the river of all things annoura didnвђt tell me till i was nearly to berelainвђs apartments perrin tried very hard not to wince why did he have to keep saying the womanвђs name you wanted to talk to me about something else rand he hoped he had not put too much emphasis in that yet he hoped rand caught it he did not look at faile but he tested the air gingerly no jealousy not yet a good deal of anger however for a moment rand stared at him looked through him listening to something else perrin folded his arms to stop from shuddering i need to know rand said finally are you still unwilling to command the army against illian i have to know now iвђm no general perrin said raggedly there would be battles in illian images flashed in his head men all around him and the axe in his hands spinning hewing his way through always more men however many he cut down in endless ranks and in his heart a seed growing he could not face that again he would not besides i thought i was supposed to stay close to you that was what min had said from one of her viewings twice perrin had to be there or rand would go down to disaster once had been dumaiвђs wells maybe but there was still another to come we all must take risks randвђs voice was very quiet and very hard min peered around the doorframe again looking as if she wanted to come to him but she glanced at faile and stayed outside rand the aes sedai a smart man would let this lie probably he had never claimed to be particularly smart though the wise ones are ready to skin them alive or near enough you canвђt let them be harmed rand in the corridor sulin turned to study him through the doorway the man he thought he knew laughed a wheezing sound we all have to take risks he repeated i wonвђt let them be hurt rand cold blue eyes met his gaze youwonвђt let it iwonвђt perrin told him levelly he did not flinch from that stare either they are prisoners and no threat theyвђre women they are aes sedai randвђs voice was so like aramвђs back at dumaiвђs wells that it nearly took perrinвђs breath rand вђ i do what i have to do perrin for a moment he was the old rand not liking what was happening for a moment he looked tired to death a moment only then he was the new rand again hard enough to mark steel i wonвђt harm any aes sedai who doesnвђt deserve it perrin i canвђt promise more since you donвђt want the army i can use you elsewhere just as well really i wish i could let you rest longer than a day or two but i canвђt thereвђs no time no time and we must do what we must forgive me for interrupting you he sketched a bow one hand on the hilt of his sword faile perrin tried to catch his arm but he was out of the room the door closing behind him before perrin could move rand was not really rand anymore it seemed a day or two where in the light did rand mean him to go if not to the army gathering down on the plains of maredo my husband faile breathed you have the courage of three men and the sense of a child on leading strings why is it that as a manвђs courage goes up his sense goes down perrin grunted indignantly he refrained from mentioning women who set themselves to spy on people who had committed murders and almost certainly knew they were spying women always talked about how logical they were compared to men but for himself he had seen precious little of it well perhaps i donвђt really want the answer even if you know it stretching with her arms over her head she gave a throaty laugh besides i donвђt mean to let him spoil the mood i still feel as forward as a farmgirl at вђ why are you laughing stop laughing at me perrin tвђbashere aybara stop it i say you uncouth oaf if you donвђt вђ the only way to put an end to it was to kiss her in her arms he forgot rand and aes sedai and battles where faile was was home chapter lion rampant pitfalls and tripwires rand felt the dragon scepter in his hand felt every line of the carved dragons against his heronbranded palm as clearly as if he were running his fingers over them yet it seemed someone elseвђs hand if a blade cut it off he would feel the pain вђ and keep going it would be anotherвђs pain he floated in the void surrounded by emptiness beyond knowing and saidinfilled him trying to grind him to dust beneath steelshattering cold and heat where stone would flash to flame carrying the dark oneвђs taint on its flow forcing corruption into his bones into his soul he feared sometimes it did not make him feel so sick to his stomach as it once had he feared that even more and larded through that torrent of fire ice and filth вђ life that was the best word saidintried to destroy him saidinfilled him to overflowing with vitality it threatened to bury him and it enticed him the war for survival the struggle to avoid being consumed magnified the joy of pure life so sweet even with the foulness what would it be like clean beyond imagining he wanted to draw more draw all there was there lay the deadly seduction one slip and the ability to channel would be seared out of him forever one slip and his mind was gone if he was not simply destroyed on the spot and maybe everything around him too it was not madness focusing on the fight for existence it was like highwalking blindfolded over a pit full of sharpened stakes basking in so pure a sense of life that thinking of giving it up was like thinking of a world forever in shades of gray not madness his thoughts whirled through his dance with saidin slid across the void annoura peering at him with that aes sedai gaze what was berelain playing at she had never mentioned an aes sedai advisor and those other aes sedai in cairhien where had they come from and why the rebels outside the city what had emboldened them to move what did they intend now how could he stop them or use them he was becoming good at using people sometimes he made himself sick sevanna and the shaido rhuarc already had scouts on the way to kinslayerвђs dagger but at best they could only find out where and when the wise ones who could find out why would not there were a lot of whyвђs connected to sevanna elayne and aviendha no he would not think of them no thoughts of them none perrin and faile a fierce woman falcon by name and nature had she really attached herself to colavaere just to gather evidence she would try to protect perrin if the dragon reborn fell protect him from the dragon reborn should she decide it necessary her loyalties were to perrin but she would decide for herself how to meet them faile was no woman to do meekly as her husband told her if such a woman existed golden eyes staring challenge and defiance why was perrin so vehement about the aes sedai he had been a long time with kiruna and her companions on the road to dumaiвђs wells could aes sedai really do with him what everybody feared aes sedai he shook his head without being aware never again never to trust was to be betrayed trust was pain he tried to push that thought away it came a little too close to raving nobody could live without giving trust somewhere just not to aes sedai mat perrin if he could not trust them min never a thought of not trusting min he wished she were with him instead of snugged in her bed all those days a prisoner days of worry вђ more for him than herself if he knew her вђ days of being questioned by galina and illtreated when her answers failed to please вђ unconsciously he ground his teeth вђ all of that and the strain of being healed on top of it had caught up with her at last she had stayed by his side until her legs gave way and he had to carry her to her bedchamber with her sleepily protesting all the way that he needed her with him no min here no comforting presence to make him laugh make him forget the dragon reborn only the war with saidin and the whirlwind of his thoughts and they must be done away with you must do it donвђt you remember the last time that place by the wells was a pittance cities burned whole out of the earth were nothing we destroyed the world do you hear me they have to be killed wiped from the face not his that voice shouting inside his skull not rand alвђthor lews therin telamon more than three thousand years dead and talking in rand alвђthorвђs head the power often drew him out of his hiding place in the shadows of randвђs mind sometimes rand wondered how that could be he was lews therin reborn the dragon reborn no denying that but everybody was someone reborn a hundred someones a thousand more that was how the pattern worked everyone died and was reborn again and again as the wheel turned forever without end but nobody else talked with who they used to be nobody else had voices in their heads except madmen what about me rand thought one hand tightened on the dragon scepter the other on his sword hilt what about you how are we different from them there was only silence often enough lews therin did not answer maybe it had been better when he never had are you realthe voice said at last wonderingly that denial of randвђs existence was as usual as refusing to answer am i i spoke to someone i think i did inside a box a chest wheezing laughter soft am i dead or mad or both no matter i am surely damned i am damned and this is the pit of doom i am ddamned wild that laughing now and tthis вђ is the ppit of вђ rand muted the voice to an insectвђs buzz something he had learned while cramped into that chest alone in the dark just him and the pain and the thirst and the voice of a longdead madman the voice had been a comfort sometimes his only companion his friend something flashed in his mind not images just flickers of color and motion for some reason they made him think of mat and perrin the flashes had begun inside the chest them and a thousand more hallucinations in the chest where galina and erian and katerine and the rest stuffed him every day after he was beaten he shook his head no he was not in the chest anymore his fingers ached clenched around scepter and hilt only memories remained and memories had no force he was not вђ if we must make this journey before you eat let us make it the evening meal is long finished for everyone else rand blinked and sulin stepped back from his stare sulin who would stand eyetoeye with a leopard he smoothed his face tried to it felt a mask somebody elseвђs face are you well she asked i was thinking he made his hands unknot shrugged inside his coat a betterfitting coat than the one he had worn from dumaiвђs wells dark blue and plain even after a bath he did not feel clean not with saidinin him sometimes i think too much nearly twenty more maidens clustered at one end of the windowless darkpaneled room eight gilded standlamps against the walls mirrored to increase the light provided illumination he was glad of that he did not like dark places anymore three of the ashaвђman were there too the aiel women to one side of the chamber the ashaвђman to the other jonan adley an altaran despite his name stood with his arms folded working eyebrows like black caterpillars in deep thought perhaps four years older than rand he was intent on earning the silver sword of the dedicated eben hopwil carried more flesh on his bones and fewer blotches on his face than when rand had first seen him though his nose and ears still seemed the biggest part of him he fingered the sword pin on his collar as if surprised to find it there fedwin morr would have worn the sword as well had he not been in a green coat suitable for a welltodo merchant or a minor noble with a little silver embroidery on cuffs and lapels of an age with eben but stockier and with almost no blotches he did not look happy that his black coat was stuffed into the leather scrip by his feet they were the ones lews therin had been raving about them and all the rest of the ashaвђman ashaвђman aes sedai anyone who could channel set him off often as not think too much rand alвђthor enaila gripped a short spear in one hand and her buckler and three more spears in the other yet she sounded as if she were shaking a finger at him the ashaвђman frowned at her your trouble is you do not think at all some of the other maidens laughed softly but she was not making a joke shorter than any other maiden there by at least a hand she had hair as fiery as her temper and an odd view of her relationship to him her flaxenhaired friend somara who stood head and shoulders taller nodded agreement she held the same peculiar view he ignored the comment but could not stop a sigh somara and enaila were the worst yet none of the maidens could decide whether he was the carвђaвђcarn to be obeyed or the only child of a maiden ever known to the maidens to be cared for as a brother bullied as a son for a few even jalani there not many years from playing with dolls seemed to think he was her younger brother while corana graying and nearly as leatherfaced as sulin treated him like an older at least they only did that around themselves not often where other aiel could hear when it counted he would be the carвђaвђcarn and he owed it to them they died for him he owed them whatever they wanted i donвђt intend to spend all night here while you lot play kiss the daisies he said sulin gave him one of those looks вђ in dresses or in cadinвђsor women tossed those looks about like farmers scattering seed вђ but the ashaвђman abandoned staring at the maidens and slung the straps of their scrips over their shoulders push them hard he had told taim make them weapons and taim had delivered a good weapon moved as the man who held it directed if only he could be sure it would not turn in his hand he had three destinations tonight but one of those the maidens could not be allowed to know no one but himself which of the other two came first he had decided earlier yet he hesitated the journey would be known soon enough yet there were reasons to keep it secret as he could when the gateway opened there in the middle of the room a sweetish smell familiar to any farmer drifted through horse dung wrinkling her nose as she veiled sulin led half the maidens through at a trot after a glance to him the ashaвђman followed drawing deeply on the true source as they went as much as they could hold because of that he could feel their strength as they passed him without that it took some effort to tell a man could channel longer still unless he cooperated none were near as strong as he not yet anyway there was no saying how strong a man would be until he stopped growing stronger fedwin stood highest of the three but he had what taim called a bar fedwin did not really believe he could affect anything at a distance with the power the result was that at fifty paces his ability began to fade and at a hundred he could not weave even a thread of saidin men gained strength faster than women it seemed and a good thing these three were all strong enough to make a gateway of useful size if just barely in jonanвђs case every ashaвђman was that he had kept kill them before it is too late before they go mad lews therin whispered kill them hunt down sammael and demandred and all the forsaken i have to kill them all before it is too latea moment of struggle as he attempted to wrest the power away from rand and failed he seemed to try that more often of late or to seize saidinon his own the second was a bigger danger than the first rand doubted that lews therin could take the true source away once rand held it he was not certain he could take it from lews therin either if the other reached it first what about merand thought again it was nearly a snarl and no less vicious for falling short wrapped in the power as he was anger spiderwebbed across the outside of the void a fiery lace i can channel too madness waits for me but it already has you you killed yourself kinslayer after you murdered your wife and your children and the light alone knows how many others i wonвђt kill where i donвђt have to do you hear me kinslayersilence answered he drew a deep uneven breath that web of fire flickered lightning in the distance he had never spoken to the man вђ it was the man not just a voice a man entire with memories вђ never spoken to him like that before perhaps it might drive lews therin away for good half the manвђs mad rantings were tears over his dead wife did he want to drive lews therin away his only friend in that chest he had promised sulin to count to one hundred before following but he did it by fives then stepped more than a hundred and fifty leagues to caemlyn night had closed down on the royal palace of andor moonshadows cloaking delicate spires and golden domes but a gentle breeze did nothing to break the heat the moon hung above still almost full giving some light veiled maidens scurried around the wagons lined up behind the largest of the palace stables the odor of the stable muck the wagons hauled away every day had long since soaked into the wood the ashaвђman had hands to their faces eben actually pinching his nose shut the carвђaвђcarncounts quickly sulin muttered but she lowered her veil there would be no surprises here no one would stay near those wagons who did not have to rand let the gateway close as soon as the remaining maidens came through right behind him and as it winked out of existence lews therin whispered she is gone almost gone there was relief in his voice the bond of warder and aes sedai had not existed in the age of legends alanna was not really gone no more than she had been any time since bonding rand against his will but her presence had lessened and it was the lessening that made rand truly aware you could become used to anything begin taking it for granted near to her he walked around with her emotions nestled in the back of his head her physical condition as well if he thought about it and he knew exactly where she was as well as he knew his own his handвђs place but just as with his hand unless he thought about it it just was only distance had any effect but he could still feelthat she was somewhere east of him he wanted to be aware of her should lews therin fall silent and all the memories of the chest somehow be wiped from his head he would still have the bond to remind him never trust aes sedai abruptly he realized that jonan and eben still held saidintoo release he said sharply вђ that was the command taim used вђ and he felt the power vanish from them good weapons so far kill them before itвђs too late lews therin murmured rand released the source deliberately and reluctantly he always hated letting go of the life the enhanced senses of the struggle inside though he was tense a jumper ready to leap ready to seize it once more he always was now i have to kill them lews therin whispered shoving the voice back rand sent one of the maidens nerilea a squarefaced woman into the palace and began pacing alongside the wagons thoughts spinning again faster than before he should not have come here he should have sent fedwin with a letter spinning elayne aviendha perrin faile annoura berelain mat light he should not have come elayne and aviendha annoura and berelain faile and perrin and mat flashes of color quick motion just out of sight a madman muttering angrily in the distance slowly he became aware of the maidens talking among themselves about the smell implying that it came from the ashaвђman they wanted to be heard or they would have been using handtalk there was moonlight enough for that moonlight enough to see the color in ebenвђs face too and how fedwinвђs jaw was set maybe they were not boys any longer not since dumaiвђs wells certainly but they were still only fifteen or sixteen jonanвђs eyebrows had drawn down so far they seemed to be sitting on his cheeks at least nobody had seized saidinagain yet he started to step over to the three men then raised his voice instead let them all hear if i can put up with foolishness from maidens so can you if anything the color in ebenвђs face deepened jonan grunted all three saluted rand with fist to chest then they turned to one another jonan said something in a low voice glancing at the maidens and fedwin and eben laughed the first time they saw maidens they had stumbled between wanting to goggle at these exotic creatures they had only read about and wanting to run before the murderous aiel of the stories killed them nothing much frightened them anymore they needed to relearn fear the maidens stared at rand and began talking with their hands sometimes laughing softly wary of the ashaвђman they might be yet maidens being maidens вђ aiel being aiel вђ risk only made taunts more fun somara murmured aloud about aviendha settling him down which earned firm nods of approval nobodyвђs life was ever this tangled in the stories as soon as nerilea returned saying that she had found davram bashere and bael the clan chief leading the aiel here in caemlyn rand took off his sword belt and so did fedwin jalani produced a large leather bag for the swords and the dragon scepter holding it as if the swords were poisonous snakes or perhaps long dead and rotten though in truth she would not have held it so gingerly in either case putting on a hooded cloak that corana handed him rand held his wrists together behind his back and sulin bound them with a cord tightly muttering to herself this is nonsense even wetlanders would call it nonsense he tried not to wince she was strong and using every ounce of it you have run away from us too often rand alвђthor you have no care for yourself she considered him a brother of an age with herself but irresponsible at times far dareis maicarries your honor and you have no care fedwin glowered while his own wrists were tied though the maiden binding him hardly put out much effort watching jonan and eben frowned deeply they disliked this plan as much as sulin did and understood it as little the dragon reborn did not have to explain himself and the carвђaвђcarnseldom did no one said anything though a weapon did not complain when sulin stepped around in front of rand she took one look at his face and her breath caught they did this to you she said softly and reached for her heavybladed belt knife a foot or more of steel it was almost a shortsword though none but a fool would say that to an aiel pull up the hood rand told her roughly the whole point of this is that no one recognize me before i reach bael and bashere she hesitated peering into his eyes i said pull it up he growled sulin could kill most men with her bare hands but her fingers were gentle settling the hood around his face with a laugh jalani snatched the hood down over his eyes now you can be sure no one will know you rand alвђthor you must trust us to guide your feet several maidens laughed stiffening he barely stopped short of seizing saidin barely lews therin snarled and gibbered rand forced himself to breathe normally it was not total darkness he could see moonlight below the edge of the hood even so he stumbled when sulin and enaila took his arms and led him forward i thought you were old enough to walk better than that enaila murmured in mock surprise sulinвђs hand moved it took him a moment to realize she was stroking his arm all he could see was what lay just before him the moonlit flagstones of the stableyard then stone steps floors of marble by lamplight sometimes with a long runner of carpet he strained his eyes at the movement of shadows felt for the telltale presence of saidin or worse the prickling that announced a woman holding saidar blind like this he might not know he was under attack until too late he could hear the whisper of a few servantsвђ feet as they hurried on nighttime chores but no one challenged five maidens apparently escorting two hooded prisoners with bael and bashere living in the palace and policing caemlyn with their men doubtless stranger sights had been seen in these corridors it was like walking a maze but then he had been in one maze or another since leaving emondвђs field even when he had thought that he walked a clear path would i know a clear path if i saw onehe wondered or have i been at this so long iвђd think it was a trap there are no clear paths only pitfalls and tripwires and darkness lews therinвђs snarl sounded sweaty desperate the way rand felt when sulin finally led them into a room and shut the door rand tossed his head violently to throw back the hood вђ and stared bael and davram he had expected but not davramвђs wife deira nor melaine nor dorindha i see you carвђaвђcarn bael the tallest man rand had ever seen sat crosslegged on the greenandwhite floor tiles in his cadinвђsor an air about him even at ease that said he was ready to move in a heartbeat the clan chief of the goshien aiel was not young вђ no clan chief was вђ and there was gray in his dark reddish hair but anyone who thought him soft with age was in for a sad surprise may you always find water and shade i stand with the carвђaвђcarn and my spears stand with me water and shade may be all very well davram bashere said hooking a leg over the gilded arm of his chair but myself i would settle for chilled wine little taller than enaila he had his short blue coat undone and sweat glistened on his dark face despite his apparent indolence he looked even harder than bael with his fierce tilted eyes and his eagleвђs beak of a nose above thick graystreaked mustaches i offer congratulations on your escape and your victory but why do you come disguised as a prisoner i prefer to know whether he is bringing aes sedai down on us deira put in a large woman gowned in goldworked green silk faileвђs mother stood as tall as any maiden there except somara long black hair slashed with white at the temples her nose only a little less bold than her husbandвђs truth she could give him lessons in looking fierce and she was very like her daughter in one respect her loyalty was to her husband not rand youвђve taken aes sedai prisoner are we now to expect the entire white tower to descend upon our heads if they do melaine said sharply adjusting her shawl they will be dealt with as they deserve sunhaired greeneyed and beautiful no more than a handful of years older than rand by her face she was a wise one and married to bael whatever had caused the wise ones to change their view of aes sedai melaine amys and bair had changed the most what i wish to know the third woman said is what you will do about colavaere saighan while deira and melaine had presence great presence dorindha outshone both though it was difficult to see how exactly the roofmistress of smoke springs hold was a solid motherly woman much nearer handsome than pretty with creases at the corners of her blue eyes and as much white in her pale red hair as bael had gray yet of the three women any eye with a brain behind it would have said she held sway melaine says that bair considers colavaere saighan of little importance dorindha went on but wise ones can be as blind as any man when it comes to seeing the battle ahead and missing the scorpion underfoot a smile for melaine robbed the words of their sting melaineвђs answering smile certainly said she took none a roofmistressвђs work is finding those scorpions before anyone is stung she also was baelвђs wife a fact that still disconcerted rand for all it had been her choice and melaineвђs perhaps partly becauseit had been theirs among aiel a man had little say if his wife chose a sisterwife it was not a common arrangement even among them colavaere has taken up farming rand growled they blinked at him wondering whether that was a joke the sun throne is empty again and waiting for elayne he had considered weaving a ward against listeners but a ward could be detected by anyone searching man or woman and its presence would announce that something interesting was being said well everything said here would be known from the dragonwall to the sea soon enough fedwin was already rubbing his wrists while jalani sheathed her knife no one looked at them twice all eyes were on rand frowning at nerilea he waggled his bound hands until sulin sliced the cords i didnвђt realize this was to be a family gathering nerilea looked a trifle abashed maybe but no one else did after you marry davram murmured with a smile you will learn you must choose very carefully what to keep from your wife deira glanced down at him pursing her lips wives are a great comfort bael laughed if a man does not tell them too much smiling dorindha ran her fingers into his hair вђ and gripped for a moment as though she meant to tug his head off bael grunted but not for dorindhaвђs fingers alone melaine wiped her small belt knife on her heavy skirt and sheathed it the two women grinned at one another over his head while he rubbed at his shoulder where a small spot of blood stained his cadinвђsor deira nodded thoughtfully it seemed she had just gotten an idea what woman could i hate enough to marry her to the dragon reborn rand said coldly that caused a silence solid enough to touch he tried to take rein on his anger he should have expected this melaine was not just a wise one she was a dreamwalker as were amys and bair among other things they could talk to one another in their dreams and to others a useful skill though they had only used it for him once it was wise onesвђ business no wonder at all that melaine was abreast of everything that had happened no wonder that she told dorindha everything wise onesвђ business or no the two women were best friends and sisters rolled into one once melaine let bael know of the kidnapping of course he had told bashere expecting bashere to keep that from his wife was like expecting him to keep it secret that their house was on fire inch by inch he drew the anger in forced it down has elayne arrived he tried to make his voice casual and missed no matter there were reasons everyone knew for him to be anxious andor might not be as unquiet as cairhien but elayne on the throne was the fastest way to settle both lands maybe the only way not yet bashere shrugged but tales have come north of aes sedai with an army somewhere in murandy or maybe altara that could be young mat and his band of the red hand with the daughterheir and the sisters who fled the tower when siuan sanche was deposed rand rubbed his wrists where the cords had chafed all that captive rigmarole had been on the chance elayne was here already elayne and aviendha so he could come and go without them learning of it till he was gone maybe he would have found a way to peek at them maybe he was a fool and no maybe about that do you mean those sisters to swear oath to you too deiraвђs tone was icy as her face she did not like him as she saw it her husband had set off down a road that likely would end with his head on a pike over a gate in tar valon and rand had put his feet on that road the white tower will not hold still for your coercing aes sedai rand made her a small bow and burn her if she took it for mocking deira ni ghaline tвђbashere never gave him a title never even used his name she could as well have been talking to a footman and not a very intelligent or trustworthy one should they choose to swear iвђll accept their oaths i doubt many are exactly eager to return to tar valon if they choose otherwise they can go their own way so long as they donвђt put themselves against me the white tower has put itself against you bael said leaning forward with his fists on his knees his blue eyes made deiraвђs voice seem warm an enemy who comes once will come again unless they are stopped my spears will follow wherever the carвђaвђcarnleads melaine nodded of course she very likely wanted every last aes sedai shielded and kneeling under guard if not bound hand and foot but dorindha nodded as well and sulin and bashere knuckled his mustaches thoughtfully rand did not know whether to laugh or weep donвђt you think iвђve enough on my plate without a war against the white tower elaida grabbed my throat and was slapped down the ground erupting in fire and torn flesh ravens and vultures gorging how many dead slapped down if she has sense enough to stop there i will too so long as they did not ask him to trust the chest he was shaking his head halfaware of lews therin suddenly moaning about the dark and the thirst he could ignore he had to ignore but not forget or trust leaving bael and bashere arguing over whether elaida did have sense enough to stop now that she had begun he moved to a mapcovered table against the wall beneath a tapestry of some battle where the white lion of andor stood prominent apparently bael and bashere used this room for their planning a little rooting around found the map he needed a large roll displaying all of andor from the mountains of mist to the river erinin and parts of the lands to the south as well ghealdan and altara and murandy the women held captive in the treekillersвђ lands are allowed to cause no trouble so why should any others melaine said apparently in answer to something he had not heard she sounded angry we will do what we must deira tвђbashere dorindha said calmly she was seldom anything but hold to your courage and we will arrive where we must go when you leap from a cliff deira replied it is too late for anything but holding to your courage and hoping thereвђs a haywain at the bottom to land in her husband chuckled as though she was making a joke she did not sound it spreading the map out and weighting the corners with ink jars and sand bottles rand measured off distances with his fingers mat was not moving very fast if rumor placed him in altara or murandy he took pride in how fast the band could march maybe the aes sedai were slowing him with servants and wagons maybe there were more sisters than he had thought rand realized his hands were clenched into fists and made them straighten he needed elayne to take the throne here and in cairhien that was why he needed her just that aviendha he did not need her not at all and she had made it clear she had no need for him she was safe away from him he could keep them both safe by keeping them as far from him as possible light if he could only look at them he needed mat though with perrin being stubborn he was not sure how mat had suddenly become expert on everything to do with battle but even bashere respected matвђs opinions about war anyway they treated him as daвђtsang sulin growled and some of the other maidens growled wordlessly in echo we know melaine said grimly they have no honor will he truly hold back after what you describe deira demanded in disbelieving tones the map did not extend far enough south to show illian вђ no map on the table showed any part of that country вђ but randвђs hand drifted down across murandy and he could imagine the doirlon hills not far inside illianвђs borders with a line of hillforts no invading army could afford to ignore and some two hundred and fifty miles to the east across the plains of maredo an army such as had not been seen since the nations gathered before tar valon in the aiel war maybe not since artur hawkwingвђs day tairen cairhienin aiel all poised to smash into illian if perrin would not lead then mat must only there was not enough time there was never enough time burn my eyes davram muttered you never mentioned that melaine lady caraline and lord toram camped right outside the city and high lord darlin as well they didnвђt come together by chance now right at this time they did not thatвђs a pit of vipers to have on your doorstep whoever you are let the algaiвђdвђsiswaidance bael replied dead vipers bite no one sammael had always been at his best defending that was lews therinвђs memory from the war of the shadow with two men inside one skull maybe it was to be expected that memories would drift between them had lews therin suddenly found himself recalling herding sheep or cutting firewood or feeding the chickens rand could hear him faintly raging to kill to destroy thoughts of the forsaken almost always drove lews therin over the brink deira tвђbashere speaks truly bael said we must stay on the path we have begun until our enemies are destroyed or we are that was not how i meant it deira said dryly but you are right we have no choice now until our enemies are destroyed or we are death destruction and madness floated in randвђs head as he studied the map sammael would be at those forts soon after the army struck sammael with the strength of a forsaken and the knowledge of the age of legends lord brend he called himself one of the council of nine and lord brend they called him who refused to admit the forsaken were loose but rand knew him with lews therinвђs memory he knew sammaelвђs face knew him to the bone what does dyelin taravin intend with naean arawn and elenia sarand dorindha asked i confess i do not understand this shutting people away what she does there is hardly important davram said it is her meetings with those aes sedai that concern me dyelin taravin is a fool melaine muttered she believes the rumors about the carвђaвђcarnkneeling to the amyrlin seat she will not brush her hair unless those aes sedai give her permission you mistake her deira said firmly dyelin is strong enough to rule andor she proved that at aringill of course she listens to the aes sedai вђ only a fool ignores aes sedai вђ but to listen is not to obey the wagons that had been brought from dumaiвђs wells would have to be searched again the fatlittleman angrealhad to be there somewhere none of the sisters who escaped could have had a clue what it was unless perhaps one had stuck a souvenir of the dragon reborn in her pouch no it had to be in the wagons somewhere with that he was more than a match for any of the forsaken without it death destruction and madness suddenly what he had been hearing rushed forward what was that he demanded turning from the ivoryinlaid table surprised faces turned toward him jonan straightened from where he had been slouching against the doorframe the maidens squatting easily on their heels suddenly appeared alert they had been talking idly among themselves even they were wary around him now fingering one of her ivory necklaces melaine shared a decided look between bael and davram then spoke before anyone else there are nine aes sedai at an inn called the silver swan in what davram bashere calls the new city she said the word inn in an odd way and city as well she had only known them from books before coming across the dragonwall he and bael say we must leave them alone unless they do something against you i think you have learned about waiting for aes sedai rand alвђthor my fault bashere sighed if fault there is though what melaine expects to do i canвђt say eight sisters stopped at the silver swan almost a month ago just after you left now and then a few more come or go but there are never more than ten at one time they keep to themselves cause no trouble and ask no questions that bael or i can learn a few red sisters have come into the city as well twice those at the silver swan all have warders but these never do iвђm sure they are reds two or three appear ask after men heading for the black tower and after a day or so they leave without learning much iвђd say that black tower is as good as a fortress for holding in secrets none of them has made trouble and i would rather not trouble them until i know it is necessary i didnвђt mean that rand said slowly he sat down in a chair opposite bashere gripping the carved arms till his knuckles hurt aes sedai gathering here aes sedai gathering in cairhien happenstance lews therin rumbled like thunder on the horizon about death and betrayal he would have to warn taim not about the aes sedai at the silver swan вђ taim certainly knew already why had he not mentioned it вђ about staying away from them keeping the ashaвђman away if dumaiвђs wells was to be an end there could be no new beginnings here too many things seemed to be spinning out of control the harder he tried to gather them all in the more there were and the faster they spun sooner or later everything was going to fall and shatter the thought dried his throat thom merrilin had taught him to juggle a little but he had never been very good now he had to be very good indeed he wished he had something to wet his throat he did not realize he had spoken that last aloud until jalani straightened from her crouch and strutted across the room to where a tall silver pitcher stood on a small table filling a hammered silver goblet she brought it back to rand with a smile her mouth opening as she proffered it he expected something rude but a change came over her face all she said was carвђaвђcarn then went back to her place with the other maidens so dignified it seemed she was imitating dorindha or maybe deira somara gestured in handtalk and suddenly every maiden was redfaced and biting her lips to keep from laughing every maiden but jalani who was just redfaced the wine punch tasted of plums rand could remember fat sweet plums from the orchards across the river when he was young climbing the trees to pick them himself tilting his head back he drained the goblet there were plum trees in the two rivers but no orchards of them and certainly not across any river keep your bloody memories to yourself he snarled at lews therin the man in his head laughed at something giggling quietly to himself bashere frowned at the maidens then glanced at bael and his wives all impassive as stone and shook his head he got on well with bael but aiel in general mystified him since no one is bringing me any drink he said rising and went to pour his own he took a long swallow that wet his heavy mustaches now thatвђs cooling taimвђs way of enrolling men seems to sweep up every fellow whoвђd like to follow the dragon reborn he has delivered a goodly army to me men who lack whatever it is your ashaвђman need they all talk wideeyed about walking though holes in the air but none has been anywhere near the black tower iвђm trying out a few thoughts young mat had rand waved that away with the empty goblet tell me about dyelin dyelin of house taravin would be next in line for the throne should anything happen to elayne but he had told her he was having elayne brought to caemlyn if she thinks she can take the lion throne i can find a farm for her too take the throne deira said incredulously and her husband laughed out loud i have no understanding of wetlander ways bael said but i do not think that is what she has done far from it davram carried the pitcher over to pour more punch for rand some lesser lords and ladies who thought to curry favor proclaimed for her at aringill she moves quickly lady dyelin within four days she had the two leaders hanged for treason to the daughterheir elayne and ordered another twenty flogged he chuckled approvingly his wife sniffed likely she would have had the road lined with gibbets all the way from aringill to caemlyn then what was that about her ruling andor rand demanded and imprisoning elenia and naean they are the ones who tried to claim the throne deira said dark eyes sparkling angrily bashere nodded he was much calmer only three days ago when word arrived of colavaereвђs coronation and the rumors from cairhien that you had gone to tar valon began to sound more real with trade beginning again there are so many pigeons in the air between cairhien and caemlyn you could walk on their backs putting the pitcher back he returned to his chair naean proclaimed for the lion throne in the morning elenia before midday and by sunset dyelin pelivar and luan had arrested them both they announced dyelin as regent the next morning in elayneвђs name until elayne returns most of the houses of andor have declared support for dyelin i think some would like her to take the throne herself but aringill keeps even the most powerful careful of their tongues closing one eye bashere pointed at rand you they do not mention at all whether that is good or bad it will take a wiser head than mine to say deira offered a cool smile looking down that nose of hers those lickspittles you allowed to make free of the palace have all fled the city it seems fled andor some of them according to rumor you should know they were all behind either elenia or naean rand carefully set his full goblet on the floor beside his chair he had only let lir and arymilla and the rest remain in order to try pushing dyelin and those who supported her into cooperation with him they would never have left andor to the likes of lord lir with time and elayneвђs return it might yet work but everything was whirling faster and faster whirling away from his fingers there were a few things he could control though fedwin there is an ashaвђman he said he can bring messages to me in cairhien if thereвђs need that with a glare for melaine who returned the blandest sort of look deira studied fedwin as she might a dead rat some overeager dog had dropped on her rug davram and bael were more considering fedwin tried to stand straighter under their gaze donвђt let anyone know who he is rand went on no one thatвђs why he isnвђt wearing black i am taking two more to lord semaradrid and high lord weiramon tonight theyвђll have need when they face sammael in the doirlon hills i will be busy chewing on cairhien for a while yet it seems and maybe andor too does this mean you will send the spears forward at last bael said you give the orders tonight rand nodded and bashere gave a great hoot of laughter now that calls for a good wine or it would if it wasnвђt hot enough to make a manвђs blood thick as porridge laughter slid into a grimace burn me but i wish i could be there still i suppose holding caemlyn for the dragon reborn is no small thing you always want to be where the swords are bared my husband deira sounded quite fond the fifth bael said you will allow the fifth in illian when sammael has fallen aiel custom allowed taking the fifth part of all that was in a place taken by force of arms rand had forbidden it here in caemlyn he would not give elayne a city looted even that much they will have the fifth rand said but it was not of sammael or illian that he thought bring elayne quickly mat it ran wild in his head across lews therinвђs cackling bring her quickly before andor and cairhien both erupt in my face chapter snakey square the figurehead we must stop here tomorrow egwene shifted carefully on her folding chair it had a tendency to fold on its own sometimes lord bryne says the army is running short of food our camp is certainly short of everything two stubby tallow candles burned on the wooden table in front of her that folded too for easy packing but it was sturdier than the chair the candles in the tent that served as her study were supplemented by an oil lantern hanging from the centerpole up near the peak the dim yellow light flickered making faint shadows dance on patched canvas walls that were a far cry from the grandeur of the amyrlinвђs study in the white tower but that did not upset her truth be known she herself was some considerable distance short of the grandeur normally associated with the amyrlin seat she knew very well that the sevenstriped stole on her shoulders was the only reason any stranger would believe her amyrlin if they did not think it an extremely foolish joke odd things had happened in the white towerвђs history вђ siuan had told her secret details of some of them вђ yet surely nothing so odd as her four or five days would be better sheriam mused studying the sheaf of papers in her lap slightly plump with high cheekbones and tilted green eyes in her dark green riding dress she managed to look elegant and commanding despite her perch on one of the two precarious stools in front of the table exchange her narrow blue stole of the keeper of the chronicles for the amyrlinвђs and anyone would think she wore it by right sometimes she certainly seemed to believe the striped stole rested on her own shoulders or perhaps longer it would not hurt to build our stores up once more siuan atop the other rickety stool shook her head slightly but egwene did not need the hint one day she might be just eighteen and well short of a true amyrlinвђs grandeur but she was no fool too many of the sisters seized on any excuse for a halt вђ too many of the sitters as well вђ and if they stopped too long it might be impossible to start them moving again sheriam opened her mouth one daughter egwene said firmly whatever sheriam thought the fact was that sheriam bayanar was the keeper and egwene alвђvere the amyrlin if only sheriam could be brought to realize that and the hall of the tower they were worse she wanted to snarl or snap or maybe throw something but after close to a month and half she already had a lifetimeвђs practice in keeping her face and voice smooth at far greater provocation than this any longer and weвђll begin to strip the countryside bare i wonвђt leave people to starve on the practical side if we take too much from them even paid for theyвђll give us a hundred problems in return raids on the herds and flocks and thieves at the storewagons siuan murmured studying her divided gray skirts not looking at anyone she seemed to be thinking aloud men shooting at our guards at night maybe setting fire to whatever they can reach a bad business hungry people become desperate in a hurry those were the same reasons lord bryne had given egwene in very nearly the same words the fieryhaired woman shot siuan a hard look many sisters had a difficult time with siuan her face was probably the best known in the camp young enough to have looked proper above an acceptedвђs dress or a noviceвђs for that matter that was a side effect of being stilled though not many had known it siuan could hardly walk a step without sisters staring at her the once amyrlin seat deposed and cut off from saidar then healed and restored to at least some ability when everyone knew that was impossible many welcomed her back warmly as a sister once more for herself and for the miracle that held out hope against what every aes sedai feared beyond death but just as many or more offered lukewarm toleration or condescension or both blaming her for their present situation sheriam was one of those who thought siuan should instruct the new young amyrlin in protocol and the like which everyone believed she hated and keep her mouth closed unless she was called upon she was less than she had been no longer amyrlin and no longer anywhere near so strong in the power it was not cruelty as aes sedai saw it the past was past what was now was and must be accepted anything else only brought greater pain by and large aes sedai admitted change slowly but once they did for most it was as if things had always been that way one day mother as you say sheriam sighed at last bowing her head slightly less in submission egwene was sure than to hide a grimace over her stubbornness she would accept the grimace if the acquiescence came with it for the time being she had to siuan bowed her head too to hide a smile any sister might be appointed to any post but the social pecking order was quite rigid and siuan stood a long way further down than she had that was one reason the papers on sheriamвђs lap were duplicated on siuanвђs and on the table in front of egwene reports on everything from the number of candles and sacks of beans remaining in the camp to the state of the horses and the same for lord bryneвђs army the armyвђs camp encircled the aes sedaiвђs with a ring perhaps twenty steps wide between but in many ways they might as well have been a mile apart surprisingly lord bryne insisted on that as much as the sisters the aes sedai did not want soldiers wandering among their tents a lot of unwashed illiterate ruffians with light fingers often as not and it seemed the soldiers did not want aes sedai wandering among them either вђ though perhaps wisely they held their reasons close they marched toward tar valon to pull down a usurper to the amyrlin seat and raise egwene in her place yet few men were truly comfortable around aes sedai few enough women either as keeper sheriam would have been all too happy to take these minor matters out of egweneвђs hands she had said as much explaining how minor they were how the amyrlin seat should not be burdened with daytoday trifles siuan on the other hand said a good amyrlin paid attention to just those not trying to duplicate the work of dozens of sisters and clerks yet checking on something different every day that way she had a good idea of what was happening and what needed doing before someone came running to her with a crisis already breaking into shards a feel for how the wind was blowing siuan called it making sure these reports reached her had required weeks and egwene was sure that once she let them pass to sheriamвђs control she would never again learn anything until it was long dealt with if then a silence stretched as they began reading the next paper in each stack they were not alone chesa seated on cushions to one side of the tent spoke too little light is bad for the eyes she murmured almost to herself holding up one of egweneвђs silk stockings that she was darning youвђll never catch me ruining my eyes over words in this little light just short of stout with a twinkle in her eyes and a merry smile egweneвђs maid was always trying to slip advice to the amyrlin as though talking about herself she could have been in egweneвђs service twenty years instead of less than two months and three times as old as egwene instead of barely twice tonight egwene suspected that she talked to fill silences there was a tension in the camp since logain had escaped a man who could channel shielded and under close guard yet he had slipped away like fog everyone walked on edge wondering how wondering where he was what he intended to do now egwene wished harder than most that she could be sure she knew where logain ablar was giving her papers a firm snap of her wrists sheriam frowned at chesa she did not understand why egwene let her maid be present at these meetings much less let her chatter away freely it probably never occurred to her that chesaвђs presence and her unexpected chatter frequently unsettled her just enough to help egwene sidestep advice she did not want to take and postpone decisions she did not want to make at least not the way sheriam wanted them made certainly the notion had never occurred to chesa she smiled apologetically and returned to her darning occasionally murmuring to herself if we continue mother sheriam said coolly we may finish before dawn staring at the next page egwene rubbed her temples chesa might be right about the light she had another headache coming on then again it might be the page detailing what money was left the stories she had read never mentioned how much coin was required to keep an army pinned to the sheet were notes from two of the sitters romanda and lelaine suggesting the soldiers be paid less frequently paid less in fact more than suggesting really just as romanda and lelaine were more than simply two sitters in the hall other sitters followed where they led if not all by any means while the only sitter egwene could count on was delana and her not far it was rare that lelaine and romanda agreed on anything and they could hardly have chosen a worse some of the soldiers had sworn oaths yet most were there for their pay and maybe the hope of loot the soldiers are to be paid as before egwene muttered crumpling the two notes she was not going to let her army melt away any more than she would allow looting as you command mother sheriamвђs eyes sparkled with pleasure the difficulties must be clear to her вђ anyone who thought her less than very intelligent was in deep trouble вђ but she did have a blind spot if romanda or lelaine said the sun was coming up sheriam most likely would claim it was going down she had had almost as much sway with the hall as they did now perhaps more until they put a halt to it between them the opposite was true as well those two would speak against anything sheriam wanted before they stopped to think which had its uses all in all egweneвђs fingers tapped on the tabletop but she made them stop the money had to be found вђ somewhere somehow вђ but she did not have to let sheriam see her worry that new woman will work out chesa murmured over her sewing tairens always carry their noses high of course but selame does know whatвђs required of a ladyвђs maid meri and i will settle her down soon enough sheriam rolled her eyes irritably egwene smiled to herself egwene alвђvere with three maids waiting on her as unbelievable as the stole itself but the smile lasted only a heartbeat maids had to be paid too a tiny sum balanced against thirty thousand soldiers and the amyrlin could hardly do her own laundry or mend her own shifts but she could have managed splendidly with chesa alone and would have had she any choice in it less than a week earlier romanda had decided that the amyrlin needed another servant and found meri among the refugees who huddled in every village until they were chased away and not to be outdone lelaine produced selame from the same source the two women were crowded into chesaвђs small tent before egwene knew either existed the principle of the thing was wrong threemaids when there was not enough silver to pay the army halfway to tar valon servants chosen for her without any say and then there was the fact that she had yet another if one who received not a copper everyone believed marigan was the amyrlinвђs maidservant anyway beneath the edge of the table she felt her belt pouch felt the bracelet inside she should wear it more it was a duty keeping her hands low she dug the bracelet out and slipped it around her wrist a band of silver made so the catch was invisible once closed made with the one power the bracelet snapped shut beneath the table and she very nearly snatched it off again emotion flooded into a corner of her mind emotion and awareness a little pocket as if she were imagining it not imagination though all too real half of an aвђdam the bracelet created a link between her and the woman who wore the other half a silver necklace the wearer could not remove herself they were a circle of two without embracing saidar egwene always leading by virtue of the bracelet marigan was asleep now her feet sore from walking all day and days past but even sleeping fear oozed though most strongly only hate ever came near fear in the stream that flowed through the aвђdam egweneвђs reluctance came from the constant gnawing of the other womanвђs terror from having worn the necklace end of an aвђdamonce and from knowing the woman on the far end she hated sharing any part of her only three women in the camp knew that moghedien was a prisoner hidden in the midst of aes sedai if it came out moghedien would be tried stilled and executed in short order if it came out egwene might not be far behind her and siuan and leane as well they were the other two who knew at best she would have the stole stripped away for hiding one of the forsaken from justice she thought grimly iвђll be lucky if they just stick me back with the accepted unconsciously she thumbed the golden great serpent ring on the first finger of her right hand then again however just such a punishment might be it was unlikely she had been taught that the wisest of the sisters was chosen amyrlin seat yet she had learned better the choosing of an amyrlin was as hotly contested as electing a mayor in the two rivers and maybe more no one bothered to stand against her father in emondвђs field but she had heard about elections in deven ride and taren ferry siuan had only been raised amyrlin because the three before her each had died after just a few years on the amyrlin seat the hall had wanted someone young speaking of age to a sister was at least as rude as slapping her face yet she had begun to get some idea how long aes sedai lived rarely was anyone chosen sitter before she had worn the shawl seventy or eighty years at least and amyrlins generally longer often muchlonger so when the hall deadlocked between four sisters raised aes sedai less than fifty years before and seaine herimon of the white suggested a woman who had worn the shawl only tenyears it might have been as much exhaustion as siuanвђs qualifications in administration that brought the sitters to stand for her and egwene alвђvere who in many eyes should still have been a novice a figurehead easily directed a childwho had grown up in the same village with rand alвђthor that last definitely had its part in the decision they would not take back the stole but she would find the little authority she had managed to accumulate gone romanda lelaine and sheriam might actually come to blows over which would march her about by the scruff of her neck that looks much like a bracelet i saw elayne wearing the papers on sheriamвђs lap crackled as she leaned forward for a better look and nynaeve they shared it as i recall egwene gave a start she had been careless itвђs the same a remembrance gift when they left twisting the silver circlet around her wrist she felt a stab of guilt that was all her own the bracelet appeared segmented but so cunningly you could not see how exactly she had hardly thought of nynaeve and elayne since their departure for ebou dar perhaps she should call them back their search was not going well it seemed though they denied it still if they could find what they were after sheriam was frowning whether or not at the bracelet egwene could not say she could not allow sheriam to start thinking too much on that bracelet though if she ever noticed that the necklace marigan wore was a match there might be painfully awkward questions rising egwene smoothed her skirt as she moved around the table siuan had acquired several pieces of information today one could be put to good use now she was not the only one with secrets sheriam looked surprised when she stopped too close for the other woman to stand daughter iвђve learned that a few days after siuan and leane arrived in salidar ten sisters left two from each ajah there except the blue where did they go and why sheriamвђs eyes narrowed a fraction but she wore serenity as comfortably as her dress mother i can hardly recall every вђ no dancing around sheriam egwene moved a little closer until their knees almost touched no lies by omission the truth a frown creased sheriamвђs smooth forehead mother even if i knew you cannot trouble yourself with every little вђ the truth sheriam the whole truth must i ask before the entire hall why i cannot have the truth from my keeper i will have it daughter one way or another i willhave it sheriamвђs head swiveled as though she was looking for a way to escape her eyes fell on chesa hunched over her sewing and she all but gasped with relief mother tomorrow when we are alone i am sure i can explain everything to your satisfaction i must speak with a few of the sisters first so they could work up what sheriam was to tell her tomorrow chesa egwene said wait outside please for all that she seemed focused on her work to the exclusion of everything else chesa bounded to her feet in a flash and very nearly ran from the tent when aes sedai were at odds anyone with half a brain went elsewhere now daughter egwene said the truth all that you know this is as private as you will be she added when sheriam glanced at siuan for a moment sheriam adjusted her skirts plucking at them really avoiding egweneвђs eyes no doubt still working out evasions but the three oaths trapped her she could not speak an untrue word and whatever she thought of egweneвђs true position slipping behind her back was a long way from denying her authority to her face even romanda maintained the proper courtesies if only by a hair at times drawing a deep breath sheriam folded her hands in her lap and spoke to egweneвђs chest matteroffact when we learned the red ajah was responsible for setting logain up as a false dragon we felt something had to be done вђweвђ certainly meant the small coterie of sisters she had gathered around her carlinya and beonin and the rest held as much real sway as most sitters if not actually in the hall elaida was sending out demands for every sister to return to the tower so we chose ten sisters to do just that by the fastest means they could manage they all should be there long since quietly making sure that every sister in the tower understands the truth of what the reds did with logain not вђ she hesitated then finished in a rush not even the hall knows of them egwene stepped away rubbing her temples again quietly making sure in the hope that elaida would be deposed not exactly a bad scheme really it might even work eventually it might take years too but then for most sisters the longer they could go without truly doinganything the better with enough time they could convince the world that the white tower had never really broken it had been broken before even if only a handful knew it maybe with enough time they could find a way to adjust everything so it had not really why keep it from the hall sheriam surely you donвђt think any of them would betray your plan to elaida half the sisters eyed the other half askance for fear of elaidaвђs sympathizers partly for fear of that mother a sister who decided that what we do is a mistake would hardly let herself be chosen a sitter any such would have taken herself away long since sheriam had not relaxed but her voice took on the patient instructing tone she seemed to think had the greatest effect on egwene usually though she was more adroit at changing the subject those suspicions are the worst problem we face for the time being no one really trusts anyone if we could only see how to вђ the black ajah siuan cut in quietly thatвђs what chills your blood like a silverpike up your skirts who can say for sure who is black and who can say what a black sister might do sheriam darted another hard look at siuan but after a moment the force went out of her or rather one sort of tension replaced another she glanced at egwene then nodded reluctantly by the sour twist to her mouth she would have made another evasion had it not been plain egwene would not stand for it most sisters in the camp believed now but after more than three thousand years denying the black ajahвђs existence it was a queasy belief almost no one would open her mouth on that topic no matter what they believed the question mother siuan went on is what happens when the hall does find out she seemed to be thinking aloud again i canвђt see any sitter accepting the excuse that she couldnвђt be told because she might be on elaidaвђs side and as for the possibility she might be black ajah yes i think they will be quite upset sheriamвђs face paled slightly it was a wonder she did not go dead white upset did not begin to cover it yes sheriam would face muchmore than upset if this came out now was the time to drive home her advantage but another question occurred to egwene if sheriam and her friends had sent вђ what were they not spies ferrets maybe sent into the walls after rats вђ if sheriam had sent ferrets into the white tower could a sudden stab of pain through that pocket of sensations in the back of her head sent everything else flying had she felt it directly it would have been numbing as it was her eyes bulged in shock a man who could channel was touching the necklace around moghedienвђs neck this was one link no man could be brought into pain and something unheard of from moghedien hope and then it was all gone the awareness the emotions the necklace was off i need some fresh air she managed sheriam started to rise and siuan but she waved them back down no i want to be alone she said hastily siuan find out everything sheriam knows about the ferrets light i mean the ten sisters they both stared at her but thank the light neither followed as she snatched the lantern from its hook and hurried out it would not do for the amyrlin to be seen running yet she came close hoisting her divided skirts as well as she could with her free hand and very nearly trotting a cloudless sky made the moonlight bright dappling the tents and wagons with shadows most people in the camp were asleep but low fires still burned here and there a handful of warders were about a few servants too many eyes to see if she ran the last thing she wanted was someone offering help she realized she was panting but from alarm not exertion thrusting her head and the lantern into mariganвђs tiny tent she found it empty the blankets that made up the pallet on the ground lay in a sprawl tossed aside by someone in a hurry and what if she had still been hereshe wondered with the necklace off and maybe whoever freed hershivering she withdrew slowly moghedien had good reason to dislike her very personally and the only sister who could match one of the forsaken alone when she could channel at all was in ebou dar moghedien could have killed egwene without anyone noticing even had a sister felt her channel there would be nothing remarkable in that worse moghedien might not have killed her and no one would have known anything until they found the pair of them gone mother chesa fussed behind her you should not be out in the night air night air is bad air if you wanted marigan i could have fetched her egwene very nearly jumped she had not been aware of chesa following her she studied the people at the nearest fires they had gathered for companionship not warmth in this unholy heat and they were not close but maybe someone had seen who went into mariganвђs tent she certainly had few visitors and no men among them a man might well have been remarked i think she has run away chesa why that wicked woman chesa exclaimed i always said she had a mean mouth and a sneaking eye slinking away like a thief after you took her in sheвђd be starving by a road if not for you no gratitude at all she followed all the way back to the tent where egwene slept nattering on about wickedness in general the thanklessness of marigan in particular and how that sort should be handled which seemed to jump between switching them till they settled down and tossing them out before they could run away tucked around cautions that egwene check her jewelry to be sure it was all still there egwene barely heard her mind spun it could not have been logain could it he could not have known about moghedien much less come back to rescue her could he those men rand was gathering those ashaвђman rumor in every village carried whispers of ashaвђman and the black tower most of the sisters tried to pretend they were unaffected by dozens of men who could channel gathering in one spot вђ the worst of the tales had to be inflated rumor always exaggerated вђ but egweneвђs toes wanted to curl under with fright whenever she thought of them an ashaвђman could have but why how would he have known any more than logain she was trying to avoid the only reasonable conclusion something far worse than logain come back or even ashaвђman one of the forsaken had freed moghedien rahvin was dead by randвђs hand according to nynaeve and he had killed ishamael as well or so it seemed and aginor and balthamel moiraine had killed beвђlal that left only asmodean demandred and sammael among the men sammael was in illian no one knew where the others were or any of the women who survived moiraine had done for lanfear too or they had done for each other but all the other women were still alive so far as anyone knew forget the women it had been a man which plans had been laid long since in case one of the forsaken struck at the camp no one sister here could equal any of the forsaken by herself but linked in circles was another matter and any forsaken who stepped into their camp would find circles forming on every side of him or her once they realized who she was the forsaken showed no signs of agelessness for some reason maybe it was some effect of being connected to the dark one they this was dithering she had to start thinking clearly chesa look like you need your head rubbed for the ache again is what is what you yes mother find siuan and leane tell them to come to me but donвђt let anyone hear you grinning chesa dropped a curtsy and scampered out she could hardly avoid knowing the currents that swirled around egwene yet she found all the plotting and scheming fun not that she knew more than surface and little enough of that egwene did not doubt her loyalty but chesaвђs opinion of what was exciting might change if she learned the depth of those swirls channeling the oil lamps inside the tent alight egwene blew out the lantern and set it carefully in a corner maybe she had to think clearly but she still felt as if she was stumbling in the dark chapter flame of tar valon a pair of silverpike egwene was sitting in her chair вђ one of the few real chairs in the camp with a little plain carving like a farmerвђs best armchair roomy and comfortable enough that she felt only a touch of guilt about taking up valuable wagon space for it вђ she was sitting there trying to pull her thoughts together when siuan swept aside the entry flaps and ducked into the tent siuan was not happy why in the light did you run off her voice had not changed with her face and she chided with the best even when she did it in respectful tones barely respectful her blue eyes remained the same too they could have done for a saddlemakerвђs awls sheriam brushed me aside like a fly that surprisingly delicate mouth twisted bitterly she was gone almost as soon as you were donвђt you realize she handed herself to you she certainly does her and anaiya and morvrin and the lot of them you can be sure theyвђll spend tonight trying to bail water and patch holes they could manage it i donвђt see how but they might almost as the last word left her mouth leane entered a tall willowy woman her coppery face was as youthful as siuanвђs and for the same reason she also was more than old enough to be egweneвђs mother in truth leane took one look at siuan and threw up her hands as much as the roof of the tent would allow mother this is a foolish risk her dark eyes went from dreamy to flashing but her voice had a languorous quality even when she was irritated once it had been brisk if anyone sees siuan and me together this way вђ i donвђt care if the whole camp learns your squabbling is a fraud egwene broke in sharply weaving a small barrier against eavesdropping around the three of them it could be worked through with time but not without detection so long as she held the weave instead of tying it off she did care and perhaps she should not have called them both but her first halfcoherent thought had been to summon the two sisters she could count on no one in the camp so much as suspected everyone knew the former amyrlin and her former keeper detested one another every bit as much as siuan detested being tutor to her successor should any sister uncover the truth they might well find themselves doing penance for a long time to come and not an easy one вђ aes sedai appreciated being made fools of even less than other people kingshad been made to pay for that вђ but in the meanwhile their supposed animosity resulted in a certain leverage with the other sisters including sitters if theyboth said the same thing it must be so another incidental effect of being stilled was very useful one no one else knew about the three oaths no longer held them they could lie like wool merchants now schemes and deceptions on every side the camp was like some fetid swamp where strange growths sprouted unseen in mists maybe anywhere aes sedai gathered was like that after three thousand years of plotting however necessary it was hardly surprising that scheming had become second nature to most sisters and only a breath away for the rest the truly horrible thing was that she found herself beginning to enjoy all the machinations not for their own sake but as puzzles though no twisted bits of iron could intrigue her a quarter so much what that said about her she did not want to know well she wasaes sedai whatever anyone thought and she had to take the bad of it with the good moghedien has escaped she went on without pause a man removed the aвђdamfrom her a man who can channel i think one of them took the necklace away it wasnвђt in her tent that i saw there might be some way to find it using the bracelet but if there is i donвђt know it that took the starch right out of them leaneвђs legs gave way and she dropped like a sack onto the stool chesa sometimes used siuan sat down on the cot slowly back very straight hands very still on her knees incongruously egwene noticed that her dress had tiny blue flowers embroidered in a wide tairen maze around the bottom a band that made the divided skirts seem one when she was still another band curved becomingly across the bodice concern for her clothes that they be pretty instead of just suitable was certainly a small change looking at it one way вђ she never took it to extremes вђ yet in another it was as drastic as her face and a puzzle siuan resented the changes and resisted them except for this one leane on the other hand in true aes sedai fashion embraced what had changed a young woman again вђ egwene had overheard a yellow exclaiming in wonder that both were prime childbearing age by everything she could find вђ she might never have been keeper never have had any other face the very image of practicality and efficiency became the ideal of an indolent and alluring domani woman even her riding dress was cut in the style of her native land and no matter that its silk so thin it barely seemed opaque was as impractical as the pale green color for traveling dusty roads told that having been stilled had broken all ties and associations leane had chosen the green ajah over a return to the blue changing ajahs was not done but then no one had been stilled and then healed before either siuan had gone right back into the blue grumbling over the idiotic need to entreat and appeal for acceptance as the formal phrase went oh light leane breathed as she thumped onto the stool with considerably less than her usual grace we should have turned her over for trial the first day nothing weвђve learned from her is worth letting her loose on the world again nothing it was a measure of her shock she did not normally go about stating the obvious her brain had not grown indolent whatever her outward demeanor languid and seductive domani women might be on the outside but they were still known as the sharpest traders anywhere blood and bloody вђ we should have had her watched siuan growled through her teeth egweneвђs eyebrows rose siuan must be as shaken as leane by who siuan faolain theodrin they donвђt even know you two are of my party a party five women and faolain and theodrin were hardly eager adherents especially faolain nynaeve and elayne could be counted too of course and birgitte certainly even if she was not aes sedai but they were a long way off stealth and cunning were still her major strengths plus the fact that no one expected them of her how should i have explained to anyonewhy they were supposed to watch my serving woman for that matter what good would it have done it had to be one of the forsaken do you really think faolain and theodrin together could have stopped him iвђm not sure icould have even linked with romanda and lelaine they were the next two strongest women in the camp as strong in the power as siuan used to be siuan visibly forced a scowl from her face but even so she snorted she often said that if she could no longer be amyrlin then she would teach egwene how to be the best amyrlin ever yet the transition from lion on a hill to mouse underfoot was difficult egwene allowed her no little latitude because of that i want the two of you to ask about among those near the tent moghedien was sleeping in someone must have seen the man he had to come afoot anybody opening a gateway inside a space that little risked cutting her in two however small he wove it siuan snorted louder than the first time why bother she growled do you mean to go chasing after like some fool hero in a gleemanвђs fool story and bring her back maybe tie up all the forsaken at one go win the last battle while youвђre at it even if we get a description head to toe nobody knows one forsaken from another nobody here anyway itвђs the most bloody useless barrel of fish guts i ever вђ siuan egwene said sharply sitting up straighten latitude was one thing but there were limits she did not put up with this even from romanda color bloomed slowly in siuanвђs cheeks struggling to master herself she kneaded her skirts and avoided egweneвђs eyes forgive me mother she said finally she almost sounded as if she meant it it has been a difficult day for her mother leane put in with an impish smile she was very good at those though she generally used them to set some manвђs heart racing not promiscuously of course she possessed discrimination and discretion in ample supply but then most are if she could only learn not to throw things at gareth bryne every time she gets angry вђ enough egwene snapped leane was only trying to take a little of the pressure from siuan but she was in no mood for it i want to know anything i can learn about whoever freed moghedien even if itвђs just whether he was short or tall any scrap that makes him less a shadow creeping in the dark if thatвђs not more than i have a right to ask leane sat quite still staring at the flowers in the carpet in front of her toes the redness spread to cover nearly siuanвђs whole face with her fair skin it made her look like a sunset i humbly beg your pardon mother this time she did sound penitent her difficulty meeting egweneвђs gaze was obvious sometimes itвђs hard to no no excuses i humbly beg pardon egwene fingered her stole letting the moment set itself as she looked at siuan without blinking that was something siuan herself had taught her but after a bit she shifted uneasily on the cot when you knew you were in the wrong silence pricked and the pricks drove home that you werewrong silence was a very useful tool in a number of situations since i canвђt recall what i should forgive she said at last quietly there seems to be no need but siuan donвђt let it happen again thank you mother a hint of wry laughter curled the corners of siuanвђs mouth if i may say so i seem to have taught you very well but if i may suggest she waited for egweneвђs impatient nod one of us should carry your order to faolain or theodrin to ask the questions very sulky at being made a messenger theyвђll occasion a deal less comment than leane or i everyone knows you are their patron egwene agreed immediately she still was not thinking clearly or she would have seen that for herself the headachy feeling was back again chesa claimed it came from too little sleep but sleeping was difficult when your head felt taut as a drumhead it would take a larger head than hers not to feel tight stuffed with as many worries as she had well at least now she could pass on the secrets that had kept moghedien hidden how to weave disguises with the power and how to mask your ability from other women who could channel revealing those had been too risky when they might have led to unmasking moghedien a bit more acclaim she thought wryly there had been great petting and exclaiming when she announced the oncelost secret of traveling which at least had been her own and more praise since for every one of the secrets she had wrenched out of moghedien like pulling a back tooth each time none of the acclaim made an ounce of difference in her position though you could pat a talented child on the head without forgetting she was a child leane departed with a curtsy and a dry comment that she was not sorry somebody else would have less than a full nightвђs rest for once siuan waited no one could be allowed to see her and leane leaving together for a time egwene merely studied the other woman neither spoke siuan seemed lost in thought finally she gave a start and stood straightening her dress plainly preparing to go siuan egwene began slowly and found herself uncertain how to continue siuan thought she understood you were not only right mother she said looking egwene straight in the eye you were lenient too lenient though i say it who shouldnвђt you are the amyrlin seat and no onemay be insolent or impertinent to you if youвђd given me a penance that made even romanda feel sorry for me it would have been no more than i deserved i will remember that next time egwene said and siuan bowed her head as if in acceptance maybe it was unless the changes in her ran deeper than seemed possible there almost certainly would be a next time and more after that but what i want to ask about is lord bryne all expression vanished from siuanвђs face are you sure you wouldnвђt like me to intervene why would i want that mother siuanвђs voice was blander than cold water soup the only duties i have are teaching you the etiquette of your office and handing sheriam reports from my eyesandears she still retained some of her former network though it was doubtful any knew who their reports went to now gareth bryne hardly requires enough of my time to interfere with that she almost always referred to him that way and even when she used his title she put a bite into it siuan a burned barn and a few cows couldnвђt cost that much not compared with paying and feeding all those soldiers certainly but she had offered before and the stiff reply was the same i thank you mother but no i wonвђt have him saying i break my word and i swore to workthe debt off abruptly siuanвђs stiffness dissolved in laughter rare when she spoke about lord bryne scowls were much more common if you need to worry about somebody worry about him not me i need no help handling gareth bryne and that was the strange part weak she might be in the one power now but not so weak that siuan had to keep on as his servant spending hours up to her elbows in hot soapy water with his shirts and smallclothes perhaps she did so in order to have someone at hand on whom she could loose the temper she was otherwise forced to keep in a sack whatever the reason it occasioned no little talk and confirmed her oddness in many eyes she wasaes sedai after all if rather far down his methods of dealing with her temper вђ once she threw plates and boots anyway вђ outraged her and provoked threats of dire consequences yet though she could have wrapped him up unable to stir a finger siuan never touched saidararound him not to do his chores and not even when it meant being turned over his knee that fact she had kept hidden from most so far but some things slipped out when she was in a rage or when leane was in a humor there seemed to be no explanation siuan was not weakspirited or a fool she was neither meek nor afraid she was not you might as well be on your way siuan clearly some secrets were not going to be revealed tonight itвђs late and i know you want your bed yes mother and thank you she added though egwene could not have said for what after siuan left egwene rubbed her temples once more she wanted to pace the tent would not do it might be the largest in the camp occupied by just one person but that meant less than two spans by two and it was crowded with cot and chair and stool washstand and standmirror and no fewer than three chests full of clothes chesa had seen to those last and sheriam and romanda and lelaine and a dozen more sitters they kept seeing to them a few more gifts of silk shifts or stockings one more dress grand enough to receive a king and there would be need for a fourth chest maybe sheriam and the sitters hoped all the fine dresses would blind her to anything else but chesa just thought the amyrlin seat had to be clothed suitably for her station servants it seemed believed in following the correct rituals as much as the hall ever did shortly selame would be there it was her turn to undress egwene for bed another ritual only between her head and her restless feet she was not ready for bed yet leaving the lamps burning she hurried out before selame could arrive walking would clear her head and maybe tire her enough that she could sleep soundly putting herself to sleep would be no problem вђ the wise one dreamwalkers had taught her that skill early on вђ yet finding any rest in it was another matter especially when her mind boiled with a list of worries that began with romanda and lelaine and sheriam then ran through rand elaida moghedien the weather and on out of sight she avoided the area near moghedienвђs tent if she asked questions herself too much importance would be given to a servant running away discretion had become part of her the game she played allowed few slips and being careless where you knew it did not matter could lead to being careless where it did worse you could discover you had been wrong about where it mattered the weak must be bold cautiously that was siuan again she truly did her best to teach and she knew this particular game very well there were no more people out and about in the moonshadowed camp than had been there before handfuls slouched wearily around low fires exhausted by their eveningвђs labors after a hard dayвђs journey those who saw her rose tiredly to make their courtesies as she passed murmuring the light shine on you mother or something like occasionally asking her blessing which she gave with a simple the light bless you my child men and women old enough to be her grandparents sat back down beaming from that yet she wondered what they actually believed about her what they knew all the aes sedai presented an unbroken front to the outside world including their own servants but siuan said that if you believed a servant knew twice what he should you only knew half the truth still those bows and curtsies and murmurs followed her from one clump of people to the next comforting her with the possibility that there were some at least who did not see her as a child the hall brought out when they needed her as she passed an open area surrounded by ropes tied to posts driven into the ground a gatewayвђs silver slash of light flashed vivid in the darkness as it rotated open it was not really light though it cast no shadows she paused to watch beside a corner post no one at the nearby fires even looked up they were used to this by now a dozen or more sisters twice as many servants and a number of warders bustled out returning with messages and wicker cages of pigeons from the dovecotes in salidar a good five hundred miles west and south as the goose flew they began scattering before the gateway closed carrying their burdens to sitters to their ajahs a few back to their own tents most nights siuan would have been with them she seldom trusted anyone else to fetch messages destined for her even if most were in codes or ciphers sometimes the world seemed to hold more networks of eyesandears than it did aes sedai though most were severely truncated by circumstance the majority of agents for the various ajahs seemed to be lying low until the difficulties in the white tower subsided and a good many of the individual sistersвђ eyesandears had no idea where the woman they served was at present several of the warders saw egwene and made careful bows with a respect proper to the stole sisters might eye her askance but the hall had raised her amyrlin and the gaidin needed no more a number of the servants offered bows or curtsies too not one of the aes sedai hurrying away from the gateway so much as glanced in her direction perhaps they did not notice her perhaps in a way that anybody could still hear from any of their eyesandears at all was one of moghedienвђs gifts the sisters with the strength to make gateways had all been in salidar long enough to know it well those who could weave a gateway of useful size were able to travel almost anywhere from there and land right on the spot trying to travel tosalidar however would have meant spending half of each night learning the new ropedoff patch of ground more for some every time they made camp what egwene had pried from moghedien was a way to journey from a place you did not know well to one you did slower than traveling skimming was not one of the lost talents вђ no one had ever heard of it вђ so even the name was credited to egwene anyone who could travel could skim so every night sisters skimmed to salidar checking the dovecotes for birds that had returned to where they had been hatched then traveled back the sight should have pleased her вђ the rebel aes sedai had gained talents the white tower thought lost forever as well as learned new ones and those abilities would help cost elaida the amyrlin seat before all was done вђ yet instead of pleasure egwene felt sourness being snubbed had nothing to do with it or not much anyway as she walked on the fires grew farther between then faded behind all around her lay the dark shapes of wagons most with canvas tops stretched over iron hoops and tents glowing palely in the moonlight beyond the armyвђs campfires climbed the surrounding hills all around the stars brought to ground the silence from caemlyn tied her middle into knots whatever anyone else thought the very day they left salidar a message had arrived though sheriam had not bothered to show it to her until a few days ago and then with repeated warnings on the need to keep the contents secret the hall knew but no one else must more of the ten thousand secrets that infested the camp egwene was sure she never would have seen it if she had not kept going on about rand she could recall every carefully chosen word written in a tiny hand on paper so thin it was a wonder the pen had not torn through we are well settled at the inn of which we spoke and we have met with the wool merchant he is a veryremarkable young man everything that nynaeve told us still he was courteous i think he is somewhat afraid of us which is to the good it will go well you may have heard rumors about men here including a fellow from saldaea the rumors are all too true i fear but we have seen none of them and will avoid them if we can if you pursue two hares both will escape you verin and alanna are here with a number of young women from the same region as the wool merchant i will try to send them on to you for training alanna has formed an attachment to the wool merchant which may prove useful though it is troubling too all will go well i am sure merana sheriam emphasized the good news as she saw it merana an experienced negotiator had reached caemlyn and been well received by rand the wool merchant wonderful news to sheriam and verin and alanna would be bringing two rivers girls to become novices sheriam was sure they must be coming down the same road they themselves were headed up she seemed to think egwene would be all aglow at the expectation of seeing faces from home merana would handle everything merana knew what she was doing thatвђs a bucket of horse sweat egwene muttered at the night a gaptoothed fellow carrying a large wooden bucket gave a start and gaped at her so amazed he forgot to bow rand courteous she had seen his first meeting with coiren saeldain elaidaвђs emissary overbearing summed it up nicely why should he be different with merana and merana thought he was afraid thought that was good rand was seldom afraid even when he should be and if he was now merana should remember that fear could make the mildest man dangerous remember that rand was dangerous just being who he was and what was this attachment alanna had formed egwene did not entirely trust alanna the woman did extremely odd things at times maybe impetuously and maybe with some deeper motive egwene would not put it past her to find a way into randвђs bed he would be clay in the hands of a woman like her elayne would break alannaвђs neck if that was so but that was the least of it worst of all no more of the pigeons merana had taken with her had appeared in the salidar dovecotes merana should have had some word to send if only that she and the rest of the embassy had gone to cairhien lately the wise ones did little more than acknowledge rand was alive yet it seemed he was there sitting on his hands as far as she could make out which should have been a warning beacon sheriam saw it differently who could say why any man did what he did probably not even the man himself most of the time and when it came to one who could channel silence proved all was well merana surely would have reported any real difficulty she must be on her way to cairhien if not there already and there was no need to report further until she could send word of success for that matter rand in cairhien was success of a sort one of meranaвђs goals if not the most important had been to ease him out of caemlyn so that elayne could return there safely and take the lion throne and the dangers of cairhien had dissipated incredible as it seemed the wise ones said coiren and her embassy had left the city on their way back to tar valon or maybe not so incredible it all made a sort of sense given rand given the way aes sedai did things even so to egwene it all felt wrong i have to go to him she muttered one hour and she could straighten everything out underneath he was still rand thatвђs all there is to it i have to go to him that isnвђt possible and you know it if egwene had not had herself on a tight rein she would have jumped a foot as it was her heart pounded even after she made out leane by the light of the moon i thought you were she said before she could stop herself and only just managed not to say moghedienвђs name the taller woman fell in beside her keeping a careful watch for other sisters as they walked leane did not have siuanвђs excuse for spending time with her not that being seen together once should cause any harm but should not isnвђt always will notegwene reminded herself slipping the stole from her shoulders she folded it to carry in one hand at a glance from a distance leane might well be taken for an accepted despite her dress many accepted lacked enough of the banded white dresses to wear one all the time from a distance egwene might be taken for one too not the most pacifying thought theodrin and faolain are asking around near mariganвђs tent mother they werenвђt especially pleased i did a fine sulk over carrying messages if i do say so theodrin had to stop faolain dressing me down for it leaneвђs laughter was quiet and breathy situations that grated siuanвђs teeth usually amused her she was cosseted by most of the other sisters for how well she had adjusted good good egwene said absently merana misstepped somehow leane or he wouldnвђt be staying in cairhien and she wouldnвђt be keeping quiet off in the distance a dog bayed at the moon then others until they were abruptly silenced by shouts that perhaps luckily she could not quite understand a number of the soldiers had dogs tagging along there were none in the aes sedai camp any number of cats but no dogs merana does know what she is doing mother it sounded very like a sigh leane and siuan both agreed with sheriam everyone did except her when you give someone a task you have to trust it to them egwene sniffed and folded her arms leane that man could strike sparks from a damp cloth if it wore the shawl i donвђt know merana but iвђve never seen an aes sedai who qualified as a damp cloth iвђve met one or two leane chuckled this time her sigh was plain but not merana true does he really believe he has friends inside the tower alviarin that might make him difficult for merana i suppose but i can hardly see alviarin doing anything to risk her place she was always ambitious enough for three he has a letter supposedly from her she could still see rand gloating over receiving letters from elaida and alviarin both back before she herself left cairhien maybe her ambitions make her think shecan replace elaida with him on her side thatвђs if she really wrote it he thinks heвђs clever leane вђ maybe he is вђ but he doesnвђt believe he needs anyone rand would go on thinking he could handle anything by himself right up until one of those anythings crushed him i know him inside and out leane being around the wise ones seems to have infected him or maybe he infected them whatever the sitters think whatever any of you think an aes sedaiвђs shawl doesnвђt impress him any more than it does the wise ones sooner or later heвђll exasperate a sister until she does something about it or one of them will push him the wrong way not realizing how strong he is and what his temper is now after that there might be no going back iвђm the only one who can deal with him safely the only one he can hardly be as irritating as those aiel women leane murmured wryly even she found it difficult to be amused by her experiences with the wise ones but it hardly matters вђthe amyrlin seat being valued with the white tower itself вђ a pair of women appeared between the tents ahead moving slowly as they talked distance and shadows obscured their faces yet it was clear they were aes sedai from the way they carried themselves an assurance that nothing hiding in any darkness could harm them no accepted on the brink of the shawl could manage quite that degree of confidence a queen with an army at her back might not they were coming toward her and leane leane quickly turned in to the deeper dimness between two wagons scowling with frustration egwene nearly pulled her out again and marched on let it all come into the open she would stand before the hall and tell them it was time they realized the amyrlinвђs stole was more than a pretty scarf she would following leane she motioned the other woman to walk on what she would not do was throw everything on the midden heap in a fit of pique only one tower law specifically limited the power of the amyrlin seat a fistful of irritating customs and a barrel full of inconvenient realities but only one law yet it could not have been a worse for her purposes the amyrlin seat being valued with the white tower itself as the very heart of the white tower she must not be endangered without dire necessity therefore unless the white tower be at war by declaration of the hall of the tower the amyrlin seat shall seek the lesser consensus of the hall of the tower before deliberately placing herself in the way of any danger and she shall abide by the consensus that stands what rash incident by an amyrlin had inspired that egwene did not know but it had been law for something over two thousand years to most aes sedai any law that old attained an aura of holiness changing it was unthinkable romanda had quoted that that bloodylaw as though lecturing a halfwit if the daughterheir of andor could not be allowed within a hundred miles of the dragon reborn how much more they must preserve the amyrlin seat lelaine sounded almost regretful most likely because she was agreeing with romanda that had nearly curdled both their tongues without them both of them the lesser consensus lay as far out of reach as the greater light even that declaration of war only required the lesser consensus so if she could not obtain permission leane cleared her throat you can hardly do much if you go in secret mother and the hall will find out soon or late i think you would find it difficult to have an hour to yourself after that not that theyвђd dare put a guard on you precisely but there are ways i can quote examples from certain sources she never mentioned the hidden records directly unless they were behind a ward am i so transparent egwene asked after a moment there were only wagons around them here and beneath the wagons the dark mounds of sleeping wagon drivers and horse handlers and all the rest needed to keep so many vehicles moving it was remarkable just how many conveyances over three hundred aes sedai required when few would condescend to ride even a mile in wagon or cart but there were tents and furnishings and foodstuffs and a thousand things needed to keep the sisters and those who served them the loudest sounds here were snores a chorus of frogs no mother leane laughed softly i just thought what i would do but itвђs well known iвђve lost all my dignity and sense the amyrlin seat can hardly take me for a model i think you must let young master alвђthor go as he will for a time anyway while you pluck the goose thatвђs in front of you his way may lead us all to the pit of doom egwene muttered but it was not an argument there had to be a way to pluck that goose and still keep rand from making dangerous mistakes but she could not see it now not frogs those snores sounded like a hundred saws cutting logs full of knots this is as bad a spot for a soothing walk as iвђve ever visited i think i might as well go to bed leane tilted her head in that case mother if you will forgive me thereвђs a man in lord bryneвђs camp after all whoever heard of a green without even one warder from the sudden quickening in her voice you might have thought she was off to meet a lover considering what egwene had heard about greens perhaps there was not that much difference back among the tents the last of the fires had been doused with dirt no one took risks with fire when the countryside was tinder dry a few tendrils of smoke rose lazily in the moonlight where the job had not been well done a man murmured drowsily in his sleep inside a tent and here and there a cough drifted out or a rasping snore but otherwise the camp lay silent and still which was why egwene was surprised when someone stepped from the shadows in front of her especially someone wearing the simple white dress of a novice mother i need to speak to you nicola egwene had made a point of fixing name to face for every novice no easy chore given how sisters hunted all along the armyвђs path for girls and young women who could learn active search was still not well thought of вђ custom was to wait for the girl to ask best of all to wait for her to come to the tower вђ but ten times as many novices studied in the camp now as the white tower had held in years nicola was one to be remembered though and besides egwene had often noticed the young woman staring at her tiana wonвђt be pleased if she finds you up this late tiana noselle was the mistress of novices known equally for a comforting shoulder when a novice needed to cry and an unyielding stance when it came to rules the other woman shifted as if to hurry away then straightened her back sweat glistened on her cheeks the darkness was cooler than the light had been but not what anyone would call cool and the simple trick of ignoring heat or cold came only with the shawl i know iвђm supposed to ask to see tiana sedai and then ask her to see you mother but sheвђd never let a novice approach the amyrlin seat about what child egwene asked the woman was older by six or seven years at least but that was the proper address for a novice fidgeting with her skirt nicola stepped closer large eyes met egweneвђs perhaps more directly than a noviceвђs should have mother i want to go as far as i can her hands plucked at her dress but her voice was cool and selfpossessed fit for an aes sedai i wonвђt say they are holding me back but i am sure i can become stronger than they say i just know i can you were never held back mother no one has ever gained so much of her strength as fast as you all i ask is the same chance movement in the shadow behind nicola turned into another sweatyfaced woman this one in short coat and wide trousers carrying a bow her hair hung to her waist in a braid tied with six ribbons and she wore short boots with raised heels nicola treehill and areina nermasiv seemed an odd pair to be friends like many of the older novices вђ women with nearly ten years on egwene were tested now though many sisters still grumbled that they were ten years too old to accept novice discipline вђ like many of those older women nicola was ferocious in her desire to learn by all reports and she had a potential bettered only by nynaeve elayne and egwene herself among living aes sedai in fact nicola apparently was making great strides often great enough that her teachers had to slow her down some said she had begun picking up weaves as if she already knew them not only that but she already demonstrated two talents although the ability to see taвђverenwas minor while the major talent foretelling emerged so that no one understood what she had foretold she herself did not remember a word she said all in all nicola was already marked by the sisters as someone to watch despite her late start the begrudging agreement to test women older than seventeen or eighteen probably could be laid at nicolaвђs feet areina on the other hand was a hunter for the horn who swaggered as much as a man and sat around talking of adventures those she had had and those she would when she was not practicing with her bow very likely she had picked that weapon up from birgitte along with her manner of dress she certainly seemed to have no interest in anything beside the bow except flirting occasionally in a rather forward manner though not lately perhaps long days on the road left her too tired for it if not for archery why she was still traveling with them egwene could not understand it was hardly likely that areina believed the horn of valere would turn up along their march and impossible that she even suspected it was hidden away inside the white tower veryfew people knew that egwene was not certain even elaida did areina seemed a posturing fool but egwene felt a certain sympathy for nicola she understood the womanвђs discontent understood wanting to know it all now she had been that way too maybe she still was nicola she said gently we all have limits iвђll never match nynaeve sedai for example whatever i do but if i could only have the chance mother nicola actually wrung her hands in pleading and there was a touch of it in her voice yet her eyes still met egweneвђs levelly the chance you had what i did вђ because i had no choice because i didnвђt know better вђ is called forcing nicola and it is dangerous she had not heard that term until siuan apologized for doing it to her that was one time siuan truly had seemed repentant you know if you try to channel more of saidarthan youвђre ready to handle you risk burning yourself out before you ever come close to your full strength best you learn to be patient the sisters wonвђt let you be anything else until you are ready anyway we came to salidar on the same riverboat as nynaeve and elayne areina said suddenly her gaze was more than direct it was challenging and birgitte for some reason she said the name bitterly nicola made shushing motions thereвђs no need to bring that up oddly she did not sound as if she meant it hoping she was keeping her face half so smooth as nicolaвђs egwene tried to quell a sudden uneasiness marigan had come to salidar on that boat too an owl hooted and she shivered some people thought hearing an owl in moonlight meant bad news was coming she was not superstitious but no need to bring up what the other two women exchanged looks and areina nodded it was on the walk from the river to the village for all her supposed reluctance nicola peered straight into egweneвђs eyes areina and i heard thom merrilin and juilin sandar talking the gleeman and the thieftaker juilin said if there were aes sedai in the village вђ we werenвђt sure yet вђ and they learned nynaeve and elayne had been pretending to be aes sedai then we were all jumping into a school of silverpike which i take it isnвђt very safe the gleeman saw us and hushed him areina put in fingering the quiver at her waist but we heard her voice was hard as her stare i know theyвђre both aes sedai now mother but wouldnвђt they still be in trouble if anyone found out the sisters i mean anybody who pretends to be a sister is in trouble if they find out even years later nicolaвђs face did not change but her gaze suddenly seemed to be trying to fix egweneвђs she leaned a little forward intent anybody at all isnвђt that so emboldened by egweneвђs silence areina grinned an unpleasant grin in the night i hear nynaeve and elayne were sent out of the tower on some task by the sanche woman back when she was amyrlin i hear you were sent off by her too at the same time got into all sorts of trouble when you came back sly insinuation slithered into her voice do you remember them playing at aes sedai they stood there looking at her areina leaning insolently on her bow nicola so expectant the air should have crackled siuan sanche is aes sedai egwene said coldly and so are nynaeve alвђmeara and elayne trakand you will show them proper respect to you they are siuan sedai nynaeve sedai and elayne sedai the pair blinked in surprise inside her stomach quivered with outrage after everything she had been through tonight she was confronted with blackmailfrom these she could not think of a word bad enough elayne could have elayne listened to stablemen and wagon drivers and every sort memorizing the words she should have refused to hear unfolding the striped stole egwene draped it carefully across her shoulders i donвђt think you understand mother nicola said hastily not fearfully however just attempting to force her point i merely worried that if anyone found out that you had вђ egwene gave her no chance to go further oh i understand child the fool woman wasa child however old she was any number of the older novices gave trouble usually in the form of insolence toward accepted set to teach them but even the silliest had sense enough to avoid impertinence to the sisters it fanned her anger to white heat that the woman had the gall to try this on with her they were both taller than she if not by much but she planted her fists on her hips and drew herself up and they shrank away as though she loomed do you have any notion how serious it is to bring charges against a sister especially for a novice charges based on a conversation you claim to have heard between men now a thousand miles away tiana would skin you alive and put you to scrubbing pots the rest of your natural life nicola kept trying to push a word in вђ apologies they sounded like this time and more protests that egwene did not understand frantic attempts to change everything вђ but egwene ignored her and rounded on areina the hunter took another step back wetting her lips and looking remarkably uncertain you neednвђt think you would walk away clear either even a hunter could be hauled to tiana for a thing like this if youвђre lucky enough not to be flogged at a wagon tongue the way they do soldiers caught stealing either way youвђll be tossed out by the road with your welts for company drawing a deep breath egwene folded her hands at her waist clutched together they would not tremble all but cowering the pair looked suitably chastened she hoped those downcast eyes and slumped shoulders and shifting feet were not feigned by rights she should send them to tiana right now she had no idea what the penalty might be for trying to blackmail the amyrlin seat but it seemed likely that being turned out of the camp would be the least of it in nicolaвђs case the turning out would have to wait until her teachers were satisfied she knew enough of channeling not to hurt herself or others by accident nicola treehill would never be aes sedai though once that charge was laid against her all that potential would go for nothing except any woman caught pretending to be aes sedai was set down so hard she would still be whimpering years later and an accepted caught might very well consider the other woman fortunate but surely nynaeve and elayne were safe now they really were sisters herself as well only it might take no more than a whisper of this to erase any chance of making the hall acknowledge her truly the amyrlin seat as well jaunt off to rand and then tell the hall to their faces she dared not allow these two to see her doubt or even suspect i will forget this she said sharply but if i hear so much as a whisper of it again from anyone she drew a ragged breath вђ if she heard shoutsof it there might be little she could do вђ but by the way they jumped they read a threat that pricked deep get to your beds before i change my mind in an instant they became a flurry of curtsies of yes mother and no mother and as you command mother they scurried away looking back over their shoulders at her every step faster than the last until they were running she had to walk on sedately but she wanted to run too chapter dream ring unseen eyes selame was waiting when egwene got back to her tent a railthin woman with dark tairen coloring and a nearly impervious selfassurance chesa was right she did carry her long nose raised as though recoiling from a bad smell yet if her manner with the other maids was arrogant she was in reality quite different around her patroness as egwene entered selame folded herself into a curtsy so deep her head nearly brushed the carpet skirts spread as wide as they would go in the cramped quarters before egwene had taken her second step inside the woman leaped up fussing over her buttons and fussing over her too selame had very little sense oh mother you went out with your head uncovered again as if she had ever worn any of those beaded caps the woman favored or the embroidered velvet things meri favored or chesaвђs plumed hats why youвђre shivering you should never go walking outofdoors without a shawl and parasol mother how was a parasol supposed to stop shivering with sweat trickling down her own cheeks however fast she dabbed with her handkerchief selame never thought to ask why she shivered which was perhaps just as well and you went alone in the night it just isnвђt proper mother besides there are all those soldiers rough men with no decent respect for any woman even aes sedai mother you simply mustnвђt egwene let the foolish words wash over her in the same way she let the woman undress her paying less than half a mind ordering her to be quiet would only produce so many hurt looks and abused sighs that it made little difference except for the brainless chatter selame performed her duties diligently if with so many flourishes they became a dance of grand gestures and obsequious curtsies it seemed impossible that anyone could be as silly as selame always concerned with appearances always worrying over what people would think to her people were aes sedai and the nobility and their upper servants by her book no one else mattered perhaps no one else thought by her book it probably wasimpossible egwene was not about to forget who had found selame in the first place any more than she did who had found meri true chesa was a gift from sheriam but chesa had shown her loyalties to egwene more than once egwene wanted to tell herself the tremors that the other woman took for shivers were quivers of rage yet she knew a worm of fear writhed in her belly she had come too far had too much to do yet to allow nicola and areina to put a spoke through her wheels as her head popped through the top of a clean shift she caught a bit of the skinny womanвђs prattle and stared did you say eweвђs milk oh yes mother your skin is so soft and nothing will keep it that way like bathing in eweвђs milk maybe she really was an idiot hustling a protesting selame out egwene brushed her own hair turned down her own cot placed the now useless aвђdambracelet in the small carved ivory box where she kept her few pieces of jewelry then extinguished the lamps all by myself she thought sarcastically in the darkness selame and meri will have conniptions before retiring however she padded to the entrance and opened a small gap in the doorflaps outside was moonlit stillness and silence broken by a night heronвђs cry that suddenly cut off in a shriek there were hunters abroad in the darkness after a moment something moved in the shadows beside a tent across the way it looked like a woman perhaps idiocy did not disqualify selame any more than dourfaced gloom eliminated meri it could be either one or someone else entirely even nicola or areina however unlikely she let the tentflap fall shut with a smile whoever the watcher was would not see where she went tonight the way the wise ones had taught her to put herself to sleep was simple eyes closed feeling each part of the body relax in turn breathing in time with her heartbeat mind unfocused and drifting all but one tiny corner drifting sleep swept over her in moments but it was the sleep of a dreamwalker formless she floated deep within an ocean of stars infinite points of light glimmering in an infinite sea of darkness fireflies beyond counting flickering in an endless night those were dreams the dreams of everyone sleeping anywhere in the world maybe of everyone in all possible worlds and this was the gap between reality and telвђaranвђrhiod the space separating the waking world from the world of dreams wherever she looked ten thousand fireflies vanished as people woke and ten thousand new were born to replace them a vast everchanging array of sparkling beauty she did not waste time in admiration though this place held dangers some deadly she was sure she knew how to avoid those but one peril in this place aimed straight at her if she lingered too long and being caught in it would be embarrassing to say the least keeping a wary eye out вђ well it would have been a wary eye had she had eyes here вђ she moved she had no sense of motion it seemed she stood still and that glittering ocean swirled around her until one light settled before her every twinkling star looked exactly like every other yet she knew this was nynaeveвђs dream howshe knew was another matter not even the wise ones understood that recognition she had considered trying to find nicolaвђs dreams and areinaвђs once she unearthed them she knew exactly how to sink the fear of the light into their bones and she did not give a fig that every bit of it was proscribed practicality sent her here instead not fear of the forbidden she had done what was not done before and she was certain she would again should it become necessary do what you must then pay the price for it was what she had been taught by the same women who had marked off those forbidden areas it was refusal to admit the debt refusal to pay that often turned necessity to evil but even if that pair were asleep locating someoneвђs dreams the first time was arduous at best without guarantees days of efforts вђ nights of it rather вђ were more likely to deliver nothing this was at least sure slowly she moved closer through everlasting darkness though once again it seemed that she stayed still and the pinpoint of light grew to a glowing pearl an iridescent apple a full moon until it filled her vision entirely with brightness all the world she did not touch it though not yet a space finer than a hair remained between ever so gently she reached across that gap with what lacking a body was as much a mystery as how she knew one dream from another her will the wise ones said but she still did not understand how that could be as though laying a finger to a soap bubble she kept her touch very delicate indeed the shining wall shimmered like spun glass pulsed like a heart delicate and alive a little firmer touch and she would be able to see inside see what nynaeve was dreaming a bit firmer still and she could actually step inside and be a part of the dream that carried hazards especially with anyone of a strong mind but either looking in or stepping in could be mortifying for example if the dreamer happened to be dreaming of a man she was particularly interested in apologies alone took half the night when you did that or with a hooking sort of motion like rolling a fragile bead across a tabletop she could snatch nynaeve out into a dream of her own making a part of telвђaranвђrhioditself where she was in complete control she was sure that would work of course that was one of the forbidden things and she did not think nynaeve would appreciate it nynaeve this is egwene under no circumstances are you to return until you find the bowl not until i can settle a problem with areina and nicola they know you were pretending i will explain more when i see you next in the little tower be careful moghedien has escaped the dream winked out the soap bubble pricked despite the message she would have giggled had she possessed a throat a disembodied voice in your dream could have a startling effect especially if you were afraid the speaker might be peeking nynaeve was not one to forget even when it was an accident that lightspangled sea whirled about her once more until she settled on another sparkling pinpoint elayne the two women very likely slept no more than a dozen paces apart in ebou dar but distance had no meaning here or perhaps it had a different meaning this time when she delivered her message the dream pulsed and changed it still appeared exactly the same as every other but even so to her it was transformed had the words drawn elayne into another dream they would remain however and she would remember on waking with nicola and areinaвђs bowstrings dampened a little more it was time to turn her attention to rand unfortunately finding his dreams would be as useless as finding an aes sedaiвђs he shielded his somewhat as they did theirs although apparently a manвђs shield differed from a womanвђs an aes sedaiвђs shield was a crystal carapace a seamless sphere woven of spirit but however transparent it appeared it might as well have been steel she could not recall how many fruitless hours she had frittered away trying to peer through his where a sisterвђs shielded dream seemed brighter close up his were dimmer it was like staring into muddy water sometimes you had the impression that something had moved deep in those graybrown swirls but you could never tell what again the endless array of lights spun and settled and she approached a third womanвђs dream gingerly so much lay between her and amys that it seemed akin to approaching her motherвђs dreams in truth she had to admit she wanted to emulate amys in many ways she desired amysвђ respect every bit as greatly as she did the hallвђs maybe if she had to choose she would choose amysвђ certainly there was no sitter she esteemed as highly as she did amys pushing away a sudden diffidence she tried to make her voice softer to no avail amys this is egwene i must speak with you we will come a voice murmured to her amysвђ voice startled egwene backed away she felt like laughing at herself perhaps it was just as well to be reminded that the wise ones had long yearsвђ more experience at this there were times she was afraid she might have been spoiled by not having to work harder for her abilities with the one power then again as if to make up for it sometimes everything else seemed like trying to climb a cliff in a rainstorm abruptly she caught movement at the very edge of her field of vision one of those points of light slid through the sea of stars drifting toward her of its own volition growing larger only one dream would do that one dreamer in a panic she fled wishing she had a throat to scream or curse or just shout especially at the tiny corner of her that wanted to stay where she was and wait not even the stars moved this time they simply disappeared and she was leaning against a thick redstone column panting as though she had sprinted a mile heart beating fit to burst after a moment she looked down at herself and began to laugh a trifle unsteadily trying to catch her breath she had on a fullskirted gown of shimmering green silk worked in threadofgold in wide ornate bands across the bodice and along the hem that bodice also showed considerablymore bosom than she ever would waking and a broad cinched belt of woven gold made her waist seem smaller than it really was then again maybe it was smaller here in telвђaranвђrhiod you could be however you wanted whatever you wanted even when the wanting was unconscious if you were not careful gawyn trakand had unfortunate effects on her very unfortunate that tiny part of her still wished she had waited to be overtaken by his dream overtaken and absorbed by it if a dreamwalker loved somebody to distraction or hated them beyond reason most especially if the emotion was returned she could be pulled into that personвђs dream she drew the dream or it drew her as a lodestone drew iron filings she certainly did not hate gawyn but she could not afford to be trapped in his dream not tonight trapped until he wakened being as he saw her which was a good deal more beautiful than she truly was oddly heappeared less beautiful than he was in life there was no question of a strong mind or concentration when love or hate that strong was involved once you were in that dream there you remained until the other person stopped dreaming about you remembering what he dreamed of doing with her what they had done in his dreams she felt a fiery blush suffusing her face a good thing none of the sitters can see me now she muttered theyвђd never take me for anything but a girl then grown women did not flutter and moon over a man this way she was certain of that not women with any sense anyway what he dreamed of would come but at a time of her choosing obtaining her motherвђs permission might be difficult yet surely she would not withhold it even if she had never laid eyes on gawyn marin alвђvere trusted her daughtersвђ judgment now it was time for her youngest daughter to show a little of that judgment and put these fancies away until a better time looking around she almost wished she could go on letting gawyn fill her thoughts more massive columns ran in every direction supporting a soaring vaulted ceiling and a great dome none of the gilded lamps hanging from golden chains overhead was lit yet there was light of a sort light that was just there without source neither bright nor dim the heart of the stone inside the great fortress called the stone of tear or rather its image in telвђaranвђrhiod an image as real as the original in many ways this was where she had met the wise ones before their choice a strange one for aiel it seemed to her she would have expected rhuidean now that it was open or somewhere else in the aiel waste or simply wherever the wise ones happened to be every place except ogier steddinghad its reflection in the world of dreams вђ even the steddingdid really but they could not be entered just as rhuidean had once been closed the aes sedai camp was out of the question of course a number of the sisters now had access to terвђangrealthat allowed them to enter the world of dreams and since none really knew what they were doing they often began their ventures by appearing in the camp of telвђaranвђrhiodas though setting out on a normal journey like angrealand saвђangreal by tower law terвђangrealwere the property of the white tower no matter who happened to possess them for the present very seldom did the tower insist at least when possession lay somewhere like the socalled great holding in this very stone of tear вђ eventually they would come to the aes sedai and the white tower had always been good at waiting when it needed to вђ but those actually in aes sedai hands were in the gift of the hall of individual sitters the loan really they were almost never given elayne had learned to duplicate dream terвђangreal and she and nynaeve had taken two with them but the rest were in the hallвђs possession now along with the other sorts elayne had made which meant that sheriam and her little circle could use them whenever they wished and most assuredly lelaine and romanda though it was likely those two sent others instead of entering telвђaranвђrhiodthemselves until quite recently no aes sedai had walked the dream in centuries and they still had considerable difficulties most of which stemmed from a belief that they could learn by themselves even so the last thing egwene wanted was any of their followers spying on this meeting tonight as though the thought of spies had made her more sensitive she became aware of being watched by unseen eyes that sensation was always present in telвђaranвђrhiod and not even the wise ones knew why but although hidden eyes always seemed to be there actual watchers might be present as well it was not romanda or lelaine on her mind now trailing her hand against the column she walked all the way around it slowly studying the redstone forest as it ran away in deepening shadows the light surrounding her was not real anybody in one of those shadows would see the same light around them while shadows hid her people did appear men and women flickering images that rarely lasted more than a few heartbeats she had no interest in those who touched the world of dreams in their sleep anyone might do that by happenstance but luckily for them only for moments seldom long enough to face any of the dangers the black ajah possessed dream terвђangreal too stolen from the tower worse moghedien knew telвђaranвђrhiodas well as any dreamwalker perhaps better she could control this place and anyone in it as easily as turning her hand for a moment egwene wished she had spied on moghedienвђs dreams while the woman was prisoner just once just enough to be able to distinguish them but even identifying her dreams would not reveal where she was now and there had been the possibility of being drawn in against her will she certainly despised moghedien enough and the forsaken most assuredly hated her without bounds what happened in there was not real not even as real as in telвђaranвђrhiod but you remembered it as if it was a night in moghedienвђs power would have been a nightmare she likely would have relived every time she went to sleep for the rest of her life maybe awake too another circuit what was that a dark regally beautiful woman in pearlcovered cap and laceruffed gown strode from the shadows and vanished a tairen woman dreaming a high lady or dreaming herself as one she might be plain and dumpy a farmwife or a merchant awake better to have spied on logain than moghedien she still would not know where he was but she might have some idea of his plans of course being pulled into his dream might not have been much more pleasant than being drawn into moghedienвђs he hated all aes sedai arranging his escape had been one of those necessary things she just hoped the price would not be too high forget logain moghedien was the danger moghedien who might come after her even here especially here moghedien who suddenly she became aware of how heavily she was moving and made a vexed sound in her throat very nearly a groan the beautiful gown had become a full set of plateandmail armor like that of gareth bryneвђs heavy cavalry an openfaced helmet rested on her head with a crest in the shape of the flame of tar valon by the feel it was very irritating she was beyond this sort of lack of control firmly she changed the armor to what she had worn meeting the wise ones before it was just a matter of thought full skirt of dark wool and loose white algodeblouse just as she had worn while studying with them complete with a fringed shawl so green it was nearly black and a folded head scarf to hold her hair back she did not duplicate their jewelry of course all the multitudes of necklaces and bracelets they would laugh at her for that a woman built her collection over the years not in the blink of a dream logain is on his way to the black tower she said aloud she certainly hoped he was at least there would be some check on him then or so she hoped and if he was caught and gentled again rand could not blame any sister following her and moghedien has no way of knowing where i am that she tried to make sound a certainty why should you fear the shadowsouled asked a voice behind her and egwene tried to climb into the air this being telвђaranвђrhiod and she a dream walker she was more than her own height above the floorstones before she came to herself oh yes she thought floating iвђm far beyond all those beginnerвђs mistakes if this went on next she would be jumping when chesa gave her good morning hoping she was not blushing too badly she let herself settle slowly perhaps she could retain a little dignity perhaps yet bairвђs aged face had more creases than usual from a grin that seemed nearly to touch her ears unlike the other two women with her she could not channel but that had nothing to do with dreamwalking she was as skilled as either more in some areas amys was smiling too if not so broadly but sunhaired melaine threw back her head and roared i have never seen anyone melaine just managed to get out like a rabbit she gave a little hop and lifted a full pace into the air i recently caused moghedien some hurt egwene was quite proud of her poise she liked melaine вђ the woman was much less thorny since she was with child with twins actually вђ but at the moment egwene could have strangled her cheerfully some friends and i damaged her pride if not much more i think she would like the opportunity to repay me on impulse she changed her clothes once more to the sort of riding dress she wore every day now in lustrous green silk the great serpent encircled her finger with gold she could not tell them everything but these women were friends too and they deserved to know what she could tell wounds to the pride are remembered long after wounds to the flesh bairвђs voice was thin and high yet strong a reed of iron tell us about it melaine said with an eager smile how did you shame her bairвђs was just as enthusiastic in a cruel land you either learned to laugh at cruelty or spent your life weeping in the threefold land the aiel had learned to laugh long since besides shaming an enemy was considered an art amys studied egweneвђs new clothes for a moment then said that can come later i think we are to talk you said she gestured to where the wise ones liked to talk out beneath the vast dome at the heart of the chamber why they chose that spot was another mystery egwene could not puzzle out the three women settled themselves crosslegged spreading their skirts neatly only a few paces from what seemed to be a sword made of gleaming crystal rising hiltfirst from where it had been driven into the floorstones they paid it no mind whatsoever вђ it was no part of their prophecies вђ any more than they did the people who flashed into existence around the great chamber but here was always where they came fabled callandorwould indeed function as a sword despite its appearance but in truth it was a male saвђangreal one of the most powerful ever made in the age of legends she felt a little shiver thinking of male saвђangreal it had been different when there was only rand and the forsaken of course but now there were these ashaвђman with callandor a man could draw enough of the one power to level a city in a heartbeat and devastate everything for miles she walked wide around it holding her skirts aside reflexively from the heart of the stone rand had drawn callandorin fulfillment of the prophecies then returned it for his own reasons returned it and snared it round with traps woven in saidin they would have their reflection too one that might trigger as decisively as the original should the wrong weaves be tried nearby some things in telвђaranвђrhiodwere all too real trying not to think of the sword that is not a sword egwene placed herself before the three wise ones fastening their shawls around their waists they unlaced their blouses that was how aiel women sat with friends in their tents beneath a hot sun she did not sit and if that made her seem a supplicant or on trial so be it in a way in her heart she was iвђve not told you why i was summoned away from you and you have not asked you will tell us when you are ready amys said complacently she looked of an age with melaine despite hair white as bairвђs tumbling to her waist вђ her hair had begun turning when she was little older than egwene вђ but she was the leader among the three not bair for the first time egwene wondered just how old she was not a question you asked a wise one any more than an aes sedai when i left you i was one of the accepted you know about the division in the white tower bair shook her head and grimaced she knew but she did not understand none of them did to aiel it was as unreal as clan or warrior society dividing against itself perhaps it was also affirmation in their eyes that aes sedai were less than they should be egwene went on surprised that her voice was collected steady the sisters who oppose elaida have raised me as their amyrlin when elaida is pulled down i will sit on the amyrlin seat in the white tower she added the striped stole to her clothes and waited once she had lied to them a serious transgression under jiвђeвђtoh and she was not sure how they would react to learning this truth she had hidden if only they believed at least they merely looked at her there is a thing children do melaine said carefully after a time her pregnancy did not show yet but already she had the inner radiance making her even more beautiful than usual and an inward unshakable calm children all want to push spears and they all want to be the clan chief but eventually they realize that the clan chief seldom dances the spears himself so they make a figure and set it on a rise off to one side the floor suddenly mounded up no longer stone tiles but a ridge of sunbaked brown rock atop it stood a shape vaguely like a man made of twisted twigs and bits of cloth this is the clan chief who commands them to dance the spears from the hill where he can see the battle but the children run where they will and their clan chief is only a figure of sticks and rags a wind whipped the cloth strips emphasizing the hollowness of the shape and then ridge and figure were gone egwene drew a deep breath of course she had atoned for her lie according to jiвђeвђtoh by her own choice and that meant it was as if the lie had never been spoken she should have known better but they had struck to the heart of her situation as though they had been weeks in the aes sedai camp bair studied the floor not wanting to witness her shame amys sat with chin in hand sharp blue gaze trying to dig to her heart some see me so another deep breath and she pushed the truth out all but a handful do now by the time we finish our battle they will know i amtheir chief and they will run as isay return to us bair said you have too much honor for these women sorilea already has a dozen young men picked out for you to view in the sweat tents she has a great desire to see you make a bridal wreath i hope she will be there when i wed bair вђ to gawyn she hoped that she would bond him she knew from interpreting her dreams but only hope and the certainty of love said they would wed вђ i hope all of you will but iвђve made my choice bair would have argued further and melaine too but amys raised a hand and they fell silent if not pleased there is much jiin her decision she will bend her enemies to her will not run from them i wish you well in your dance egwene alвђvere she had been a maiden of the spear and often thought as one still sit sit her honor is her own bair said frowning at amys but i have another question her eyes were an almost watery blue yet when they turned on egwene they were sharp as ever amysвђ had been will you bring these aes sedai to kneel to the carвђaвђcarn startled egwene nearly fell the last foot to the floorstones rather than sitting there was no hesitation in her answer though i canвђt do that bair and would not if i could our loyalty is to the tower to the aes sedai as a whole above even the lands we were born in that was true or was supposed to be though she wondered how the claim squared in their minds with her and the othersвђ rebellion aes sedai donвђt even swear fealty to the amyrlin and certainly not to any man that would be like one of you kneeling to a clan chief she made an illustration the way melaine had by concentrating on its reality telвђaranвђrhiodwas infinitely malleable if you knew how beyond callandorthree wise ones dropped to their knees before a clan chief the man strongly resembled rhuarc the women the three in front of her she only held it for an instant but bair glanced at it and sniffed loudly the notion waspreposterous do not compare those women to us melaineвђs green eyes sparkled with something very like their old sharpness her tone was honed like a razor egwene held her tongue the wise ones seemed to despise aes sedai all except her or perhaps better to say they were contemptuous she thought they might actually resent the prophecies that linked them to aes sedai before she had been summoned by the hall to be raised amyrlin sheriam and her circle of friends had met here regularly with these three but that had ended as much because the wise ones refused to hide their contempt as because egwene finally had been called in telвђaranвђrhiod a confrontation with someone more familiar with the place could be mortifying in the extreme even with egwene there was a distance now and certain matters they would not discuss such as whatever they knew of randвђs plans before she had been one with them a student in dreamwalking after she was aes sedai even before they learned what she had just told them egwene alвђvere will do as she must amys said melaine gave her a long look and rearranged her shawl ostentatiously shifted several long necklaces in a clatter of ivory and gold but said nothing amys seemed even more the leader than she had been the only wise one egwene had ever seen make other wise ones defer to her so easily was sorilea bair had imagined tea before her as it might be in the tents a golden teapot worked with lions from one country a silver tray edged in ropework from another tiny green cups of delicate sea folk porcelain the tea tasted real of course felt real going down despite a hint of some sweet berry or herb she did not recognize it was too bitter for egweneвђs tongue she imagined a little honey in it and took another sip too sweet a touch less honey now it tasted right that was something you could not do with the power egwene doubted that anyone had the skill to weave threads of saidarfine enough to remove honey from tea for a moment she sat peering into her teacup thinking about honey and tea and fine threads of saidar but that was not what held her silent the wise ones wanted to guide rand no less than elaida or romanda or lelaine or very likely any other aes sedai of course they only wanted to direct the carвђaвђcarnin a way that was best for the aiel yet those sisters wanted to direct the dragon reborn toward what was best for the world as they saw it she did not spare herself helping rand keeping him from putting himself at odds with aes sedai beyond recovery those meant guiding him too only iвђm right she reminded herself whatever i do is as much for his own good as for anybody elseвђs none of the others ever think about whatвђs right for him but it was best to remember that these women were more than simply her friends and followers of the carвђaвђcarn no one was ever simply anything she was learning i do not think you wished only to tell us you are now a woman chief among the wetlanders amys said over her teacup what troubles your mind egwene alвђvere what troubles me is what always does she smiled to lighten the mood sometimes i think rand is going to give me gray hairs before my time without men no woman would have gray hairs normally that would have been a joke on melaineвђs tongue and bair would have made another over the vast knowledge of men melaine had gained in just a few months of marriage but not this time all three women simply watched egwene and waited so they wished to be serious well rand was serious business she just wished she could be sure they saw it anything at all the way she did balancing her cup on her fingertips she told them everything about rand anyway and her fears since learning of the silence from caemlyn i donвђt know what heвђs done вђ or what she has everybody tells me how experienced merana is but sheвђs had none with the likes of him when it comes to aes sedai if you hid this cup in a meadow heвђd still manage to step on it inside three paces i know i could do better than merana but you could return bair suggested again and egwene shook her head firmly i can do more where i am as amyrlin and there are rules even for the amyrlin seat her mouth twisted for an instant she did not like admitting that especially not to these women i canвђt even visit him without the hallвђs permission iвђm aes sedai now and i have to obey our laws that came out more fiercely than she intended it was a stupid law but she had not yet found a way around it besides they wore so little expression she was sure they were snickering incredulously inside not even a clan chief had the right to say when or where a wise one could go the three women across from her exchanged long looks then amys set her teacup down and said merana ambrey and other aes sedai followed the carвђaвђcarnto the treekillersвђ city you need have no fear he will put his foot wrong with her or any of your sisters with her we will see that there is no difficulty between him and any aes sedai that hardly sounds like rand egwene said doubtfully so sheriam had been right about merana but why was she still silent bair cackled with laughter most parents have more trouble with their children than lies between the carвђaвђcarnand the women who came with merana ambrey so long as he isnвђt the child egwene chuckled relieved that someone was amused at something the way these women felt about aes sedai they would have been spitting nails if they thought any sister was gaining influence with him on the other hand merana had to gain some or she might as well leave now but merana should have sent a report i donвђt understand why she hasnвђt youвђre certain there isnвђt any вђ she could not think of how to finish there was no way that rand could have stopped merana from sending off a pigeon perhaps she sent a man on a horse amys grimaced faintly as much as any aiel she found riding repugnant your own legs were good enough she brought none of the birds that wetlanders use that was foolish of her egwene muttered foolish did not come close meranaвђs dreams would be shielded so there was no point trying to talk to her there even if they could be found light but it was vexing she leaned forward intently amys promise me you wonвђt try to stop him from talking with her or make her so angry she does something foolish they were quite capable of that more than capable they had putting an aes sedaiвђs back up perfected to a talent sheвђs just supposed to convince him that we mean him no harm iвђm sure elaida has some nasty surprise hidden behind her skirts but we donвђt she would see to that if anyone had different notions somehow she would promise me they passed unreadable looks back and forth they could not like the idea of letting a sister near rand certainly not unhindered doubtless one of them would contrive to be present whenever merana was but she could live with that so long as they did not hinder too much i promise egwene alвђvere amys said finally in a voice flat as worked stone probably she was offended that egwene had required a pledge but egwene felt as though a weight had lifted two weights rand and merana were not at each otherвђs throats and merana would have a chance to do what she had been sent to do i knew iвђd have the unvarnished truth from you amys i canвђt tell you how glad i am to hear it if anything were wrong between rand and merana thank you startled she blinked for an instant amys wore cadinвђsor she made some sort of small gesture too maiden handtalk perhaps neither bair nor melaine sipping their tea gave any sign that they had noticed amys must have been wishing she were somewhere else away from the tangle rand had made of everybodyвђs life it would be embarrassing shaming for a wise one dreamwalker to lose control of herself in telвђaranвђrhiodeven for an instant to the aiel shame hurt far worse than pain but it had to be witnessed to beshame if it was not seen or those who saw refused to admit it then it might as well never have happened a strange people but she certainly did not want to shame amys composing her face she went on as if nothing had happened i must ask a favor an important favor donвђt tell rand вђ or anybody вђ about me about this i mean to say she lifted an end of her stole their faces made an aes sedaiвђs best calm look maniacal stone was not in it i donвђt mean lie she added hastily under jiвђeвђtoh asking someone to lie was little better than telling one yourself just donвђt bring it up heвђs already sent somebody to вђrescueвђ me and wonвђt he be furious when he finds out i shuffled mat off to ebou dar with nynaeve and elayne she thought she had had to do it though i donвђt need rescuing and i donвђt want it but he thinks he knows better than everybody iвђm afraid he might come hunting for me himself which frightened her more вђ that he might appear in the camp alone raging with three hundred or so aes sedai around him or that he might come with some of the ashaвђman either way a disaster that would be unfortunate melaine murmured though she was seldom one for understatement and bair muttered the carвђaвђcarnis headstrong as bad as any man i have ever known and a few women for that matter we will hold your confidence close egwene alвђvere amys said gravely egwene blinked at the quick agreement but perhaps it was not so surprising to them the carвђaвђcarnwas only another chief just more so and wise ones had certainly been known to keep things from a chief they thought he should not know after that there was not much to say though they talked a while longer over more cups of tea she longed for a lesson in walking the dream but could not ask with amys there amys would go and she wanted her company more than learning the closest the wise ones came to telling her anything rand was actually doing was when melaine grumbled that he should finish the shaido and sevanna now and both bair and amys frowned at her so she turned bright red after all sevanna was a wise one as egwene knew quite bitterly not even the carвђaвђcarnwould be allowed to interfere with even a shaido wise one and she could not give them details of her own circumstances that they had leaped right to the most shaming part did nothing to lessen the shame she would feel talking about it вђ it was very hard not to drop back into behaving even thinking as the aiel did when she was around them for that matter she thought it might have shamed her had she never met an aiel вђ and the only sort of advice they had about dealing with aes sedai lately was of a nature that elaida herself would not try to follow an aes sedai riot unlikely as it sounded might result worse they already thought badly enough of aes sedai without her adding wood to the fire some day she wanted to forge a link between the wise ones and the white tower but that would never happen unless she managed to dampen that fire down another thing she had no idea how to do as yet i must go she said at last standing her body lay asleep in her tent but there was never quite enough rest in sleep while you were in telвђaranвђrhiod the others rose with her i hope you will all be very careful moghedien hates me and she would certainly try to hurt anyone whoвђs my friend she knows a great deal about the world of dreams at least as much as lanfear did that was as close as she could come to warning them without saying right out that moghedien might know more than they aiel pride could be prickly they took her meaning though and without offense if the shadowsouled meant to threaten us melaine said i think they would have by now perhaps they believe we are no threat to them we have glimpsed those who must be dreamwalkers including men bair shook her head incredulously no matter what she knew about the forsaken she considered male dreamwalkers about as common as legs on snakes they avoid us all of them i think we are as strong as they amys added in the one power she and melaine were no stronger than theodrin and faolain вђ far from weak indeed stronger than most aes sedai but far from a forsakenвђs strength too вђ yet in the world of dreams knowledge of telвђaranвђrhiodwas often as powerful as saidar more at times here bair was the equal of any sister but we will take care it is the enemy you underestimate who kills you egwene took amysвђ hand and melaineвђs and would have bairвђs had there been a way instead she included her with a smile iвђll never be able to tell you what your friendship means to me what you mean to me despite everything that was simple truth the whole world seems to be changing every time i blink you three are one of the few firm spots in it the world does change amys said sadly even mountains are worn away by the wind and no one can climb the same hill twice i hope we will always be friends in your eyes egwene alвђvere may you always find water and shade and with that they were gone back to their own bodies for a time she stood frowning at callandorbut not seeing it until suddenly she gave herself an exasperated shake she had been thinking about that endless field of stars if she waited there long gawynвђs dream would find her again swallow her the way his arms would shortly thereafter a pleasant way to spend the rest of the night and a childish waste of time firmly she made herself step back to her sleeping body but not to ordinary sleep she never did that anymore that one corner of her brain remained fully aware cataloging her dreams filing away those that foretold the future or at any rate gave glimpses of the possible course it might take at least she could tell that much now though the only one she had been able to interpret so far was the dream that told of gawyn becoming her warder aes sedai called this dreaming and the women who could do it dreamers all long dead but her yet it had no more to do with the one power than dreamwalking did perhaps it was inevitable she should dream first of gawyn because she had been thinking of him she stood in a vast dim chamber where everything was indistinct everything except gawyn slowly coming toward her a tall beautiful man вђ had she ever thought his halfbrother galad was more beautiful вђ with golden hair and eyes of the most wonderful deep blue he had some distance to cover yet but he could see her his gaze was fixed on her like an archerвђs on the target a faint sound of crunching and grating hung in the air she looked down and felt a scream building in her on bare feet gawyn walked across a floor of broken glass shards breaking at every slow step even in that faint light she could see the trail of blood left by his slashed feet she flung out a hand tried to shout for him to stop tried to run to him but just that quickly she was elsewhere in the way of dreams she floated above a long straight road across a grassy plain looking down upon a man riding a black stallion gawyn then she was standing in the road in front of him and he reined in not because he saw her this time but the road that had been straight now forked right where she stood running over tall hills so no one could see what lay beyond she knew though down one fork was his violent death down the other a long life and a death in bed on one path he would marry her on the other not she knew what lay ahead but not which way led to which suddenly he did see her or seemed to and smiled and turned his horse along one of the forks and she was in another dream and another another and again not all had any bearing on the future dreams of kissing gawyn of running in a cool spring meadow with her sisters the way they had as children slid by along with nightmares where aes sedai with switches chased her through endless corridors where misshapen things lurched through shadows all around where a grinning nicola denounced her to the hall and thom merrilin came forward to give evidence those she discarded the others she tucked away to be prodded and poked later in the hope she might understand what they meant she stood before an immense wall clawing at it trying to tear it down with her bare hands it was not made of brick or stone but countless thousands of discs each half white and half black the ancient symbol of the aes sedai like the seven seals that had once held the dark oneвђs prison shut some of those seals were broken now though not even the one power could break cuendillar and the rest had weakened somehow but the wall stood strong however she beat at it she could not tear it down maybe it was the symbol that was important maybe it was the aes sedai she was trying to tear down the white tower maybe mat sat on a nightshrouded hilltop watching a grand illuminatorвђs display of fireworks and suddenly his hand shot up seized one of those bursting lights in the sky arrows of fire flashed from his clenched fist and a sense of dread filled her men would die because of this the world would change but the world waschanging it always changed straps at waist and shoulder held her tightly to the block and the headsmanвђs axe descended but she knew that somewhere someone was running and if they ran fast enough the axe would stop if not in that corner of her mind she felt a chill logain laughing stepped across something on the ground and mounted a black stone when she looked down she thought it was randвђs body he had stepped over laid out on a funeral bier with his hands crossed at his breast but when she touched his face it broke apart like a paper puppet a golden hawk stretched out its wing and touched her and she and the hawk were tied together somehow all she knew was that the hawk was female a man lay dying in a narrow bed and it was important he not die yet outside a funeral pyre was being built and voices raised songs of joy and sadness a dark young man held an object in his hand that shone so brightly she could not see what it was on and on they came and she sorted feverishly desperately tried to understand there was no rest in it but it must be done she would do what must be done chapter female silhouettes an oath you asked to be wakened before the sun mother egweneвђs eyes popped open вђ she had set herself a time to wake only moments from now вђ and despite herself she started back against her pillow from the face above her stern through a sheen of perspiration it was not a pleasant sight first thing in the morning meriвђs manner was perfectly respectful but a pinched nose a permanently downturned mouth and dark eyes sharp with censure said she had never seen anyone half as good as they should be or pretended to be and her flat tone turned every meaning head to heels i hope you slept well mother she said while her expression managed a fair accusation of sloth her black hair in tight coils over her ears seemed to pull her face painfully the unrelieved drab dark gray she always wore however it made her sweat only added to the gloom it was a pity she had not managed a little real rest yawning egwene rose from her narrow cot and scrubbed her teeth with salt washed her face and hands while meri laid out her clothes for the day donned stockings and a clean shift then suffered herself to be dressed suffered was the word i fear some of these knots will pull mother the cheerless woman murmured drawing the brush through egweneвђs hair and egwene very nearly told her she had not deliberately tangled it in her sleep i understand we will rest here today mother bone idleness seethed meriвђs reflection in the standmirror this shade of blue will set off your coloring nicely mother meri said as she did up egweneвђs buttons her face an accusation of vanity filled with relief that she would have chesa tonight egwene donned the stole and fled almost before the woman finished not even a rim of the sun showed above the hills to the east the land humped up all around in long ridges and irregular mounds sometimes hundreds of feet high that often looked as though monstrous fingers had squeezed them shadows like twilight bathed the camp lying in one of the broad valleys between but it was well awake in the heat that never really lifted smells of breakfast cooking filled the air and people bustled about though there was none of the rush that would have meant a dayвђs marching ahead whiteclad novices darted about at a near run a wise novice always carried out her chores as quickly as she could warders never seemed hurried of course but even servants carrying the morning meal to aes sedai appeared to stroll this morning well almost in comparison to the novices the whole camp was taking advantage of the halt a clatter and curses as a jacklever slipped announced wagonwrights making repairs and a distant tapping of hammers told of farriers reshoeing horses a dozen candlemakers had their molds lined up already and the kettles heating to melt the carefully hoarded drippings and tagends of every candle that had been burned more big black kettles stood on fires to boil water for baths and laundry and men and women were heaping clothes up nearby egwene gave little notice to any of the activity the thing of it was she was certain meri did not do it apurpose she could not help her face even so she was as bad as it would be to have romanda for a maid the thought made her laugh out loud romanda as ladyвђs maid would have her mistress toeing the line in no time no doubt as to who would run and fetch in thatpair a grayhaired cook paused in raking coals from atop an iron oven to give her a grin of shared amusement for a moment anyway then he realized he was grinning at the amyrlin seat not just some young woman walking by and the grin melted crookedly as he jerked a bow before bending back to his work if she sent meri off romanda would only find a new spy and meri would again be starving her way from village to village adjusting her dress вђ she really had gone before the woman was quite finished вђ egweneвђs fingers found a small linen bag the strings tucked behind her belt she did not have to lift it all the way to her nose to smell rose petals and a blend of herbs with a cool scent it made her sigh a face like a headsmanвђs spying for romanda without any doubt and trying to perform her duties as well as she could why were these things never easy approaching the tent she used as a study вђ many called it the amyrlinвђs study as if it were rooms in the tower вђ a solemn satisfaction replaced worry over meri whenever they halted for a day sheriam would be there before her with fat sheaves of petitions a laundress imploring clemency on a charge of theft when she had been caught with the jewelry sewn into her dress or a blacksmith begging a testimonial for his work which he could not use unless he intended to leave and likely not then a harness maker asking the amyrlinвђs prayers for her to give birth to a daughter one of lord bryneвђs soldiers requesting the amyrlinвђs personal blessing to his wedding a seamstress there was always a slew from older novices appealing visits to tiana and even extra chores anyone had the right to petition the amyrlin but those in service to the tower seldom did and never novices egwene suspected that sheriam worked to dig up petitioners something to butter the catвђs paws to keep her out of sheriamвђs hair while the keeper took care of what she considered important this morning egwene thought she might make sheriam eat those petitions for her breakfast when she entered the tent though sheriam was not there which perhaps should not have been a surprise given the night before the tent was not empty however the light illumine you this morning mother theodrin said making a deep curtsy that set the brown fringe of her shawl swaying she had all the fabled domani grace though her highnecked dress was really quite modest domani women were not known for modesty we did as you commanded but no one saw anybody near mariganвђs tent last night some of the men remembered seeing halima faolain added sourly with a much briefer bend of her knees but aside from that they hardly recalled whether they went to sleep many women disapproved of delanaвђs secretary but it was her next remark that made faolainвђs round face darker than usual we met tiana while we were roaming about she told us to go to bed and be quick about it unconsciously she stroked the blue fringe on her shawl new aes sedai almost always wore their shawls more often than they needed to so siuan said giving them a smile she hoped was welcoming egwene took her place behind the small table carefully the chair tilted for a moment anyway until she reached down and pulled the leg straight an edge of folded parchment peeked out from beneath the stone inkwell her hands twitched toward it but she made them be still too many sisters saw little need for courtesy she would not be one of those besides these two had a claim on her i am sorry for your difficulties daughters made aes sedai by her decree on being raised amyrlin they faced the same predicament as she but lacking the added shield of the amyrlinвђs stole small shield that that had proved most sisters behaved as though they were still only accepted what went on inside the ajahs was seldom known outside but it was rumored that they truly had had to beg admittance and that guardians had been named to oversee their behavior no one had ever heard the like but everyone took it for fact she had done them no favor another thing that had been necessary though i will speak to tiana it might do some good for a day or an hour thank you mother theodrin said but there is no need to bother yourself still she also touched her shawl hands lingering tiana wanted to know why we were up so late she added after a moment but we didnвђt tell her there was no need for secrecy daughter a pity they had not found a witness though moghedienвђs rescuer would remain a shadow halfglimpsed always the most frightening sort she glanced at the tiny corner of parchment itching to read it maybe siuan had discovered something thank you both theodrin recognized a dismissal and made her manners to go but stopped when faolain remained where she was i wish i had held the oath rod already faolain told egwene in tones of frustration so you could know what i say is true this isnвђt the time to bother the amyrlin theodrin began then folded her hands and turned her attention to egwene patience blended with something else on her face clearly the stronger of the two in the power she always took the lead yet this time she was prepared to step back in aid of what egwene wondered it isnвђt the oath rod that makes a woman aes sedai daughter whatever some believed speak the truth to me and i will believe it i donвђt like you faolainвђs mop of dark curls swayed as she shook her head for emphasis you must know that you probably think i was mean when you were a novice when you came back to the white tower after running away but i still believe you didnвђt get half the punishment you should have maybe my admitting it will help you know i speak the truth it isnвђt as though we have no choice even now romanda offered to take us under her protection and so did lelaine they said theyвђd see we were tested and raised properly as soon we return to the tower her face grew angrier and theodrin rolled her eyes and broke in mother what faolain is fumbling all around without getting to the point is that we didnвђt attach ourselves to you because we had no choice and we didnвђt do it in gratitude for the shawl she pursed her lips as if thinking that raising them aes sedai in the manner egwene had was not really a gift to inspire much gratitude then why egwene asked leaning back the chair shifted but held faolain jumped in before theodrin could more than open her mouth because you are the amyrlin seat she still sounded angry we can see what happens some of the sisters think youвђre sheriamвђs puppet but most believe romanda or lelaine tells you where and when to step it is not right her face was twisted in a scowl i left the tower because what elaida did wasnвђt right they raised you amyrlin so i am yours if you will have me if you can trust me without the oath rod you must believe me and you theodrin egwene said quickly schooling her face knowing how the sisters felt was bad enough hearing it again was painful i am yours too theodrin sighed if youвђll have me she spread her hands disparagingly we are not much i know but it looks as though we are all you have i must admit i was hesitant mother faolain is the one who kept insisting we do this frankly she settled her shawl again unnecessarily and her voice firmed frankly i do not see how you can win out over romanda and lelaine but we are trying to behave as aes sedai even though we arenвђt really yet we will not be that mother whatever you say until the other sisters see us as aes sedai and that wonвђt happen until we have been tested and have sworn the three oaths plucking the folded scrap of parchment out from under the inkwell egwene fingered it while she thought faolain was the driving force behind this that seemed as unlikely as a wolf befriending the shepherd she suspected dislike was a mild word for what faolain felt for her and the woman must know egwene hardly saw her as a potential friend if they had accepted either sitterвђs arrangement mentioning the offer might be a good means of disarming her suspicions mother faolain said and stopped looking surprised at herself it was the first time she had addressed egwene so drawing a deep breath she went on mother i know you must have a hard time believing us since weвђve never held the oath rod but вђ i wish you would stop bringing that up egwene said it was well to be careful but she could not afford to refuse every offer of help for fear of plots do you think everybody believes aes sedai because of the three oaths people who know aes sedai know a sister can stand truth on its head and turn it inside out if she chooses to myself i think the three oaths hurt as much as they help maybe more i will believe you until i learn youвђve lied to me and i will trust you until you show you donвђt deserve it the same way everybody else does with one another come to think of it the oaths did not really change that you still had to take a sister on trust most of the time the oaths just made people warier about it wondering whether and how they were being manipulated another thing you two areaes sedai i donвђt want to hear any more about having to be tested or hold the oath rod or any of it bad enough you have to face that nonsense without parroting it yourselves have i made myself clear the two women standing on the other side of the table murmured hastily that she had then exchanged long looks this time it was faolain who appeared indecisive finally theodrin glided around to kneel beside egweneвђs chair and kiss her ring under the light and by my hope of salvation and rebirth i theodrin dabei swear fealty to you egwene alвђvere to faithfully serve and obey on pain of my life and honor she looked at egwene questioningly it was all egwene could do to nod this was no part of aes sedai ritual this was how noble swore to ruler even some rulers did not receive so strong an oath yet no sooner had theodrin risen with a relieved smile than faolain took her place under the light and by my hope of salvation and rebirth i faolain orande all that she could have wished for and more from any other sisters at least who were not just as likely to be sent to fetch anotherвђs dustcloak if the wind rose when faolain finished she remained kneeling but stiffly upright mother there is the matter of my penance for what i said to you about not liking you i will set it myself if you wish but it is your right her voice was as rigid as her posture yet not at all fearful she looked ready to stare down a lion eager to in fact biting her lip egwene nearly laughed aloud keeping her face smooth took effort maybe they would take it for a hiccough however much they claimed they were not really aes sedai faolain had just proved how much of one she was sometimes sisters set themselves penances in order to maintain the proper balance between pride and humility вђ that balance was much prized supposedly and the only reason given usually вђ but certainly none sought to have one imposed penance set by another could be quite harsh and the amyrlin was supposed to be harder in this than the ajahs either way though many sisters made a haughty display of submission to the greater will of the aes sedai an arrogant showing of their lack of arrogance the pride of humility siuan called it she considered telling the woman to eat a handful of soap just to see her expression вђ faolain had a mean tongue вђ but instead i donвђt hand out penance for telling the truth daughter or for not liking me dislike to your heartвђs content so long as you keep your oath not that anyone except a darkfriend would break that particular oath still there were ways around almost anything but weak sticks were better than none when you were fending off a bear faolainвђs eyes widened and egwene sighed as she motioned the woman to rise had their positions been reversed faolain wouldhave put her nose firmly in the dust iвђm setting you two tasks to begin daughters she went on they listened carefully faolain not even blinking theodrin with a thoughtful finger to her lips and this time when she dismissed them they said as you command mother in unison as they curtsied egweneвђs good mood was fleeting though meri arrived with her breakfast on a tray as theodrin and faolain departed and when egwene thanked her for the rosepetal pomander she said i had a few spare moments mother by her expression that could have been an accusation that egwene worked her too hard or that she herself did not work hard enough not a pleasant spice for the stewed fruit for that matter the womanвђs face might sour the mint tea and turn the warm crusty bun hard as a rock egwene sent her away before eating the tea was weak anyway tea was one of the things in short supply the note that had been under the inkwell proved no better seasoning nothing of interest in the dream said siuanвђs fine script so siuan had been in telвђaranвђrhiodlast night too she did a good deal of spying there it mattered little whether she had been hunting some sign of moghedien though that would have been insanely foolish or something else nothing was nothing egwene grimaced and not just for the nothing siuan in telвђaranвђrhiodlast night meant a visit from leane sometime today complaining siuan most definitely no longer was allowed any of the dream terвђangreal not since she had tried to teach some of the other sisters about the world of dreams it was not so much that she knew little more than they or even that few sisters believed they actually needed a teacher to learn anything but siuan possessed a tongue like a rasp and no patience usually she managed to hold her temper but two outbursts of shouting and fistshaking and she had been fortunate just to find herself denied access to the terвђangreal leane was given one whenever she asked though and frequently siuan used it in secret that was one of the few real bones of contention between them both would have been in telвђaranвђrhiodevery night if they could with a grimace egwene channeled the tiniest spark of fire to set a corner of the parchment alight and held it until it burned nearly to her fingers nothing left to be found by anyone rooting through her belongings and reported where it would rouse suspicions breakfast almost done she was still alone and that was not usual sheriam might well be avoiding her but siuan should have been there popping a last bit of the bun into her mouth and washing it down with a final swallow of tea she rose to go find her only to have the object of her intended search stalk into the tent had siuan had a tail she would have been lashing it where have you been egwene demanded weaving a ward against listeners aeldene pulled me out of my blankets first thing siuan growled dropping onto one of the stools she still thinks sheвђll pump the amyrlinвђs eyesandears out of me no one gets that no one when siuan had first arrived in salidar a stilled woman on the run a deposed amyrlin the world thought dead the sisters might well not have let her stay except that she knew not only the amyrlin seatвђs network of agents but also that of the blue ajah which she had run before being raised to the stole that had given her a certain influence just as leaneвђs agents inside tar valon had given her some the arrival of aeldene stonebridge who had taken her place with the blue eyesandears had changed matters for siuan aeldene had been outraged that reports from the handful of blue agents siuan had managed to reach had been handed to women outside the ajah that aeldeneвђs own position had been revealed вђ only two or three sisters were supposed to know even within the blue вђ infuriated her to near apoplexy she not only snatched back control of the blue network not only upbraided siuan in a voice that might have been heard a mile off she very nearly went for siuanвђs throat aeldene was from an andoran mining village in the mountains of mist and it was said her crooked nose came from fighting with her fists when she was a girl aeldeneвђs actions had started others thinking egwene returned to her unsteady chair and pushed her breakfast tray aside aeldene wonвђt take it away from you siuan and neither will anyone else when aeldene reclaimed the blue eyesandears others had begun thinking that the blue should not have the amyrlinвђs as well no one suggested that it should be in egweneвђs control the hall was to have it so romanda said and lelaine each intended to be the one in charge of course the one those reports came to first for being first to know had advantages aeldene thought those agents should be added to the blue network since siuan was blue at least sheriam was content simply to be handed all the reports siuan received which she usually was they canвђt make you give it up egwene filled her teacup again setting it and the blueglazed honeypot on the corner of the table nearest siuan but the other woman only stared at them the anger had gone out of her she slumped on the stool you never really think about strength she said half to herself youвђre aware of it whether youвђre stronger than somebody else but you donвђt think about it you just know that she defers to you or you to her there was no one stronger than me before no one since her eyes dropped to her hands stirring uneasily on her lap sometimes when romanda is hammering at me or lelaine it suddenly hits me like a gale theyвђre so far above me now i should be holding my tongue until they give me permission to speak even aeldene is and sheвђs no more than middling she forced her head upright mouth tight and voice bitter i suppose iвђm adjusting to reality thatвђs ingrained in us too driven deep before you ever test for the shawl but i donвђt like it i donвђt egwene picked up her pen from beside the inkwell and the sand jar fiddling with it while she chose words siuan you know how i feel about what needs to be changed thereвђs too much we do because aes sedai have always done it that way but things are changing no matter who believes it will all go back to how it was i doubt anyone else was ever raised amyrlin without being aes sedai first that should have elicited a comment on the white towerвђs hidden records вђ siuan often said there was nothing that had not occurred at least once in the towerвђs history though this did seem to be a first вђ but siuan sat there disheartened like a sack siuan the aes sedai way isnвђt the only way and not even always the best i intend to make sure we follow the best way and whoever canвђt learn to change or wonвђt had better learn to live with it leaning across the table she tried to make her expression encouraging i never did figure out how wise ones determine precedence but it isnвђt strength in the power there are women who can channel who defer to women who canвђt one sorilea would never have made it to accepted yet even the strongest jump when she says toad wilders siuan said dismissively but it lacked force aes sedai then i wasnвђt raised amyrlin because i am the strongest the wisest women are chosen for the hall or to be ambassadors or advisors the most skillful anyway not those with the most strength best not to say skillful in what though siuan certainly possessed those particular skills too the hall the hall might send me for tea they might have me sweep out when theyвђve finished sitting sitting back egwene threw down the pen she wanted to shake the woman siuan had kept going when she could not channel at all and now her knees began to fold egwene was on the point of telling her about theodrin and faolain вђ that should get some rise and approval вђ when she saw an oliveskinned woman ride past the open tent flaps looking lost in thought beneath the wide gray hat she wore to keep off the sun siuan itвђs myrelle letting the ward go she rushed outside myrelle she called siuan needed a victory to wash the taste of being bullied out of her mouth and this might be just the thing myrelle was one of sheriamвђs lot and apparently with a secret all her own reining in her sorrel gelding myrelle looked around and gave a start when she saw egwene by her expression the green sister had not realized what part of the camp she was passing through a thin dustcloak hung down the back of her pale gray riding dress mother she said hesitantly if you will forgive me i вђ i will not forgive you egwene cut in making her flinch any doubt vanished that myrelle had heard about last night from sheriam i will talk with you now siuan had come outside too but instead of watching the sister climb uneasily from her saddle she stared down the rows of tents toward a stocky graying man with a battered breastplate strapped over his buffcolored coat leading a tall bay in their direction his presence was a surprise lord bryne usually communicated with the hall by messenger and his rare visits mostly finished before egwene learned he had come siuan assumed such a look of aes sedai serenity it nearly made you forget her youthful face glancing briefly at siuan bryne made a leg handling his sword with a spare grace a weathered man he was only moderately tall but the way he carried himself made him seem taller there was nothing flashy about him the sweat on his broad face made him seem to be about a job of work mother may i speak with you alone myrelle turned as if to go and egwene snapped you stay right there right where you are myrelleвђs mouth dropped open her surprise seemed as much for her own obedience as egweneвђs decisive tone and it faded into bitter resignation that she quickly hid behind a cool faгade one belied by the way she twiddled her reins bryne did not even blink though egwene was sure he at least had an inkling of her situation she suspected that very little surprised him or unsettled him just the sight of him had made siuan ready to fight back for all it was apparently she who started most of their arguments already her fists rested on her hips and her gaze was fixed on him an auguring stare that should have made anyone uneasy even had it not come from an aes sedai myrelle offered more than helping siuan though perhaps i intended to ask you to come this afternoon lord bryne i ask now she had questions to put to him we can talk then if you will forgive me instead of accepting her dismissal he said mother one of my patrols found something just before dawn something i think you should see for yourself i can have an escort ready in вђ no need for that she broke in quickly myrelle you will come with us siuan would you ask someone to bring my horse please without delay riding out with myrelle would be better than confronting her here if siuanвђs patchedtogether clues really pointed at anything and on a ride she could ask bryne her questions but neither fueled her haste she had just spotted lelaine striding toward her through the tentrows takima at her side with one exception all the women who had been sitters before siuan was deposed had drifted to either lelaine or romanda most of the newly chosen sitters went their own way which was slightly better in egweneвђs view just slightly even at a little distance the set of lelaineвђs shoulders was evident she looked ready to walk through whatever got in her way siuan saw her as well and darted off without pausing for so much as a curtsy yet there was no time to make a clean escape short of leaping onto lord bryneвђs horse lelaine planted herself in front of egwene but it was bryne she fixed with eyes sharp as tacks considering calculating what he was doing there she had larger fish to put on the fire though i must speak with the amyrlin she said peremptorily pointing toward myrelle you will wait i will talk to you after bryne bowed not too deeply and led his horse where she pointed men who had any brains at all soon learned arguments did little good with aes sedai and with sitters the tally was usually none before lelaine could open her mouth romanda was suddenly there radiating command so strongly that at first egwene did not even notice varilin with her and the slender redhaired sitter for the gray was inches taller than most men the only surprise was that romanda had not appeared sooner she and lelaine watched one another like hawks neither allowing the other near egwene alone the glow of saidarsurrounded both women at the same instant and each wove a ward around the five of them to stop eavesdropping their eyes clashed challenging in faces utterly cool and collected but neither let her ward drop egwene bit her tongue in a public place it was up to the strongest sister present to decide whether a conversation should be warded and protocol said the amyrlin made that decision wherever she was present she had no desire for the notquite apologies mentioning it would bring though if she pressed they would accede of course while behaving as though soothing a petulant toddler she bit her tongue and boiled inside where wassiuan that was not fair вђ getting horses saddled required more than moments вђ but she wanted to grip her skirts to keep her hands away from her head romanda dropped the staring match first though not in defeat she rounded on egwene so suddenly that lelaine was left staring past her and looking foolish delana is making trouble again her highpitched voice was almost sweet but it held a sharpness that emphasized the lack of any title of respect romandaвђs hair was completely gray gathered in a neat bun on the nape of her neck but age had certainly not softened her takima with her long black hair and aged ivory complexion had been almost nine years a brown sitter as forceful in the hall as in the classroom yet she stood a meek pace back hands folded at her waist romanda led her faction as firmly as sorilea she was one to whom strength was indeed allimportant and in truth lelaine seemed not far behind she plans to lay a proposal before the hall lelaine put in sourly refusing to look at romanda at all now agreeing with the other woman certainly pleased her as little as speaking second aware that she had gained an edge romanda smiled a faint curving of her lips about what egwene asked playing for time she was certain she knew it was very hard not to sigh it was very hard not to rub her temples why the black ajah of course mother varilin replied lifting her head as if surprised at the question well she might be delana was rabid on the subject she wants the hall to condemn elaida openly as black she stopped abruptly when lelaine raised a hand lelaine allowed her followers more leeway than romanda or maybe she just did not have as tight a grip you must speak with her mother lelaine had a warm smile when she chose to use it siuan said they had been friends once вђ lelaine had accepted her back with some version of welcome вђ yet egwene thought that smile a practiced tool and say what her hands ached to soothe her head these two each made sure the hall passed only what she wanted certainly little that egwene suggested with the result that nothing much at all was passed and they wanted herto intercede with a sitter delana did support her proposals true вђ when they suited her delana was a weathervane turning with the last breath of air to pass and if she turned in egweneвђs direction a great deal of late it did not mean very much the black ajah seemed her only fixed point what was keeping siuan tell her she must stop mother lelaineвђs smile and tone made her seem to be counseling a daughter this foolishness вђ worse than foolishness вђ has everyone at daggersвђ points some of the sisters are even beginning to believe mother it will not be long before the notion spreads to the servants and the soldiers the look she directed toward bryne was full of doubt bryne appeared to be attempting to chat with myrelle who was staring at the warded group and running her reins uneasily through her gloved hands believing what is plain is hardly foolish romanda barked mother in her mouth that sounded entirely too much like girl the reason delana must be stopped is she does no good and considerable harm perhaps elaida is black вђ though i have strong doubts whatever secondhand gossip that trollop halima brought elaida is wrongheaded to a fault but i cannot believe her evil вђ yet even if she is trumpeting it will make outsiders suspicious of every aes sedai and drive the black into deeper hiding there are methods to dig them out if we donвђt frighten them into flight lelaineвђs sniff bordered on a snort even were this nonsense true no selfrespecting sister would submit to your methods romanda what youвђve suggested is close to being put to the question egwene blinked in confusion neither siuan nor leane had brought her a whisper of this luckily the sitters were not paying her enough mind to notice as usual planting her fists on her hips romanda squared around on lelaine desperate days demand desperate actions some might ask why anyone would put her dignity ahead of exposing the dark oneвђs servants that sounds dangerously near an accusation lelaine said eyes narrowing romanda was the one smiling now a cold flinty smile i will be the first to submit to my methods lelaine if you are the second lelaine actually growled taking half a step toward the other woman and romanda leaned toward her chin thrust out they looked ready to begin pulling hair and rolling in the dirt and aes sedai dignity be hanged varilin and takima glared at one another like two maidservants supporting their mistresses a longlegged wading bird in a scowling match with a wren the whole lot of them seemed to have forgotten egwene entirely siuan came running up in a broad straw hat leading a fat dun mare with whitestockinged hind legs and skidded to a halt when she saw the warded gathering one of the grooms was with her a lanky fellow in a long frayed vest and a patched shirt holding the reins of a tall roan the wards were invisible to him but saidardid not hide the faces his eyes went very wide and he began licking his lips for that matter passersby walked wide around the tent and pretended to see nothing aes sedai warders and servants alike bryne alone frowned and studied them as though wondering what was hidden from his ears myrelle was retying her saddlebags plainly on the point of leaving when you have decided what i should say egwene announced then i can decide what to do they really had forgotten her all four stared at her in amazement as she walked between romanda and lelaine and out through the doubled wards there was nothing to feel as she brushed by the weave of course they had never been made to stop anything as solid as a human body when she scrambled onto the roan myrelle drew a deep breath and emulated her in resignation the wards had vanished though the glow still enveloped the two sitters each more the image of frustration than the other as they stood watching hurriedly egwene donned the thin linen dustcloak that had been draped in front of her geldingвђs saddle and the riding gloves that were tucked into a small pocket in the cloak a widebrimmed hat hung from the saddleвђs high pommel deep blue to match her dress with a spray of white plumes pinned slanting across the front that shouted of chesaвђs hand heat she could ignore but the glare of the sun was another matter removing plumes and pin she tucked them into the saddlebags put the hat on her head and tied the ribbons beneath her chin shall we go mother bryne asked he was already mounted the helmet that had been hanging from his saddle now obscuring his face behind steel bars it looked quite natural on him as though he had been born for armor she nodded there was no attempt to stop them lelaine would not stoop to shouting halt in public of course but romanda egwene felt a sense of relief as they rode away yet her head seemed to be splitting what wasshe to do about delana what could she do the main road in this area a wide stretch of dirt packed so hard nothing could raise dust from it ran through the armyвђs camp and along the gap between that and the aes sedaiвђs bryne angled across it through the rest of the army on the other side although the army camp held thirty times or more as many people as the aes sedai camp there seemed to be few more tents than for the sisters and those who served them all scattered out across the flats and up the hillsides most of the soldiers slept in the open but then it was hard to remember the last time rain had fallen and there certainly was not a cloud to be seen strangely there were more women than in the sistersвђ camp though they seemed fewer at first glance among so many men cooks tended kettles and laundresses attacked great heaps of clothing while some worked with the horses or wagons a fair number appeared to be wives at least they sat about knitting or darning dresses or shirts or stirring small cookpots armorers had set up almost anywhere she looked hammers making steel ring on their anvils and fletchers adding arrows to bundles by their feet and farriers checking horses wagons of every sort and size stood everywhere hundreds perhaps thousands the army seemed to scoop up every one it found along its path most of the foragers were already out but a few highwheeled carts and lumbering wagons still trundled away in search of farms and villages here and there soldiers raised a cheer as they rode by lord bryne and the bull the bull that was his sigil nothing about aes sedai or the amyrlin seat egwene twisted around in her saddle to make sure myrelle was still close behind she was letting her horse follow on its own a faroff slightly sickly expression on her face siuan had taken a position at the rear shepherd to their lone sheep then again she might just have been afraid to urge her mount ahead the dun was positively a butterball but siuan would probably treat a pony like a warhorse egwene felt a stab of irritation at her own animal his name was daishar glory in the old tongue she would much rather be riding bela a shaggy little mare not much slimmer than siuanвђs dun that she had ridden out of the two rivers sometimes she thought she must look a doll perched atop a gelding that could be taken for a warhorse but the amyrlin had to have a proper mount no shaggy cart horses even if this rule was of her own making she felt as confined as a novice turning in the saddle she said do you expect any opposition ahead lord bryne he glanced at her sideways she had asked the same once before leaving salidar and twice while crossing altara not enough to rouse suspicions she thought murandy is like altara mother neighbor too busy scheming against neighbor or outright fighting him to band together for anything short of a war and not to any great degree then his tone was very dry he had been captaingeneral of the queenвђs guards in andor with years of border skirmishes against the murandians behind him andor will be another matter i fear i am not looking forward to that he turned another way climbing a gentle slope to avoid three wagons rumbling over rocks in the same direction egwene tried not to grimace andor before he had just said no these were the tail end of the cumbar hills somewhat south of lugard the capital of murandy even if they were lucky the border of andor lay at least ten days ahead and when we reach tar valon lord bryne how do you plan to take the city no one has asked me that yet mother she had only thought his voice was dry before nowit was dry by the time we reach tar valon the light willing iвђll have two or three times as many men as i do now egwene winced at the idea of paying so many soldiers he did not seem to notice with that i will lay siege the hardest part will be finding ships and sinking them to block northharbor and southharbor the harbors are as much the key as holding the bridge towns mother tar valon is larger than cairhien and caemlyn together once food stops going in he shrugged most of soldiering is waiting when it isnвђt marching and if you donвђt have that many soldiers she had never thought of all those people going hungry women and children she had never really thought of anyone being involved except the aes sedai and the soldiers how could she have been so foolish she had seen the results of war in cairhien bryne seemed to take it so lightly but then he was a soldier privation and death must be everyday to soldiers what if you only have say what you do now siege apparently some of what they had been saying had finally broken into whatever myrelle was thinking she booted the sorrel forward making a number of men jump aside some falling on their faces a few opened their mouths angrily then saw her ageless features and shut their jaws again glowering they might as well not have existed for all of her artur hawkwing besieged tar valon for twenty years and failed abruptly she realized ears were about and lowered her voice but it was still acid do you expect us to wait twenty years that acid washed over gareth bryne without leaving a stain would you prefer a direct assault right off myrelle sedai he could have been asking whether she wanted her tea sweet or bitter several of hawkwingвђs generals tried and their men were slaughtered no army has ever managed to breach tar valonвђs walls that was not strictly true egwene knew in the trolloc wars an army of dreadlordled trollocs had actually plundered and burned a part of the white tower itself at the end of the war of the second dragon an army trying to rescue guaire amalasan before he was gentled had reached the tower too myrelle could not know though much less bryne access to those secret histories hidden deep in the tower library was set out in a law that was itself secret and revealing the existence of either records or law was treason siuan said if you read between the lines you found hints of things that had not been recorded even there aes sedai were very good at hiding truth when they thought it necessary even from themselves with a hundred thousand or what i have now bryne continued i will be the first if i can block the harbors hawkwingвђs generals never managed that the aes sedai always raised those iron chains in time to stop the ships getting into the harbor mouth and sank them before they could be placed to hinder trade food and supplies got in it will come to your assault eventually but not until the cityвђs weakened if i have my way his voice was still ordinary a man discussing an outing his head turned toward myrelle and though his tone did not change the intensity in his eyes was evident even behind his faceguard and you all agreed i would when it came to the army i wonвђt throw men away myrelle opened her mouth then closed it slowly plainly she wanted to say something but did not know what they hadgiven their word she and sheriam and those who had been running things when he appeared in salidar however much giving it galled however much the sitters tried to get round it theyhad given no word bryne acted as though they had though and so far he had managed to get away with it so far egwene felt ill she hadseen war images flashed in her head men fighting killing their way through the streets of tar valon dying her eyes fell on a squarejawed fellow chewing his tongue while he sharpened a pikehead would he die in those streets the grizzled balding man running his fingers so carefully down each arrow before sliding the shaft into his quiver and there that lad swaggering in his high riding boots he looked too young to shave light so many were boys how many would die for her for justice for the right for the world but at the heart for her siuan raised her hand but did not complete the gesture had she been close enough she could not pat the amyrlin seat on the shoulder where everyone could see egwene straightened her back lord bryne she said in a tight voice what is it you want me to see she thought he halfglanced at myrelle before answering better you see it for yourself mother egwene thought her head might break open if siuanвђs clues led to anything at all she might just skin myrelle if they did not she might skin siuan and she might throw gareth bryne in for good measure chapter snakey square a morning of victory the crooked hills and ridges surrounding the camp showed every sign of the drought and unseasonable heat the unholy heat in truth even the dullest scullion scrubbing pots saw the dark oneвђs touch on the world the true forest lay behind them to the west but twisted oaks grew out of the rocky slopes sourgums arid pines of unfamiliar shape and trees egwene had no names for brown and yellow and barebranched not winterbare or brown starved for moisture and coolness dying if the weather did not change soon beyond the last of the soldiers a river ran off south and west the reisendrelle twenty paces wide and flanked on either side by hardbaked mud studded with stones swirling around rocks that might have made crossing hazardous in other days the water rose short of the horsesвђ knees as they forded egwene felt her own problems dwindle in size despite her head she offered a small prayer for nynaeve and elayne their search was as important as anything she did more the world would live if she failed but they had to succeed they traveled southward at an easy canter slowing when the hillside slant of the land grew too great or the horses had to climb any distance through trees and sparse scrub but keeping to the lowland as much as possible and covering ground quickly bryneвђs bignosed gelding surefooted and strong hardly seemed to mind which way the ground tilted or whether smooth or rough yet daishar kept pace easily sometimes siuanвђs plump animal labored though she might just have been picking up her riderвђs anxiety no amount of practice could make siuan anything but a terrible rider nearly throwing her arms around the mareвђs neck climbing upslope almost falling from the saddle going down awkward as a duck afoot on the flats and not far from wideeyed as the horse myrelle actually regained some of her humor watching siuan her own whitefooted sorrel picked her way in delicate swoops like a swallow and myrelle rode with an assurance and flare that made bryne appear stolid and workmanlike before they had gone very far riders appeared atop a high ridge to the west perhaps a hundred men in column the rising sun glinting off breastplates and helmets and lance points at their head streamed a long white pennant egwene could not make out but she knew it bore the red hand she had not expected to see them so close to the aes sedai camp dragonsworn animals myrelle muttered watching the horsemen parallel their route her gloved hands tightened on her reins вђ with fury not fear the band of the red hand puts out patrols bryne said placidly with a glance at egwene he added lord talmanes seems concerned about you mother last i spoke to him he put no more emphasis on that than the other youвђve spokenwith him every vestige of myrelleвђs serenity vanished the anger she had to hold in with egwene she could safely unleash on him she all but shook with it that is very close to treason lord bryne it might well betreason siuan had been dividing her attention between her horse and the men on the ridge and she did not look at myrelle but she stiffened no one had tied the band and treason together before they rounded a bend in the hill valley a farm clung to a hillside or what had been a farm once one wall of the small stone house had collapsed and a few charred timbers stuck up beside the sootcoated chimney like grimy fingers the roofless barn was a blackened hollow box of stone and scattered ash marked where sheds might once have stood all across altara they had seen as bad and worse entire villages sometimes the dead lying in the streets food for ravens and foxes and feral dogs that fled when people came close stories of anarchy and murder in tarabon and arad doman suddenly had flesh and bones many men seized any excuse to turn bandit or settle old grudges вђ egwene hoped fervently it was so вђ but the name on every survivorвђs lips was dragonsworn and the sisters blamed rand as surely as if he had carried the torches himself they would use him still if they could though control him if they found a way she was not the only aes sedai to believe in doing what she must even when she had to hold her nose myrelleвђs anger affected bryne as little as rain affected a boulder egwene had a sudden image of storms whirling about his head and floodwaters swirling around his knees while he just kept striding ahead myrelle sedai he said with the calm she should have shown when ten thousand men or more are shadowing my backtrail i want to know what their intentions are especially this particular ten thousand or more this was a dangerous topic however happy egwene was that they were past questions of talmanesвђ concern over her she should have been grinding her teeth that he had mentioned her at all but she was so startled she sat bolt upright in her saddle ten thousand are you sure the band had had little more than half that when mat brought it to salidar hunting her and elayne bryne merely shrugged i gather recruits as i go and so does he not as many but some men have notions about serving aes sedai more people than not would have been distinctly uneasy saying that to three sisters he said it with a wry smile besides it seems the band has a certain reputation from the fighting in cairhien the tale is shen an calharnever loses whatever the odds that was what drove men to join here as back in altara the thought that two armies must mean a battle trying to stand aside might end as hard as choosing the wrong side at best there would be no pickings for neutrals iвђve had a few deserters to my ranks from talmanesвђ newlings some seem to think the bandвђs luck is tied up in mat cauthon and canвђt be there without him something close to a sneer twisted myrelleвђs lips these fool murandiansвђ fears are certainly useful but i did not think you were a fool too talmanes follows us because he fears we might turn against his precious lord dragon but if he truly intended to attack donвђt you think he would have by now these dragonsworn can be dealt with once more important matters are done communicating with him however giving herself a shake she managed to regain her serenity on the surface at least her tone could still have scorched wood you mark me lord bryne egwene let myrelleвђs words pass her by bryne had looked at her when he mentioned mat the sisters thought they knew the situation with the band and mat and did not think on it much but bryne apparently did tilting her head so the brim of her hat obscured her face she studied him from the corner of her eye he was oathbound to build the army and lead it until elaida was brought down but why had he sworn surely he could have found some lesser oath and it surely would have been accepted by sisters who only thought to use all those soldiers as a foolday mask to frighten elaida having him on their side was comforting even the other aes sedai seemed to feel that like her father he was the sort of man who made you believe there was no cause for panic whatever the situation having him oppose her she realized suddenly might be as bad as having the hall against her and never mind the army the one approving comment siuan had ever had of him was that he was formidable even if she did try to change her remark immediately to mean something else any man siuan sanche thought formidable was one to be mindful of they splashed across a tiny stream a rivulet that barely wet the horsesвђ hooves a bedraggled crow feeding on a fish that had stranded itself in water too shallow to swim fluttered its tattered wings on the edge of flight then settled back to its meal siuan also was studying bryne вђ the mare made much easier going when she forgot to saw at the reins or dig her heels in at just the wrong moment egwene had asked her about lord bryneвђs motives but siuanвђs own tangled connection to the man left her little except acid when it came to him she either hated gareth bryne to his bootsoles or loved him and imagining siuan in love was like imagining that crow swimming the ridgeline where the bandвђs soldiers had been showed only cockeyed lines of dead conifers now she had not noticed them going mat had a reputation as a soldier crows swimming did not come close she had believed he commanded only because of rand and that had been hard enough to swallow believing because you think you know is dangerous she reminded herself eyeing bryne should be flogged myrelleвђs voice still burned i warn you if i hear that youвђve met with this dragonsworn again rain washing over that boulder as far as bryne was concerned or so it seemed he rode easily occasionally murmuring yes myrelle sedai or no myrelle sedai without any hint of distress and without lessening the watch he kept on the countryside no doubt hehad seen the soldiers leave however he mustered the patience вђ egwene was sure fear was no part of it вђ she was in no mood to listen to that be quiet myrelle no one is going to do anything to lord bryne rubbing her temple she thought of asking one of the sisters back in the camp for healing neither siuan nor myrelle had much ability there not that healing would do any good if it was just lack of sleep and worry not that she wanted whispers spreading that the strain was growing too great for her besides there were other ways to deal with headaches than healing although not here myrelleвђs mouth tightened only for an instant with a toss of her head she turned her face away color in her cheeks and bryne suddenly appeared absorbed in examining a redwinged hawk wheeling off to their left even a brave man could know when to be discreet folding its wings the hawk plummeted toward unseen prey behind a stand of bedraggled leatherleafs egwene felt that way swooping on targets she could not see hoping she had chosen the right one hoping there was a target there she drew breath wishing it were steadier just the same lord bryne i think itвђs best you donвђt meet talmanes again surely you know as much of his intentions as you need by this time light send talmanes had not said too much already a pity she could not send siuan or leane to caution him if he would take it but given feelings among the sisters she might as well risk going to see rand bryne bowed in his saddle as you command mother there was no mockery in his tone there never was he had obviously learned to school his voice around aes sedai siuan hung back frowning at him perhaps she could dig out where his loyalties lay for all her animosity she spent a great deal of time in his company much more than she absolutely had to with an effort egwene kept her hands on daisharвђs reins away from her head how much further lord bryne keeping impatience from her voice was more difficult just a little way mother for some reason he halfway turned his head to look at myrelle not far now increasingly farms dotted the region as many clinging to hillsides as on the flats though the emondвђs fielder in egwene said that made no sense low gray stone houses and barns and unfenced pastures with a few slatribbed cows and sadlooking blacktailed sheep not all had been burned by far only one here and one there supposedly the burnings were to let the others know what would happen if they did not declare for the dragon reborn at one farm she saw some of lord bryneвђs foragers with a wagon that they were his was plain as much by the way he eyed them and nodded as by the lack of a white pennant the band always flaunted itself aside from the banners some had of late taken to wearing a red scarf tied around the arm half a dozen cattle and maybe two dozen sheep lowed and baaed under the guard of men on horseback and other men toted sacks from barn to wagon past a slumpshouldered farmer and his family a sullen lot in dark rough woolens one of the little girls wearing a deep bonnet like the others had her face pressed to her motherвђs skirts apparently crying some of the boys had their fists clenched as if they wanted to fight the farmer would be paid but if he could not really spare what was taken if he had had a mind to resist close on twenty men in breastplates and helmets those burned farms would have given him pause quite often bryneвђs soldiers found charred corpses in the ruins men and women and children who had died trying to get out sometimes the doors and windows had been sealed up from outside egwene wondered whether there was any way to convince the farmers and villagers that there was a difference between the brigands and the army she wanted to very much but she did not see how short of letting her own soldiers go hungry until they deserted if the sisters could see no difference between the brigands and the band there seemed no hope for the country folk as the farm dwindled behind them she resisted the urge to twist around in her saddle and look back looking would change nothing lord bryne was as good as his word perhaps three or four miles from the camp вђ three or four in a straight line twice that over the country they had crossed вђ they rounded the shoulder of a hill spotted with brush and trees and he drew rein the sun stood almost halfway to its crest now another road ran below narrower and much more winding than the one through the camp they had the idea traveling by night would take them safe past the bandits he said not a bad notion as it turns out or else theyвђve just had the dark oneвђs own luck theyвђve come from caemlyn a merchant train of some fifty large wagons behind teams of ten or so lay stretched out along the road halted under the eyes of more of bryneвђs soldiers a few of the soldiers were afoot supervising the transfer of barrels and bags from the merchantsвђ wagons to half a dozen of their own one woman in a plain dark dress waved her arms and pointed vigorously to this item or that either protesting or bargaining but her fellows stood in a glum silent knot a short way farther up the road grim fruit decorated the spreading limbs of an oak men hanging by the neck from every bare branch bare except for crows almost enough to make the tree seem leafed in black they had larger than fish to feed on these birds even at a distance it was not a sight to ease egweneвђs head or her stomach this what you wanted me to see the merchants or the bandits she could hot see a dress on any of those dangling corpses and when the bandits hanged people they included women and children anyone could have put the corpses there bryneвђs soldiers the band вђ that the band hanged any of the socalled dragonsworn they caught made little difference to the sisters вђ or even some local lord or lady had the murandian nobles worked together all the brigands might have hung from trees by now but that was like asking cats to dance wait he had said caemlyn is it something to do with rand or the ashaвђman this time he looked from her to myrelle and back quite openly myrelleвђs hat cast shadows on her face she appeared sunk in gloom sagging in her saddle and not at all the confident rider she had been earlier he seemed to reach a decision i thought you should hear before anybody else did but perhaps i misunderstood he eyed myrelle again hear what you hairyeared lump siuan growled thumping the fat mare closer with her heels egwene made a soothing gesture toward her myrelle can hear anything i do lord bryne she has my complete trust the green sisterвђs head jerked around from her stricken look anyone would doubt they had heard egwene correctly but after a moment bryne nodded i see that matters have changed yes mother removing his helmet he set it on the pommel of his saddle he still seemed reluctant picking his words with care merchants carry rumors the way dogs do fleas and that lot down there has a fine crop i donвђt say any of it is true of course but it was odd seeing him so hesitant mother one tale that caught them up on the road is that rand alвђthor has gone to the white tower and sworn fealty to elaida for a moment myrelle and siuan looked much alike blood draining from their faces as they envisioned catastrophe myrelle actually swayed in her saddle for a moment egwene could only stare at him then she startled herself and the others by bursting out laughing daishar danced in surprise and settling him on the rocky slope settled her nerves as well lord bryne she said patting the geldingвђs neck that isnвђt so believe me i know it for a fact as of last night siuan heaved an instant sigh and myrelle was only a heartbeat behind egwene felt like laughing again at their expressions so incredibly relieved they were wideeyed children who had been told the shadowman was not under the bed aes sedai calm indeed thatвђs good to hear bryne said flatly but even if i sent away every man down there the tale will still reach my ranks it will go through the army like wildfire crossing these hills that cut her mirth short that could be disaster left alone i will have sisters announce the truth to your soldiers tomorrow will six aes sedai who know of themselves be enough myrelle here and sheriam carlinya and beonin anaiya and morvrin those sisters would not like having to meet with the wise ones but they would not be able to refuse her either would not want to really to stop this tale spreading should not want to at least myrelleвђs tiny wince was followed by a resigned twist of her mouth leaning an elbow on his helmet bryne studied egwene and myrelle he never so much as peeked at siuan his bay stamped a hoof on the rocks and a covey of some sort of dove with bright blue wings whirred into the air from beneath bushes a few paces away making daishar and myrelleвђs roan start skittishly bryneвђs mount did not stir he had heard of the gateways without doubt though he surely knew nothing of what they were вђ aes sedai did keep secrets by habit and had some hope of keeping that one from elaida вђ and he certainly knew nothing at all about telвђaranвђrhiodвђ that vital secret was easier to guard with no manifestations anyone could see вђ yet he did not ask how perhaps he was accustomed to aes sedai and secrets by now so long as they say the words straight he said at last if they hedge even a hair his stare was not an attempt to intimidate just to drive the point home he seemed satisfied by what he saw in her face you do very well it appears mother i wish you continued success set your time for this afternoon and i will come we should confer regularly i will come whenever you send for me we should begin making firm plans how to put you on the amyrlin seat once we reach tar valon his tone was guarded вђ very likely he still was not entirely sure what was going on or how far he could trust myrelle вђ and it took her a moment to realize what he had done it made her breath catch maybe she was just becoming too used to the way aes sedai shaded words but bryne had just said the army was hers she was sure of it not the hallвђs and not sheriamвђs hers thank you lord bryne that seemed little enough especially when his careful nod his eyes steady on hers seemed to confirm her belief suddenly she had a thousand more questions most of which she could not ask even were they alone a pity she could not take him into her confidence completely caution until youвђre sure and then a little more caution an old saying that applied very well to any dealings that brushed against aes sedai and even the best men would talk things over with their friends perhaps especially when things were supposed to be secret iвђm sure you have a thousand details to see to whatвђs left of the morning she said gathering her reins you go on back we will ride a little more bryne protested of course he almost sounded like a warder talking of the impossibility of watching every way at once and how an arrow in the back could kill an aes sedai as quickly as it could anyone else the next man who told her that she decided was going to pay for it three aes sedai were surely the equal of three hundred men in the end for all his grumbles and grimaces he had no choice but to obey donning his helmet he started his horse down the uneven slope toward the merchant train instead of back the way they had come but that was even better from her point of view will you lead the way siuan she said when he was a dozen strides below siuan glared after him as though he had been badgering her the whole time with a snort she tugged her straw hat straight wheeled her mare around вђ well dragged her around вђ and heeled the stout animal to a walk egwene motioned myrelle to follow like bryne the woman had no choice at first myrelle directed sidelong glances at her plainly expecting her to bring up the sisters sent to the white tower plainly gathering excuses for why they had to be kept secret even from the hall the longer egwene rode in silence the more uneasily the other shifted in her saddle myrelle began wetting her lips fine cracks spreading in that aes sedai calm a veryuseful tool silence for a time the only sounds were their horsesвђ hooves and the occasional cry of a bird in the brush but as siuanвђs direction became clear angling a little west from the path back to the camp myrelleвђs shifting increased until she might have been sitting on nettles maybe there was something to those bits and pieces siuan had gathered after all when siuan took another turn westward between two misshapen hills that bent toward each other myrelle drew rein there there is a waterfall in that direction she said pointing east not very large even before the drought but quite pretty even now siuan stopped too looking back with a small smile what could myrelle be hiding egwene was curious glancing at the green sister she gave a start at a single bead of perspiration on the womanвђs forehead glistening in the shadow just at the edge of her wide gray hat she most certainly wanted to know what could shake an aes sedai enough to make her sweat i think siuanвђs way will offer even more interesting sights donвђt you egwene said turning daishar and myrelle seemed to fold in on herself come along you know everything donвђt you myrelle muttered unsteadily as they rode between the leaning hills more than one drop of sweat decorated her face now she was shaken to her core everything how could you suddenly she jerked upright in her saddle staring at siuanвђs back her siuanвђs been your creature from the beginning she sounded almost indignant how could we have been so blind but i still donвђt understand we were so circumspect if you want to keep something hidden siuan said contemptuously over her shoulder donвђt try to buy coin peppers this far south what in the world were coin peppers and what were they talking about myrelle shuddered it was a measure of how upset she was that siuanвђs tone brought no quick snap to put the other woman in her places instead she licked her lips as though they were suddenly very dry mother you have to understand why i did it why we did it the frantic edge to her voice was fit for confronting half the forsaken and her in her shift not just because moiraine asked not just because she was my friend i hate letting them die i hate it the bargain we make is hard on us sometimes but harder on them you must understand you must just when egwene thought she was about to reveal everything siuan halted her round mare again and faced them egwene could have slapped her it might go easier with you myrelle if you lead the rest of the way she said coldly disgustedly in fact cooperation might mean mitigation a little yes myrelle nodded hands working incessantly on the reins yes of course she looked on the point of tears as she took the lead siuan falling in behind appeared relieved for just an instant egwene thought she herself was going to burst what bargain with whom letting who die and who was we sheriam and the others but myrelle would have heard and exposing her own ignorance hardly seemed advisable at this point an ignorant woman who keeps her mouth shut will be thought wise the saying went and there was another keeping the first secret always means keeping ten more there was nothing for it but to follow holding everything in siuan was going to get a talkingto though the woman was notsupposed to be keeping secrets from her grinding her teeth egwene tried to appear patient unconcerned wise almost back to the road the camp was on a few miles to the west myrelle led the way up a low flattopped hill covered with pine and leatherleaf two huge oaks kept anything else from growing in the wide depression on the crown beneath thick intertwined branches stood three peaked tents of patched canvas and a picket line of horses with a cart nearby and five tall warhorses each carefully picketed away from the others nisao dachen in a simply cut bronzecolored riding dress waited under the awning in front of one of the tents as if to welcome guests with sarin hoigan at her side in the olive green coat so many of the gaidin wore a baldheaded stump of a man with a thick black beard nisaoвђs warder still stood taller than she a few paces away two of myrelleвђs three gaidin warily watched them descend into the hollow croi makin slender and yellowhaired and nuhel dromand dark and bulky with a beard that left his upper lip bare no one looked surprised in the least obviously one of the warders had been keeping guard and given warning nothing in sight warranted all the secrecy though or myrelleвђs liplicking for that matter if nisao waited in welcome why did her hands keep stroking her divided skirts she looked as if she would rather face elaida while shielded two women peering around a corner of one of the tents ducked back hurriedly but not before egwene recognized them nicola and areina suddenly she felt very uneasy what had siuan brought her to siuan showed no nervousness at all as she dismounted bring him out myrelle now she was getting her own back with a vengeance her tone made a file seem smooth itвђs too late for hiding myrelle barely managed a frown at being addressed so and it appeared an effort visibly pulling herself together she jerked her hat from her head and climbed down without a word glided to one of the tents and vanished inside nisaoвђs already big eyes followed her growing wider by the moment she seemed frozen to the spot no one but siuan was near enough to overhear why did you break in egwene demanded softly as she got down iвђm sure she was about to confess whatever it is and i still donвђt have a clue coin peppers very popular in shienar and malkier siuan said just as quietly i only heard that after i left aeldene this morning i had to make her lead the way i didnвђt know it not exactly it would hardly have done much good to let her discover that now would it i didnвђt know about nisao either i thought they hardly ever spoke to one another she glanced at the yellow sister and gave her head an irritated shake a failure to learn something was a failure siuan did not tolerate well in herself unless iвђve gone blind andstupid what these two grimacing as though she had a mouthful of something rotten she spluttered trying to find a name to fit abruptly she caught egweneвђs sleeve here they come now youвђll see for yourself myrelle left the tent first then a man in just boots and breeches who had to duck low through the doorflaps a bared sword in his hand and scars crisscrossing his lightly furred chest he was head and shoulders and more taller than her taller than any of the other warders his long dark hair held by a braided leather cord around his temples was more streaked with gray than when egwene has seen him last but there was nothing at all soft in lan mandragoran pieces of the puzzle suddenly clicked into place yet it still would not come apart for her he had been warder to moiraine the aes sedai who had brought her and rand and the rest out of the two rivers what seemed an age ago but moiraine was dead killing lanfear and lan had gone missing in cairhien right after maybe it was all clear to siuan to her it was mostly mud murmuring something to lan myrelle touched his arm he flinched slightly like a nervous horse but his hard face never turned from egwene finally though he nodded and pivoted on his heel strode farther away beneath the branches of the oaks gripping the sword hilt in both hands above his head blade slanted down he rose onto the ball of one booted foot and stood motionless for a moment nisao frowned at him as though she too saw a puzzle then her gaze met myrelleвђs and together their eyes swept to egwene instead of coming to her they went to each other exchanging hasty whispers at least it was an exchange at first then nisao merely stood there shaking her head in disbelief or denial you dropped me into this she groaned aloud at last i was a blind fool to listen to you this should be interesting siuan said as they finally turned toward her and egwene the twist she gave the word made it sound decidedly unpleasant myrelle and nisao hurriedly touched hair and dresses as they crossed the short distance making certain everything was in order perhaps they had been caught out вђ in whategwene wondered вђ but apparently they intended to put the best face they could on matters if you will step inside mother myrelle said gesturing to the nearest tent only the slightest tremor in her voice betrayed her cool face the sweat was gone wiped away of course but it had not returned thank you no daughter some wine punch nisao asked with a smile hands clasped at her breast she looked anxious anyway siuan go tell nicola to bring the punch siuan did not move and nisao blinked in surprise her mouth thinning the smile returned in an instant though and she raised her voice a little nicola child bring the punch made with dried blackberries i fear she confided to egwene but quite restorative i donвђt want punch egwene said curtly nicola emerged from behind the tent yet she showed no sign of running to obey instead she stood staring at the four aes sedai chewing her underlip nisao flashed a glare of what could only be called distaste but said nothing another piece of the puzzle snapped into place and egwene breathed a trifle easier what i want daughter what i require is an explanation best face or no it was a thin veneer myrelle stretched out a pleading hand mother moiraine did not choose me just because we were friends two of my warders belonged first to sisters who died avar and nuhel no sister has saved more than one in centuries i only became involved because of his mind nisao said hastily i have some interest in diseases of the mind and this must rightly be called one myrelle practically dragged me into it smoothing her skirts myrelle directed a dark look at the yellow that was returned with interest mother when a warderвђs aes sedai dies it is as though he swallows her death and is consumed by it from the inside he вђ i know that myrelle egwene broke in sharply siuan and leane had told her a good bit though neither knew she had asked because she wanted to know what to expect with gawyn a poor bargain myrelle had called it and perhaps it was when a sisterвђs warder died grief enveloped her she could control it somewhat sometimes hold it in but sooner or later it gnawed a way out however well siuan managed when others were around she still wept alone many nights for her alric killed the day she was deposed yet what were even months of tears compared with death itself the stories were full of warders dying to avenge their aes sedai and indeed it was very often the case a man who wanted to die a man looking for what could kill him took risks not even a warder could survive perhaps the most horrible part of it to her was that they knew knew what their fate would be if their aes sedai died knew what drove them when she did knew nothing they did could change it she could not imagine the courage required to accept the bargain knowing she stepped aside so she could see lan clearly he still stood motionless not even seeming to breathe apparently forgetting the tea nicola had seated herself crosslegged on the ground to watch him areina squatted on her heels at nicolaвђs side with her braid pulled over her shoulder staring even more avidly much more avidly actually since nicola sometimes darted furtive glances at egwene and the others the rest of the warders made a small cluster pretending to watch him too while keeping a close eye on their aes sedai a more than warm breeze stirred ruffling the dead leaves that carpeted the ground and with shocking suddenness lan was moving shifting from stance to stance blade a whirling blur in his hands faster and faster till he seemed to sprint from one to the next yet all as precise as the movements of a clock she waited for him to stop or at least slow but he did not faster areinaвђs mouth slowly dropped open eyes going wide with awe and for that matter so did nicolaвђs they leaned forward children watching candy set to dry on the kitchen table even the other warders really divided their attention between their aes sedai and him now but in contrast to the two women they watched a lion that might charge any moment i see you are working him hard egwene said that was part of the method for saving a warder few sisters were willing to make the attempt given the rate of failure and the cost of it to themselves keeping him from risks was another and bonding him again that was the first step without doubt myrelle had taken care of that little detail poor nynaeve she might well strangle myrelle when she learned then again she might countenance anything that kept lan alive maybe for lanвђs part he deserved the worst he received letting himself be bonded by another woman when he knew nynaeve was pining for him she thought she had kept her voice clear but something of what she felt must have crept through because myrelle began trying to explain again mother passing a bond is not that bad why in point of fact itвђs no more than a woman deciding who should have her husband if she dies to see he is in the right hands egwene stared at her so hard that she stepped back almost tripping over her skirts it was only shock though every time she thought she had heard of the strangest possible custom another popped up stranger still we arenвђt all ebou dari myrelle siuan said dryly and a warder isnвђt a husband for most of us myrelleвђs head came up defiantly some sisters did marry a warder a handful not many married at all no one inquired too closely but rumor said she had married all three of hers which surely violated custom and law even in ebou dar not that bad you say myrelle not that bad siuanвђs scowl matched her tone she sounded as if she had a vile taste in her mouth there is no law against it nisao protested to egwene not siuan no law against passing a bond siuan received a frown that should have made her step back and shut her mouth she was having none of it though thatвђs not the point is it she demanded even if it hasnвђt been done in вђ what four hundred years or more вђ even if customs havechanged you might have escaped with a few stares and a little censure if all you and moiraine had done was pass his bond between you but he wasnвђt asked was he he was given no choice you might as well have bonded him against his will in fact you bloody well did at last the puzzle came clear for egwene she knew she should feel the same disgust as siuan aes sedai put bonding a man against his will on a level with rape he had as much chance to resist as a farmgirl would if a man the size of lan cornered her in a barn if three men the size of lan did sisters had not always been so particular though вђ a thousand years earlier it would hardly have been remarked вђ and even today an argument could sometimes be made as to whether a man had actually known what he was agreeing to hypocrisy was a fine art among aes sedai sometimes like scheming or keeping secrets the thing was she knew he had resisted admitting his love for nynaeve some nonsense about how he was bound to be killed sooner or later and did not want to leave her a widow men always did spout drivel when they thought they were being logical and practical would nynaeve have let him walk away unbonded had she had the chance whatever he said would she herself let gawyn he had said he would accept yet if he changed his mind nisaoвђs mouth worked but she could not find the words she wanted she glared at siuan as though it were all her fault yet that was nothing alongside the scowl she directed at myrelle i should never have listened to you she growled i must have been mad somehow myrelle still managed to maintain a smooth face but she wavered a little as though her knees had gone weak i did not do it for myself mother you must believe that it was to save him as soon as he is safe i will pass him on to nynaeve the way moiraine wanted just as soon as sheвђs вђ egwene flung up a hand and myrelle stopped as if she had clapped it over her mouth you mean to pass his bond to nynaeve myrelle nodded uncertainly nisao much more vigorously scowling siuan muttered something about doubling a wrong making it three times as bad lan stillhad not slowed two grasshoppers whirred up from the leaves behind him and he spun sword flicking them out of the air without a pause are your efforts succeeding is he any better how long have you had him exactly only two weeks myrelle replied today is the twentieth mother it could require months and there is no guarantee perhaps it is time to try something different egwene said more to herself than anyone else more to convince herself than for any other reason in his circumstances lan was hardly an easy present to hand anyone but bond or no bond he belonged to nynaeve more than he ever would to myrelle when she crossed the hollow to him though doubts sprang up strong he whirled to face her in his dance sword streaking toward her someone gasped as the blade halted abruptly only inches from her head she was relieved that it had not been her brilliant blue eyes regarded her intently from beneath lowered brows in a face all planes and angles that might have been carved from stone lan lowered his sword slowly sweat coated him yet he was not even breathing hard so you are the amyrlin now myrelle told me they had raised one but not who it seems you and i have a good deal in common his smile was as cold as his voice as cold as his eyes egwene stopped herself from adjusting her stole reminding herself that she was amyrlin and aes sedai she wanted to embrace saidar until this moment she had not realized exactly how dangerous he was nynaeve is aes sedai now too lan sheвђs in need of a good warder one of the other women made a noise but egwene held her gaze on him i hope she finds a hero out of legend he barked a laugh sheвђll need the hero just to face her temper the laugh convinced her icy hard as it was nynaeve is in ebou dar lan you know what a dangerous city that is she is searching for something we need desperately if the black ajah learns of it theyвђll kill her to get it if the forsaken find out she had thought his face bleak before but the pain that tightened his eyes at nynaeveвђs danger confirmed her plan nynaeve not myrelle had the right i am sending you to her to act as her warder mother myrelle said urgently behind her egwene flung out a hand to silence her nynaeveвђs safety will be in your hands lan he did not hesitate or even glance at myrelle it will take at least a month to reach ebou dar areina saddle mandarb on the point of turning away he paused lifting his free hand as if to touch her stole i apologize for ever helping you leave the two rivers you or nynaeve striding away he vanished into the tent he had come out of earlier but before he had gone two steps myrelle and nisao and siuan were all clustered around her mother you donвђt understand what you are proposing myrelle said breathlessly you might as well give a child a lighted lantern to play with in a haybarn i began readying nynaeve as soon as i felt his bond pass to me i thought i had time but she was raised to the shawl in a blink she isnвђt ready to handle him mother not him not the way he is with an effort egwene made herself be patient they still did not understand myrelle even if nynaeve could not channel a lick she could not actually unless she was angry that would make no difference and you know it not in whether she can handle him thereвђs one thing you havenвђt been able to do give him a task so important that he has to stay alive to carry it out that was the final element supposedly it worked better than the rest to him nynaeveвђs safety is that important he loves her myrelle and she loves him that explains myrelle began softly but nisao burst out incredulously atop her oh surely not not him she might love him i suppose or think she does but women have been chasing lan since he was a beardless boy and catching him for a day or a month he was quite a beautiful boy however hard that might be to believe now still he does appear to have his attractions she glanced sideways at myrelle who frowned slightly tiny spots of color blooming in her cheeks she did not react any further but that was more than enough no mother any woman who thinks she has leashed lan mandragoran will find she has collared only air egwene sighed in spite of herself some sisters believed there was one more part of saving a warder whose bond was broken by death putting him into the arms вђ into the bed вђ of a woman no man could focus on death then the belief ran myrelle it seemed had taken care of that herself too at least she had not actually married him not if she meant to pass him on it would be just as well if nynaeve never found out be that as it may she told nisao absently areina was fastening the girths on mandarbвђs saddle with a brisk competence the tall black stallion standing with head high but allowing it plainly this was not the first time she had been around the animal nicola stood close by the thick bole of the farther oak arms crossed beneath her breasts staring at egwene and the others she looked ready to run i donвђt know what areina has squeezed out of you egwene said quietly but the extra lessons for nicola stop now myrelle and nisao jumped mirror images of surprise siuanвђs eyes grew to the size of teacups but luckily she recovered before anyone noticed you really do know everything myrelle whispered all areina wants is to be around lan i think she believes heвђll teach her things she can use as a hunter or maybe that heвђll go off on the hunt with her nicola wants to be another caraighan nisao muttered caustically or another moiraine i think she had some notion she could make myrelle give lanвђs bond to her well at least we can deal with that pair as they deserve now that heвђs out in the open whatever happens to me it will be a joy to know theyвђll be squealing from here to yearвђs end siuan finally realized what had been going on and outrage warred on her face with the wondering looks she directed at egwene that someone else had puzzled matters out first probably upset her as much as nicola and areina blackmailing aes sedai or perhaps not nicola and areina were not aes sedai themselves after all that drastically changed siuanвђs view of what was allowed but then it did the same for any sister with so many eyes turned her way and not a friendly gaze in the lot nicola backed up against the oak tree and seemed to be trying to back further stains on that white dress would put her in hot water when she returned to the camp areina was still absorbed in lanвђs horse unaware of what was crashing down on her head that would be justice egwene agreed but not unless you two face full justice yourselves nobody was looking at nicola anymore myrelleвђs eyes filled her face and nisaoвђs opened wider yet neither seemed to dare crack her teeth siuan wore grim satisfaction like another skin by her lights they deserved no mercy at all not that egwene intended to give much we will speak further when i come back she told them as lan reappeared his sword buckled on over a green coat undone to reveal an unlaced shirt bulging saddlebags draped over his shoulder the colorshifting warder cloak hanging down his back wrenched the eye as it swirled behind him leaving the stunned sisters to stew in their own juices egwene went to meet him siuan would keep them on a fine simmer should they show any sign of falling off i can have you in ebou dar sooner than a month she said he only nodded impatiently and called for areina to bring mandarb his intensity was unnerving an avalanche poised to fall held back by a thread weaving a gateway where he had been practicing the sword a good eight feet by eight she stepped through onto what seemed to be a ferry floating in darkness that stretched forever skimming required a platform and though it could be anything you chose to imagine every sister seemed to have one she preferred for her that was this wooden barge with stout railings if she fell off she could make another barge beneath her although where she came out then would be something of a question but for anyone who could not channel that fall would be as endless as the black that ran off in every direction only at the near end of the barge was there any light the gateway giving a constricted view of the hollow that light did not penetrate the darkness at all yet there was light of a sort at least she could see quite clearly as in telвђaranвђrhiod not for the first time she wondered whether this actually was some part of the world of dreams lan followed without needing to be told leading his horse he examined the gateway as he came through studied the darkness as his boots and the stallionвђs hooves thudded across the deck planks to her the only question he asked was how quickly will this take me to ebou dar it wonвђt she said channeling to swing the gate shut then closing the gateway not right to the city nothing moved that anyone could have seen there was no wind or breeze nothing to feel they were in motion though and fast faster than she could imagine anything moving it must be six hundred miles or more they had to go i can put you out five maybe six days north of ebou dar she had seen the gateway woven when nynaeve and elayne traveled south and she remembered enough for skimming to the same place he nodded peering ahead as though he could see their destination he reminded her of an arrow in a drawn bow lan nynaeve is staying at the tarasin palace a guest of queen tylin she might deny sheвђs in any danger which she certainly would indignantly if egwene knew nynaeve and rightfully so try not to make a point of it вђ you know how stubborn she is вђ but you mustnвђt pay that any mind if necessary just protect her without letting her know he said nothing did not glance at her she would have had a hundred questions in his place lan when you find her you must tell her that myrelle will give your bond to her as soon as you three can be together she had thought of passing that information along herself but it seemed better not to let nynaeve know he was coming she was as besotted with him as as as i am with gawyn she thought ruefully if nynaeve knew he was on his way there would be little room in her head for anything else with the best will in the world she would let the search fall on elayne not that she would curl up and daydream but any searching she did would be with dazzled eyes are you listening to me lan tarasin palace he said in flat voice without shifting his gaze guest of queen tylin might deny sheвђs in danger stubborn as if i didnвђt know already he looked at her then and she almost wished he had not she was full of saidar full of the warmth and the joy and the power the sheer life but something stark and primal raged in those cold blue eyes a denial of life his eyes were terrifying that was all there was to it i will tell her everything she needs to know you see i listen she made herself meet his stare without flinching but he only turned away again there was a mark on his neck a bruise it might вђ just might вђ be a bite perhaps she should caution him tell him he did not have to be too detailed in any explanations about himself and myrelle the thought made her blush she tried not to see the bruise but now she had noticed it she could not seem to see anything else anyway he would not be that foolish you could not expect a man to be sensible but even men were not that scatterbrained in silence they floated moving without moving she had no fears of the forsaken suddenly appearing here or anyone else skimming had its oddities some of which made for safety and privacy if two sisters wove gateways on the same spot only moments apart aiming to skim to the same place they would not see one another not unless it was exactlythe same spot with the weaves exactlyidentical and neither precision was as easy to achieve as it might seem after a time вђ it was hard to tell how long exactly but she thought well under half an hour вђ the barge stopped suddenly nothing altered in the feel nor in the weaves she held she simply knew that one moment they were speeding through the blackness and the next standing still opening a gateway just at the bargeвђs bow вђ she was not sure where one opened at the stern would lead and not anxious to find out frankly moghedien had found the very idea frightening вђ she motioned lan to go ahead the barge only existed so long as she was present another thing like telвђaranвђrhiod he swung back the ferry gate leading mandarb out and when she followed he was already in the saddle she left the gateway open for her return low rolling hills ran off in every direction covered in withered grass there was not a tree to be seen nothing more than patches of shriveled scrub brush the stallionвђs hooves kicked up little spurts of dust the morning sun in that cloudless sky baked even hotter here than in murandy longwinged vultures circled over something to the south and in another place to the west lan she began meaning to make sure he understood what he was to tell nynaeve but he forestalled her five or six days you said he said peering south i can make it faster she will be safe i promise mandarb danced impatient as his rider but lan held him easily youвђve come a very long way since emondвђs field looking down at her he smiled any warmth in it was swallowed by his eyes you have a hold on myrelle and nisao now donвђt let them argue with you again by your command mother the watch is not done with a small bow he dug in his heels walking mandarb just far enough to put her clear of the dust before setting the horse to a gallop watching him speed southward she closed her mouth well he had noticed in the middle of all that sword practice noticed and done the sums correctly apparently including sums he could not have suspected before seeing her with the stole nynaeve had better take care she always did think men were dimmer than they actually were at least they canвђt get into any real trouble she told herself aloud lan topped a hill and vanished over the other side had there been any real danger in ebou dar elayne or nynaeve would have said something they did not meet often вђ she just had too much to do вђ but they had worked out a way to leave messages in the salidar of telвђaranвђrhiodwhenever there was need for one a wind that might have come from an open oven gusted up sheets of dust coughing she covered her mouth and nose with a corner of the amyrlinвђs striped stole and hurriedly retreated through the gateway to her ferry the journey back was silent and boring leaving her to worry whether she had done the right thing sending lan whether it was right to keep nynaeve in the dark itвђs done she kept telling herself but that did not help when she stepped once more into the hilltop hollow beneath the oak trees myrelleвђs third warder avar hachami had joined the others a hawknosed man with thick graystreaked mustaches like downcurving horns all four gaidin were hard at work the tents down and nearly folded nicola and areina trotted back and forth loading all the camp paraphernalia into the cart everything from blankets to cookpots and black iron washkettle they really did trot not pausing but at least half their attention was on siuan and the other two sisters over near the treeline for that matter the warders gave the three aes sedai much more than half their consideration their ears might as well have been up in points who was simmering who seemed to be a question not speak to me in that manner siuan myrelle was saying not only loud enough to be heard across the clearing but cold enough to take the edge off the weather arms folded tightly beneath her breasts she was drawn up to every inch of height imperious to the point of bursting do you hear me you will not are you lost to all propriety siuan nisaoвђs hands were knotted in her skirts in a vain attempt to keep herself from quivering and the heat in her voice easily matched the ice in myrelleвђs if youвђve forgotten simple manners completely you can be taught again facing them with her hands on her hips siuan moved her head jerkily struggling both to keep a glare on her face and to keep it fixed on the other two i i am only when she saw egwene approaching her relief bloomed like a flower in spring mother that was almost a gasp i was explaining possible penalties she drew a long breath and went on more definitely the hall will have to invent them as they go of course but i think they might well start with making these two pass their warders to others since they seem so fond of it myrelle squeezed her eyes shut and nisao turned to look at the warders her expression never changed calm if a touch flushed but sarin stumbled to his feet and took three quick steps toward her before she raised a hand to stop him a warder could sense his aes sedaiвђs presence her pain her fear and anger every bit as much as egwene could feel moghedienвђs when she wore the aвђdam no wonder all the gaidin moved on their toes and looked ready to spring at something they might not know what had driven their aes sedai to the brink of despair but they knew the two women were at that brink which was exactly where egwene wanted them she did not like this part of it all the maneuvering was like a game but this i do what i must she thought unsure whether that was an attempt to stiffen her backbone or an attempt to excuse what she was about to do siuan please send nicola and areina back to the camp what they did not see they could not tell we canвђt have their tongues flapping so make sure they know what will happen to them tell them they have one more chance because the amyrlin is feeling merciful but theyвђll never get another i think i can manage that much siuan replied and gathering her skirts she stalked off no one could stalk like siuan yet she seemed more eager to be away from myrelle and nisao than anything else mother nisao said choosing her words before you left you said something вђ indicated there might be some way вђ for us to avoid вђ some way we might not have to вђ she glanced at sarin again myrelle would have been a study in aes sedai serenity as she examined egwene except that her fingers were laced together so tightly that her knuckles strained the thin leather of her gloves egwene motioned them to wait nicola and areina turning away from the cart saw siuan coming and went stiff as posts which was no wonder considering that siuan advanced as though she intended to walk right over them andthe cart areinaвђs head swiveled searching but before she could think to actually run siuanвђs hands darted out and caught each of them by an ear what she said was too low to carry yet areina stopped trying to pry her ear free her hands stayed on siuanвђs wrist but she almost seemed to be using it to hold herself up a look of such horror oozed across nicolaвђs face that egwene wondered whether siuan might be going too far but then maybe not under the circumstances they weregoing to walk free of their crime a pity she could not find a way to harness such a talent for ferreting out what was hidden a way to harness it safely whatever siuan said when she loosed their ears the pair immediately turned toward egwene and dropped into curtsies nicolaвђs was so low it nearly put her face on the ground and areina came close to falling on hers siuan clapped hands sharply and the two women bounded to their feet scrambled to untie a pair of shaggy wagon horses from the picket line they were astride bareback and galloping out of the hollow so quickly it was a wonder they did not have wings they wonвђt even talk in their sleep siuan said sourly when she returned i can still handle novices and scoundrels at least her eyes stayed on egweneвђs face avoiding the other two sisters entirely suppressing a sigh egwene turned to myrelle and nisao she had to do something about siuan but first things first the green sister and the yellow eyed her warily it is very simple she said in a firm voice without my protection you will very likely lose your warders and almost certainly wish youвђd been skinned alive by the time the hall finishes with you your own ajahs may have a few choice words for you as well it may be years before you can hold your heads up again years before you donвђt have sisters looking over your shoulder every minute but why should i protect you from justice it puts me under an obligation you might do the same again or worse the wise ones had their part in this though it was not exactly jiвђeвђtoh if iвђm to take on that responsibility then you must have an obligation too i must be able to trust you utterly and i can only see one way to do that the wise ones and then faolain and theodrin you must swear fealty they had been frowning wondering where she was headed but wherever they thought it was not where she ended their faces were a study nisaoвђs jaw dropped and myrelle looked as though she had been hit between the eyes with a hammer even siuan gaped in disbelief imppossible myrelle spluttered no sister has ever вђ no amyrlin has required вђ you canвђt really think вђ oh do be quiet myrelle nisao snapped this is all your fault i should never have listened вђ well done is done and what is is peering at egwene from beneath lowered brows she muttered you are a dangerous young woman mother a very dangerous woman you may break the tower more than it already is before youвђre done if i was sure of that if i had the courage to do my duty and face whatever comes вђ yet she knelt smoothly pressing her lips to the great serpent ring on egweneвђs finger beneath the light and by my hope of rebirth and salvation not the same wording as faolain and theodrin but every scrap as strong more by the three oaths no aes sedai could speak a vow she did not mean except the black ajah of course it seemed obvious they must have found a way to lie whether either of these women was black was a problem for another time though siuan eyes popping and mouth working without sound looked like a fish stranded on a mudbank myrelle tried another protest but egwene just thrust out her right hand with the ring and myrelleвђs knees folded in jerks she gave the oath in bitter tones then looked up youвђve done what has never been done before mother that is always dangerous it wonвђt be the last time egwene told her in fact my first order to you is that you will tell no one that siuan is anything but what everybody thinks my second is you will obey any order she gives as if it came from me their heads turned toward siuan faces unruffled as you command mother they murmured together it was siuan who looked ready to faint she was still staring at nothing when they reached the road and turned their horses east toward the aes sedai camp and the army the sun still climbed toward its zenith still well short it had been a morning eventful as most days most weeks for that matter egwene let daishar amble myrelle was right siuan mumbled finally with her riderвђs mind elsewhere the mare moved with something close to a smooth gait she actually made siuan appear a competent rider fealty no one has ever done that no one there isnвђt so much as a hint in the secret histories and them obeying me you arenвђt just changing a few things youвђre rebuilding the boat while sailing a storm everythingis changing and nicola in my day a novice would have wet herself if she even thought of blackmailing a sister not their first attempt egwene told her relating the facts in as few words as possible she expected siuan to explode in a fury at the pair but instead the woman said quite calmly i fear our two adventurous lasses are about to meet with accidents no egwene reined in so suddenly that siuanвђs mare ambled another halfdozen paces before she could bring the animal under control and turn her all the while muttering imprecations under her breath she sat there giving egwene a patient look that outdid lelaine at her worst mother they have a club over your head if theyвђre ever smart enough to think it out even if the hall doesnвђt force you into a penance you can watch any hope you have with them sail right over the horizon she shook her head disgustedly i knew you would do it when i sent you out вђ i knew youвђd have to вђ but i never thought elayne and nynaeve were witless enough to bring back anyone who knew those two girls deserve all theyвђll catch if this gets out but you canвђt afford to let it out nothing is to happen to nicola or areina siuan if i approve killing them for what they know whoвђs next romanda and lelaine for not agreeing with me where does it stop in a way she felt disgusted with herself once she would not have understood what siuan meant it was always better to know than to be ignorant but sometimes ignorance was much more comfortable heeling daishar on she said i wonвђt have a day of victory spoiled with talk of murder myrelle wasnвђt even the beginning siuan this morning faolain and theodrin were waiting siuan brought the plump mare in closer to listen as they rode the news did not relieve siuanвђs concern over nicola and areina but egweneвђs plans certainly put a sparkle in her eye and a smile of anticipation on her lips by the time they reached the aes sedai camp she was eager to take on her next task which was to tell sheriam and the rest of myrelleвђs friends that they were expected in the amyrlinвђs study at midday she could even say quite truthfully that nothing would be required of them that other sisters had not done before for all her talk of victory egwene did not feel so zestful she barely heard blessings and calls for blessings acknowledging them with only a wave of her hand and was sure she missed more than she did hear she could not countenance murder but nicola and areina would bear watching will i ever reach a place where the difficulties donвђt keep piling upshe wondered somewhere a victory did not seem to have to be matched by a new danger when she walked into her tent her mood sank right to her feet her head throbbed she was beginning to think she should just stay away from the tent altogether two carefully folded sheets of parchment sat neatly atop the writing table each sealed with wax and each bearing the words sealed to the flame for anyone other than the amyrlin breaking that seal was accounted as serious as assaulting the amyrlinвђs person she wished she did not have to break them there was no doubt in her mind who had written those words unfortunately she was right romanda suggested вђ demanded was a better word вђ that the amyrlin issue an edict sealed to the hall known only to the sitters the sisters were all to be summoned one by one and any who refused was to be shielded and confined as a suspected member of the black ajah what they were to be summoned for was left rather vague but lelaine had more than hinted this morning lelaineвђs own missive bore her manner all over it mother to child what should be done for egweneвђs own good and everyoneвђs the edict she wanted was only to be sealed to the ring any sister could know and in fact in this case they would have to mention of the black ajah was to be forbidden as fomenting discord a serious charge under tower law with appropriate penalties egwene dropped onto her folding chair with a groan and of course the legs shifted and nearly deposited her on the carpet she could delay and sidestep but they would keep coming back with these idiocies sooner or later one would introduce her modest proposal to the hall and that would put the fox in the henyard were they blind fomenting discord lelaine would have every sister convinced not just that there was a black ajah but that egwene was part of it the stampede of aes sedai back to tar valon and elaida could not be far behind romanda just meant to set off a mutiny there were six of those hidden in the secret histories half a dozen in more than three thousand years might not be very many but each had resulted in an amyrlin resigning and the entire hall as well lelaine knew that and romanda lelaine had been a sitter for nearly forty years with access to all the hidden records before resigning to go into a country retreat as many sisters did in age romanda had held a chair for the yellow so long that some said she had had as much power as any amyrlin she sat under being chosen to sit a second time was nearly unheard of but romanda was not one to let power reside anywhere outside her own hands if she could manage no they were not blind just afraid everybody was including her and even aes sedai did not always think clearly when they were afraid she refolded the pages wanting to crumple them up and stamp her feet on them her head wasgoing to burst may i come in mother halima saranov swayed into the tent without waiting for an answer the way halima moved always drew every male eye from age twelve to two days past the grave but then if she hid herself in a heavy cloak from the shoulders down men still would stare long black hair glistening as if she washed it every day in fresh rainwater framed a face that made sure of that delana sedai thought you might want to see this sheвђs putting it before the hall this morning the hall was sitting without so much as informing her well she had been away but custom if not law said the amyrlin must be informed before the hall couldsit unless they were sitting to depose her anyway at that moment she would almost have taken it as a blessing she eyed the folded sheet of paper halima laid on her table much as she would a poisonous snake not sealed the newest novice could read it so far as delana was concerned the declaration that elaida was a darkfriend of course not quite as bad as romanda or lelaine but if she heard the hall had broken up in a riot she would hardly blink halima i could wish youвђd gone home when cabriana died or at least that delana had had the sense to seal the womanвђs information to the hall or even to the flame instead of telling every sister she could collar i could hardly do that mother halimaвђs green eyes flashed with what seemed challenge or defiance but she only had two ways to look at anyone a wide direct stare that dared and a lidded gaze that smoldered her eyes caused a lot of misunderstanding after cabriana sedai told me what sheвђd learned about elaida and her plans cabriana was my friend and friend to you to all of you opposing elaida so i had no choice i only thank the light she mentioned salidar so i knew where to come she put her hands on a waist as small as egweneвђs had been in telвђaranвђrhiodand tilted her head to one side studying egwene intently your brain is hurting again isnвђt it cabriana used to have such pains so bad they made her toes cramp she had to soak in hot water till she could bear to put on clothes it took days sometimes if i hadnвђt come yours could have gotten that bad eventually moving around behind the chair she began kneading egweneвђs scalp halimaвђs fingers possessed a skill that melted pain away you could hardly ask another sister for healing as often as you have these aches itвђs just tightness anyway i can feel it i suppose i couldnвђt egwene murmured she rather liked the woman whatever anyone said and not just for her talent in smoothing away headaches halima was earthy and open a country woman however much time she had spent gaining a skim of city sophistication balancing respect for the amyrlin with a sort of neighborliness in a way egwene found refreshing startling sometimes but enlivening even chesa did not do better but chesa was always the servant even if friendly while halima never showed the slightest obsequiousness yet egwene really did wish she had gone back to her home when cabriana fell from that horse and broke her neck it might have been useful had the sisters accepted cabrianaвђs belief that elaida intended to still half of them and break the rest but everyone was sure halima had garbled that somehow it was the black ajah they latched on to women unused to being afraid of anything had taken what they had always denied and terrified themselves halfwitless with it how was she to root the darkfriends out without scattering the other sisters like a frightened covey of quail how to stop them scattering sooner or later anyway light how think on looseness halima said softly your face is loose your neck is loose your shoulders her voice was almost hypnotic a drone that seemed to caress each part of egweneвђs body she wanted to relax some women disliked her just for the way she looked of course as though a particularly lascivious man had dreamed her and a good many claimed she flirted with anything in breeches which egwene could not have approved of but halima admitted she liked looking at men her worst critics never claimed she had done more than flirt and she herself became indignant at the suggestion she was no fool вђ egwene had known that at their first conversation the day after logain escaped when the headaches had begun вђ not at all the brainless flipskirt egwene suspected it was much as with meri halima could not help her face or her manner her smile seemed inviting or teasing because of the shape of her mouth she smiled the same at man or woman or child it was hardly her fault that people thought she was flirting when she was only looking besides she had never mentioned the headaches to anyone if she had every yellow sister in the camp would be laying siege that indicated friendship if not loyalty egweneвђs eyes fell on the papers on the writing table and her thoughts drifted under halimaвђs stroking fingers torches ready to be tossed into the haystack ten days to the border of andor unless lord bryne was willing to push without knowing why and no opposition before could she hold those torches back ten days southharbor northharbor the keys to tar valon how could she be sure of nicola and areina short of siuanвђs suggestion she needed to arrange for every sister to be tested before they reached andor she had the talent for working with metals and ores but it was rare among aes sedai nicola areina the black ajah youвђre tensing again stop worrying over the hall those soothing fingers paused then began once more this would do better tonight after youвђve had a hot bath i could work your shoulders and back everywhere we havenвђt tried that yet youвђre stiff as a stake you should be supple enough to bend backwards and put your head between your ankles mind and body one canвђt be limber without the other just put yourself in my hands egwene teetered on the brink of sleep not a dreamwalkerвђs sleep just sleep how long since she had done that the camp would be in an uproar once delanaвђs proposal got out which it would soon enough and that was before she had to tell romanda and lelaine she had no intention of issuing their edicts but there was one thing yet today to look forward to a reason to remain awake that will be nice she murmured meaning more than the promised massage long ago she had pledged that one day she would bring sheriam to heel and today was the day at last she was beginning to be the amyrlin in control very nice chapter star and birds the bowl of the winds aviendha would have sat on the floor but three other women occupying the boatвђs small room left not quite enough space so she had to be content with folding her legs atop one of the carved wooden benches built against the walls that way it was not so much like sitting in a chair at least the door was shut and there were no windows only fanciful carved scrollwork piercing the walls near the ceiling she could not see the water outside but the piercings let in the smell of salt and the slap of waves against the hull and the splash of the oars even the shrill hollow cries of some sort of birds shouted of vast expanses of water she had seen men die for a pool they might have stepped across but this water was bitter beyond belief reading of it was not at all the same as tasting it and the river had been at least half a mile wide where they boarded this boat with its two oddly leering oarsmen half a mileof water and not a drop fit for drinking who could imagine useless water the motion of the boat had changed to a rocking back and forth were they out of the river yet into what was called the bay that was wider still far wider so elayne said aviendha locked her hands on her knees and tried desperately to think of anything else if the others saw her fear the shame would follow her to the end of her days the worst of it was she had suggested this after hearing elayne and nynaeve talk of the sea folk how could she have known what it would be like the blue silk of her dress felt incredibly smooth and she latched on to that she was barely used to skirts at all вђ she still yearned for the cadinвђsorthe wise ones had made her burn when she began training with them вђ and here she wore a silkdress вђ of which she now owned four вђ and silk stockings instead of stout wool and a silk shift that made her aware of her skin in a way she never had been before she could not deny the beauty of the dress no matter how odd it was to find herself wearing such things but silk was precious and rare a woman might have a scarf of silk to be worn on feastdays and envied by others few women had two it was different among these wetlanders though not everyone wore silk yet sometimes it seemed to her every second person did great bolts and even bales of it came by ship from the lands beyond the threefold land by ship on the ocean water stretching to the horizon with many places where if she understood correctly you could not see land at all she came close to shivering at the impossible thought none of the others looked as if they wished to talk elayne absently twisted the great serpent ring on her right hand and peered at something not to be seen inside the four walls these worries often overtook her two duties confronted her and if one lay nearer her heart she had chosen the one she considered more important more honorable it was her right and duty to become the chief the queen of andor but she had chosen to continue hunting in a way however important their search that was like putting something before clan or society yet aviendha felt pride elayneвђs view of honor was as peculiar at times as the notion of a woman being a chief or her becoming chief just because her mother had been but she followed it admirably birgitte in the wide red trousers and short yellow coat aviendha envied sat toying with her waistlong braid lost in thought as well or maybe sharing part of elayneвђs worries she was elayneвђs first warder which upset the aes sedai back in the tarasin palace no end though it did not seem to bother their warders wetlander customs were so curious they hardly bore thinking about if elayne and birgitte seemed to deflect any thought of talk nynaeve alвђmeara directly opposite aviendha by the door rebuffed it firmly nynaeve not nynaeve alвђmeara wetlanders liked to be called by only half their names and aviendha was trying to remember however much it felt like using a honeyname rand alвђthor was the only lover she had ever had and she did not think even of him so intimately but she had to learn their ways if she was to wed one of them nynaeveвђs deep brown eyes stared through her her knuckles were white on a thick braid as dark as birgitteвђs was golden and her face had gone beyond pale to a faint green from time to time she emitted a tiny muted groan she did not usually sweat she and elayne had taught aviendha the trick nynaeve was a puzzle brave to the point of madness sometimes she moaned over her supposed cowardice and here she displayed her shame for all to see without a care how could the motiondisturb her so when all that water did not water again aviendha shut her eyes to avoid seeing nynaeveвђs face but that only made the sounds of the birds and the lapping water fill her head i have been thinking elayne said suddenly then paused are you all right aviendha you aviendhaвђs cheeks reddened but at least elayne did not say aloud that she had jumped like a rabbit at the sound of her voice elayne seemed to realize how close she had come to revealing aviendhaвђs dishonor color flushed her own cheeks as she continued i was thinking about nicola and areina about what egwene told us last night you donвђt suppose they can cause herany trouble do you what is she to do rid herself of them aviendha said drawing a thumb across her neck the relief of speaking of hearing voices was so great that she almost gasped elayne appeared shocked she was remarkably softhearted at times it might be for the best birgitte said she had revealed no more name than that aviendha thought her a woman with secrets areina could have made something of herself with time but вђ donвђt look at me that way elayne and stop going all prim and indignant in your head birgitte often slipped back and forth between the warder who obeyed and the older firstsister who instructed whether or not you wished to learn right then waving an admonishing finger she was the firstsister you two wouldnвђt have been warned to stay away if it was a difficulty the amyrlin could solve by having them set to work with the laundresses or the like elayne gave a sharp sniff in the face of what she could not deny and adjusted her green silk skirts where they were drawn up in front to expose layers of blue and white petticoats she was wearing the local fashion complete with creamy lace at her wrists and around her neck a gift from tylin quintara as was the closefitting necklace of woven gold aviendha did not approve the upper half of the dress the bodice fitted as snugly as that necklace and a missing narrow oval of cloth revealed the inner slopes of her breasts walking about where all could see was not the same as the sweat tents people in the streets of the city were not gaiвђshain her own dress had a high neck that brushed her chin with lace and no parts of it missing beside birgitte went on i would think mariganwould worry you more she frightens me spitless that name got through to nynaeve as well it might her groaning ceased and she sat up straight if she comes after us we will just settle for her again weвђll weвђll drawing breath she stared at them pointedly as if they were arguing with her what she said in a faint voice was do you think she will fretting will do no good elayne told her much more calmly than aviendha could have managed if she thought one of the shadowsouled had marked her out we will just have to do as egwene said and be careful nynaeve muttered something inaudible which was probably just as well silence descended again elayne settling to a browner study than before birgitte propping her chin on one hand as she frowned at nothing nynaeve kept right on grumbling under her breath but she had both hands pressed to her middle now and from time to time she paused to swallow the splashing of water seemed louder than ever and the cries of the birds i have been thinking too nearsister she and elayne had not reached the point of adopting each other as firstsisters yet but she was sure they would now already they brushed each otherвђs hair and every night in the dark shared another secret never told to anyone else this min woman though that was for later when they were alone about what elayne asked absently our search we prepare for success but we are as far away as when we began does it make sense not to use every weapon at hand mat cauthon is taвђveren yet we work to avoid him why not take him with us with him we might find the bowl at last mat nynaeve exclaimed incredulously as well stuff your shift full of nettles i would not endure the man if he had the bowl in his coat pocket oh dobe quiet nynaeve elayne murmured without any heat she shook her head wonderingly taking no notice of the otherвђs sudden glower prickly only began to describe nynaeve but they were all used to her ways whydidnвђt i think of that it is so obvious maybe birgitte murmured dryly you had mat the scoundrel set so hard in your mind you couldnвђt see he had any use elayne gave her a cool stare chin raised then abruptly grimaced and nodded reluctantly she did not accept criticism easily no nynaeve said in a voice that somehow managed to be sharp and weak at the same time the sickly cast of her face had deepened but it no longer seemed caused by the boatвђs heaving you cannot possibly mean it elayne you know what a torment he can be how stubborn he is heвђll insist on bringing those soldiers of his like a feastday parade try finding anything in the rahad with soldiers at your shoulder just try inside two steps heвђll try to take charge flaunting that terвђangrealat us heвђs a thousand times worse than vandene or adeleas or even merilille the way he behaves you would think weвђd walk into a bearвђs den just to see the bear birgitte made a noise in her throat that might have been amusement and received a darted glare she returned such a look of bland innocence that nynaeve began to sound as if she were choking elayne was more soothing she probably would try to make peace in a waterfeud he is taвђveren nynaeve he alters the pattern alters chance just being there iвђm ready to admit we need luck and a taвђverenis more than luck besides we can snare two birds at once we should not have been letting him run loose all this time no matter how busy we were thatвђs done no one any good him least of all he needs to be made fit for decent company we will put him on a short rein from the start nynaeve smoothed her skirts with considerable vigor she claimed to have no more interest in dresses than aviendha вђ in what they looked like anyway she was always muttering about good plain wool being fine enough for anybody вђ yet her own blue dress was slashed with yellow on the skirts and sleeves and she herself had chosen its design every stitch she owned was silk or embroidered or both all cut with what aviendha had learned to recognize as fine care for once nynaeve appeared to understand she would not get her way sometimes she threw amazing tantrums until she did not that she would admit that was what they were the glower faded to a grumpy sulk who will ask him whoever does he will make her beg you know he will iвђd sooner marry him elayne hesitated then said firmly birgitte will and she wonвђt beg she will tell him most men will do as you say if you use a firm confident voice nynaeve looked doubtful and birgitte jerked erect on her bench startled for the first time aviendha had ever seen with anyone else aviendha might have said she looked a little afraid too birgitte would have done very well as far dareis mai for a wetlander she had remarkable skill with a bow you are the clear choice birgitte elayne went on quickly nynaeve and i are aes sedai and aviendha might as well be we cannot possiblydo it not and maintain proper dignity not with him you knowwhat he is like what had happened to all that talk of a firm confident voice not that aviendha had ever noticed that working for anyone except sorilea it surely had not so far on mat cauthon that she had seen birgitte he canвђthave recognized you if he had he would have said something by now whatever that meant birgitte leaned back against the wall and laced her fingers over her stomach i should have known youвђd get back at me ever since i said it was a good thing your bottom wasnвђt any вђ she stopped and a faint satisfied smile appeared on her lips nothing changed in elayneвђs expression but plainly birgitte thought she had gained a measure of revenge it must have been something felt through the warder bond how elayneвђs bottom entered into anything though aviendha could not puzzle out wetlanders were so odd at times birgitte continued still wearing that smile what i donвђt understand is why he starts chafing as soon as he sees you two it canвђt be that you snagged him off here egwene was as deep in that as you but i saw him treat her with more respect than most of the sisters do besides the times iвђve glimpsed him coming out of the wandering woman he looked to be enjoying himself her smile became a grin that made elayne sniff disapprovingly that is one thing we need to change a decent woman cannot be in the room with him oh do wipe that smirk off your face birgitte i vow you are as bad as he sometimes the man was born just to be a trial nynaeve muttered sourly suddenly aviendha was forcibly reminded that she was on a boat as everything lurched swaying and swinging around to a halt rising and straightening dresses they gathered the light cloaks they had brought she did not don hers the sunlight here was not so bright that she needed the hood to keep it from her eyes birgitte only draped hers over one shoulder and pushed open the door following up the three steps after nynaeve had rushed past her with a hand clapped over her mouth elayne paused to tie her cloak ribbons and arrange the hood around her face redgold curls peeking out all around you did not say much nearsister i said what i had to say the decision was yours the key thought was yours though sometimes i think the rest of us are turning into halfwits well half turning to the steps not quite looking at her elayne paused distances bother me sometimes over water i think i will look only at the ship myself nothing else aviendha nodded вђ her nearsister had a fine delicacy вђ and they went up on the deck nynaeve was just shaking off birgitteвђs offer of help and pushing herself up from the railing the two oarsmen looked on in amusement as she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand shiftless fellows with a brass hoop in each ear they must have had frequent use for the curved daggers shoved behind their sashes most of their attention went to working their pairs of long sweeps though walking back and forth on the deck to hold the heaving boat in place near a ship that almost took aviendhaвђs breath with its size looming above their suddenly very tiny vessel its three great masts reaching taller than most trees she had seen even here in the wetlands they had chosen it because it was the largest of the hundreds of sea folk ships anchored in the bay on a ship that big surely it must be possible to forget all the surrounding water except elayne had not really acknowledged her shame and if she had a nearsister could know your deepest humiliation without it mattering but amys said she had too much pride she made herself turn and look away from the boat she had never seen so much water in her life not if every drop seen before had been gathered in one place all of it rolling graygreen and here and there frothing white her eyes darted trying to avoid taking it in even the sky seemed larger here immense with a liquid gold sun crawling up from the east a gusting wind blew somewhat cooler than on the land and never failing entirely clouds of birds flurried in the air gray and white and sometimes splotched with black giving those shrill cries one all black except for its head skimmed along the surface with its long lower beak slicing through the water and a slanted line of ungainly brown birds вђ pelicans elayne had named them вђ suddenly folded their wings one by one and plummeted with great splashes bobbing back to the top where they floated tilting up beaks of incredible size there were ships everywhere many almost as large as the one behind her not all belonging to the athaвђan miere and smaller vessels with one or two masts moving under triangular sails smaller ships still mastless like the boat she was on with a high sharp peak at the front and a low flat house at the back spidered across the water on oars one pair or two or sometimes three one long narrow boat that must have had twenty to a side looked like a hundredlegs skittering along and there was land maybe seven or eight miles distant sunlight gleamed off the whiteplastered buildings of the city seven or eight miles of water swallowing she turned back more swiftly than she had turned away she thought her cheeks must be greener than nynaeveвђs had been elayne was watching her trying to keep a smooth face but wetlanders showed their emotions so plainly her concern was visible i am a fool elayne even with her using no more of her name made aviendha feel uneasy when they were firstsisters when they were sisterwives it would be easier a wise woman listens to wise advice you are braver than i will ever be elayne replied quite seriously she was another who kept denying that she had any courage maybe that was also a wetlander custom no aviendha had heard wetlanders speak of then own bravery these ebou dari for one seemed unable to utter three words without boasting elayne drew a deep breath steeling herself tonight we will talk about rand aviendha nodded but she did not see how that followed from talk of courage how could sisterwives manage a husband if they did not talk of him in detail that was what the older women told her anyway and the wise ones they were not always so forthcoming of course when she complained to amys and bair that she must be ill because she felt as though rand alвђthor was carrying some part of her around with him they had fallen down laughing you will learn they cackled at her and you would have learned sooner had you grown up in skirts as if she had ever wanted any life but that of a maiden running with her spearsisters maybe elayne felt something of the same emptiness speaking of him did seem to make the hollowness grow even while filling it for some time she had been aware of voices rising and now she heard the words you earringed buffoon nynaeve was shaking her fist at a very dark man peering down at her from over the tall side of the ship he looked calm but then he could not see the glow of saidarsurrounding her we are not after the gift of passage so it doesnвђt matter whether you refuse it to aes sedai you let down a ladder this instant the men at the oars were missing their grins apparently they had failed to see the serpent rings back at the stone landing and they did not look pleased to learn they had aes sedai aboard oh dear elayne sighed i must retrieve this aviendha or weвђve wasted the morning just so she could lose her breakfast porridge gliding across the deckвђ aviendha was proud of knowing the proper names for things on boats вђ elayne addressed the man up on the ship i am elayne trakand daughterheir of andor and aes sedai of the green ajah my companion is quite truthful we do not seek the gift of passage but we must speak with your windfinder on a matter of urgency tell her we know of the weaving of winds tell her we know of windfinders the man above frowned down at her then abruptly vanished without a word the woman will probably think you mean to blab her secrets nynaeve muttered jerking her cloak into place she tied the ribbons fiercely you know how afraid they are that aes sedai will haul them all off to the tower if itвђs known most can channel only a ninny thinks she can threaten people elayne and still get anywhere aviendha burst out laughing by the startled look nynaeve gave her she did not see the joke she had made on herself elayneвђs lips quivered though however she tried to hold them you could never be sure about wetlander humor they found strange things funny and missed the best whether or not the windfinder felt threatened by the time elayne had paid the boatmen and cautioned them to wait for their return вђ with nynaeve grumbling over the amount and telling them she would box their ears if they left and how she was to manage that nearly set aviendha laughing again вђ by the time all that was done it seemed a decision had been reached to allow them on no ladder was lowered but instead a flat piece of wood the two ropes it hung from becoming one and running up to a thick pole swung out over the side from one of the masts nynaeve took her place sitting on the board with dire warnings for the boatmen if they even thought of trying to look up her skirts and elayne blushed and held hers tightly around her legs hunched over so she appeared ready to fall off headfirst as she wobbled into the air and disappeared from sight onto the ship one of the fellows looked upward anyway until birgitte struck him on the nose with her fist they certainly did not watch herascent aviendhaвђs belt knife was small with a blade not half a foot long but the oarsmen frowned worriedly when she drew it her arm went back and they fell sprawling to the deck as the knife whirled over their heads to sink with a solid thunkinto the thick wooden post at the front of the boat looping the cloak over her arms like a shawl she hoisted her skirts well above her knees so she could climb over the oars and retrieve her blade then took her place on the dangling board she did not replace the knife in its sheath for some reason the two men exchanged confused looks but they kept their eyes down as she was lifted up perhaps she was beginning to get a feel for wetlander customs settling onto the great shipвђs deck she gaped almost forgetting to climb off the narrow seat she had read of the athaвђan miere but reading and seeing was as different as reading of saltwater and tasting it they were all dark for one thing much darker than the ebou dari even darker than most tairens with straight black hair and black eyes and tattooed hands barechested barefoot men with bright narrow sashes holding up baggy breeches of some dark cloth that had an oily look to it and women in blouses as brilliantly colored as their sashes all with a sway to their movements gliding gracefully with the rocking of the ship sea folk women had very strange customs when it came to men according to what she had read dancing with no more than a single scarf for covering and worse but it was the earrings that made her stare most had three or four often with polished stones and several actually had a small ring in one side of their noses the men did too the earrings at least and just as many heavy gold and silver chains around their necks men some wetlander men wore rings in their ears true вђ most ebou dari men seemed to вђ but so many and necklaces wetlanders did have strange ways the sea folk never left their ships вђ never вђ so she had read and supposedly they ate their dead she had not been quite able to credit that but if the men wore necklaces who could say what else they did the woman who came to meet them wore breeches and blouse and sash like the others but hers were of brocaded yellow silk the sash knotted intricately with ends trailing to her knee and one of her necklaces bore a small golden box of intricate piercework a sweetly musky scent surrounded her gray streaked her hair heavily and she had a grave face five small fat golden rings decorated each of her ears and a fine chain connected one to a similar ring in her nose tiny medallions of polished gold dangling from the chain flashed in the sunlight as she studied them aviendha pulled her hand down from her own nose вђ to wear that chain always tugging вђ and barely managed to suppress a laugh wetlander customs were odd beyond belief and surely no one deserved the name better than the sea folk i am malin din toral breaking wave the woman said wavemistress of clan somarin and sailmistress of windrunner a wavemistress was important like a clan chief yet she seemed at a loss looking from one face to the next until her eye fell on the great serpent rings elayne and nynaeve wore and then she exhaled in resignation if it pleases you to come with me aes sedai she said to nynaeve the back of the ship was raised and she led the way inside that by a door then down a hallway to a large room вђ a cabinвђ with a low ceiling aviendha doubted rand alвђthor would have been able to stand upright beneath one of the thick beams except for a few lacquered chests everything seemed to have been built in place cabinets along the walls even the long table that ran half the length of the room and the armchairs that surrounded it it was difficult to think of something the size of this ship being made of wood and even after all her time in the wetlands the sight of all that polished wood nearly made her gasp it glowed almost as much as the gilded lamps hanging unlit in some sort of cage so they remained upright as the ship moved with the waves in truth the ship hardly seemed to move at all at least in comparison with the boat they had been on but unfortunately the back of the cabin of the ship was a line of windows with the painted and gilded shutters standing open giving a splendid view of the bay worse there was no land in sight out those windows no land at all her throat seized she could not have spoken she could not have screamed although that was what she wanted to do those windows and what they showed вђ what they did not show вђ had caught her eyes so quickly that it took her a moment to realize people were there already a fine thing had they wished they could have killed her before she knew not that they showed any sign of hostility but you could never be too careful with wetlanders a spindly old man with deepset eyes was sitting at his ease atop one of the chests what little hair remained to him was white and his dark face had a kindly look though a full dozen earrings altogether and a number of thick gold chains around his neck gave his expression a strange twist in her eyes like the men above he was barefoot and barechested but his breeches were a dark blue silk and his long sash a bright red an ivoryhilted sword was thrust through that sash she noted with disdain as well as two curved daggers to match the slender handsome woman with her arms folded and a grimly foreboding frown was more worthy of notice she wore only four earrings in each ear and fewer medallions on her chain than malin din toral and her clothing was all in reddishyellow silk she could channel aviendha knew that this close she must be the woman they had come for the windfinder and yet it was another who held aviendhaвђs eye and for that matter elayneвђs and nynaeveвђs and birgitteвђs the woman who had looked up from an unrolled map on the table might have been as old as the man by her white hair short no taller than nynaeve she looked like someone who had once been stocky and was beginning to go stout but her jaw thrust forward like a hammer and her black eyes spoke of intelligence and power not the one power just that of someone who said go and knew that people would go yet she had it strongly her breeches were brocaded green silk her blouse blue and her sash red like the manвђs the stoutbladed knife in a gilded sheath tucked behind that sash had a round pommel covered with red and green stones firedrops and emeralds aviendha thought twice as many medallions hung from her nose chain as from malin din toralвђs and another thinner gold chain connected the six rings in each of her ears aviendha barely kept her hand from going to her own nose again without a word the whitehaired woman came to stand in front of nynaeve rudely examining her from head to toe frowning in particular at nynaeveвђs face and the great serpent ring on her right hand she took no time about it and with a grunt moved on from her ruffled object of study to give elayne the same quick intense scrutiny and then birgitte at last she spoke you are not an aes sedai her voice sounded like rocks tumbling by the nine winds and stormbringerвђs beard i am not birgitte replied sometimes she said things even elayne and nynaeve seemed not to understand but the whitehaired woman jumped as if she had been goosed and stared a long moment before turning to frown up at aviendha you are not aes sedai either she grated after the same examination aviendha drew herself to her full height feeling as though the woman had rummaged through her garments and twirled her about to look at her better i am aviendha of the nine valleys sept of the taardad aiel the woman gave twice the start she had for birgitte black eyes going wide you are not garbed as i expected girl was all she said though and strode back to the far end of the table where she planted her fists on her hips and studied them all again much as she might have some strange animal she had never seen before i am nesta din reas two moons she said at last mistress of the ships to the athaвђan miere how do you know what you know nynaeve had been working on a scowl since the woman first looked at her and now she snapped aes sedai know what they know and we expect more in the way of manners than iвђve seen so far i certainly saw more the last time i was on a sea folk ship maybe we should find another where the people donвђt all have sore teeth nesta din reasвђ face grew darker but elayne of course stepped into the breech removing her cloak and laying it over the edge of the table the light illumine you and your vessels shipmistress and send the winds to speed you all her curtsy was moderately deep aviendha had become a judge of these things for all she thought it looked the most awkward thing any woman could ever do forgive us if there have been words in haste we mean no disrespect to one who is as a queen to the athaвђan miere that with a speaking look for nynaeve nynaeve only shrugged though elayne introduced herself again and the rest of them to strange reactions that elayne was daughterheir produced none though that was a high position among the wetlanders and that she was green ajah and nynaeve yellow received sniffs from nesta din reas and sharp looks from the spindly old man elayne blinked taken aback but she went on smoothly we have come for two reasons the lesser is to ask how you mean to aid the dragon reborn who according to the jendai prophecy you call the coramoor the greater is to request the help of this vesselвђs windfinder whose name she added gently i regret i do not yet know the slender woman who could channel reddened i am dorile din eiran long feather aes sedai i may help if it pleases the light malin din toral looked abashed too the welcome of my ship to you she murmured and the grace of the light be upon you until you leave his decks not so nesta din reas the bargain is with the coramoor she said in a hard voice and made a sharp cutting gesture the shorebound have no part of it except where they tell of his coming you girl nynaeve what ship gave you the gift of passage who was his windfinder i canвђt recall nynaeveвђs airy tone was at odds with the stony smile she wore she had a deathgrip on her braid too but at least she had not embraced saidaragain and i am nynaeve sedai nynaeve aes sedai not girl putting her hands flat on the table nesta din reas directed a stare at her that reminded aviendha of sorilea perhaps you are but i will know who revealed what should not have been revealed she has lessons of silence to learn a split sail is split nesta the old man said suddenly in a deep voice much stronger than his bony limbs suggested aviendha had taken him for a guard but his tone was that of an equal it might be well to ask what aid aes sedai would have of us in days when the coramoor has come and the seas rage in endless storms and the doom of the prophecy sails the oceans if they are aes sedai that with a raised eyebrow to the windfinder she answered quietly in a respectful voice three can channel including her she pointed at aviendha i have never met anyone so strong as they they must be who else would dare wear the ring waving her to silence nesta din reas turned that same iron gaze on the man aes sedai never ask aid baroc she growled aes sedai never askanything he met her gaze mildly but after a moment she sighed as though he had stared her down the eyes she aimed at elayne were no whit softer though what would you have of us she hesitated daughterheir of andor even that sounded skeptical nynaeve gathered herself ready to launch into an attack вђ aviendha had had to listen to more than one tirade sparked by the aes sedai back in the tarasin palace and their habit of forgetting that she and elayne were aes sedai too someone not even aes sedai denying it might bring the shedding of blood вђ nynaeve gathered herself up and opened her mouth and elayne silenced her with a touch on the arm and a whisper too low for aviendha to hear nynaeveвђs face was still crimson and she looked about to pull her braid out slowly by the roots yet she held her tongue maybe elayne couldmake peace in a waterfeud of course elayne could not be pleased when not only her right to be called aes sedai but her right to the title of daughterheir was doubted so openly most would have thought her quite calm but aviendha knew the signs the raised chin spoke of anger add eyes open as wide as they would go and elayne was a torch to overwhelm nynaeveвђs ember besides birgitte was on her toes face like stone and eyes like fire she did not usually mirror elayneвђs emotions except when they were very strong wrapping her fingers around the hilt of her belt knife aviendha readied herself to embrace saidar she would kill the windfinder first the woman was not weak in the power and she would be dangerous they could find others with so many ships about we seek a terвђangreal except that her tone was cool anyone who did not know her would think elayne was absolutely serene she faced nesta din reas but she addressed everyone perhaps especially the windfinder with it we believe we can remedy the weather it must trouble you as much as it does the land baroc spoke of endless storms you must be able to see the dark oneвђs touch the father of stormsвђ touch on the sea just as we do on the land with this terвђangreal we can change that but we cannot do it alone it will require many women working together perhaps a full circle of thirteen we think those women should include windfinders no one else knows so much of weather not any aes sedai living that is the aid we ask dead silence met her speech until dorile din eiran said carefully this terвђangreal aes sedai what is it called how does it look it has no name that i know elayne told her it is a thick crystal bowl shallow but something over two feet across and worked inside with clouds when it is channeled into the clouds move вђ the bowl of the winds the windfinder broke in excitedly stepping toward elayne as if she did not realize it they have the bowl of the winds you truly have it the wavemistressвђs eyes were fixed on elayne eagerly and she also took an involuntary step we are lookingfor it elayne said but we know it is in ebou dar if it is the same вђ it must be malin din toral exclaimed by your description it must the bowl of the winds dorile din eiran breathed to think it would be found again after two thousand years here it must be the coramoor he must have вђ nesta din reasвђ hands slapped together loudly do i see a wavemistress and her windfinder or two deckgirls at their first shipmeet malin din toralвђs cheeks reddened with a proud anger and she bent her head stiffly pride in that as well twice as flushed dorile din eiran bowed touching fingertips to forehead lips and heart the shipmistress frowned at them a moment before going on baroc summon the other wavemistresses who hold this port and the first twelve as well with their windfinders and let them know you will hoist them by their toes in their own rigging if they do not hurry as he rose she added oh and have tea sent down working out the terms of this bargain will be thirsty the old man nodded that he might dangle wavemistresses by their toes and that he must send tea were accepted equally eyeing aviendha and the others he sauntered out with that rolling walk she changed her opinion when she saw his eyes close up it might have been a fatal mistake to kill the windfinder first someone must have been awaiting orders of the sort because baroc was only gone moments before a slim pretty young man with a single thin ring in each ear entered carrying a wooden tray that bore a square blueglazed teapot with a golden handle and large blue cups of thick pottery nesta din reas waved him out вђ he will spread enough tales as it is without hearing what he should not she said when he was gone вђ and directed birgitte to pour which she did to aviendhaвђs surprise and maybe her own the shipmistress settled elayne and nynaeve in chairs at one end of the table apparently intent on beginning her bargaining aviendha refused a chair вђ at the other end of the table вђ but birgitte took one swinging the arm out then latching it back when she was seated the wavemistress and the windfinder were excluded from that discussion too if discussion it could be called the words were too low to hear but nesta din reas emphasized everything she said with a finger driven like a spear elayne had her chin so high she seemed to be looking down her nose and if nynaeve for once was managing to keep her face calm she seemed to be trying to climb her own braid if it pleases the light i will speak with both of you malin din toral said looking from aviendha to birgitte but i think i must hear your story first birgitte began to look alarmed as the woman sat down across from her which means i can speak first with you if it pleases the light dorile din eiran told aviendha i have read of the aiel if it pleases you tell me if an aiel woman must kill a man every day how are there any men left among you aviendha did her best not to stare how could the woman believe such nonsense when did you live among us malin din toral said over her teacup at the near end of the table birgitte was leaning away from her as though she wanted to climb over the back of the chair at the far end of the table nesta din reasвђ voice rose for a moment came to me not i to you thatsets the basis for our bargain even if you are aes sedai slipping into the room baroc paused between aviendha and birgitte it seems your shoreboat departed as soon as you came below but have no worry windrunnerhas boats to put you on the shore walking on down the cabin he took a chair below elayne and nynaeve and joined right in when they looked at whichever was speaking the other could observe them unnoticed they had lost an advantage one they needed of course the bargain is on our terms he said in tones of disbelief that it could be otherwise while the shipmistress studied elayne and nynaeve as a woman might two goats she meant to skin for a feast barocвђs smile was almost fatherly who asks must of course pay highest but you must have lived among us to know those ancient oaths malin din toral insisted are you well aviendha dorile din eiran asked even here the motion of a ship sometimes affects shorefolk вђ no and my questions do not offend then tell me do aiel women truly tie a man down before you вђ i mean when you and he вђ when you вђ cheeks reddened she broke off with a weak smile are many aiel women as strong in the one power as you it was not the windfinderвђs foolish fumbling about that had made the blood drain from aviendhaвђs face or that birgitte appeared ready to run once she could manage to unlatch the chair arm again or even that nynaeve and elayne were apparently discovering they were two brighteyed girls at a fair in the hands of wellseasoned traders they would all blame her and rightly she was the one who had said if they could not take the terвђangrealback to egwene and the other aes sedai once found why not secure these sea folk women they spoke of time could not be wasted waiting for egwene alвђvere to say they could return they would blame her and she would meet her toh but she was remembering the boats she had seen on the deck stacked upside down atop one another boats without any shelter on board they would blame her but whatever debt she owed she was going to repay a thousandfold in shame by the time she was taken across seven or eight miles of water in an open boat do you have a bucket she asked the windfinder faintly chapter dice white plumes the silver circuit was misnamed at first glance but ebou dar liked grand names and sometimes it seemed that the worse they fit the better the grimiest tavern mat had seen in the city smelling of very old fish bore the name of the queenвђs glory in radiance while the golden crown of heaven graced a dim hole across the river in the rahad with only a blue door to mark it where black stains from old knife fights splotched the grimy floor the silver circuit was for racing horses removing his hat he fanned himself with the broad brim and went so far as to loosen the black silk scarf he wore to hide the scar around his neck the morning air shimmered with heat already yet crowds packed the two long earthen banks that flanked the course where the horses would run up and back that was all there was to the silver circuit the murmur of voices almost drowned out the cries of the gulls overhead there was no charge to watch so saltworkers in the white vest of their guild and gauntfaced farmers who had fled from the dragonsworn inland rubbed shoulders with ragged taraboners wearing transparent veils across their thick mustaches weavers in vests with vertical stripes printers in horizontal stripes and dyers with hands stained to the elbow the unrelieved black of amadician countrymen buttoned to the neck though the wearers seemed about to sweat to death stood alongside murandian village dresses with long colorful aprons so narrow they must be only for show and even a handful of copperskinned domani the men in short coats if they wore one the women in wool or linen so thin it clung like silk there were apprentices and laborers from the docks and warehouses tanners who had a small space around them in the crowd because of the smell of their work and filthyfaced street children watched closely because they would steal whatever they could lay hand to there was little silver among the working people though all of them were above the thick hemp ropes strung on posts below was for those who did have silver and gold the wellborn the welldressed and the welltodo smug menservants poured punch into silver cups for their masters fluttery maids waved feathered fans to cool their mistresses and there was even a capering fool with whitepainted face and jingling brass bells on his blackandwhite hat and coat haughty men in highcrowned velvet hats strutted with slender swords on their hips their hair brushing silk coats slung across their shoulders and held by gold or silver chains between the narrow embroidered lapels some of the women had hair shorter than the men and some longer arranged in as many ways as there were women they wore wide hats with plumes or sometimes fine netting to obscure their faces and gowns usually cut to show bosom whether in the local style or from elsewhere the nobles beneath brightly colored parasols glittered with rings and earrings necklaces and bracelets in gold and ivory and fine gems as they stared down their noses at everyone else wellfed merchants and moneylenders with just a touch of lace and perhaps one pin or a ring bearing a fat polished stone humbly bowed or curtsied to their betters who very likely owed them vast sums fortunes changed hands at the silver circuit and not just in wagers it was said lives and honor changed hands too below the ropes replacing his hat mat raised his hand and one of the bookers came вђ a hatchetfaced woman with a nose like an awl вђ spreading bony hands as she bowed murmuring the ritual as my lord wishes to wager so shall i write truly the ebou dari accent managed to be soft despite clipping the ends off some words the book is open like the saying the open book embroidered on the breast of her red vest came from a time long past when the wagers were written into a book but he suspected he was the only one there who knew that he remembered many things he had never seen from times long gone to dust with a quick glance at the odds for the morningвђs fifth race chalked on the slate the poleman held up behind the redvested woman he nodded wind was only the third favorite despite his victories he turned to his companion put it all on wind nalesean the tairen hesitated fingering the point of his oiled black beard sweat glistened on his face yet he kept his coat with its fat bluestriped sleeves fastened to the top and wore a square cap of blue velvet that did nothing to keep the sun off all of it mat he spoke softly trying to keep the woman from hearing the odds could change any time until you actually offered your wager burn my soul but that little piebald looks fast and so does that pale dun gelding with the silvery mane they were the favorites today new to the city and like all things new of great expectation mat did not bother to glance toward the ten horses entered in the next race that were parading at one end of the course he had already taken a good look while putting olver up on wind all of it some idiot clubbed the piebaldвђs tail heвђs already half mad from the flies the dun is showy but he has a bad angle to his fetlocks he may have won some in the country but heвђll finish last today horses were one thing he knew on his own his father had taught him and abell cauthon had a sharp eye for horseflesh he looks more than showy to me nalesean grumbled but he was not arguing any more the booker blinked as nalesean sighing pulled purse after fat purse from his bulging coat pockets at one point she opened her mouth to protest but the illustrious and honored guild of bookers always claimed it would take any wager in any amount they even wagered with shipowners and merchants as to whether a ship would sink or prices change rather the guild itself did not individual bookers the gold went into one of her ironstrapped chests each carried by a pair of fellows with arms as thick as matвђs legs her guards hardeyed and bentnosed in leather vests that showed arms still thicker held long brassbound cudgels another of her men handed her a white token bearing a detailed blue fish вђ every booker had a different sigil вђ and she wrote the wager the name of the horse and a symbol indicating the race on the back with a fine brush that she took from a lacquered box held by a pretty girl slim with big dark eyes the girl directed a slow smile at mat the hatchetfaced woman certainly did not smile bowing again she slapped the girl casually and walked off whispering to her poleman who hastily wiped his slate with a cloth when he held it up again wind was listed at the shortest odds rubbing her cheek surreptitiously the girl scowled back at mat as though the slap had been his fault i hope your luck is in nalesean said holding the token carefully for the ink to dry bookers could be touchy about paying on a token with smeared ink and no one was touchier than an ebou dari i know you donвђt lose often but iвђve seen it happen burn me but i have thereвђs a lass i mean to step out with at the dancing tonight just a seamstress he was a lord though not a bad fellow really and such things seemed important to him but pretty enough to dry your mouth she likes trinkets golden trinkets she likes fireworks too вђ i hear some illuminators are setting up for tonight youвђll be interested in that вђ but itвђs trinkets make her smile she wonвђt be friendly if i cannot afford to make her smile mat youвђll make her smile mat said absently the horses were still walking in a circle above the starting poles olver sat proudly on windвђs back broad mouth grinning to split his morethanplain face from jugear to jugear in ebou dari races all the riders were boys a few miles inland they used girls olver was the smallest here today the lightest not that the leggy gray gelding needed the advantage youвђll make her laugh till she canвђt stand up nalesean gave him a frown he barely noticed the man should know gold was one thing mat never had to worry about he might not always win but close enough his luck had nothing to do with whether wind won anyway of that he was sure gold did not concern him but olver did there was no rule against the boys using their switches on each other instead of their mounts in every race so far wind had broken to the lead and stayed there but if olver took any hurt even just a bruise mat would never hear the end not from mistress anan his innkeeper not from nynaeve or elayne not from aviendha or birgitte the onetime maiden of the spear and the peculiar woman elayne had taken as a warder were the last he would have expected to gush with maternal feelings yet they had already tried to move the boy out of the wandering woman behind his back and into the tarasin palace anywhere with so many aes sedai was the last place for olver or for anybody but one bump and instead of telling birgitte and aviendha they had no right to take the boy setalle anan would likely hustle him off there herself olver would probably cry himself to sleep if he was not allowed to race anymore but women never understood these things for about the thousandth time mat cursed nalesean for sneaking olver and wind to those first races of course they had to find something to fill all the idle hours on their hands but they could have found something else cutting purses could have been no worse in the womenвђs eyes hereвђs the thiefcatcher nalesean said stuffing the token into his coat he did not quite sneer much good heвђs done so far weвђd have done better to bring another fifty soldiers instead juilin strode though the crowd purposefully a dark hard man using a slender bamboo staff as tall as himself for a walking stick with a flattopped conical red taraboner cap on his head and a plain coat tight to the waist then flaring to his boot tops wellworn and plainly not the coat of someone rich he normally would not have been allowed below the ropes but he made out to study the horses and ostentatiously bounced a fat coin on his palm several of the bookersвђ guards looked at him suspiciously but the gold crown let him pass well mat said sourly tugging his hat low once the thiefcatcher reached him no let me tell you they slipped out of the palace again no one saw them go again nobody has any bloody idea where they are again juilin tucked the coin carefully into his coat pocket he would make no wager he seemed to save every copper that came into his hands all four of them took a closed coach from the palace to a landing on the river where they hired a boat thom hired another to follow and see where theyвђre going nowhere dark or unpleasant iвђd say by their clothes but it is true nobles wear silk to crawl in the mud he grinned at nalesean who folded his arms and pretended to be engrossed in the horses the grin was a mere baring of teeth they were both tairen but the gap between noble and common stood wide in tear and neither man liked the otherвђs company women several finely dressed specimens nearby turned to eye mat askance from beneath bright parasols he frowned right back though two were pretty and they set to laughing and chattering among themselves as though he had done something amusing a woman would do a thing until you were sure she always would then do something else just to fuddle you but he had promised rand to see elayne safely to caemlyn and nynaeve and egwene with her and he had promised egwene to see the other two safe on this trip to ebou dar not to mention aviendha that was the price of getting elayne to caemlyn not that they had told him why they needed to be here oh no not that they had spoken twenty words to him since arriving in the bloody city iвђll see them safe he muttered under his bream if i have to stuff them into barrels and haul them to caemlyn in a cart he might be the only man in the world who could say that about aes sedai without looking over his shoulder maybe even including rand and those fellows he was gathering he touched the foxhead medallion hanging under his shirt to make sure it was there though he never took it off even to bathe it did have flaws but a man liked to be reminded tarabon must be terrible now for a woman not used to taking care of herself juilin murmured he was watching three veiled men in tattered coats and baggy oncewhite trousers scramble up the bank ahead of a pair of bookmenвђs guards waving their clubs no rule said the poor could not come below the ropes but the bookersвђ guards did the two pretty women who had eyed mat appeared to be making a private wager on whether the taraboners would outrun the guards weвђve more than enough women right here without sense to come in out of the rain mat told him go back to that boat landing and wait for thorn tell him i need him as soon as possible i want to know what those fool bloody women are up to juilinвђs look did not quite call hima fool they had after all been trying to find out exactly that for over a month now ever since coming here with a last glance at the fleeing men he sauntered back the way he had come once more bouncing the coin in his hand frowning mat peered across the racecourse it was barely fifty paces to the crowd on the other side and faces leaped out at him вђ a bent whitehaired old man with a hooked nose a sharpfaced woman under a hat that seemed mostly plumes a tall fellow who looked like a stork in green silk and gold braid a nicely plump fullmouthed young woman who appeared about to come out of her dress at the top the longer the heat continued the fewer and thinner garments women in ebou dar wore but for once he hardly gave them any notice weeks had gone by since he so much as glimpsed the women who concerned him now birgitte certainly needed no one to hold her hand a hunter for the horn anyone who troubled her would be in a deep hole by his estimation and aviendha all she needed was someone to keep her from stabbing everybody who looked at her crossways as far as he was concerned she could knife whoever she wanted so long as it was not elayne for all the bloody daughterheir walked about with her nose in the air she turned mooneyed around rand and for all aviendha behaved as if she would stab any man who glanced her way she did the same rand usually knew how to deal with women but he had jumped into a bear pit letting that pair come together it was a short road to disaster and why ruin had not happened was beyond mat for some reason his eyes drifted back to the sharpfaced woman she was pretty if vulpine about nynaeveвђs age he estimated it was hard to tell at the distance but he could judge women as well as he could horses of course women could fool you faster than any horse slim why did she make him think of straw what he could see of her hair beneath the plumed hat was dark no matter birgitte and aviendha could do without his shepherding and normally he would have said the same of elayne and nynaeve however wrongheaded conceited and downright pushy they could be that they had been sneaking out all this time said differently though wrongheadedness was the key they were the sort who berated a man for meddling and chased him away then berated him again for not being there when he was needed not that they would admit he was needed even then not them raise a hand to help and you were interfering do nothing and you were an untrustworthy wastrel the foxfaced woman across the way popped into his view again not straw a stable which made no more sense he had had fine times in stables with many a young woman and some not so young but she wore modestly cut blue silk with a high neck right under her chin trimmed in snowy lace and more spilling over her hands a lady and he avoided noblewomen like death playing haughty like a harp expecting a man always to be at their beck and call not mat cauthon strangely she was fanning herself with a spray of white plumes where was her maid a knife why should she make him think of a knife and fire something burning anyway shaking his head he tried to focus on what was important other menвђs memories of battles and courts and lands vanished centuries ago filled holes in his own places where his own life suddenly went thin or was not there at all he could remember fleeing the two rivers with moiraine and lan quite clearly for example but almost nothing more until reaching caemlyn and there were gaps before and after as well if whole years of his own growing up lay beyond recall why should he expect to recollect every woman he had met maybe she reminded him of some woman dead a thousand years or more the light knew that happened often enough even birgitte sometimes tickled his memory well there were four women here and now who had his brain tied in knots they were what was important nynaeve and the others were avoiding him as if he had fleas five times he had been to the palace and the once they would see him it was to say they were too busy for him and send him away like an errand boy it all added up to one thing they thought he would interfere with whatever they were up to and the only reason he would do that was if they were putting themselves in danger they were not complete fools idiots often but not complete fools if they saw danger there was danger some places in this city being a stranger or showing a coin could bring a knife in your ribs and not even channeling would stop it if they did not see in time and here he was with nalesean and a dozen good men from the band not to mention thom and juilin who actually had rooms in the servantsвђ quarters of the palace all left to twiddle their thumbs those thickskulled women were going to get their throats cut yet not if i can help it he growled what nalesean said look theyвђre lining up mat the light burn my soul i hope youвђre right that piebald doesnвђt look halfcrazed to me he looks eager the horses were prancing taking their places between tall poles stuck in the ground with streamers tailing from the tops of them in a warm breeze blue and green and every color some striped five hundred paces down the track of hardbeaten red clay an identical number of streamered poles made another row each rider had to round the samecolored streamer as floated to his right at the start and then return a booker stood at either end of the line of horses just to the front a round woman and a rounder man each with a white scarf held overhead the bookers took turns at this and were not allowed to accept wagers on a race they started burn me nalesean muttered light man be easy youвђll tickle your seamstress under the chin yet a roar drowned the last word as the scarves came down and the horses surged forward even the sound of their hooves submerged in the noise of the crowd in ten strides wind had the lead olver lying close on his neck with the silvermaned dun only a head back the piebald trailed in the pack where the ridersвђ switches already rose and fell frantically i told you the dun was dangerous nalesean moaned we shouldnвђt have wagered everything mat did not bother to answer he had another purse in his pocket and loose coins besides he called the purse his seed with that with even a few of the coins in it and a game of dice he could repair his fortunes whatever happened this morning halfway down the course wind still held the lead the dun clinging close a full length ahead of the next horse the piebald was running fifth after the turn would come the hazard boys on trailing animals were known to slash at those who rounded the stakes ahead of them following the horses matвђs eyes swept across the sharpfaced woman again and snapped back the shouts and screams of the crowd faded the woman was shaking her fan at the horses and jumping excitedly but suddenly he saw her in pale green and a rich gray cloak her hair caught in a frothy net of lace skirts held up delicately as she picked her way across a stable not far from caemlyn rand still lay there moaning in the straw even if the fever seemed gone at least he was not shouting anymore at people who were not there mat eyed the woman suspiciously as she knelt beside rand maybe she could help as she claimed but mat did not trust as he once had what was a fine lady like this doing in a village stable caressing the rubytipped hilt of the dagger hidden by his coat he wondered why he had ever trusted it never paid never weak as a dayold kitten she was saying as she reached beneath her cloak i think a knife appeared in her hand so suddenly streaking for matвђs throat that he would have been dead if he had not been ready dropping flat he seized her wrist just pushing it away from him the curved shadar logoth blade sweeping out to lie against her slim white neck the woman froze trying to look down at the sharp edge dimpling her skin he wanted to slice especially when he saw where her own dagger had stabbed into the stable wall around the slim blade a black circle of char grew and a thin gray tendril of smoke rose from wood about to burst into flame shivering mat rubbed a hand across his eyes just carrying that shadar logoth knife had nearly killed him eating those holes in his memories but how could he forget a woman who tried to kill him a darkfriend вђ she had admitted as much вђ who tried to kill him with a dagger that set a bucket of water near boiling when they tossed it in after securing her in the tackroom a darkfriend who had been hunting rand and him what chance she was in ebou dar when he was at the races on the same day taвђverenmight be the answer вђ he liked thinking of that about as much he did the horn of bloody valere вђ but the fact was the forsaken knew his name that stable had not been the last time darkfriends tried putting an end to mat cauthon he staggered as nalesean suddenly began pounding his back look at him mat light of heaven look at him the horses had rounded the far poles and were well on their way back head stretched out mane and tail flying behind wind streaked down the course with olver clinging to his back like a part of the saddle the boy rode as if he had been born there four lengths behind the piebald pounded furiously rider working his switch in a futile effort to close just like that they slashed across the finish line with the next nearest horse another three lengths back the whitemaned dun came last the moans and mutters of losing bettors overwhelmed the shouts of winners losing tokens made a shower of white onto the track and dozens of the bookersвђ servants rushed out to clear them away before the next race we have to find that woman mat iвђd not put it past her to run off without paying out so much as she owes us from what mat had heard the bookersвђ guild was more than harsh the first time one of its members tried anything of the sort and deadly the second but they were commoners and that was enough for nalesean sheвђs standing right over there in plain view mat gestured without taking his eyes from the foxfaced darkfriend glaring at a token she hurled it to the ground and even lifted her skirts to stamp on it plainly not a wager on wind still grimacing she began threading her way through the crowd mat stiffened she was leaving gather our winnings nalesean then take olver back to the inn if he misses his reading lesson youвђll kiss the dark oneвђs sister before mistress anan lets him out for another race where are you going i saw a woman who tried to kill me mat said over his shoulder give her a trinket next time nalesean shouted after him following the woman was no trouble with that whiteplumed hat for a banner bobbing through the crowd on the other side the earthen banks gave way to a large open area where brightly lacquered coaches and sedan chairs waited under the watchful eyes of drivers and bearers matвђs horse pips was one of scores being guarded by members of the ancient and worshipful guild of stablemen there was a guild for most things in ebou dar and woe to anyone who trespassed on their ground he paused but she walked on by the conveyances that had brought those with position or money no maid and now not even a chair no one walked in this heat who had money to ride had my lady come on hard times the silver circuit lay just south of the tall whiteplastered city wall and she strolled up the hundred paces or so of road to the broad pointed arch of the moldine gate and in trying to appear casual mat followed the gateway was ten spans of dim tunnel but her hat stood out among the folk passing through people who had to walk seldom wore plumes she seemed to know where she was going on the other side the plumes wove through the crowds ahead of him unhurried but always moving forward ebou dar shone white in the morning sun white palaces with white columns and screened wroughtiron balconies cheekbyjowl with whiteplastered weaversвђ shops and fishmongers and stables great white houses with louvered shutters hiding their arched windows beside white inns with painted signs hanging in front and open markets under long roofs where live sheep and chickens calves and geese and ducks made a barnyard din alongside their fellows already butchered and hanging all white stone or plaster except here and there bands of red or blue or gold on turnipshaped domes and pointed spires that had balconies running around them there were squares everywhere always with a statue larger than life on a pedestal or a splashing fountain that only emphasized the heat always packed with people refugees filled the city and merchants and traders of every sort never a trouble but brought profit to somebody what saldaea had once sent into arad doman now came downriver to ebou dar and so did what amadicia had traded into tarabon everyone scurried for a coin or a thousand for a bite to eat today the aroma that hung in the air was equal parts perfume dust and sweat somehow it all smelled desperate bargefilled canals sliced through the city crossed by dozens of bridges some so narrow that two people would have to squeeze past one another others large enough that shops actually lined them hanging out over the water on one of those he suddenly realized that the whiteplumed hat had stopped people flowed around him as he did too the shops here were really just open wooden nooks with heavy plank shutters that could be let down to close them off at night raised overhead now the shutters displayed signs for the shops the one above the plumed hat showed a golden scale and hammer sign of the goldsmithsвђ guild though plainly not of a particularly prosperous member through a momentary gap in the crowd he saw her look back and turned hurriedly to the narrow stall to his right on the wall at the back hung finger rings and boards displaying stones cut in all sorts of designs my lord wishes a new signet ring the birdlike fellow behind the counter asked bowing and drywashing his hands skinny as a rail he had no worry of anyone stealing his goods cramped into a corner on a stool sat a oneeyed fellow who might have had trouble standing upright inside the cubicle with a long cudgel studded with nail heads propped between his massive knees i can cut any design as my lord can see and i have tryrings for the size of course let me see that one mat pointed at random he needed some reason to stand here until she went on it might be a good time to decide exactly what he was going to do a fine example of the long style my lord much in favor now gold but i work in silver as well why i think the size is right if my lord would care to try it on my lord may wish to examine the fine detail of the carving does my lord prefer gold or silver with a grunt that he hoped might be taken for answer to some of that mat shoved the proffered ring onto the second finger of his left hand and pretended to examine the dark oval of carved stone all he really saw was that it was as long as the joint of his finger head down he studied the woman from the corner of his eye the best he could through gaps that opened in the throng she was holding a wide flat gold necklace up to the light there was a civil guard in ebou dar but not a very efficient one seldom to be seen on the streets if he denounced her it would be his word against hers and even if he was believed a few coins might let her walk free even on that charge the civil guard was cheaper than a magistrate but either could be bought unless someone powerful was watching and then if enough gold lay in the offer a swirl in the crowd suddenly turned into a whitecloak conical helmet and long mail shirt gleaming like silver snowy cloak with the flaring golden sun billowing as he strode along confident that a path would clear for him which it certainly did few willingly put themselves in the way of the children of the light yet for every eye that slid away from the stonefaced man another beamed on him approvingly the sharpfaced woman not only looked at him openly she smiled a charge laid against her might or might not put her in prison but it could be the spark to ignite a city full of tales about darkfriends in the tarasin palace whitecloaks were good at whipping up mobs and to them aes sedai weredarkfriends as the child of the light passed her she laid down the necklace apparently regretful and turned to go does the style suit my lord mat gave a start he had forgotten the skinny man and the ring too no i donвђt want вђ frowning he tugged at the ring again it would not budge no need to pull you might crack the stone now that he was no longer a potential customer mat was no longer my lord either sniffing the fellow kept a sharp eye on him lest he try to run i have some grease deryl whereвђs that greasepot the guard blinked and scratched his head as if wondering what a greasepot was the whiteplumed hat was halfway to the end of the bridge already iвђll take it mat snapped no time for haggling hauling a fistful of coins from his coat pocket he slapped them down on the counter mostly gold and a little silver enough the ringmakerвђs eyes bulged a little too much he quavered uncertainly his hands hesitated above the coins then two fingers pushed a pair of silver pennies toward mat so much give them to deryl mat growled as the bloody ring slipped from his finger the skinny man was hurriedly raking up the rest of the coins too late to try backing out of the purchase mat wondered by just how much he had overpaid stuffing the ring into his pocket he hastened after the darkfriend the hat was nowhere to be seen twinned statues decorated the end of the bridge pale marble women over a span tall each with one breast bared and a hand raised to point toward something in the sky in ebou dar a bare chest symbolized openness and honesty ignoring stares he climbed up beside one of the women steadying himself with an arm around her waist a street ran along the canal and two more split off at angles ahead all full of people and carts sedan chairs and wagons and coaches someone shouted in a rough voice about real women being warmer and a number in the crowd laughed white plumes appeared from behind a bluelacquered coach on the lefthand fork leaping down he pushed up the street after her ignoring the curses of those he bumped it was an odd chase in the mass of people with wagons and coaches constantly getting in his way he could not keep a clear sight of the hat from the street scampering up the broad marble steps of a palace he got another glimpse then scurried back down to shove ahead the rim of a tall fountain gave him yet another view then an upended barrel against a wall and a crate that had just been unloaded from an oxcart once he clung to the side of a wagon until the driver threatened him with her whip with all the climbing and looking he did not narrow the darkfriendвђs lead very much but then he still had no notion what to do if he caught her suddenly when he hoisted himself up onto the narrow coping along the face of one of the big houses she was not there anymore frantically he looked up and down the street the white plumes no longer waved through the crowd in easy sight were half a dozen houses much like the one he was clinging to several palaces of various sizes two inns three taverns a cutlerвђs shop with a knife and a pair of scissors on its sign a fishmonger with a board painted in fifty kinds of fish two rugweavers with unrolled carpets spread on tables beneath awnings a tailorвђs shop and four cloth sellers two shops displaying lacquerware a goldsmith a silversmith a livery stable the list was too long she could have gone into any of them or none she might have taken a turn he had not seen jumping down he settled his hat muttering under his breath and saw her almost at the top of the wide stairs leading to a palace nearly across from him already halfhidden by the tall fluted columns out front the palace was not large with only two slim spires and a single pearshaped dome banded in red but ebou dari palaces always gave the ground floor to servants and kitchens and the like the better rooms were high to catch the breezes doormen liveried in black and yellow bowed deeply and swung the carved doors wide before she reached them a servant inside curtsied apparently saying something and immediately turned to lead her deeper she was known he would have wagered everything on it for a while after the doors closed he stood there studying the palace not the richest in the city by far but only a noble would dare build its like but who in the pit of doom lives there he muttered finally plucking off his hat to fan himself not her not when she had to walk a few questions in the taverns along the street would tell him and word of his queries would seep to the palace sure as dirt soiled your hands someone said carridin it was a scrawny whitehaired fellow lounging nearby in the shade mat looked at him questioningly and he grinned showing gaps in his teeth his stooped shoulders and sad weathered face did not fit his fine gray coat despite a bit of lace at his neck he was the very picture of hard times you asked who lived there the chelsaine palace is let to jaichim carridin matвђs hat paused you mean the whitecloak ambassador aye and inquisitor of the hand of the light the old man tapped a gnarled finger against the side of his beak of a nose both looked to have been broken several times not a man to bother unless you must and then iвђd think three times unconsciously mat hummed a bit of storm from the mountains not a man to bother indeed questioners were the nastiest of the whitecloaks a whitecloak inquisitor who had a darkfriend come to call thank you вђ mat gave a start the fellow was gone swallowed up in the crowd strange but he had looked familiar maybe another longdead acquaintance drifting out of those old memories maybe it hit him like an illuminatorвђs nightflower exploding inside his head a whitehaired man with a hooked nose that old man had been at the silver circuit standing not far from the woman who had just gone into carridinвђs rented palace turning his hat in his hands he frowned uneasily at the palace the mire never held a bog like this one he could feel the dice tumbling in his head suddenly and that was always a bad sign chapter snakey square insects carridin did not look up immediately from the letter he was writing when the lady shiaine as she called herself was shown in three ants struggled futilely in the wet ink trapped everything else might be dying but ants and cockroaches and every sort of vermin seemed to thrive carefully he pressed the blotter down he was not about to begin again for a few ants a failure to send this report or a report of failure might doom him as surely as those mired insects yet it was fear of a different failure that tightened his guts he had no worry of shiaine reading what he wrote it was in a cipher known to only two men beside himself so many bands of dragonsworn at work each stiffened by a core of his most trusted men so many more who might be bandits or even truly sworn to that filth alвђthor pedron niall might not like that last but his command had been to plunge altara and murandy into blood and chaos from which only niall and the children of the light could rescue them a madness clearly to be laid at the feet of this socalled dragon reborn and that he had done fear held both countries by the throat tales that the witches marched across the same country were an added reward tar valon witches and dragonsworn aes sedai carrying off young women and setting up false dragons villages in flames and men nailed to the doors of their barns вђ it was all one in half the street rumors now niall would be pleased and send more orders how he expected carridin to snatch elayne trakand out of the tarasin palace was beyond reason another ant skittered across the ivoryinlaid table onto the page and his thumb stabbed down destroying it and smearing a word to illegibility the entire report would need to be redone he wanted a drink very badly there was brandy in a crystal flask on the table by the door but he did not want the woman to see him drinking suppressing a sigh he shoved the letter aside and pulled a kerchief from his sleeve to wipe his hand so shiaine do you finally have progress to report or have you just come for more money she smiled at him lazily from a tall carved armchair there are expenses associated with a search she said in almost the accents of an andoran noble especially when we want no questions asked most people would have been unsettled by the sight of jaichim carridin even cleaning a pen nib with his steely face and deepset eyes the white tabard over his coat bearing the golden sunburst of the children of the light impressed upon the crimson shepherdвђs crook of the hand not mili skane that was her real name though she did not know he knew a saddlerвђs daughter from a village near whitebridge she had gone to the white tower at fifteen another thing she thought secret it was hardly the best start becoming a friend of the dark because the witches told her she could not learn to channel but before that year was out she had not only found a circle in caemlyn but made her first kill in the seven years since she had added nineteen more she was one of the best assassins available and a hunter who could find anyone or anything that much he had been told when she was sent to him a circle reported to her now several of them actually were nobles and almost all were older but neither thing mattered among those who served the great lord another circle working for carridin was led by a gnarled beggar with one eye no teeth and a habit of bathing only once in the year had circumstances been different carridin himself would have knelt to old cully the only name the stinking villain admitted to mili skane surely groveled for old cully and so did every last companion of her circle noble or not it irritated carridin that lady shiaine would be on her knees in a flash if the stragglyhaired old beggar entered the room but for him sat with her legs crossed smiling and twitching her slippered foot as if impatient to be done she had been ordered to obey him absolutely by one even old cully would grovel for and besides he had a desperate need of success niallвђs schemes could go to dust but not this many things can be excused he said laying the pen on its ivory stand and shoving back his chair for those who accomplish the tasks they are given he was a tall man and he loomed threateningly he was well aware that the giltframed mirrors on the wall showed a figure of strength a dangerous man even dresses and baubles and gambling paid for with coin that was to go for information that twitching foot froze for instant then began again but her smile was forced her face pale her circle obeyed her instantly but they would string her up by the heels and skin her alive if he spoke the word you have not accomplished very much have you in fact you do not seem to have accomplished anything there are difficulties as you well know she said breathily she managed to meet his eyes squarely though excuses tell me of difficulties surmounted not those you stumble over and fall you can fall a long way if you fail in this turning his back he strode to the nearest window he could fall a long way too and he did not want to risk her seeing anything in his eyes sunlight slanted through the ornate stone screen the highceilinged room with its greenandwhitetiled floor and bright blue walls stayed comparatively cool behind the thick walls of the palace but the heat outside seeped in near the windows he could almost feel the brandy across the room he could not wait for her to be gone my lord carridin how can i have anyone ask too openly about objects of the power that willcause questions and there are aes sedai in the city you will recall peering down at the street through the scrollcarvings he wrinkled his nose at the smell every sort was jammed together down there an arafellin with his hair in two long braids and a curved sword on his back tossed a coin to a onearmed beggar who scowled at the gift before tucking it under his rags and resuming his piteous cries to the passersby a fellow in a torn bright red coat and even brighter yellow breeches came running from a shop clutching a bolt of cloth to his chest pursued by a shouting palehaired woman who had her skirts pulled above her knees and was outpacing the burly guard who lumbered behind her waving his truncheon the driver of a redlacquered coach with the moneylendersвђ gold coins and open hand on the door shook his whip at the driver of a canvascovered wagon whose team had become entangled with the coachвђs the man filling the street with curses grimy street urchins crouched behind a dilapidated cart while they snatched puny shriveled fruit brought in from the country a taraboner woman pushed her way through the crowd veiled her dark hair in thin braids drawing every male eye in her dusty red dress that shaped itself to her form shamelessly my lord i must have time i must i cannot do the impossible certainly not in days trash all of them grubbers for gold and hunters for the horn thieves refugees even tinkers scum riots would be easy to start a purge for all this filth outlanders were always the first targets always to blame for whatever was wrong along with neighbors who had the misfortune to be on the wrong side of grudges women who peddled herbs and cures and folk with no friends especially if they lived alone properly guided as carefully as such things could be a good riot might well burn the tarasin palace down around that useless jade tylin and the witches as well he glared at the swarm below riots did tend to get out of hand the civil guard might stir itself and inevitably a handful of true friends would be snapped up he could not afford the chance that some of those might be from the circles he had hunting for that matter even a few days of rioting would disrupt their work tylin was not important enough for that she did not matter at all in truth no not yet niall he could afford to disappoint but not his true master my lord carridin a note of defiance had entered shiaineвђs voice he had let her stew too long my lord carridin some of my circle question why we are looking for he started to turn to put her down hard вђ he needed success not excuses not questions вђ but her voice dwindled to nothing as his eyes fell on a young man standing diagonally across the street in a blue coat with enough redandgold embroidery on the sleeves and lapels for two nobles taller than most he was fanning himself with a broadbrimmed black hat and adjusting his neck scarf as he spoke to a stooped whitehaired man carridin recognized the young man suddenly he felt as though a knotted rope had been fastened around his head and was being drawn ever tighter for an instant a face hidden behind a red mask filled his vision nightdark eyes stared at him and then were endless caverns of flame and still staring within his head the world exploded in fire cascading images that battered him and swept him beyond screaming the forms of three young men stood unsupported in air and one of them began to glow the form of the man in the street brighter and brighter till it must have seared any living eyes to ash brighter still burning a curled golden horn sped toward him its cry pulling his soul then flashed into a ring of golden light swallowing him chilling him until the last fragment of him that recalled his name was sure his bones must splinter a rubytipped dagger hurdled straight at him curved blade striking him between the eyes and sinking in in until goldwrapped hilt and all was gone and he knew agony that washed away all thought that what had gone before was pain he would have prayed to a creator he had long abandoned if he remembered how he would have shrieked if he remembered how if he remembered that humans shrieked that he was human on and on more and more raising a hand to his forehead he wondered why it trembled his head ached too there had been something he gave a start at the street below everything was changed in the blink of an eye the people different wagons moved colorful coaches and chairs replaced by others worse cauthon was gone he wanted to swallow that whole flask of brandy in one gulp suddenly he realized that shiaine had stopped talking he turned ready to continue putting her in her place she was leaning forward in the act of rising one hand on the arm of her chair the other raised in a gesture her narrow face was fixed in petulant defiance but not at carridin she did not move she did not blink he was not sure she breathed he barely noticed her ruminating sammael said can i at least hope that it is about what you are here to find for me he stood only a little taller than average a muscular solid man in a coat of the highcollared illianer style so covered with goldwork it was hard to tell the cloth was green but more than being one of the chosen gave him stature his blue eyes were colder than winterвђs heart a livid scar burned down his face from golden hairline to the edge of golden squarecut beard and it seemed a suitable decoration whatever got in his way was brushed aside trampled or obliterated carridin knew sammael would have turned his bowels to water if the man had been just someone met by chance hurriedly moving from the window he dropped to his knees before the chosen he despised the tar valon witches indeed he despised anyone who used the one power meddling with what had broken the world once wielding what mere mortals should not touch this man used the power too but the chosen could not be called mere mortals perhaps not mortals at all and if he served well neither would he be great master i saw mat cauthon here oddly for a moment sammael seemed taken aback he murmured something under his breath and the blood drained from carridinвђs face at one caught word great lord you know i would never betray вђ you fool you havenвђt the stomach are you certain it was cauthon you saw yes great master in the street i know i can find him again sammael frowned down at him stroking his beard looking through and beyond jaichim carridin carridin did not like feeling insignificant especially when he knew it was true no sammael said finally your search is the most important thing the onlything so far as you are concerned cauthonвђs death would be convenient certainly but not if it draws attention here if it appears that attention is already here should he take an interest in your search then he dies but otherwise he can wait but вђ did you mishear me sammaelвђs scar pulled his smile into a snarl on one side i saw your sister vanora recently she did not look well at first screaming and weeping twitching constantly and pulling at her hair women do suffer worse than men from the attentions of myrddraal but even myrddraal must find their pleasures somewhere donвђt worry that she suffered too long the trollocs are always hungry the smile faded his voice was stone those who disobey can find themselves over a cookfire too vanora seemed to be smiling carridin do you think you would smile turning on a spit carridin swallowed in spite of himself and quelled a pang for vanora with her ready laugh and her skill with horses daring to gallop where others feared to walk she had been his favorite sister yet she was dead and he was not if there were any mercies in the world she had not learned why i live to serve and obey great master he did not believe he was a coward but no one disobeyed one of the chosen not more than once then find what i want sammael roared i know itвђs hidden somewhere in this kjasicflyspeck of a city terвђangreal angreal even saвђangreal i have tracked them traced them now you find them carridin do not make me grow impatient great master he worked his mouth to find moisture great master there are witches aes sedai here i cannot be sure how many if they hear a whisper waving him to silence sammael paced a few quick steps three times up and back hands clasped behind his back he did not look worried only considering finally he nodded i will send you someone to deal with these aes sedai he barked a short laugh i almost wish i could see their faces very well you have a little while longer then perhaps someone else will have a chance he lifted a strand of shiaineвђs hair with a finger she still did not move her eyes stared unblinking this child would certainly leap at the opportunity carridin fought down a stab of fear the chosen cast down as quickly as they raised up and as often failure never went unpunished great master the favor i asked of you if i might know have you will you вђ there is very little luck in you carridin sammael said with another smile you had better hope you have more carrying out my orders it seems that someone is making sure at least some of ishmaelвђs commands are still carried out he was smiling but he seemed far from amused or perhaps it was just the scar you failed him and youвђve lost your entire family for it only my hand protects you now once long ago i saw three myrddraal make a man give them his wife and his daughters one by one then beg them to cut off his right leg then the left then his arms and burn out his eyes the perfectly ordinary conversational tone made the recitation worse than any shouts or snarls ever could have it was a game with them you understand to see how much they could make him beg them to take they left his tongue for last of course but there wasnвђt a great deal of him remaining by then he had been quite powerful handsome and famous envied no one would ever envy what they finally tossed to the trollocs you wouldnвђt believe the sounds it made find what i want carridin you will not like it if i withdraw my hand abruptly there was a vertical line of light in the air before the chosen it seemed to turn in some fashion widening as it did into a square hole carridin gaped he was staring through a hole in the air at somewhere full of gray columns and thick mist sammael stepped through and the opening snapped shut a brilliant bar of light that vanished leaving only a purple afterimage glowing in carridinвђs eyes unsteadily he pushed himself to his feet failure was always punished but no one survived disobeying one of the chosen suddenly shiaine moved completing her halted rise from the chair you mark me bors she began then cut off staring at the window where he had been standing her eyes darted found him and she jumped he could have been one of the chosen himself from the way those eyes bulged no one survived disobeying the chosen he pressed his hands against his temples his head felt tight to bursting there is a man in the city mat cauthon you will вђ she gave a small start and he frowned you know him i have heard the name she said warily and angrily he would have said few linked to alвђthor remain unknown for long as he stepped closer she crossed her arms protectively in front of herself and held her place with an obvious effort what is a seedy farmboy doing in ebou dar how did he вђ donвђt bother me with foolish questions shiaine his head had never hurt like this never it felt as though a dagger was being driven into his skull between his eyes no one survived you will put your circle to locating cauthon immediately all of them old cully was coming tonight slipping in through the back of the stables she did not need to know there would be others nothing else is to get in the way but i thought вђ she broke off with a gasp as he seized her neck a slim dagger appeared in her hand but he wrenched it away she twisted and jerked but he drove her face down onto the table her cheek smudging stilldamp ink on the discarded letter to pedron niall the dagger stabbing down just in front of her eyes froze her by chance the blade piercing the paper had caught an ant by the tip of one leg it struggled as vainly as she had you are an insect mili the pain in his head made his voice rasp it is time you understand that one insect is much like another and if one wonвђt do her eyes followed his thumb down and when it flattened on the ant she flinched i live to serve and obey master she breathed she had said that to old cully every time he saw them together but never before to him and this is how you will obey no one survived disobedience no one chapter flame of tar valon a touch on the cheek the tarasin palace was a mass of shining marble and white plaster with screened balconies of whitepainted wrought iron and columned walks as much as four stories above the ground pigeons wheeled around pointed domes and tall balconywreathed spires banded in red and green tiles glittering in the sun sharparched gates in the palace itself led to various courtyards and more pierced the high wall hiding the gardens but deep snowy white steps ten spans wide climbed on the side facing mol hara square to great doors carved in coiling patterns like me balcony screens and covered with beaten gold the dozen or so guards lined up before those doors sweating in the sun wore gilded breastplates over green coats and baggy white trousers stuffed into dark green boots green cords secured thick twists of white cloth around glittering golden helmets with the long ends hanging down their backs even their halberds and the scabbards of their daggers and short swords shone with gold guards for being looked at not fighting but then when mat reached the top he could see swordsmenвђs calluses on their hands always before he had entered through one of the stableyards to peruse the palace horses in passing but this time he was going in the way a lord would the lightвђs blessing on all here he said to their officer a man not much older than he ebou dari were polite people iвђve come to leave a message for nynaeve sedai and elayne sedai or to give it to them if theyвђve returned the officer stared at him looked at the stairs in consternation gold cord as well as green on his pointed helmet signified some rank mat did not know and he carried a gilded rod instead of a halberd with a sharp end and a hook like an oxgoad by his expression no one had ever come up that way before studying matвђs coat he mulled it over visibly and at last decided he could not tell him to go away with a sigh the man murmured a benison in return and asked matвђs name pushed open a small door in one of the larger and ushered him into a grand entry hall encircled by five stonerailed balconies beneath a domed ceiling painted like the sky complete with clouds and a sun the guardвђs snapping fingers summoned a slim young serving woman in a white dress sewn up on the left to show green petticoats and embroidered on the left breast with a green anchor and sword she scurried across the redandblue marble floor looking startled curtsying to mat and the officer each short black hair framed a sweetly pretty face with silken olive skin and her livery had the deep narrow neckline common to all women except nobles in ebou dar for once mat did not really notice when she heard what he wanted her big black eyes widened even more aes sedai were not unpopular in ebou dar exactly but most ebou dari would go a long distance out of their way to avoid one yes swordlieutenant she said bobbing again of course swordlieutenant may it please you to follow me my lord it did outside ebou dar sparkled white but inside color ran wild there seemed to be miles of broad corridor in the palace and here the high ceiling was blue and the walls yellow there the walls pale red and the ceiling green changing with every turn combinations to jar any eye but a tinkerвђs matвђs boots sounded loud on floor tiles that made patterns of two or three or sometimes four colors in diamonds or stars or triangles wherever hallways crossed the floor was a mosaic of tiny tiles intricate swirls and scrolls and loops a few silk tapestries displayed scenes of the sea and arched niches held carved crystal bowls and small statues and yellow sea folk porcelain that would fetch a fine penny anywhere occasionally a liveried servant hurried along silently often as not carrying a silver tray or a golden normally displays of wealth made mat feel comfortable for one thing where there was money some might stick to his fingers this time he felt impatient more so by the step and anxious the last time he had felt the dice rolling so hard in his head was just before he found himself with three hundred of the band a thousand of gaebrilвђs white lions on a ridge to his front and another thousand coming hard up the road behind him when all he had been trying to do was ride away from the entire mess that time he had avoided the chop by the grace of other menвђs memories and more luck than he had a right to the dice almost always meant danger and something else he had not figured out yet the prospect of having his skull cracked was not enough and once or twice there had been no possibility of such yet the upcoming likelihood of mat cauthon dead in some spectacular fashion seemed the most usual cause unlikely maybe in the tarasin palace but unlikely did not make the dice go away he was going to leave his message grab nynaeve and elayne by the scruff of the neck if he had an opportunity give them a talkingto that made their ears glow and then get out the young woman glided ahead of him until they reached a short bullish man a little older than she another servant in tight white breeches a white shirt with wide sleeves and a long green vest with the anchor and sword of house mitsobar in a white disc master jen she said curtsying once more this is lord mat cauthon who wishes to leave a message for the honored elayne aes sedai and the honored nynaeve aes sedai very good haesel you may go he bowed to mat may it please you to follow me my lord jen led him as far as a dark grimfaced woman short of her middle years and bowed mistress carin this is lord mat cauthon who wishes to leave a message for the honored elayne aes sedai and the honored nynaeve aes sedai very good jen you may go may it please you to follow me my lord carin took him up a sweeping flight of marble stairs the risers painted yellow and red to a skinny woman named matilde who handed him over to a stout fellow named bren who led him to a balding man named madic each a little older than the one before where five corridors met like the spokes of a wheel madic left him with a round woman called laren who had a touch of gray at her temples and a stately carriage like carin and matilde she wore what the ebou dari called a marriage knife hanging hilt down from a closefitting silver necklace between more than plump breasts five white stones in the hilt two set in red and four red stones one surrounded by black said three of her nine children were dead two sons in duels rising out of her curtsy to mat laren began to float up one of the hallways but he hurried to catch her arm dark eyebrows rose slightly as she glanced at his hand she had no dagger except the marriage knife but he released her immediately custom said she could only use that on her husband yet there was no point in pushing he did not soften his voice though how far do i have to go to leave a note show me to their rooms a pair of aes sedai shouldnвђt be that hard to find this isnвђt the bloody white tower aes sedai a woman said behind him in a heavy illianer accent if you do seek two aes sedai you have found two larenвђs face did not change or almost not her nearly black eyes darted past him and he was sure they tightened with worry doffing his hat mat turned wearing an easy smile with that silver foxhead around his neck aes sedai did not put him off at all well not very much it had those flaws maybe the smile was not that easy the two women confronting him could not have been more different one was slender with a fetching smile in a greenandgold dress that showed a hint of what he judged to be a fine bosom except for that ageless face he might have thought to strike up a conversation it was a pretty face with eyes large enough for a man to sink into a pity the other had the agelessness too but seeing it took him a moment he thought she was scowling until he realized that must be her normal expression her dark almost black dress covered her to the wrists and chin for which he was grateful she looked scrawny as an old bramble she looked as if she ate brambles for breakfast iвђm trying to leave a message for nynaeve and elayne he told them this woman вђ he blinked looking down each of the corridors servants hurried by but laren was nowhere in sight he would not have thought she could move so fast anyway i want to leave a note suddenly cautious he added are you friends of theirs not exactly the pretty one said i am joline and this is teslyn and you are mat cauthon matвђs stomach tightened nine aes sedai in the palace and he had to walk into the two who followed elaida and one of them red not that he had anything to fear he lowered his hand to his side before it could touch the foxhead under his clothes the one who ate brambles вђ teslyn вђ stepped closer she was a sitter according to thom though what a sitter was doing here even thom did not understand we would be their friends if we could they do need friends master cauthon as do you her eyes tried to dig holes in his head joline moved to flank him laying a hand on his lapel he would have considered that smile inviting from another woman she was green ajah they are on dangerous ground and blind to what lies beneath their feet i know you are their friend you might show it by telling them to abandon this nonsense before it is too late foolish children who go too far can find themselves punished quite severely mat wanted to back away even teslyn stood close enough to be almost touching him instead he put on his most insolent grin it had always landed him in trouble back home but it seemed appropriate those dice in his head could have nothing to do with this pair or they would have stopped spinning and he did have the medallion they see pretty well iвђd say nynaeve badly needed to be snatched down a peg or six and elayne even more but he was not about to stand by and listen to this woman talk nynaeve down if that meant defending elayne too so be it maybe you should abandon your nonsense jolineвђs smile vanished but teslyn replaced it with one of her own a razored smile we do know about you master cauthon she looked a woman who wanted to skin something and whoever was handy would do taвђveren it do be said with dangerous associations of your own that do be more than hearsay jolineвђs face was ice a young man in your position who wished to be assured of his future could do much worse than seek the protection of the tower you should never have left it his stomach clenched tighter what else did they know surely not about the medallion nynaeve and elayne knew and adeleas and vandene and the light only knew who they had told but surely not this pair there was worse than taвђverenor the foxhead though or even rand as far as he was concerned if they knew about the bloody horn abruptly he was yanked away from them so hard that he stumbled and nearly dropped his hat a slender woman with a smooth face and nearly white hair gathered at the back of her neck had him by sleeve and lapel reflexively teslyn seized him the same way on the other side he recognized the straightbacked newcomer in her plain gray dress in a way she was either adeleas or vandene two sisters вђ real sisters not just aes sedai вђ who might as well have been twins he never could tell them apart for certain she and teslyn stared at one another chill and serene two cats with a paw on the same mouse no need to tear my coat off he growled trying to shrug free my coat he was not sure they heard even wearing the foxhead he was not prepared to go as far as prying their fingers free вђ unless he had to two other aes sedai accompanied whichever sister it was though one a dark stocky woman with inquisitive eyes was marked by no more than the great serpent ring and the brownfringed shawl she wore displaying the white flame of tar valon among vines on her back she appeared to be just a little older than nynaeve which made her sareitha tomares only two years or so aes sedai do you stoop to kidnapping men in the halls now teslyn the other said a man who cannot channel can hardly be of interest to you short and pale in lacetrimmed gray slashed with blue she was all cool ageless elegance and confident smile a cairhienin accent identified her he had certainly attracted the top dogs in the yard thom had not been sure whether joline or teslyn was in charge of elaidaвђs embassy but merilille led the one from those idiots who had tricked egwene into becoming their amyrlin mat could have shaved with teslynвђs return smile do no dissemble with me merilille mat cauthon do be of considerable interest he should no be running loose as if he was not standing there listening donвђt fight over me he said tugging his coat was not making anyone let go thereвђs enough to go around five sets of eyes made him wish he had kept his mouth shut aes sedai had no sense of humor he pulled a little harder and vandene вђ or adeleas вђ jerked back hard enough to pull the coat out of his hand vandene he decided she was green and he had always thought she wanted to turn him upside down and shake the secret of the medallion out of him whichever she was she smiled part knowing part amused he saw nothing funny the others did not look at him long he might as well have vanished what he needs joline said firmly is to be taken into custody for his own protection and more three taвђverencoming out of a single village and one of them the dragon reborn master cauthon should be sent to the white tower immediately and he had thought her pretty merilille only shook her head you overestimate your situation here joline if you think i will simply allow you to take the boy you overestimate yours merilille joline stepped closer until she was looking down at the other woman her lips curved superior and condescending or do you understand that itвђs only a wish not to offend tylin that keeps us from confining all of you on bread and water until you can be returned to the tower mat expected merilille to laugh in her face but she shifted her head slightly as if she really wanted to break away from jolineвђs gaze you would not dare sareitha wore aes sedai tranquillity like a mask face smooth and hands calmly adjusting her shawl but her breathy voice shouted that it was a mask these are childrenвђs games joline vandene murmured dryly surely that was who she was she was the only one of the three who really did appear unruffled faint splashes of color blossomed on merililleвђs cheeks as if the whitehaired woman had spoken to her but her own gaze steadied you can hardly expect us to go meekly she told joline firmly and there are five of us seven counting nynaeve and elayne the last was a clear afterthought and reluctant at that joline arched an eyebrow teslynвђs bony fingers did not loosen their grip any more than vandeneвђs but she studied joline and merilille with an unreadable expression aes sedai were a country of strangers where you never knew what to expect until it was too late there were deep currents here deep currents around aes sedai could snatch a man to his death without them so much as noticing maybe it was time to start prying at fingers larenвђs sudden reappearance saved him the effort struggling to control her breath as if she had been running the plump woman spread her skirts in a curtsy markedly deeper than she had given him forgiveness for disturbing you aes sedai but the queen summons lord cauthon forgiveness please itвђs more than my ears are worth if i donвђt bring him straight away the aes sedai looked at her all of them till she began to fidget then the two groups stared at one another as if trying to see who could outaes sedai who and then they looked at him he wondered whether anybody was going to move i canвђt keep the queen waiting now can i he said cheerily from the sniffs you would have thought he had pinched somebodyвђs bottom even larenвђs brows drew down in disapproval release him adeleas merilille said finally he frowned as the whitehaired woman complied those two ought to wear little signs with their names or differentcolor hair ribbons or something she gave him another of those amused knowing smiles he hated that it was a womanвђs trick not just aes sedai and they usually did not know anything at all like what they wanted you to believe teslyn he said the grim red still had hold of his coat with both hands she peered up at him ignoring everyone else the queen merilille opened her mouth and hesitated obviously changing what she had been going to say how long do you intend to stand here holding him teslyn perhaps you will explain to tylin why her summons is disregarded consider well who you do tie yourself to master cauthon teslyn said still looking only at him wrong choices can lead to an unpleasant future even for a taвђveren consider well then she let go as he followed laren he did not allow himself to show his eagerness to be away but he did wish the woman would walk a little faster she glided along ahead of him regal as any queen regal as any aes sedai when they reached the first turning he looked over his shoulder the five aes sedai were still standing there staring after him as if his look had been a signal they exchanged silent glances and went each in a different direction adeleas came toward him but a dozen steps before reaching him she smiled at him again and disappeared through a doorway deep currents he preferred swimming where his feet could touch the bottom of the pond laren was waiting around the corner hands on broad hips and her face much too smooth beneath her skirts he suspected her foot was tapping impatiently he gave her his most winning smile giggling girls or grayhaired grandmothers women softened for that one it had won him kisses and eased him out of predicaments more often than he could count it was almost as good as flowers that was neatly done and i thank you iвђm sure the queen doesnвђt really want to see me if she did he did not want to see her everything he thought about nobles was tripled for royalty nothing he had found in those old memories changed that and some of those fellows had spent considerable time around kings and queens and the like now if you will just show me where nynaeve and elayne stay strangely the smile did not seem to have any effect i would not lie lord cauthon it would be more than my ears are worth the queen is waiting my lord you are a very brave man she added turning then said something more under her breath or a very great fool he doubted he had been supposed to hear that a choice between going to see the queen and wandering miles of corridor until he stumbled on somebody who would tell him what he wanted to know he went to see the queen tylin quintara by the grace of the light queen of altara mistress of the four winds guardian of the sea of storms high seat of house mitsobar awaited him in a room with yellow walls and a pale blue ceiling standing before a huge white fireplace with a stone lintel carved into a stormy sea she was well worth seeing he decided tylin was not young вђ the shiny black hair cascading over her shoulders had gray at the temples and faint lines webbed the corners of her eyes вђ nor was she exactly pretty though the two thin scars on her cheeks had nearly vanished with age handsome came closer but she was imposing large dark eyes regarded him majestically an eagleвђs eyes she had little real power вђ a man could ride beyond her writ in two or three days and still have a lot of altara ahead вђ but he thought she might make even an aes sedai step back like isebele of dal calain who had made the amyrlin anghara come to her that was one of the old memories dal calain had vanished in the trolloc wars majesty he said sweeping his hat wide in a bow and flourishing an imaginary cloak by your summons do i come imposing or not it was hard to keep his eyes away from the not small lacetrimmed oval where her whitesheathed marriageknife hung a very nicely rounded sight indeed yet the more bosom a woman displayed the less she wanted you to look openly at least whitesheathed but he already knew she was a widow not that it mattered he would as soon tangle himself with that foxfaced darkfriend as with a queen not looking at all was difficult but he managed most likely she would call guards rather than draw the gemencrusted dagger thrust behind a wovengold belt to match the collar her marriage knife hung from maybe that was why the dice were still rolling in his head the possibility of an encounter with the headsman would set them spinning if anything did layered silk petticoats rippled white and yellow as she crossed the room and walked slowly all the way around him you speak the old tongue she said once she stood in front of him again her voice was lowpitched and musical without waiting for a reply she glided to a chair and sat adjusting her green skirts an unconscious gesture her gaze remained fixed on him he thought she could probably tell when his smallclothes had been washed last you wish to leave a message i have what is necessary a lace fall at her wrist swayed as she gestured to a small writing table standing beneath a giltframed mirror all the furnishings were gilded and carved like bamboo tall triplearched windows opening onto a wroughtiron balcony admitted a sea breeze that was surprisingly pleasant if not exactly cool yet mat felt hotter than in the street and it had nothing to do with her stare deyeniye dyu ninte concion caвђlyet ye that was what he had said the bloody old tongue popping out of his mouth again without him knowing it he had thought he had that little bother under control no telling when those bloody dice would stop or for what best to keep his eyes to himself and his mouth shut as much as possible i thank you majesty he made very sure of those words thick sheets of pale paper already waited on the slanted table at a comfortable height for writing he propped his hat against the table leg he could see her in the mirror watching why had he let his tongue run loose dipping a golden pen вђ what else would a queen have вђ he composed what he wanted to write in his head before bending over the paper with an arm curled around it his hand was awkward and square he had no love of writing i followed a darkfriend to the palace jaichim carridin is renting she tried to kill me once and maybe rand as well she was greeted like an old friend of the house for a moment he studied that biting the end of the pen before realizing he was scoring the soft gold maybe tylin would not notice they needed to know about carridin what else he added a few more reasonably worded lines the last thing he wanted was to put their backs up be sensible if you have to go traipsing around let me send a few men along to keep you from having your heads split open anyway isnвђt it about time i took you back to egwene thereвђs nothing here but heat and flies and we can find plenty of those in caemlyn there they could not ask for pleasanter than that blotting the page carefully he folded it four times sand in a small golden bowl covered a coal he puffed on it till it glowed then used it to light a candle and picked up the stick of red wax as the sealing wax dripped onto the edges of the paper it suddenly struck him that he had a signet ring in his pocket just something the ringmaker had carved to show his skill but better than a plain lump the ring was slightly longer than the pool of solidifying wax yet most of the sigil took for the first time he got a good look at what he had bought inside a border of large crescents a running fox seemed to have startled two birds into flight that made him grin too bad it was not a hand for the band but appropriate enough he certainly needed to be crafty as a fox to keep up with nynaeve and elayne and if they were not exactly flighty well besides the medallion had made him fond of foxes he scrawled nynaeveвђs name on the outside and then elayneвђs as an afterthought one or the other they should see it soon turning with the sealed letter held in front of him he gave a start as his knuckles brushed against tylinвђs bosom he stumbled back against the writing table staring and trying not to turn red staring at her face just her face he had not heard her approach best to simply ignore the brushing not embarrass her any further she probably thought he was a clumsy lout as it was there is something in this you should know majesty insufficient room remained between them to lift the letter jaichim carridin is entertaining darkfriends and i donвђt mean arresting them you are certain of course you are no one would make that charge without being certain a furrow creased her forehead but she gave her head a shake and the frown disappeared let us speak of more pleasant things he could have yelped he told her the whitecloak ambassador to her court was a darkfriend and all she did was grimace you are lord mat cauthon there was just a hint of question in the title her eyes minded him more than ever of an eagleвђs a queen could not like someone coming to her pretending to be a lord just mat cauthon something told him she would hear a lie besides letting people think he was a lord was just a ruse one he would rather have managed without in ebou dar you could find a duel any time you turned around but few challenged lords except other lords as it was in the last month he had cracked a number of heads bloodied four men and run half a mile to escape a woman tylinвђs stare made him nervous and those dice still rattled about in his skull he wanted out of there if youвђll tell me where to leave the letter majesty the daughterheir and nynaeve sedai seldom mention you she said but one learns to hear what is not said casually she reached up and touched his cheek he halfraised his own hand uncertainly had he smeared ink there chewing the pen women did like to tidy things including men maybe queens did too what they do not say but i hear is that you are an untamed rogue a gambler and chaser after women her eyes held his expression never altering a hair and her voice stayed firm and cool but as she spoke her fingers stroked his other cheek untamed men are often the most interesting to talk to a finger outlined his lips an untamed rogue who travels with aes sedai a taвђverenwho i think makes them a little afraid uneasy at the least it takes a man with a strong liver to make aes sedai uneasy how will you bend the pattern in ebou dar just mat cauthon her hand settled against his neck he could feel his pulse throbbing against her fingers his mouth fell open the writing table behind his back rattled against the wall as he tried to back away the only way out was to push her aside or climb over her skirts women did not behave this way oh some of those old memories suggested they did but it was mainly memories of memories that that woman had done this or this woman had done that the things he recalled clearly were battles for the most part and no help here at all she smiled a faint curl of her lips that did not lessen the predatory gleam in her eyes the hair on his head tried to stand up her eyes flickered over his shoulder to the mirror and she turned abruptly leaving him gaping at her back as she moved away i must arrange to speak with you again master cauthon i вђ she cut off as the door swung all the way open apparently surprised but then he realized she had seen it begin moving in the mirror a slender young man entered limping slightly a dark lad with sharp eyes that flicked by mat with barely a pause black hair hung to his shoulders and he wore one of those coats that was never meant to be worn normally draped across his shoulders green silk with a gold chain across his chest and gold leopards worked on the lapels mother he said bowing to tylin and touching his lips with his fingers beslan she filled the name with warmth and kissed him on both cheeks and his eyelids the firm even icy tone she had used with mat might as well have never been it went well i see not as well as it might the boy sighed despite his eyes he had a mild manner to him and a soft voice nevin nicked my leg on the second pass then slipped on the third so i ran him through the heart instead of his swordarm the offense was not worth killing and now i must pay condolences to his widow he seemed to regret that as much as this nevinвђs death tylinвђs beaming face hardly seemed right on a woman whose son had just told her he had killed a man just be sure your visit is brief stab my eyes but davindra will be one of those widows who wants comforting and then you will either have to marry her or kill her brothers by her tone the first alternative was much the worse the second merely a nuisance this is master mat cauthon my son he is taвђveren i hope you will make a friend of him perhaps you two will go to the swovan night dances together mat jumped the last thing he wanted was to go anywhere with a fellow who fought duels and whose mother wanted to stroke mat cauthonвђs cheek i am not much for balls he said quickly ebou dari liked festivals beyond reason here high chasaline was just past and they had five more in the next week two allday affairs not just the simpler evening feasts i do my dancing in taverns the rougher sort iвђm afraid nothing youвђd like i favor taverns of the rougher sort beslan said with a smile in that soft voice the balls are for older people and their pretties after that it was all downhill on crumpling shingle before mat knew what was happening tylin had him sewed up in a sack he and beslan would be attending the festivals together all of the festivals hunting beslan called it and when mat said hunting for girls without thinking вђ he would never have said that in front of somebodyвђs mother had he thought вђ the boy laughed and said a girl or a fight pouting lips or a flashing blade whichever dance youвђre dancing at the moment is always the most fun wouldnвђt you say so mat tylin smiled at beslan fondly mat managed a weak laugh this beslan was mad him and his mother both chapter female silhouettes the triumph of logic mat stalked out of the palace when tylin finally let him go and had he thought it would do any good he would have run the skin between his shoulder blades prickled so he almost forgot the dice dancing in his head the worst moment вђ the very worst of a dozen bad вђ had been when beslan teased his mother saying she should find herself a pretty for the balls and tylin laughingly claimed a queen had no time for young men all the while looking at mat with those bloody eagleвђs eyes now he knew why rabbits ran so fast he stumped across mol hara square not seeing anything had nynaeve and elayne been cavorting with jaichim carridin and elaida in the fountain beneath that statue of some longdead queen two spans or more tall and pointing to the sea he would have passed by without a second look the common room of the wandering woman was dim and comparatively cool after the bright heat outside he took off his hat gratefully a faint haze of pipesmoke hung in the air but the arabesquecarved shutters across the wide arched windows let in more than enough light some bedraggled pine branches had been tied above the windows for swovan night in one corner two women with flutes and a fellow with a small drum between his knees provided a shrill pulsing sort of music that mat had come to like even at this time of the day there were a few patrons outland merchants in moderately plain woolens with a sprinkling of ebou dari most in the vests of various guilds no apprentices or even journeymen here so close to the palace the wandering woman was hardly an inexpensive place to drink or eat much less sleep the rattle of dice at a table in the corner echoed the feel in his head but he turned the other way to where three of his men sat on benches around another table corevin a thickly muscled cairhienin with a nose that made his eyes seem even smaller than they were sat stripped to the waist holding his tattooed arms over his head while vanin wound strips of bandage around his middle vanin was three times corevinвђs size but he looked like a balding sack of suet overflowing his bench his coat appeared to have been slept in for a week it always did even an hour after one of the serving women ironed it some of the merchants eyed the three uneasily but none of the ebou dari men or women they had seen the same or worse often harnan a lanternjawed tairen file leader with a crude tattoo of a hawk on his left cheek was berating corevin donвђt care what the flaming fishseller said you goatspawned toad you use your bloody club and donвђt go accepting flaming challenges just because вђ he cut off when he saw mat and tried to look as if he had not been saying what he had he just looked as if he had a toothache if mat asked it would turn out corevin had slipped and fallen on his own dagger or some such foolery mat was supposed to pretend to believe so he just leaned his fists on the table as if he saw nothing out of the ordinary truth to tell it was not that out of the ordinary vanin was the only man who had not been in two dozen scrapes already for some reason men looking for trouble walked as wide of vanin as they did nalesean the only difference was that vanin seemed to like it that way has thom or juilin been here yet vanin did not look up from tying the bandages havenвђt seen hide hair nor toenail nalesean was in for a bit though there was no my lord nonsense from vanin he made no bones about not liking nobles with the unfortunate exception of elayne left an ironstrapped chest up in your room and went out babbling about trinkets he made as if to spit through the gap in his teeth then glanced at one of the serving women and did not mistress anan was death on anybody spitting on her floors or tossing bones or even tapping out a pipe the boyвђs out back in the stable he went on before mat could ask with his book and one of the innkeeperвђs daughters another of the girls spanked his bottom for pinching hers finishing the last knot he gave mat an accusatory look as if it had been his fault in some way poor little mite corevin muttered twisting to see whether the bandages would stay in place he had a leopard and a boar inked on one arm a lion and a woman on the other the woman did not seem to be wearing much except her hair sniveling he was though he did brighten when leral let him hold her hand the men all looked after olver like a gaggle of uncles though certainly the sort no mother would want near her son heвђll live mat said dryly the boy was probably picking up these habits from his uncles next they would give him a tattoo at least olver had not sneaked out to run with the street children he seemed to enjoy that almost as much as he did making himself a nuisance to grown women harnan you wait here and if you see thom or juilin collar them vanin i want you to see what you can learn around the chelsaine palace over near the three towers gate hesitating he looked over the room serving women drifted in and out of the kitchens with food and more often drink most of the patrons seemed intent on their silver cups though a pair of women in weaverвђs vests argued quietly ignoring their wine punch and leaning across the table at one another some of the merchants appeared to be haggling waving hands and dipping fingers in their drinks to scribble numbers on the table the music should mask his words from eavesdroppers but he lowered his voice anyway news that jaichim carridin had darkfriends coming to call screwed vaninвђs round face into a scowl as if he might spit no matter who saw harnan muttered something about filthy whitecloaks and corevin suggested denouncing carridin to the civil guard that got such disgusted looks from the other two that he buried his face in a cup of ale he was one of the few men mat knew who could drink ebou dari ale in this heat or drink it at all for that matter be careful mat warned when vanin stood it was not that he was worried really vanin moved ith surprising lightness for such a fat man he was the best horsethief in two countries at the least and could slip by even a warder unseen but theyвђre a nasty lot whitecloaks or darkfriends either one the man only grunted and motioned for corevin to gather his shirt and coat and come along my lord harnan said as they left my lord i heard there was a fog in the rahad yesterday on the point of turning away mat stopped harnan looked worried and nothing much worried him what do you mean a fog in this heat fog thick as porridge would not last a heartbeat the file leader shrugged uncomfortably and peered into his mug a fog i heard there was things in it he looked up at mat i heard people just disappeared and some was found eaten parts of them mat managed not to shiver the fogвђs gone isnвђt it you werenвђt in it worry when you are thatвђs all you can do harnan frowned doubtfully but that was the pure truth these bubbles of evil вђ that was what rand called them what moiraine had вђ burst where and when they chose and there did not seem to be anything even rand could do to stop them worrying about it did as much good as worrying whether a roof tile would fall on your head in the street tomorrow less since you could decide to stay indoors there was something that was worth worrying over though nalesean had left their winnings sitting upstairs bloody nobles tossed gold around like water leaving harnan studying his mug mat headed for the railless stairs at the back of the room but before he reached them one of the serving women accosted him caira was a slender fulllipped girl with smoky eyes a man came in looking for you my lord she said twisting her skirts from side to side and looking up at him through long lashes there was a certain smokiness in her voice too said he was an illuminator but he looked seedy to me he ordered a meal and left when mistress anan wouldnвђt give it he wanted you to pay next time pigeon give the meal he told her slipping a silver mark into the plunging neck of her dress ill speak to mistress anan he did want to find an illuminator вђ a real one not some fellow selling fireworks full of sawdust вђ but it hardly mattered now not with the gold lying unguarded and fogs in the rahad and darkfriends and aes sedai and bloody tylin taking leave of her senses and caira giggled and twisted like a stroked cat would you like me to bring some punch to your room my lord or anything she smiled hopefully invitingly maybe later he said tapping her nose with a fingertip she giggled again she always did caira would have her skirt sewn to show petticoats to the middle of her thigh or higher had mistress anan allowed it but the innkeeper looked after her serving women almost as closely as she did her daughters almost maybe later trotting up the wide stone stairs he put caira out of his mind what was he to do about olver the boy would find himself in real trouble one day if he thought he could treat women that way he was going to have to keep him away from harnan and the others as much as possible he supposed they were a bad influence on a boy to have this on top of everything else he had to get nynaeve and elayne out of ebou dar before something worse went wrong his room was at the front with windows overlooking the square and as he reached for the door the hallway floor behind him squeaked in a hundred inns it would not even have registered but the floors in the wandering woman did not squeak he looked back вђ and spun just in time to drop his hat and catch the descending truncheon with his left hand instead of his skull the blow stung his hand to numbness but he held on desperately as thick fingers dug into his throat forcing him back against the door to his room his head hit with a thump silverrimmed black spots danced in his vision obscuring a sweating face all he could really see was a big nose and yellow teeth and those seemed hazy suddenly he realized he was on the far edge of consciousness those fingers were closing off blood to his brain along with air his free hand went beneath his coat fumbling over the hilts of his knives as though his fingers no longer remembered what they were for the cudgel wrenched free he could see it rising feel it rising to smash his skull focusing everything he jerked a knife from its scabbard and thrust his attacker let out a highpitched scream and mat was vaguely aware of the club bouncing off his shoulder as it fell to the floor but the man did not let go of his throat stumbling mat drove him back tearing at the clutching fingers with one hand driving his knife repeatedly with the other abruptly the fellow fell sliding from matвђs blade the knife nearly followed him to the floor so did mat gulping breath sweet air he clung to something a doorway to hold himself on his feet from the floor a plainfaced man stared up at him with eyes that would never see anything again a heavyset fellow with curled murandian mustaches in a dark blue coat fit for a small merchant or a prosperous shopkeeper not the look of a thief about him at all abruptly he realized they had stumbled through an open door in their fight it was a smaller room than matвђs windowless a pair of oil lamps on small tables beside the narrow bed providing a murky illumination a lanky palehaired man straightened from a large open chest staring oddly at the corpse the chest took up most of the free space in the room mat opened his mouth to apologize for intruding so roughly and the lanky man snatched a long dagger from his belt a cudgel from the bed and leaped over the chest at him that had not been the look you gave a dead stranger clinging unsteadily to the doorframe mat threw underhanded the hilt no sooner leaving his hand than he was scrabbling under his coat for another his knife stuck squarely in the other manвђs throat and mat almost fell again this time from relief as the man clutched himself blood spurting between his fingers and toppled backward into the open chest itвђs good to be lucky mat croaked staggering he retrieved his knife wiping it clean on the fellowвђs gray coat a better coat than the other still wool but of a better cut a lesser lord would not have been ashamed to wear it andoran by the collar he sank onto the bed frowning at the man sprawled in the chest a noise made him look up his manservant was in the doorway trying unsuccessfully to hide a large black iron frying pan behind his back nerim kept a full set of pots and everything else he thought a lordвђs servant might need traveling in the small room he shared with olver next to matвђs he was short even for a cairhienin and skinny to boot my lord has blood on his coat again i fear he murmured in melancholy tones the day he sounded anything else the sun would rise in the west i do wish my lord would be more careful of his clothes it is so hard to remove blood without a stain and the insects hardly need any encouragement to eat holes this place has more insects than i have ever seen my lord no mention at all of two dead men or what he had intended with the frying pan that scream had drawn other attention the wandering woman was not the sort of inn where screams passed unremarked feet pounded in the hallway and mistress anan pushed nerim firmly out of her way and raised her skirts to step around the corpse on the floor her husband followed her in a squarefaced grayhaired man with the double earring of the ancient and honorable league of the nets dangling from his left ear the two white stones on the lower hoop said he owned other boats beside the one he captained jasfer anan was part of the reason mat was careful not to smile too much at any of mistress ananвђs daughters the man wore a work knife stuffed behind his belt and a longer curved blade too and his long blueandgreen vest revealed arms and chest crisscrossed with dueling scars he was alive though and most of the men who had given those scars were not the other reason for caution was setalle anan herself mat had never before let himself be turned off a girl because of her mother even if that mother owned the inn where he was staying but mistress anan had a way about her large gold hoops in her ears swung as she surveyed the dead men without a flinch she was pretty despite a touch of gray in her hair and her marriage knife nestled in roundness that normally would have drawn his eyes like moths to a candle yet looking at her that way would have been like looking at not his mother at an aes sedai maybe вђ though he had done that of course just to look вђ or at queen tylin the light help him there putting a finger on why was not easy she simply had a way about her it was just difficult to think of doing anything that would offend setalle anan one of them jumped me in the hall mat kicked the chest lightly it made a hollow sound despite the dead man slumped inside with his arms and legs dangling out this is empty except for him i think they meant to fill it with whatever they could steal the gold perhaps not likely they could have heard of that won only hours ago but he would ask mistress anan about a safer place to keep it she nodded calmly hazel eyes serene men knifed in her inn did not ruffle her feathers they insisted on carrying it up themselves their stock so they claimed they took the room just before you came in for a few hours they said to sleep before traveling on toward nor chasen that was a small village on the coast to the east but it was unlikely they would have told the truth her tone implied as much she frowned at the dead men as though wishing she could shake them alive to answer questions they were picky about the room though the palehaired man was in charge he turned down the first three he was offered then accepted this that was meant for a single servant i thought he was being stingy with a coin even a thief can be tightfisted mat said absently this could have qualified to start those dice rolling in his head вђ a head that would have been cracked open for sure without the luck of that fellow stepping on the one board in the whole inn that would squeak вђ but the bloody things were still tumbling he did not like it you think it was chance then my lord what else she had no answer but she frowned at the corpses again maybe she was not so sanguine as he had thought she was not native to ebou dar after all too many roughs in the city of late jasfer had a deep voice and speaking normally he seemed to be barking commands on a fishing boat maybe you ought to think on hiring guards all mistress anan did was lift an eyebrow at her husband but his hands rose defensively peace be on you wife i spoke without thinking ebou dari women were known to express displeasure with a husband in a sharp fashion it was not beyond possibility that a few of his scars came from her the marriage knife had several uses thanking the light he was not married to an ebou dari mat replaced his own knife in its sheath alongside the others thank the light he was not married at all his fingers brushed paper mistress anan was not letting her husband off easily you frequently do husband she said fingering the hilt between her breasts many women would not let it pass elynde always tells me i am not firm enough when you speak out of line i need to provide a good example for my daughters acerbity melted into a smile if a small one consider yourself chastised i will refrain from telling you who should haul which net on which boat you are too kind to me wife he replied dryly there was no guild for innkeepers in ebou dar but every inn in the city was in the hands of a woman to ebou dari bad luck of the worst sort would dog any inn owned by a man or any vessel owned by a woman there were no women in the fishermenвђs guild mat pulled out the paper it was snowy white expensive and stiff and folded small the few lines on it were printed in square letters like those olver might use or an adult who did not want the hand recognized elayne and nynaeve are pushing too far remind them they are still in danger from the tower warn them to be careful or they will be kneeling to ask elaidaвђs pardon yet that was all no signature stillin danger that suggested it was nothing new and somehow it did not fit with them being snared up by the rebels no that was the wrong question who had slipped him this note obviously somebody who thought they could not simply hand it to him who had had the opportunity since he put the coat on this morning it had not been there then for sure somebody who had gotten close somebody unbidden he found himself humming a snatch of she dazzles my eyes and clouds my mind around here the tune had different words they called it upside down and вђround and вђround only teslyn or joline fit and that was impossible bad news my lord mistress anan asked mat stuffed the note into his pocket does any man ever get to understand women i donвђt mean just aes sedai any women jasfer roared and when his wife directed a meaning gaze his way he only laughed harder the look she gave mat would have shamed an aes sedai for its perfect serenity men have it quite easy my lord if they only looked or listened women have the difficult task we must try to understand men jasfer took hold of the doorframe tears rolling down his dark face she eyed him sideways tilting her head then turned all cool calmness вђ and punched him under the ribs with her fist so hard that his knees buckled his laughter took on a wheeze without stopping there is a saying in ebou dar my lord she said to mat over her shoulder вђa man is a maze of brambles in darkness and even he does not know the wayвђ mat snorted fat lot of help she was well teslyn or joline or somebody else вђ it must have been somebody else if he could only think who вђ the white tower was a long way away jaichim carridin was right here he frowned at the two corpses and so were a hundred other scoundrels somehow he would see those two women safely out of ebou dar the trouble was he did not have a clue how he wished those bloody dice would stop and be done with it the apartments joline shared with teslyn were quite spacious including a bedchamber for each of them plus one apiece for their maids and another that would have done quite well for blaeric and fen if teslyn could have stood to have her warders with them the woman saw every man as a potentially rabid wolf and there was no gainsaying her when she truly wanted something as inexorable as elaida she ground down whatever lay in her path they stood as equals in every real way certainly but not many managed to prevail over teslyn without a clear advantage she was at the writing table in the sitting room when joline entered her pen making an awful scritchscritch she was always parsimonious with the ink without a word joline swept by her and out onto the balcony a long cage of whitepainted iron the scrollwork was so tight that the men working in the garden three stories below would have a difficult time seeing that there was anyone within flowers in this region ordinarily thrived in heat wild colors to outshine the interior of the palace but nothing bloomed down there gardeners moved along the gravel walks with buckets of water yet nearly every leaf was yellow or brown she would not have admitted it under torture but the heat made her afraid the dark one was touching the world and their only hope a boy who was running wild bread and water teslyn said suddenly send the cauthon boy off to the tower if there do be changes in what we did plan you will please inform me before telling others joline felt a touch of heat in her cheeks merilille needed to be set down she lectured when i was a novice so had teslyn a severe teacher who held her classes with an iron grip just the way she spoke was a reminder a marked warning not to go against her equal or not merilille though stood lower she used to make us stand in front of the class and she would dig and dig for the answer she wanted until we stood there in front of every one weeping with frustration she pretended to sympathize or perhaps she really did but the more she patted us and told us not to cry the worse it was she cut off abruptly she had not intended to say all that it was teslynвђs fault always looking at her as if she were about to be upbraided for a spot on her dress but she should understand merilille had taught her too you have remembered that all this time stark incredulity painted teslynвђs voice the sisters who did teach us did only do their duty sometimes i do think what elaida did say of you do be right the annoying scritchscritchresumed it simply came to mind when merilille began as if she were truly an ambassador instead of a rebel joline frowned at the garden she despised every one of those women who had broken the white tower and flaunted the break before all the world them and anyone who aided them but elaida had blundered too horribly the sisters who were rebels now could have been reconciled with a little effort what did she say of me teslyn the sound of the pen continued like fingernails scraping across a slate joline went back inside what did elaida say teslyn laid another sheet atop her letter either to blot or to shield it from jolineвђs eyes but she did not answer immediately she scowled at joline вђ or perhaps just looked it was difficult to say with her at times вђ and at last sighed very well if you must know she did say you still do be a child a child jolineвђs shock had no effect on the other woman some teslyn said calmly do change little from the day they do put on novice white some do change no at all elaida does believe you have no grown up yet and never will joline tossed her head angrily unwilling to let herself speak to have that said by someone whose motherhad been a child when she herself gained the shawl elaida had been petted too much as a novice made over too much for her strength and the remarkable speed of her learning joline suspected that was why she was in such a fury about elayne and egwene and the wilder nynaeve because they were stronger than she because they had spent far less time as novices no matter that they had been pushed ahead too fast why nynaeve had never been a novice at all and that was completely unheard of since you did bring it up teslyn went on perhaps we should try to take advantage of the situation what do you mean embracing the true source joline channeled air to lift the silver pitcher on the turquoiseinlaid side table and fill a silver goblet with punch as always the joy of embracing saidarthrilled her soothing even as it exhilarated it do be obvious i should think elaidaвђs orders do still stand elayne and nynaeve are to be returned to the tower as soon as found i did agree to wait but perhaps we should wait no longer a pity the alвђvere girl does no be with them but two will put us back in elaidaвђs good graces and if we can add the cauthon boy i do think those three will make her welcome us as if we did come with alвђthor himself and this aviendha will make a fine novice wilder or no the goblet floated into jolineвђs hand on air and she reluctantly released the power she had never lost the ardor she felt the first time she touched the source dewmelon punch was a poor substitute for saidar the worst part of her penance before leaving the tower had been losing the right to touch saidar almost the worst part she had set it all herself but elaida had made it clear that if she did not make it harsh elaida would she had no doubt the result would have been much worse then her good graces teslyn she humiliated us for no more reason than to show the others that she could she sent us to this flyridden hole as far from everything important as she could short of the other side of the aryth ocean ambassadors to a queen with less power than a dozen of her own nobles any one of whom could snatch the throne from her tomorrow if they could be bothered to and you want to wheedle your way back into elaidaвђs favor she do be the amyrlin seat teslyn touched the letter with the page lying atop it moving the sheets a bit this way then a bit that as if framing her thoughts remaining silent for a time did let her know we are no lapdogs but remaining silent too long could be seen as treason joline sniffed ridiculous when theyвђre returned theyвђll only be punished for running away and now for pretending to be full sisters her mouth tightened they were both guilty there and those who allowed them to as well but it made a sharp difference when one of them claimed her own ajah by the time the green ajah finished with elayne for that it would be a very chastened young woman indeed who took the throne of andor though it might be best if elayne secured the lion throne first her training had to be completed either way joline did not intend to see elayne lost to the tower whatever she had done do no forget joining with the rebels light teslyn they were probably scooped up just like the girls the rebels took out of the tower does it really matter a whit whether they begin mucking out stalls tomorrow or next year that was surely as much as the novices and accepted with the rebels would have to face even the ajahs can wait to have them in hand really it is not as if they arenвђt safe they are accepted after all and they certainly seem content to stay where we can reach them whenever we choose i say let us sit where elaida put us and continue to fold our hands and hold our tongues until she asks nicely to find out what we are doing she did not say that she was prepared to wait until elaida found herself deposed as siuan had been the hall surely would not put up with the bullying and bungling forever but teslyn was red after all and would not appreciate hearing that i suppose there do be no urgency teslyn said slowly the unspoken but all but shouting itself drawing a ballfooted chair to the table with another flow of air joline settled herself to convincing her companion that silence remained the best policy still a child was she if she had her way elaida would not get so much as a word out of ebou dar until she begged for it the woman on the table arched up as far as her bonds would allow eyes bulging throat corded with a piercing scream that went on and on abruptly the scream was a loud choking rasp instead and she convulsed shaking from wrists to ankles then collapsed in silence wideopen eyes stared sightlessly at the cobwebbed basement ceiling giving vent to curses was irrational but falion could have turned the air as blue as any stableman not for the first time she wished she had temaile here instead of ispan questions were answered eagerly for temaile and nobody died until she was ready of course temaile enjoyed the work entirely too much but that was beside the point channeling once more falion gathered the womanвђs clothes from the filthy floor and dropped them atop the body the red leather belt fell off and she snatched it up by hand and slapped it back onto the pile perhaps she should have used other methods but straps and pincers and hot irons were so messy leave the body in an alley somewhere slit the throat so it looks as if she was robbed you can keep the coins in her purse the two men squatting on their heels against the stone wall exchanged looks arnin and nad might have been brothers by their appearance all black hair and beady eyes and scars with more muscles than any three men could need but they did have sufficient brains to carry out simple orders usually forgiveness mistress arnin said hesitantly but no one will believe вђ do as you are told she snapped channeling to haul him to his feet and slam him back against the stones his head bounced yet that surely could do him no damage nad rushed to the table babbling yes mistress as you command mistress when she released arnin he did not babble but he staggered over without any more objections to help gather up the body like so much rubbish and carry it out well it was so much rubbish now she regretted the outburst letting temper take control was irrational it did seem to be effective at times though after all these years that still surprised her moghedien she will not like this ispan said as soon as the men had gone the blue and green beads that were worked into her many slim black braids clacked as she shook her head she had remained in the shadows the whole time in a corner with a small ward woven so she could not hear falion managed not to glare ispan was the last companion she would have chosen for herself she was blue or had been perhaps she still was falion did not really think herself any less white ajah because she had joined the black blues were too fervent tying emotion around what should be viewed with utter dispassion rianna another white would have been her choice though the woman did have odd unsound notions on several points of logic moghedien has forgotten us ispan or have you received some private word from her in any case i am convinced this cache does not exist moghedien she says that it does ispan began firmly but her voice quickly grew warm a store of angreal and saвђangreal and terвђangreal we will have some part of them angrealof our very own falion perhaps even saвђangreal she has promised moghedien was wrong falion watched shock widen the other womanвђs eyes the chosen were only people learning that lesson had stunned falion too but some refused to learn the chosen were vastly stronger infinitely more knowledgeable and quite possibly they had already received the reward of immortality but by all evidence they schemed and fought each other as hard as two murandians with one blanket ispanвђs shock quickly gave way to anger there are others looking would they all look for nothing there are friends of the dark looking they must have been sent by others of the chosen if the chosen look can you still say there is nothing she would not see if a thing could not be found the most obvious reason was that it was not there falion waited ispan was not stupid only awestruck and falion did believe in making people teach themselves what they should already be aware of lazy minds needed to be exercised ispan paced swishing her skirts and frowning at the dust and old cobwebs this place smells and it is filthy she shuddered as a large black cockroach went skittering up the wall the glow surrounded her for a moment a flow squashed the beetle with a popping sound making a face ispan wiped her hands on her skirts as if she had used them instead of the power she had a delicate stomach though fortunately not when she could remove herself from the actual deed i will not report the failure to one of the chosen falion she would make us envy liandrin yes falion did not quite shiver she did however cross the basement and pour herself a cup of plum punch the plums had been old and the punch was too sweet but her hands remained steady fear of moghedien was perfectly sensible but yielding to fear was not perhaps the woman was dead surely she would have summoned them by now else or snatched them sleeping into telвђaranвђrhiodagain to tell her why they had not yet carried out her commands until she saw a body though the only logical choice was to continue as if moghedien would appear any moment there is a way how put every wise woman in ebou dar to the question how many are there a hundred two hundred perhaps the sisters in the tarasin palace they would notice this i think forget your dreams of owning a saвђangreal ispan there is no longhidden storehouse no secret basement beneath a palace falion spoke in cool measured tones perhaps more measured the more agitated ispan became she had always enjoyed mesmerizing a class of novices with the sound of her voice almost all of the wise women are wilders highly unlikely to know what we wish to learn no wilder has ever been found keeping an angreal much less a saвђangreal and they surely would have been found on the contrary by every record a wilder who discovers any object tied to the power rids herself of it as soon as possible for fear of attracting the wrath of the white tower women who are put out of the tower on the other hand seem not to have the same fear as you well know when they are searched before leaving fully one in three has secreted something about her person an actual object of the power or something she believes is one of the few wise women who qualify at present callie was the perfect choice when she was put out four years ago she tried to steal a small terвђangreal a useless thing that makes images of flowers and the sound of a waterfall but still an object tied to saidar and she tried to discover all the other novicesвђ secrets succeeding more often than not if there was even a single angrealin ebou dar not to speak of a vast storehouse do you think she could have been four years here without locating it i dowear the shawl falion ispan said with extraordinary asperity and i doknow all of that as well as you you said there was another way what way she simply would not apply her brain what would please moghedien as greatly as the cache ispan simply stared at her tapping her foot nynaeve alвђmeara ispan moghedien abandoned us to go chasing after her but obviously she escaped somehow if we give nynaeve вђ and the trakand girl for that matter вђ to moghedien she would forgive us a hundred saвђangreal which clearly demonstrated that the chosen could be irrational of course it was best of course to be extremely careful with those who were both irrational and more powerful than you ispan was not more powerful we should have killed her as i wanted when she first appeared she spat waving her hands she stalked up and down grime crunching loudly beneath her slippers yes yes i know our sisters in the palace they might have become suspicious we do not wish to draw their eyes but have you forgotten tanchico and tear where those two girls appear disaster follows me i think if we cannot kill them we should remain as far from nynaeve alвђmeara and elayne trakand as we can as far as we can calm yourself ispan calm yourself if anything falionвђs soothing tone only seemed to agitate the other woman more but falion was confident logic must prevail over emotion sitting on an upended barrel in the sparse coolness of a narrow shaded alley he studied the house across the busy street suddenly he realized he was touching his head again he did not have a headache but his head felt peculiar sometimes most often when he thought of what he could not remember three stories of white plaster the house belonged to a goldsmith who supposedly was being visited by two friends she had met on a journey north some years ago the friends had only been glimpsed on arrival and not seen since finding that out had been easy finding out they were aes sedai only a trifle more difficult a lean young man in a torn vest whistling his way down the street with no good on his mind paused when he glimpsed him sitting on the barrel his coat and his location in the shadows вђ and the rest of him he admitted ruefully вђ probably looked tempting he reached under his coat his hands no longer possessed the strength or flexibility for swordwork but the two long knives he had carried for well over thirty years had surprised more than one swordsman maybe something showed in his eyes because the lean young man thought better of it and whistled his way on beside the house the gate that led back to the goldsmithвђs stable swung open and two burly men appeared pushing a barrow piled high with soiled straw and muck what were they up to arnin and nad were hardly the lads to be mucking out stables he would stay here until dark he decided then see whether he could find carridinвђs pretty little killer again once again he pulled his hand down from his head sooner or later he would remember he did not have much time left but it was all he did have he remembered that much chapter dragon as the plow breaks the earth seizing saidinlong enough to unknot the ward he had woven across one corner of the anteroom rand raised his small silvermounted cup and said more tea lews therin muttered angrily in the back of his head carved chairs heavy with gilt stood in paired lines to either side of a golden rising sun two paces wide set into the polished stone floor and another tall chair so gilded it seemed entirely gold topped a small dais that was just as elaborate but he sat crosslegged on a carpet spread for the occasion green and gold and blue in a tairen maze the three clan chiefs seated across from him would have disliked him receiving them from a chair even if they were offered their own they were another maze to be trod warily he was in his shirt sleeves pushed up his forearms to expose the redandgold dragon that curled around each glittering metallically the aielmenвђs cadinвђsorcovered theirs on the left arm alone perhaps the reminder of who he was вђ that he too had been to rhuidean when the journey meant death for most men who entered вђ perhaps it was unnecessary perhaps those three faces gave away little as they watched merana come from the corner where she had been sealed off janwinвђs creased face could have been carved from old wood but it always looked that way and if his bluegray eyes seemed stormy so did they always too even his hair looked like storm clouds he was an eventempered man though indirian and oneeyed mandelain might have been thinking of something else except that their unblinking gazes followed her lews therin suddenly went silent as if he too watched through randвђs eyes meranaвђs ageless features revealed even less than the clan chiefsвђ smoothing her pale gray skirts under she knelt beside rand and lifted the teapot a massive ball of goldwashed silver with leopards for feet and handle and another crouched on the lid it required both of her hands and wavered a little as she carefully filled randвђs cup her manner seemed to say she did this because she wanted to for reasons of her own that none of them could begin to understand her manner shouted aes sedai louder than her face did was that to the good or the bad i do not allow them to channel without permission he said the clan chiefs kept silent merana rose and moved to kneel beside each in turn mandelain covered his cup with a broad hand to indicate he wanted no more the other two held out theirs bluegray eyes and green alike studying her what did they see what more could he do replacing the heavy teapot on the thick leopardhandled tray she remained on her knees may i serve my lord dragon in any way else her voice was selfpossession itself but after he motioned her back to her corner after she had risen and turned slim hands clutched at her skirts for an instant yet that might have been because turning brought her to face dashiva and narishma the two ashaвђman вђ to be precise narishma was still only a soldier the lowest level of ashaвђman with neither the sword nor the dragon on his collar вђ the ashaвђman stood impassively between two of the tall goldenframed mirrors that lined the walls at least the younger man looked impassive at first glance thumbs tucked behind his sword belt he ignored merana and paid little more attention to rand or the aielmen yet at a second glance you saw that his dark toobig eyes never rested as if he expected the unexpected to leap out of the air any moment and who could say it would not dashiva appeared to have his head in the clouds his lips moved soundlessly and he blinked and frowned at nothing lews therin snarled when rand looked at the ashaвђman but it was merana who occupied the dead man inside randвђs head only a fool thinks a lion or a woman can truly be tamed irritably rand suppressed the voice to a muted buzz lews therin could break through but not without effort grabbing hold of saidin he rewove the ward that shut merana away from their voices releasing the source again increased his irritation the hissing in his head the water drops on red coals an echo pulsing in time with lews therinвђs mad distant rage merana stood behind the barrier she could neither see nor feel head high and hands folded at her waist as if a shawl were looped over her arms aes sedai to her toenails she watched him and the clan chiefs with cool eyes light brown flecked with yellow my sisters do not all realize how very much we need you she had told him this morning in this very room but all of us who swore will do whatever you ask that would not violate the three oaths he had just wakened when she came with sorilea escorting her neither seemed to care at all that he was still in a robe with only one bite taken from his breakfast bread i have more than a little skill in negotiation and mediation my sisters have other skills let us serve you as we pledged let me serve you we need you but you have some need of us too ever present alanna lay nestled in a corner of his brain she was weeping again he could not understand why she wept so often he had forbidden her to come near him unless summoned or leave her room without an escort of maidens вђ the sisters who had sworn to him had been found rooms last night in the palace where he could keep an eye on them вђ but he had sensed tears from the moment she bonded him tears and a raw grief like being ripped by claws sometimes it was less sometimes more yet always there alanna also had told him he needed the sworn sisters screamed it at him finally with her face red and tears rolling down her cheeks before literally running from his presence and she had spoken of serving too though he doubted that meranaвђs present tasks were what either had in mind perhaps some sort of livery would make it clear the clan chiefs watched merana watch them not so much as the flicker of an eyelash betrayed their thoughts the wise ones have told you where the aes sedai stand rand said bluntly sorilea had told him they knew but the fact would have been clear from the lack of surprise when they first saw merana fetch and curtsy youвђve seen her bring the tray and pour your tea youвђve seen her come and go as i say if you want iвђll have her dance a jig convincing the aiel that he was not on the end of an aes sedai leash was the most needed service any of the sisters could do him right now he would have them all doing jigs if necessary mandelain adjusted the graygreen patch over his right eye the way he did when he wanted a moment to think a thick puckered scar ran up his forehead from behind the leather patch and halfway across his mostly bald head when he finally spoke it was only a little less blunt than rand some say an aes sedai will do anything to have what she wants indirian lowered heavy white eyebrows and peered down his long nose at his tea of only average height for an aielman he was shorter than rand by half a hand yet everything about him seemed long the heat of the waste appeared to have melted away every spare ounce of flesh and a few more besides his cheekbones stood out sharp and his eyes were emeralds set in caves i do not like speaking of aes sedai his deep rich voice was always a shock coming from that gaunt face what is done is done let the wise ones deal with them better to speak of the shaido dogs janwin said mildly which was almost as great a shock coming from his fierce face within a few months less than half a year at most every shaido who can be will be dead вђ or made gaiвђshain just because his voice was soft did not mean he was the other two nodded mandelain smiled eagerly they still seemed unconvinced the shaido had been the professed reason for this meeting and no less important for not being the most important not unimportant вђ the shaido had made trouble long enough вђ just not on the same page with the aes sedai in his book they did present problems though three clans joining timolanвђs miagoma already near kinslayerвђs dagger might well be able to do as janwin said but there were those who could not be made gaiвђshainand could not be killed some were more critical than others what of the wise ones he asked for a moment their faces became unreadable not even aes sedai could do that so well as aiel facing the one power did not frighten them not where it showed at least no one could outrun death so aiel believed and a hundred aes sedai in a rage could not make a lone aiel lower the veil once raised but learning that wise ones had taken part in the fighting at dumaiвђs wells had hit them like watching the sun rise by night and the moon by day in a bloodred sky sarinde tells me almost all of the wise ones will run with the algaiвђdвђsiswai indirian said at last reluctantly sarinde was the wise one who had followed him from red springs clan hold of the codarra or perhaps followed was not the right word wise ones seldom did in any case most of the codarra wise ones and the shiande and the daryne would go north with the spears the shaido wise ones will be dealt with by wise ones his mouth twisted with disgust all things change janwinвђs voice was even softer than usual he believed but he did not want to wise ones taking part in battle violated custom as old as the aiel mandelain set his cup down with exaggerated care corehuin wishes to see jair again before the dream ends and so do i like bael and rhuarc he had two wives the other chiefs had only one each except timolan but a widowed chief seldom remained so long the wise ones saw to that if he did not will any of us ever see the sun rise again in the threefold land i hope so rand said slowly as the plow breaks the earth shall he break the lives of men and all that was shall be consumed in the fire of his eyes the trumpets of war shall sound at his footsteps the ravens feed at his voice and he shall wear a crown of swords the prophecies of the dragon gave little hope for anything except victory over the dark one and only a chance of that the prophecy of rhuidean the aiel prophecy said he would destroy them the bleakness swept through the clans because of him and ancient customs were ripped apart even without the aes sedai small wonder if some chiefs pondered whether they were right to follow rand alвђthor dragons on his arms or no i hope so may you always find water and shade rand alвђthor indirian said after they left rand sat frowning into his cup finding no answers in the dark tea finally he set it beside the tray and pushed his sleeves down meranaвђs eyes were intent on him as if trying to pull out his thoughts there was a hint of impatience about her too he had told her to stay in the corner unless she could hear voices doubtless she saw no reason why she should not come out now the clan chiefs were gone come out and dig out what had been said do you think they believe i dance on aes sedai strings he said young narishma gave a start in truth he was a little older than rand but he had the look of a boy five or six years younger he glanced at merana as though she had the answer and shifted his shoulders uncomfortably i do not know my lord dragon dashiva blinked and stopped murmuring to himself tilting his head birdlike he eyed rand sideways does it matter so long as they obey it matters rand said dashiva shrugged and narishma frowned thoughtfully neither seemed to understand yet maybe narishma could come to maps littered the stone floor behind the throne on its dais rolled or folded or spread out where he had left them he shifted some with the toe of his boot so much to be juggled at once northern cairhien and the mountains called kinslayerвђs dagger and the region around the city illian and the plains of maredo out to far madding the island of tar valon and all the surrounding towns and villages ghealdan and part of amadicia movement and color in his head lews therin moaned and laughed in the distance faint mad mutters of killing the ashaвђman killing the forsaken killing himself alanna stopped weeping cutting anguish subdued beneath a thin thread of anger rand scrubbed his hands through his hair pressing hard against his temples what had it been like to be alone inside his own skull he could not recall one of the tall doors opened to admit one of the maidens who were standing guard in the corridor riallin with vivid yellowred hair and a grin for everything actually managed to appear plump for a maiden anyway berelain sur paendrag and annoura larisen wish to see the carвђaвђcarn she announced her voice went from warm and friendly on the first name to cold and flat on the second without disturbing her grin rand sighed and opened his mouth to let them enter but berelain did not wait she stormed in a somewhat calmer annoura at her heels the aes sedai shied slightly at the sight of dashiva and narishma and stared curiously when she saw merana standing in her corner not so berelain what is the meaning of this my lord dragon she demanded brandishing the letter he had had delivered to her this morning she stalked across the floor to shake it under his nose why am i to return to mayene i have governed well here in your name and you know it i could not stop colavaere having herself crowned but at least i stopped her changing the laws you made why am i to be sent away and why am i told by letter not to my face by letter thanked for my services and dismissed like a clerk whoвђs done collecting the taxes even furious the first of mayene was one of the most beautiful women rand had ever seen black hair fell in shining waves to her shoulders framing a face to make a blind man stare a man could easily drown in her dark eyes today she wore shimmering silver silk thin and clinging and more suited to entertaining a lover in private in fact had the neckline been a hair lower she would not have been able to wear the dress in public as it was he was not sure she should he had told himself when writing that letter that it was because he had too much to do and no time for arguing with her the truth was he enjoyed looking at her too much for some reason he had begun feeling that that was вђ not exactly wrong but almost as soon as she appeared lews therin gave over ranting to hum softly the way he did when admiring a woman abruptly rand realized he was thumbing his earlobe and felt a shock instinctively he knew that was something else lews therin did without thinking like the humming he pushed his hand to his side but for an instant it wanted to rise to his ear again burn you this is my bodythe thought was a snarl minelews therinвђs hum stopped in surprise and confusion without a sound the dead man fled back into the deepest shadows of randвђs brain randвђs silence had an effect berelain lowered the letter and her anger receded a little eyes fixed on his she drew a deep breath that heated his cheeks my lord dragon вђ you know why he cut in looking only at her eyes was not easy oddly he found himself wishing min were there very odd her viewings would be no help now when you returned from that sea folk ship this morning there was a fellow waiting on the dock with a knife berelain tossed her head contemptuously he came no closer than three steps i was accompanied by a dozen of the winged guards and lord captain gallenne nurelle had led some of the winged guards to dumaiвђs wells but gallenne commanded the guards as a whole she had eight hundred of them in the city aside from those who returned with nurelle you expect me to turn tail because of a cutpurse donвђt play the fool he growled a cutpurse with a dozen soldiers around you color flared in her cheeks she knew all right he gave her no chance for protests or explanations or any other foolishness dobraine tells me heвђs already heard whispers in the palace that you betrayed colavaere those who supported her might be afraid to say boo to me but theyвђll pay to have a knife stuck into you and faile too according to dobraine that was being taken care of but they wonвђt have a chance because you are going back to mayene dobraine will take your place here until elayne claims the sun throne she spluttered as if he had dumped cold water down her dress her eyes grew dangerously large he had been glad when she stopped being afraid of him but now he was not so sure as she opened her mouth to explode annoura touched her arm and her head whipped around they exchanged a long look and berelainвђs sputters subsided she smoothed her skirts and vigorously squared her shoulders rand looked away hastily merana hovered at the edge of the ward he wondered whether she had stepped across and dodged back вђ how else could she stand right on top of what she could not possibly detect when his head turned she moved backward until she almost touched the walls her eyes never leaving him by her face she would have poured his tea every day for ten years to hear what was being said my lord dragon berelain said smiling there is still the matter of the athaвђan miere her voice was warm honey the curve of her lips would have sparked thoughts of kisses in a stone the wavemistress harine is not pleased to be left sitting on her ship so long i have visited with her a number of times i can smooth the difficulties there which i hardly think lord dobraine can i believe the sea folk are vital to you whether or not the prophecies of the dragon mention them you are crucial in their prophecies though they seem reluctant to say exactly how rand stared why was she struggling so hard to keep a difficult job that had offered few thanks from cairhienin even before some began wanting to kill her she was a ruler used to dealing with rulers and embassies not street thugs and knives in the dark warm honey or no warm honey it was not for any desire to stay near rand alвђthor she had well offered herself to him once but the hard fact was that mayene was a small country and berelain used her beauty as a man would a sword to keep her land from being swallowed by its more powerful neighbor tear and there simple as that he had it berelain i donвђt know what else i can do to guarantee mayene for you but i will write out any вђ colors swirled so strongly in his head that his tongue froze lews therin cackled a woman who knows the danger and isnвђt afraid is a treasure only a madman would spurn guarantees bleakness engulfed honey and anger bubbled again cold this time annoura plucked at berelainвђs sleeve but she paid the aes sedai no heed while i sit in mayene with your guarantees others will serve you they will ask then rewards and the service i did here will be faded and old while theirs is bright and new if the high lord weiramon gives you illian and asks mayene in return what will you say if he gives you murandy and altara and everything clear to the aryth ocean will you serve if it still means leaving he asked quietly you will be out of my sight but not out of my mind lews therin laughed again in such a way that rand nearly blushed he enjoyed looking but sometimes the things lews therin thought berelain considered him with stubborn eyes and he could all but see the questions being toted up behind annouraвђs the careful choosing of which to ask the door opened again for riallin an aes sedai has come to see the carвђaвђcarn she managed to sound cold and uncertain at the same time her name is cadsuane melaidhrin a strikingly handsome woman swept in right behind her irongray hair gathered in a bun atop her head and decorated with dangling gold ornaments and it seemed everything happened at once i thought you were dead annoura gasped eyes nearly starting out of her head merana darted through the ward hands outstretched no cadsuane she screamed you mustnвђt harm him you must not randвђs skin tingled as someone in the room embraced saidar perhaps more than one and swiftly moving well clear of berelain he seized hold of the source flooding himself with saidin feeling it fill the ashaвђman dashivaвђs face twitched as he glared from one aes sedai to another despite the power he held narishma grasped his sword hilt with both hands and assumed the stance called leopard in the tree on the brink of drawing lews therin snarled of killing and death kill them all kill them now riallin raised her veil shouting something and suddenly a dozen maidens were in the room veiling spears ready it was hardly surprising that berelain stood gaping as if everyone had gone mad for someone who had caused all that this cadsuane seemed remarkably unaffected she looked at the maidens and shook her head golden stars and moons and birds swaying gently trying to grow decent roses in northern ghealdan may be near to death annoura she said dryly but it is not quite the grave oh do calm down merana before you frighten someone one would think you would have grown a little less excitable since putting off novice white merana opened and closed her mouth looking abashed of all things and the tingling vanished abruptly rand did not release saidin though nor did the ashaвђman who are you he demanded what ajah red by meranaвђs reaction but for a red sister simply to walk in like this alone would require suicidal courage what do you want cadsuaneвђs gaze lingered on him for no more than a moment and she did not answer meranaвђs lips parted but the grayhaired woman looked at her raising one eyebrow and that was that merana actually reddened and lowered her eyes annoura was still staring at the newcomer as if at a ghost or a giant without a word cadsuane swept across the room to the two ashaвђman dark green divided skirts swishing rand was beginning to get the feeling that she always moved in that rushing glide graceful yet wasting no time and allowing nothing to impede her dashiva stared her up and down and sneered although looking him straight in the face she did not seem to notice any more than she appeared to notice narishmaвђs hands on his sword when she put a finger under his chin moving his head from side to side before he could jerk back what lovely eyes she murmured narishma blinked uncertainly and dashivaвђs sneer turned to a grin but a nasty one that made his former smirk lighthearted in comparison do nothing rand snapped dashiva had the gall to glower at him before sullenly pressing a fist to his chest in the salute the ashaвђman used what do you want here cadsuane rand went on look at me burn you she did turning just her head so you are rand alвђthor the dragon reborn iвђd have thought even a child like moiraine could have taught you a few manners riallin put the spear from her right hand with those clutched behind her buckler and flashed maiden handtalk for once none laughed for once rand was sure the talk was not a joke about him be easy riallin he said raising a hand all of you be easy cadsuane ignored the byplay too directing a smile to berelain so this is your berelain annoura she is more beautiful than i had heard the curtsy she made bowing her head was quite deep yet somehow without any suggestion of obeisance no hint that she was in any way less it truly was a courtesy no more my lady first of mayene i must speak with this young man and i would retain your advisor iвђve heard you have undertaken many duties here i would not keep you from them it was as clear a dismissal as could be short of holding the door open berelain inclined her head graciously then smoothly turned to rand and spread her skirts in a curtsy so deep that he worried whether she would remain even as clothed as she was my lord dragon she intoned i ask your kind permission to withdraw randвђs return bow was not so practiced granted my lady first as you wish he offered her a hand to help her rise i hope you will consider my proposal my lord dragon i will serve you wherever and however you desire her voice was all honey again for cadsuaneвђs benefit he supposed there was certainly no flirtation on her face only determination remember harine she added in a whisper when the door closed behind berelain cadsuane said itвђs always good to see children play donвђt you think merana merana goggled head swiveling between rand and the grayhaired sister annoura looked as though only willpower held her upright most of the maidens followed berelain apparently deciding there was to be no killing but riallin and two others remained before the door still veiled it might have been coincidence that there was one for each aes sedai dashiva also seemed to think any danger past he leaned back against the wall with a foot propped lips moving silently arms folded apparently watching the aes sedai narishma frowned questioningly at rand but rand only shook his head the woman was deliberately trying to provoke him the question was why provoke a man she must know could still her or kill her without exerting himself lews therin muttered the same thing why whystepping onto the dais rand took up the dragon scepter from the throne and sat waiting to see what would happen the woman was not going to succeed rather ornate wouldnвђt you say cadsuane said to annoura looking around aside from all the other gold broad bands of it ran around the walls above the mirrors and the cornices were nearly two feet of golden scales iвђve never known whether cairhienin or tairens overdo worse but either can make an ebou dari blush or even a tinker is that a tea tray i would like some if itвђs fresh and hot channeling rand scooped up the tray half expecting to see the metal corrode from the taint and wafted it to the three women merana had brought extra cups and four still stood unused on the tray he filled three replaced the teapot and waited it floated in midair supported by saidin three very different women in appearance and three distinctly different reactions annoura looked at the tray much as one might a coiled viper gave a tiny shake of her head and took a small step back merana drew a deep breath and slowly picked up a cup with a hand that trembled slightly knowing a man could channel and being forced to see it were not at all the same cadsuane though took her cup and sniffed the vapors with a pleased smile nothing could tell her which of the three men had poured the tea yet she looked across her cup straight at rand lounging with one leg over the arm over his chair thatвђs a good boy she said the maidens passed shocked looks above their veils rand quivered no she would not provoke him for whatever reason that was what she wanted and she would not i will ask one more time he said strange that his voice could be that cold inside he was hotter than the hottest fires of saidin what do you want answer or leave by the door or a window your choice again merana began to speak and again cadsuane silenced her this time by a sharp gesture without looking away from him to see you she said calmly i am green ajah not red but i have worn the shawl longer than any other sister living and i have faced more men who could channel than any four reds maybe than any ten not that i hunted them you understand but i seem to have a nose calmly a woman saying she had been to market once or twice in her life some fought to the bitter end kicking and screaming even after they were shielded and bound some wept and begged offering gold anything their very souls not to be taken to tar valon still others wept from relief meek as lambs thankful finally to be done with it lightвђs truth they all weep at the end there is nothing left for them but tears at the end the heat inside him erupted in rage tray and massive teapot hurtled across the room smashing a mirror with a thunderous crash and bouncing back in a shower of glass halfflattened pot spraying tea tray spinning across the floor bent double everyone jumped except cadsuane rand leaped from the dais clutching the dragon scepter so hard his knuckles hurt is that supposed to frighten me he growled do you expect me to beg or to be thankful to weep aes sedai i could close my hand and crush you the hand he held up shook with fury merana knows why i should the light only knows why i donвђt the woman looked at the battered tea things as if she had all the time in the world now you know she said at last calm as ever that i know your future and your present the lightвђs mercy fades to nothing for a man who can channel some see that and believe the light denies those men i do not have you begun to hear voices yet what do you mean he asked slowly he could feel lews therin listening the tingle returned to his skin and he very nearly channeled but all that happened was that the teapot rose and floated to cadsuane turning slowly in the air for her to examine some men who can channel begin to hear voices she spoke almost absently frowning at the flattened sphere of silver and gold it is a part of the madness voices conversing with them telling them what to do the teapot drifted gently to the floor by her feet have you heard any startlingly dashiva gave a raucous laugh shoulders shaking narishma wet his lips he might not have been afraid of the woman before but now he watched her closely as a scorpion i will ask the questions rand said firmly you seem to forget i am the dragon reborn youare real arenвђt youhe wondered there was no answer lews therinsometimes the man did not answer but aes sedai always drew him lews therinhe was not mad the voice was real not imagination not madness a sudden desire to laugh did not help cadsuane sighed you are a young man who has little idea where he is going or why or what lies ahead you seem overwrought perhaps we can speak when you are more settled have you any objection to my taking merana and annoura away for a little while iвђve seen neither in quite some time rand gaped at her she swooped in insulted him threatened him casually announced she knew about the voice in his head and with that she wanted to leave and talk with merana and annoura isshe madstill no answer from lews therin the man was real he was go away he said go away and he was not mad all of you get out get out dashiva blinked at him tilting his head then shrugged and started for the door cadsuane smiled in such a way that he halfexpected her to tell him again he was a good boy then gathered up merana and annoura and herded them toward the maidens who were lowering their veils and frowning worriedly narishma looked at him too hesitating until rand gestured sharply finally they were all gone and he was alone alone convulsively he hurled the dragon scepter the spearpoint stuck quivering in the back of one the chairs the tassels swaying i am not mad he said to the empty room lews therin had told him things he would never have escaped galinaвђs chest without the dead manвђs voice but he had used the power before he ever heard the voice he had figured out how to call lightning and hurl fire and form a construct that had killed hundreds of trollocs but then maybe that had been lews therin like those memories of climbing trees in a plum orchard and entering the hall of the servants and a dozen more that crept up on him unawares and maybe those memories were all fancies mad dreams of a mad mind just like the voice he realized he was pacing and could not stop he felt as if he had to move or his muscles would tear him apart in spasms i am not mad he panted not yet i am not вђ the sound of the door opening made him whirl hoping for min it was riallin again supporting a short stocky woman in a dark blue dress with hair more gray than not and a blunt face a haggard redeyed face he wanted to tell them to go away to leave him alone alone was he alone was lews therin a dream if only they would leave him idrien tarsin was the head of the school he had founded here in cairhien a woman so practical he was not sure she believed in the one power since she could neither see nor touch it what could reduce her to this state he made himself turn toward her mad or not alone or not there was no one else to do what had to be done not even this small duty heavier than a mountain what is the matter he asked making his voice as gentle as he could suddenly weeping idrien stumbled to him and collapsed against his chest when she was coherent enough to tell her story he felt like weeping too chapter flame of tar valon diamonds and stars merana followed closely as she dared on cadsuaneвђs heels a hundred questions bubbling on her tongue but cadsuane was not a woman whose sleeve you plucked she decided who she noticed and when annoura held her silence too the pair of them drawn along in the otherвђs wake down the palace corridors down flights of stairs polished marble at first then plain dark stone merana exchanged glances with her sister gray and felt a momentвђs pang she did not know the woman really but annoura wore the steely look of a girl on her way to the mistress of novices determined to be brave they were not novices they were not children she opened her mouth вђ and closed it intimidated by the gray bun bobbing ahead of her with its dangling moons and stars and birds and fish cadsuane was cadsuane merana had met her once before or at least listened to her and been spoken to when she was a novice sisters had come from every ajah to see the woman filled with an awe they could not hide once cadsuane melaidhrin had been the standard by which every new entry into the novice books was judged until elayne trakand none had come to the white tower in her lifetime who could match that standard much less surpass it in more ways than one her like had not walked among aes sedai for a thousand years a refusal to accept selection as a sitter was unheard of yet it was said she had refused and at least twice it was said she had spurned being raised head of the green ajah too it was said she once vanished from the tower for ten years because the hall intended to raise her amyrlin not that she had ever spent a day more in tar valon than absolutely necessary word of cadsuane came to the tower stories to make sisters gape adventures to make those who dreamed of the shawl shiver she would end a legend among aes sedai if she was not already the shawl had graced meranaвђs shoulders for over twentyfive years when cadsuane announced her retirement from the world her hair already solid gray and everyone assumed her long dead when the aiel war erupted another twentyfive years on but before the fighting was three months old she reappeared accompanied by two warders men long in the tooth yet still hard as iron it was said cadsuane had had more warders over the years than most sisters had shoes after the aiel retreated from tar valon she retired once more but some said more than halfseriously that cadsuane would never die so long as even a spark of adventure remained in the world and that is the sort of nonsense that novices babble merana reminded herself firmly even we die eventually yet cadsuane was still cadsuane and if she was not one of those sisters who had appeared in the city after alвђthor was taken the sun would not set tonight merana moved her arms to adjust her shawl and realized it was hanging on a peg in her room ridiculous she needed no reminders of who she was if only it had been someone other than cadsuane a pair of wise ones standing in the mouth of a crossing corridor watched them pass cold pale eyes in stony faces beneath their dark head scarves edarra and leyn both could channel and quite strongly they might have risen high had they gone to the tower as girls cadsuane went by without seeming to notice the wildersвђ disapprobation annoura did frowning and muttering slender braids swaying as she shook her head merana kept her own eyes on the floor tiles undoubtedly it would fall to her now explaining to cadsuane the compromise that had been worked out with the wise ones last night before she and the others were brought to the palace annoura did not know вђ she was no part of it вђ and merana had small hope that rafela or verin would appear or anyone else she might somehow foist the duty onto it was a compromise in a way and perhaps the best that could be expected under the circumstances yet she strongly questioned whether cadsuane would see it so she wished she did not have to be the one to convince her better to pour tea for those cursed men for a month she wished she had not been so free with her tongue with young alвђthor knowing why he had made her serve tea was no balm for being sealed off from every advantage she might have gained from it she would rather think she had been caught in some taвђverenswirling of the pattern than believe that a young manвђs eyes like polished bluegray gems had set her babbling from pure fright but either way she had handed all the advantage to him on a tray she wished wishing was for children she had negotiated countless treaties many of which had actually accomplished what was intended she had ended three wars and stopped two dozen more before they began faced kings and queens and generals and made them see reason even so she found herself promising that she would not utter one word of complaint no matter how often that man made her play the maidservant if only seonid would pop around the next corner or masuri or faeldrin or anyone at all light if only she could blink her eyes and find that everything since leaving salidar had been a bad dream surprisingly cadsuane led them straight to the small room that bera and kiruna shared deep in the bowels of the palace where the servants lived a tight window set high in the wall yet level with the paving stones of a courtyard outside let in a little stream of light but the room seemed murky cloaks and saddlebags and a few dresses hung from pegs in the cracked yellowing plaster walls gouges marred the bare wooden floor though some effort had been made to smooth them a tiny battered round table stood in one corner and an equally beaten washstand in another with a chipped basin and pitcher merana eyed the small bed it did not look that much narrower than the one she was forced to share with seonid and masuri two doors farther down that room was larger by perhaps a pace each way but not meant for three coiren and the others still held in the aiel tents probably were much more comfortable as prisoners neither bera nor kiruna was present but daigian was a plump pale woman who wore a thin silver chain in her long black hair with a round moonstone dangling in the middle of her forehead her dark cairhienin dress bore four thin stripes of color across the bodice and she had added slashes in the skirts white for her ajah a younger daughter of one of the lesser houses she had always minded merana of a pouter pigeon when cadsuane entered daigian rose on her toes expectantly there was only one chair in the room little more than a stool with an excuse of a back cadsuane took that and sighed tea please two sips of what that boy poured and i could have used my tongue to sole a shoe the glow of saidarimmediately surrounded daigian though faintly and a dented tin teapot rose from the table flows of fire heating the water as she opened a small brassbound tea chest with no other choice for place to sit merana settled onto the bed adjusting her skirts and shifting on the lumpy mattress while she tried to order her thoughts this might well be as important a negotiation as she had ever undertaken after a moment annoura joined her perching on the lip of the mattress i take it by your presence merana cadsuane said abruptly that tales of the boy submitting to elaida are false donвђt look so surprised child did you think i didnвђt know your associations she gave that word such a twist it sounded as filthy as any soldierвђs expletive and you annoura i am here only to advise berelain though the truth of it is she ignored my advice by coming in the first place the taraboner woman held her head up voice confident she was rubbing her thumbs for all she was worth though she could not do well at the negotiating table if she was that transparent for the rest she said carefully i have reached no decision as yet a wisedecision that cadsuane murmured with a pointed look at merana it seems that in the last few years far too many sisters have forgotten they possess brains or discretion there was a time when aes sedai reached their decisions after calm deliberation with the good of the tower always in the front of their thoughts just remember what the sanche girl got from meddling with alвђthor annoura walk too near a forgefire and you can be burned badly merana lifted her chin working her neck to ease its tightness realizing what she was doing she made herself stop the woman did not stand that far above her not really just higher than any other sister if i may ask too diffident but worse to stop and start over what are your intentions cadsuane she struggled to maintain dignity obviously you have been holding yourself aside until now why have you decided to approach alвђthor at this particular time you were rather undiplomatic with him you might as well have slapped his face annoura put in and merana colored of the two of them annoura should have been having the harder time with cadsuane by far but she was not the one stumbling over her words cadsuane shook her head in pitying style if you want to see what a man is made of push him from a direction he doesnвђt expect thereвђs good metal in that boy i think but heвђs going to be difficult steepling her fingers she peered across them at the wall musing to herself he has a rage in him fit to burn the world and he holds it by a hair push him too far off balance phaw alвђthorвђs not so hard yet as logain ablar or mazrim taim but a hundred times as difficult i fear hearing those three names together clove meranaвђs tongue to the roof of her mouth you have seen logain and taim both a staring annoura said taim he is following alвђthor so i hear merana managed to swallow a relieved sigh tales of dumaiвђs wells had not had time to spread yet they would though i do have ears to catch rumors too annoura cadsuane said acerbically though i could wish i didnвђt for what i hear of that pair all my work thrown away to be done over othersвђ as well but i did my share and then there are these blackcoats these ashaвђman taking a cup from daigian she smiled warmly and murmured thanks the roundcheeked white seemed ready to curtsy though all she did was retreat to a corner and fold her hands she had been longer a novice and accepted than anyone in living memory barely allowed to remain in the tower gaining the ring by a fingernail and the shawl by an eyelash daigian was always selfeffacing around other sisters breathing the steam from her teacup cadsuane went on suddenly chatting pleasantly it was logain practically on my doorstep that lured me away from my roses phaw a scuffle at a sheep fair could have lured me from those lightcursed plants whatвђs the point if you use the power but do it without and you grow ten thousand thorns for every вђ phaw i actually considered taking the oath as a hunter if the council of nine would allow it well it was a nice few months chasing down logain but once he was taken escorting him to tar valon appealed as much as the roses i wandered a bit to see what i could find perhaps a new warder though itвђs a bit late for that in any fairness to the man i suppose then i heard of taim and i was off to saldaea as fast i could ride thereвђs nothing for a bit of excitement like a man who can channel abruptly her voice hardened and her gaze were either of you involved in that vileness right after the aiel war despite herself merana gave a confused start the other womanвђs eyes spoke of the block and the headsmanвђs axe what vileness i donвђt know what you are talking about that accusing glare hit annoura so hard she almost fell off the bed the aiel war she gasped steadying herself the years after i spent trying to make the socalled grand coalition more than a name merana looked at annoura with interest a good many of the gray ajah had scurried from capital to capital after the war in a futile effort to hold together the alliance that had formed against the aiel but she had never known annoura was one of them she could not be that bad a negotiator if she was so did i she said dignity since setting out after alвђthor from caemlyn she had not retained much of that the few scraps remaining were too precious to lose she made her voice calm and firm what vileness do you mean cadsuane the grayhaired woman simply waved the question away as though she had never spoken the word for a moment merana wondered whether cadsuaneвђs wits might be wandering she had never heard of it happening to a sister but most aes sedai did go into retreat at the close of their lives far from the stratagems and turbulence that none but sisters ever knew far from everyone often as not who could say what befell them before the end one look at the clear steady gaze regarding her over that teacup quickly disabused her of any such notion anyway twentyyearold vileness whatever it had been certainly could not hold a candle to what the world confronted now and cadsuane still had not answered her original questions what did she intend and why now before merana could ask again the door opened and bera and kiruna were herded in by corele hovian a boyishly slim yellow with thick black eyebrows and a mass of raven hair that gave her something of a wild appearance no matter how neatly she dressed and she always dressed for a country dance with masses of embroidery on her sleeves and bodice and up the sides of her skirts there was barely room to move with so many people in this confined space corele never failed to seem amused whatever happened but now she wore a wide smile somewhere between disbelief and outright laughter kirunaвђs eyes flashed in a face of frozen arrogance while bera fumed mouth tight and forehead creased until they saw cadsuane merana supposed that for them it must be as if she had found herself face to face with alind dyfelle or sevlana meseau or even mabriam en shereed their eyes bulged kirunaвђs jaw dropped i thought you were dead bera breathed cadsuane sniffed irritably i am growing tired of hearing that the next imbecile i hear it from is going to yelp for a week annoura began studying the toes of her slippers youвђll never guess where i found these two corele said in her lilting murandian accent she tapped the side of her upturned nose the way she did when about to tell a joke or what she saw as one spots of color appeared in beraвђs cheeks and larger in kirunaвђs bera there was sitting meek as a mouse under the eyes of half a dozen of those aiel wilders who told me bold as you please that she couldnвђt come with me until sorilea вђ oh now that womanвђs a harridan to give you nightmares she is вђ i couldnвђt have bera until sorilea was done with her private chat with the other apprentice our darling kiruna there it was no longer a matter of spots kiruna and bera reddened to their hair refusing to meet anyoneвђs eye even daigian stared at them relief surged through merana in wonderful waves she would not have to be the one to explain how the wise ones had interpreted that wretched alвђthorвђs orders that the sisters were to obey them they were not really apprentices there were no lessons involved of course what could a great lot of wilders savages at that teach aes sedai it was just that the wise ones liked to know where everyone fit just bera or kiruna could tell how alвђthor had laughed вђ laughed вђ and said it made no difference to him and he expected them to be obedientpupils no one was having an easy time bending her neck least of all kiruna yet cadsuane did not demand explanations i expected a dogвђs dinner she said dryly but not a bucket from the midden let me see if i have the straight of it you children who stand in rebellion against a lawfully raised amyrlin have now somehow associated yourselves with the alвђthor boy and if you are taking orders from these aiel women i assume you take his as well her grunt was disgusted enough for a mouthful of rotten plums shaking her head she peered into her teacup then fixed the pair again well whatвђs one treason more or less the hall can put you on your knees from here to tarmon gaiвђdon for penance but they can only take your heads once what of the rest out in the aiel camp all elaidaвђs i suppose have they also apprenticed themselves none of us have been allowed as close as the first row of tents these aiel seem to have no love of aes sedai i do not know cadsuane kiruna answered so redfaced she appeared about to catch fire we have been kept apart meranaвђs eyes widened she had never before heard kiruna sound deferential bera on the other hand drew a deep breath she already stood straight yet she seemed to straighten herself for an unpleasant task elaida is not вђ she began heatedly elaida is overambitious as near as i can make out cadsuane broke in leaning forward so abruptly that merana and annoura both started back on the bed though she was not looking at them and she may be a catastrophe simmering but she is still the amyrlin seat raised by the hall of the tower in full accordance with the laws of the tower if elaida is a lawful amyrlin why have you not obeyed her order to return all that betrayed beraвђs lack of composure was the stillness of her hands on her skirts only a marked effort to keep from clutching or smoothing could hold them so motionless so one of you has a little backbone cadsuane laughed softly but her eyes did not look mirthful at all leaning back she sipped her tea now sit down i have a great many more questions merana and annoura rose offering their places on the bed but kiruna simply stood peering at cadsuane worriedly and bera glanced at her friend then shook her head corele rolled her blue eyes grinning broadly for some reason but cadsuane did not seem to care half the rumors i hear she said concern the forsaken being loose it would hardly be a surprise with all else but do you have any evidence for or against before very long merana was glad to be sitting before very long she knew what laundry felt going through the laundressвђs mangle cadsuane did all the questioning dodging from topic to topic so you never knew what was coming next corele held her peace except for chuckling now and then or shaking her head and daigian did not even do that of course merana caught the worst her and bera and kiruna yet annoura was certainly not spared every time berelainвђs advisor relaxed thinking she was in the clear cadsuane skewered her anew the woman wanted to know everything from the alвђthor boyвђs authority with the aiel to why a sea folk wavemistress was anchored in the river from whether moiraine truly was dead to whether the boy really had rediscovered traveling and whether berelain had bedded him or had any intention of it what cadsuane thought of the answers was impossible to say except once when she learned that alanna had bonded alвђthor and how her mouth compressed to a thin line and she frowned a hole though the wall but while everyone else expressed disgust merana thought of cadsuane saying she had considered taking another warder herself the answer was ignorance entirely too often to suit but saying you did not know failed to quench cadsuaneвђs appetite she required every last shred and particle you did know even if you did not know you knew it they managed to keep a little back most of what had to be kept back yet a few surprising things came out that way some very surprising even from annoura who it turned out had been receiving detailed letters from berelain almost from the day the girl rode north cadsuane demanded answers but gave none and that worried merana she watched faces grow dogged and defensive and apologetic and wondered whether her own looked the same cadsuane she had to make one more effort cadsuane why have you decided to take an interest in him now an unblinking gaze met hers for a moment then cadsuane turned her attention to bera and kiruna so they actually managed to kidnap him right out of the palace the grayhaired woman said holding out her empty cup for daigian to refill no one else had been offered tea cadsuaneвђs expression and tone were so neutral that merana wanted to tear her own hair alвђthor would not be pleased if he learned kiruna had revealed the kidnapping however inadvertently cadsuane used any slip of your tongue to pry out more than you meant to say at least the details of his treatment had not come out he had made plain how displeased he would be if that happened merana thanked the light that the woman was not staying with any one subject for long you are sure it was taim and you are sure these blackcoats didnвђt arrive on horses bera answered reluctantly and kiruna sullenly they were as certain as they could be no one had actually seen the ashaвђman come or depart and the hole that brought them all here could have been made by alвђthor which did not satisfy at all of course think you arenвђt silly girls any longer or shouldnвђt be phaw you must have noticed something merana felt ill she and the others had spent half the night arguing over what their oath meant before deciding it meant exactly what they had said with no loopholes to wriggle through at last even kiruna conceded that they must defend and support alвђthor as well as obey that standing aside in the slightest was not permitted what that might mean when it came to elaida and the sisters loyal to her really concerned no one at least no one admitted any concern the mere fact of what they had decided was stunner enough but merana wondered whether bera or kiruna had yet realized what she had they might just find themselves opposing a legend not to mention whatever sisters besides corele and daigian had chosen to follow her worse cadsuaneвђs eyes rested on her for a moment giving away nothing demanding everything worse merana was sure that cadsuane knew that very well hurrying along the palace corridors min ignored greetings from half a dozen maidens she knew just trotted right by without a word in return never considering that she was being rude trotting was not easy in heeled boots the fool things women did for men not that rand had asked her to wear the boots but she put them on the first time with him in mind and she had seen him smile he liked them light what was she doing thinking about boots she should never have gone to colavaereвђs apartments shivering blinking back unshed tears she began to run as usual a number of maidens were squatting on their heels beside the tall doors worked with gilded rising suns their shoufahung about their shoulders and their spears lay across their knees yet there was nothing casual about them they were leopards waiting for something to kill usually maidens made min uneasy for all they were friendly enough today she would not have cared if they were veiled he is in a foul temper riallin warned but made no move to stop her min was one of the few allowed to enter randвђs presence without being announced she straightened her coat and tried to settle herself she was not sure why she had come except that rand made her feel safe burn him she had never needed anyone to feel safe before just inside the room she stopped aghast automatically she pushed the door shut behind her the place was a shambles a few glittering shards clung to some of the mirror frames but most of the glass lay scattered across the floor the dais was on its side the throne that had stood atop it just gilded flinders where it had been smashed against a wall one of the standlamps heavy iron beneath the gilt had been twisted into a hoop rand sat in one of the smaller chairs in his shirtsleeves arms dangling and head back staring at the ceiling staring at nothing images danced about him and colored auras flickered and flared he was like aes sedai in that she had no need of illuminators when rand or an aes sedai was in sight he did not move as she walked farther into the room he did not seem aware of her at all shattered bits of mirror crunched beneath her boots a foul temper indeed even so she felt no fear not of him she could not begin to imagine rand harming her for him she felt enough to nearly purge the memory of colavaereвђs apartments from her head she had long since reconciled herself to being hopelessly in love nothing else mattered not that he was an unsophisticated countryman younger than she not who or what he was not that he was doomed to go mad and die if he was not killed first i donвђt even mind having to share him she thought and knew how tightly she was caught if she could lie to herself that she had forced herself to accept elayne had a part of him a claim on him and so did this aviendha woman she had yet to meet what could not be mended must be lived with so her aunt jan always said especially when your brains had gone soft light she had always prided herself on keeping her wits she stopped beside one of the chairs where the dragon scepter had driven into the thick wooden back so hard that the point stood out nearly a hand behind in love with a man who did not know who would send her away should he ever became aware a man she was sure was in love with her and with elayne and this aviendha too that she rushed by what could not be mended he was in love with her and refused to admit it did he think that just because mad lews therin telamon had killed the woman he loved he was fated to as well iвђm glad you came he said suddenly still staring at the ceiling iвђve been sitting here alone alone he gave a bitter bark of a laugh herid fel is dead no she whispered not that sweet little old man her eyes stung he was torn apart randвђs voice was so tired so empty idrien fainted when she found him she lay in a stupor half the night and was nearly incoherent when finally roused one of the other women at the school gave her something to make her sleep she was embarrassed about that when she came to me she started crying again and it had to be shadowspawn what else could tear a man limb from limb without raising his head he smacked a fist down on the chair arm so hard the wood creaked but why why was he killed what could he have told me min tried to think she truly did master fel was a philosopher he and rand discussed everything from the meaning of parts of the prophecies of the dragon to the nature of the hole into the dark oneвђs prison he let her borrow books fascinating books especially where she had to work to puzzle out what it was they said he had been a philosopher he would never lend her a book again such a gentle old man wrapped up in a world of thought and startled when he noticed anything outside it she treasured a note he had written to rand he had said she was pretty that she distracted him and now he was dead light she had had too much of death i shouldnвђt have told you not like that she gave a start she had not heard rand cross the room his fingers brushed her cheek wiping away tears she was crying iвђm sorry min he said softly i am not a very nice person anymore a man is dead because of me and all i can do is worry why he was killed flinging arms around him she buried her face against his chest she could not stop crying she could not stop trembling i went to colavaereвђs apartments images flashed in her head the empty sitting room all the servants gone the bedchamber she did not want to remember but now she had begun she could not stop the words tumbling out i thought since youвђd exiled her maybe there was some way around the viewing i had of her colavaere had been wearing what must have been her finest gown dark silk that glistened with falls of delicate agedivory sovarra lace i thought for once it didnвђt have to be that way youвђre taвђveren you can change the pattern colavaere had donned a necklace and bracelets of emeralds and firedrops and rings with pearls and rubies surely her best pieces and yellow diamonds had been arranged in her hair a fair imitation of the crown of cairhien her face she was in her bedchamber hanging from one of the bedposts bulging eyes and protruding tongue in a blackened swollen face toes a foot above the overturned stool sobbing helplessly min sagged against him his arms went around her slowly gently oh min you have more pain than pleasure from your gift if i could take your pain i would min i would slowly it penetrated that he was trembling too light he tried so hard to be iron to be what he thought the dragon reborn must but it cut him when somebody died because of him colavaere probably no less than fel he bled for everyone harmed and tried to pretend he did not kiss me she mumbled when he did not move she looked up he blinked at her uncertainly eyes now blue now gray a morning sky iвђm not teasing how often had she teased him sitting on his lap kissing him calling him sheepherder because she dared not say his name for fear he might hear the caress he put up with it because he thought she was teasing and would stop if she believed it did not affect him hah aunt jan and aunt rana said you should not kiss a man unless you intended to marry him but aunt miren seemed to know a little more of the world she said you should not kiss a man too casually because men fell in love so easily iвђm cold inside sheepherder colavaere and master fel i need to feel warm flesh i need please his head lowered so slowly it was a brotherвђs kiss at first mild as milkwater soothing comforting then it became something else not at all soothing jerking upright he tried to pull away min i canвђt i have no right вђ seizing two handfuls of his hair she pulled his mouth back down and after a little while he stopped fighting she was not certain whether her hands began tearing at the laces of his shirt first or his at hers but of one thing she was absolutely sure if he even tried to stop now she was going to fetch one of riallinвђs spears all of them and stab him on her way out of the sun palace cadsuane studied the aiel wilders she saw as well as she could without being obvious corele and daigian followed in silence they knew her well enough by now not to disturb her with chatter which could not be said of all those who paused a few days at arilynвђs little palace before she sent them on a great many wilders every one staring at the aes sedai as if at flearidden curs covered with running sores tracking mud over a new rug some people looked at aes sedai with awe or adoration others with fear or hate but cadsuane had never seen contempt before not even from whitecloaks even so any people who produced so many wilders should be sending a river of girls to the tower that would have to be seen to eventually and to the pit of doom with custom if need be but not now the alвђthor boy needed to be kept intrigued enough that he allowed her near him and offbalance enough that she could nudge him where she wanted without him realizing one way or another anything that might interfere with that must be controlled or suppressed nothing could be allowed to influence him or upset him in the wrong way nothing the shiny black coach was waiting in the courtyard behind a patient team of six matched grays a serving man rushed to open the door painted with a pair of silver stars atop red and green stripes bowing to the three of them till his bald head was nearly level with his knees he was in shirtsleeves and breeches since coming to the sun palace she had not noticed anyone in livery yet except a few wearing dobraineвђs colors no doubt the servants were unsure what to wear and afraid to make a mistake i may skin elaida when i can lay hands on her she said as the coach lurched into motion that fool child has made my task nearly impossible and then she laughed so abruptly that daigian stared before she could control her eyes coreleвђs smile widened in anticipation neither understood and she did not try to explain all of her life the fastest way to interest her in anything had been to tell her it was impossible but then over two hundred and seventy years had passed since she last encountered a task she could not perform any day now might be her last but young alвђthor would be a fitting end to it all chapter snakey square patterns within patterns contemptuously sevanna studied her dusty companions seated in a circle with her in the small clearing the nearly leafless branches overhead provided a bit of cool shade and the place where rand alвђthor had hurled death lay more than a hundred miles to the west yet the other womenвђs eyes shifted with an air of looking over shoulders without sweat tents none had been able to clean herself properly no more than a hasty washing of face and hands at dayвђs end eight small silver cups all different sat by her side on the dead leaves and a silver pitcher filled with water that had been dented in the retreat either the carвђaвђcarnis not following she said abruptly or he has been unable to find us either contents me some of them actually jumped tionвђs round face paled and modarra patted her shoulder modarra would have been pretty if she was not so tall if she did not always try to mother everyone within reach alarys became much too intent on straightening skirts already neatly spread around her attempting to ignore what she did not want to see meiraвђs thin mouth drew down but who could say whether for the othersвђ open fear of the carвђaвђcarnor her own they had reason to be afraid two full days since the battle and fewer than twenty thousand spears had grouped around sevanna therava and most of the wise ones who had been to the west were still absent including all the rest who were tied to her some of the missing surely were making their way back to kinslayerвђs dagger but how many would never again see the sun rise no one remembered such a slaughter so many dead in so short a time even the algaiвђdвђsiswaiwere not truly ready to dance the spears again so soon reason to be afraid yet none for showing it displaying heart and soul on your face like a wetlander open and naked for all to see rhiale at least seemed to realize that much if we are to do this thing let us do it she muttered stiff with embarrassment she was one who had jumped sevanna took the small gray cube from her pouch and placed it atop the brown leaves in the middle of the circle someryn put her hands on her knees leaning over to examine it until she appeared in danger of falling out of her blouse her nose nearly touched the cube intricate patterns covered every side and close up you could see smaller patterns within the larger and still smaller inside those and a hint of what seemed smaller yet how they could have been made the tiniest so fine so precise sevanna had no idea once she had thought the cube stone but she was no longer certain yesterday she had dropped it accidentally on some rocks without marring one line of the carving if it was carving the thing must be a terвђangreal that they knew the smallest flow possible of fire must be touched lightly there on what looks like a twisted crescent moon she told them and another there on the top on that mark like a lightning bolt someryn straightened very quickly what will happen then alarys asked combing her hair with her fingers it seemed an absentminded gesture but she always found ways to remind everyone that her hair was black instead of common yellow or red sevanna smiled she enjoyed knowing what they did not i will use it to summon the wetlander who gave it to me that much you told us already rhiale said in a sour voice and tion bluntly asked how will it summon him she might fear rand alвђthor but not a great deal else certainly not sevanna belinde lightly stroked the cube with one bony finger her sunbleached eyebrows drawn down maintaining a smooth face sevanna irritably prevented her hands from fingering a necklace or adjusting her shawl i have told you all you need know considerably more than they needed in her opinion but it had been necessary otherwise they would all be back with the spears and the other wise ones eating hard bread and dried meat or rather they would all be on the move eastward watching for any sign of other survivors watching for any sign of pursuit with a late start they might still cover fifty miles before halting words will not skin the boar much less kill it if you have decided to creep back to the mountains and spend your lives running and hiding then go if not then do what you must and i will do my part rhialeвђs blue eyes stared flat defiance and tionвђs gray even modarra looked doubtful and she and someryn lay the most solidly in her grasp sevanna waited outwardly calm unwilling to tell them again or ask inside her stomach churned with anger she would not be beaten because these women had pale hearts if we must rhiale sighed at last excepting the absent therava she resisted most often but sevanna had hopes of her the spine that refused to bend at all was often the most malleable once it gave way that was as true for women as men rhiale and the others turned their eyes to the cube some frowning sevanna saw nothing of course in fact she realized that if they did nothing they could claim the cube failed to work and she would never know abruptly though someryn gasped and meira almost whispered it draws more look she pointed fire there and there and earth and air and spirit filling the runnels not all of them belinde said they could be filled many ways i think and there are places where the flows twist around something that is not there her forehead furrowed it must be drawing the male part as well several drew back a little shifting shawls brushing skirts as though to rub away dirt sevanna would have given anything to see almost anything how could they be such cowards how could they let it show finally modarra said i wonder what would happen if we touched it with fire elsewhere power the callbox too much or in the wrong way and it may melt a manвђs voice said out of the air it could even exвђ the voice cut off as the other women surged to their feet peering in among the trees alarys and modarra went so far as to draw their belt knives though they had no need of steel when they had the one power nothing moved among the sunstreaked shadows not so much as a bird sevanna did not stir she had believed perhaps a third of what of the wetlander had told her not including this in truth but she recognized caddarвђs voice wetlanders always had more names but that was all he had given a man of many secrets she suspected take your places again she ordered and put the flows back where they were how can i summon him if you fear words rhiale swung around mouth gaping and eyes incredulous undoubtedly wondering how she knew they had stopped channeling the woman was not thinking clearly slowly uneasily they settled in the circle again rhiale donned a flatter face than anyone else so you are back caddarвђs voice said from the air do you have alвђthor something in his tone warned her he could not know but he did she abandoned all she had prepared to say no caddar but we still must talk i will meet you in ten days where we first met she could reach that valley in kinslayerвђs dagger sooner but she needed time to prepare how did he know well that you told the truth girl caddar murmured dryly you will learn i do not like being lied to maintain the wayline for location and i will come to you sevanna stared at the cube in shock girlwhat did you say she demanded girlshe could not believe her ears rhiale very pointedly did not look at her and meiraвђs mouth twisted in a smile awkward because so seldom used caddarвђs sigh filled the clearing tell your wise one to continue doing exactly what she is doing вђ nothing else вђ and i will come to you the forced patience in his tone scraped like a griststone when she had what she wanted from the wetlander she would dress him in gaiвђshainwhite no in black what do you mean you will come caddar silence answered caddar where are you silence caddar the others exchanged uneasy glances is he mad tion said alarys muttered that he must be and belinde angrily demanded to know how long they were to continue this nonsense until i say to stop sevanna said softly staring at the cube a prickle of hope wormed through her chest if he could do this then surely he could deliver what he had promised and maybe she would not hope too much she looked up through the branches that nearly met above the clearing the sun still had a way to climb to its peak if he has not come by midday we will go it was too much to expect they would not grumble so we sit here like stones alarys tossed her head in a practiced way sweeping all of her hair over one shoulder for a wetlander whatever he promised you sevanna rhiale said with a scowl it cannot be worth this he is mad tion growled modarra nodded toward the cube what if he can still hear tion sniffed dismissively and someryn said how should we care if a man hears what we say but i do not relish waiting for him what if he is like those wetlanders in black coats belinde compressed her lips till they nearly matched meiraвђs do not be ridiculous alarys sneered wetlanders kill such men on sight whatever the algaiвђdвђsiswaiclaim that must have been the work of the aes sedai and rand alвђthor that name produced a pained silence but it did not last caddar must have a cube like this one belinde said he must have a woman with the gift to make it work an aes sedai rhiale made a noise of disgust in her throat if there are ten aes sedai with him let them come we will deal with them as they deserve meira laughed a dry sound as narrow as her face i think you almost begin to believe they did kill desaine watch your tongue rhiale snarled yes someryn murmured anxiously careless words might be heard by the wrong ears tionвђs laugh was short and unpleasant the lot of you has less courage than one wetlander which made someryn snap back of course and modarra too and meira spoke words that would have brought a challenge had they not been wise ones and alarys spoke harsher and belinde their squabbling irritated sevanna though it guaranteed they would not conspire against her but that was not why she raised a hand for silence rhiale frowned at her opening her mouth and in that moment they heard what she did something rustled in the dead leaves among the trees no aiel would make so much noise even if any would approach wise ones unbidden and no animal would come so near people this time she rose to her feet with the others two shapes appeared a man and a woman breaking enough branches underfoot to wake a stone just short of the clearing they stopped and the man bent his head slightly to speak to the woman it was caddar in a nearly black coat with lace at his neck and wrists at least he did not wear a sword they seemed to be arguing sevanna should have been able to hear something of their words yet the silence was complete caddar stood nearly a hand taller than modarra вђ tall for a wetlander or even for an aiel вђ and the womanвђs head reached no higher than his chest as dark of face and hair as he and beautiful enough to tighten sevannaвђs mouth she wore bright red silk cut to expose even more of her bosom than someryn showed as if thinking of the woman called her someryn drew close to sevanna the woman has the gift she whispered without taking her eyes from the pair she weaves a barrier pursing her lips she added reluctantly she is strong very strong from her that meant something indeed sevanna had never been able to understand why strength in the power did not count among wise ones вђ while being thankful that it did not for her own sake вђ but someryn prided herself that she had never encountered a woman near as strong as she by her tone sevanna suspected this woman was stronger right then she did not care whether the woman could move mountains or barely light a candle she must be aes sedai she did not have the face yet some sevanna had seen did not that must be how caddar could put his hand on terвђangreal that was how he could find them and come so soon so quickly possibilities unfolded and hope grew but between him and her who commanded stop channeling into that she ordered he might still be able to hear through it rhiale gave her a look that did not stop short of pity someryn already did sevanna nothing could spoil her mood she smiled and said very well remember what i said let me do all of the talking most of the others nodded rhiale sniffed sevanna kept her smile a wise one could not be made gaiвђshain but so many wornout customs had been set aside already that others might follow caddar and the woman started forward and someryn whispered again she still holds the power sit next to me sevanna told her hastily touch my leg if she channels how that galled but she must know she sat folding her legs under and the others joined her leaving a space for caddar and the woman someryn sat close enough that their knees touched sevanna wished she had a chair i see you caddar she said formally in spite of his insult sit you and your woman she wanted to see how the aes sedai reacted but all she did was arch an eyebrow and smile lazily her eyes were as black as his as black as a ravenвђs the other wise ones let a little coldness show had the aes sedai at the wells not allowed rand alвђthor to break free they surely would have killed or captured every one this aes sedai must be aware of that since caddar plainly knew what had happened yet she looked anything but afraid this is maisia caddar said lowering himself to the ground a little short of the space left for him for some reason he did not like to come within armвђs reach perhaps he feared knives i told you to use a single wise one sevanna not seven some men might be suspicious for some reason he seemed amused the woman maisia paused in the act of smoothing her skirts under when he gave her name glaring at him with a fury that should have stripped his hide away perhaps she had thought to keep her identity hidden she said nothing though after a moment she sat beside him her smile returning so suddenly it might never have gone not for the first time sevanna was thankful that wetlanders wore their emotions on their faces you have brought the thing that can control rand alвђthor she did not even glance at the pitcher of water when he was so rude why should she continue the forms she did not remember him being so when they met before perhaps the aes sedai emboldened him caddar gave her a quizzical look why when you do not have him i will she said levelly and he smiled so did maisia when you do then his smile shouted of doubt and disbelief the womanвђs mocked a black robe could be found for her too what i have will control him once he is taken but it cannot overcome him i wonвђt risk him finding out about me until you have him secure he did not appear shamed in the slightest by the admission sevanna forced down a stab of disappointment one hope gone but others remained rhiale and tion folded their hands and stared straight ahead beyond the circle beyond him he was no longer worth listening to of course they did not know everything what of aes sedai can this thing control them rhiale and tion stopped peering beyond the trees belindeвђs eyebrows twitched and meira actually looked at her sevanna could have cursed their lack of selfcontrol caddar was as blind as all wetlanders though he threw back his head and laughed do you mean to say you missed alвђthor but captured aes sedai you grabbed at the eagle and caught a few larks can you provide the same for aes sedai she wanted to grind her teeth surely he had been properly courteous before he shrugged perhaps if the price is right it was dust to him of no moment for that matter maisia showed no concern either strange if she was aes sedai but she must be your tongue tosses bright colors on the wind wetlander tion said in a flat voice what proof of them have you for once sevanna did not mind that she had spoken out of turn caddarвђs face tightened for all the world as if he were a clan chief as if he had heard the insult but in an instant he was all smiles once more as you wish maisia play with the callbox for them someryn shifted her skirts pressing her knuckles against sevannaвђs thigh as the gray cube rose a pace into the air it bounced back and forth as though tossed from hand to hand then tilted and spun on one corner like a top faster and faster until it blurred would you like to see her balance it on her nose caddar asked with a toothy grin tighteyed the dark woman stared straight ahead her smile clearly forced now i think i have demonstratedquite enough caddar she said coldly but the cube вђ the callbox вђ continued whirling sevanna waited a slow count of twenty before saying that is sufficient you may stop now maisia caddar said put it back where it was only then did the cube slowly descend nestling gently on its original spot dark as she was the woman looked pale and furious had she been alone sevanna would have laughed and danced as it was she had difficulty maintaining a smooth face rhiale and the others were too busy staring disdainfully at maisia to notice what worked on one woman with the gift would work on another no need with someryn and modarra perhaps but rhiale and therava she could not appear too eager not when the others knew there were no aes sedai captives of course caddar went on it will take a little time to provide you with what you wish he took on a sly look trying to hide it perhaps another wetlander would not have seen i warn you the price will not be small in spite of herself sevanna leaned forward and the way you traveled here so quickly how much to make her teach us that she managed to keep eagerness from her voice but she was afraid the contempt she felt came through wetlanders would do anything for gold perhaps the man heard it his eyes certainly widened in surprise before he could regain control such as it was he studied his hands and his mouth curled faintly why should his smile seem pleased that is not something she does he said in a voice as smooth as his palms not by herself it is like the callbox i can provide you with several but the price of those is even higher i doubt what youвђve gleaned from cairhien will be enough fortunately you can use the traveling boxes to take your people to richer lands even meira was hardpressed to keep her expression from becoming too avid richer lands and no need to make a way through those fools following rand alвђthor tell me more sevanna said coolly richer lands might be of some interest not enough to make her forget the carвђaвђcarn though caddar would give her everything he had promised before she declared him daвђtsang as well that he seemed to like wearing black there would be no need to give him any gold then the watcher ghosted through the trees making no sound it was wonderful what you could learn with a callbox especially in a world where there seemed to be only two others that red dress was easy to follow and they never looked back even to see whether some of those socalled aiel were trailing them graendal maintained the mask of mirrors that hid her true form but sammael had dropped his goldenbearded again and just head and shoulders taller than she he had let the link between them dissolve too the watcher wondered whether that was wise under the circumstances he had always wondered how much of sammaelвђs vaunted bravery was really stupidity and blindness but the man did hold saidin perhaps he was not completely unaware of his danger the watcher followed and listened they had no idea the true power drawn directly from the great lord could neither be seen nor detected except by who wielded it black flecks floated across his vision there was a price to be sure one that grew with each use but he had always been willing to pay the price when it was necessary being filled with the true power was almost like kneeling beneath shayol ghul basking in the great lordвђs glory the glory was worth the pain of course i had to have you with me sammael growled stumbling over a dead vine he had never really been at home away from the cities you answered a hundred questions for them just being there i can hardly believe that silly girl herself actually suggested what i wanted he barked a laugh perhaps iвђm taвђverenmyself a branch that partially blocked graendalвђs path flexed away until it snapped with a sharp crack for a moment it hung in the air as if she intended to strike her companion that silly girl will cut out your heart and eat it given half a chance the branch flew aside i have a few questions of my own i never thought you would keep your truce with alвђthor any longer than you must but this the watcherвђs eyebrows rose a truce a claim as risky as it was false by all evidence i didnвђt arrange his kidnapping sammael gave her what he probably thought was a wry look his scar made it more a snarl mesaana had a hand in it though maybe demandred and semirhage as well despite how it ended but mesaana certainly perhaps you ought to reconsider what you think the great lord means about leaving alвђthor unharmed graendal considered that so much so that she tripped sammael caught her by the arm keeping her on her feet but as soon as she regained her balance she jerked free interesting even given what had happened back in that clearing graendalвђs real interest was always the most beautiful plucked from among the most powerful but she would have flirted just to pass an hour with a man she intended to kill or one who wanted to kill her the only men she never flirted with were those of the chosen who stood above her for a time she never accepted being the lesser of any pair then why continue with them her voice dripped molten lava although normally she had exquisite control over her emotions alвђthor in mesaanaвђs hands is one thing alвђthor in this savageвђs is something else not that sheвђll have much chance at him if you really intend sending them off to loot travelingboxes what is your game there do they hold captives if you think i will teach them compulsion erase it from your mind one of those women was not negligible i will not risk strength and skill residing together in her or in someone she teaches or do you have a binder hidden away with your other toys for that matter where were you earlier i do not like having to wait sammael stopped glancing behind them the watcher stood very still swathed in fancloth except for his eyes he had no worry that he would be seen over the years he had learned expertise in many areas sammael scorned in some he favored too the gateway opening suddenly slicing away half of a tree made graendal jump the split trunk leaned drunkenly now she also knew sammael held to the source did you think i was telling them the truth sammael said mockingly small increases in chaos are as important as large they will go where i send them do as i wish and learn to be satisfied with what i give them as will you maisia graendal let her illusion fade and stood goldenhaired as he as fair as she had been dark if you call me that again i will kill you her voice held even less expression than her face she meant it the watcher tensed if she tried one of the two would die should he interfere black flecks sped across his eyes faster faster sammael met her stare with one just as hard remember who will be naeвђblis graendal he said and stepped through his gateway for a moment she stood looking at the opening a vertical silver slash appeared off to one side but before her gateway began to align she let go the weave slowly the streak shrinking to a point before winking out the prickling vanished from the watcherвђs skin as she released saidar as well with a fixed face she followed sammael and his gateway closed behind her the watcher smiled crookedly behind his fancloth skulkerвђs mask naeвђblis that explained what had brought graendal to heel what had stayed her from killing sammael even she would be blinded by that an even greater risk for sammael than claiming truce with lews therin though unless of course it was true the great lord delighted in setting his servants one against another to see who was stronger only the strongest could stand near his glory but todayвђs truth need not be tomorrowвђs the watcher had seen truth change a hundred times between a single sunrise and sunset more than once he had changed it himself he considered going back and killing the seven women in the clearing they would die easily he doubted they knew how to form a true circle the black flecks filled his eyes a horizontal blizzard no he would let that run its course for now to his ears the world screamed as he used the true power to rip a small hole and step outside the pattern sammael did not know how truly he spoke small increases in chaos could be every bit as important as large chapter dice swovan night night came slowly over ebou dar the glow of the white buildings resisting darkness small knots and bunches of swovan night revelers with little sprigs of evergreen in their hair danced in the streets beneath a bright threequarter moon few carrying so much as a lantern as they gamboled to the music of flutes and drums and horns that drifted from inns and palaces dancing their way from one set of festivities to another but for the most part the streets lay empty a distant dog barked and another closer answered furiously until it suddenly yelped and fell silent balanced on his toes mat listened eyes searching the moonshadows only a cat moved slinking along the street the slap of running bare feet faded the owner of one pair should be staggering and the other bleeding as he bent his foot kicked a club as long as his arm on the paving stones heavy brass studs shone in the moonlight that would have broken his skull for sure shaking his head he wiped his knife on the ragged coat worn by the man at his feet open eyes stared at the night sky from a dirty creased face a beggar by the look and smell of him mat had not heard of beggars attacking people but maybe times were harder than he thought a large jute sack lay near one outstretched hand the fellows certainly had been optimistic about what they would find in his pockets the thing could have covered him from head to knees to the north above the city light suddenly burst in the sky with a hollow boom as glittering streaks of green expanded in a ball and then another eruption showered red sparkles through die first then a blue and a yellow illuminatorsвђ nightflowers not as spectacular as they would have been in a moonless cloudy sky yet still they took his breath he could watch fireworks till he fell over from hunger nalesean had spoken of an illuminator вђ light was that only this morning вђ but no more nightflowers came when illuminators made the sky bloom as they said they planted more than four flowers plainly someone with coin had made a purchase for swovan night he wished he knew who an illuminator who would sell nightflowers would sell more than that slipping the knife back up his sleeve he gathered his hat from the pavement and walked away hurriedly his boots echoing a sound empty as the street most shuttered windows here showed not a glimmer of light a better place for murder probably could not be found in the city the entire encounter with the three beggars had lasted only a minute or two and had been seen by no one in this city you could find three or four fights in a day if you were not careful but the odds of facing two sets of robbers in one day seemed about as great as the odds of the civil guard refusing a bribe what was happening to his luck if only those bloody dice would stop rolling in his head he did not run but he did not dawdle either one hand on a hilt beneath his coat and an eye open for anyone moving in the shadows he saw nothing but a few clumps of people cavorting along the street though in the common room of the wandering woman the tables had been cleared away except for a few near the walls the flutists and the drummer made shrill music for four laughing lines of people doing what appeared to be half patterndance and half jig watching he copied a step outland merchants in fine woolens leaped right along with locals in brocaded silk vests or those useless coats slung on their shoulders he marked out two of the merchants for the way they moved one slender and one not yet both with a light grace and several local women wearing their best the deep necklines outlined by a little lace or a great deal of embroidery but none in silk not that he would refuse to dance with a woman in silk of course вђ he had never turned down a dance with any woman of any age or station вђ but the rich were in the palaces tonight or the homes of the wealthier merchants and moneylenders those folk near the walls catching their breath for the next dance had their faces buried in mugs often as not or were snatching fresh mugs from trays carried by scurrying serving women mistress anan likely would sell as much wine tonight as in an ordinary week ale too the local folk must have no taste to their tongues trying another step of the dance he caught caira as she tried to hurry by with a tray pitching his voice loud above the music to ask a few questions and finishing with an order for his dinner gilded fish a tangy dish that mistress ananвђs cook prepared to perfection a man needed his strength to keep up in the dance caira flashed a sultry smile at a fellow in a yellow vest who grabbed a mug from her tray and dropped his coin on it but for once she had no smile for mat in fact she managed to compress her mouth to a thin line no small feat your little rabbit am i with a telling sniff she went on impatiently the boy is tucked into his bed where he should be and i donвђt know where lord nalesean is or harnan or master vanin or anybody else and cook said she wonвђt fix anything but soup and bread for those as are drowning their tongues in wine though why my lord wants gilded fish when he has a gilded woman waiting in his room iвђm sure i couldnвђt say if my lord will excuse me some people need to work for their crust she swooped away proffering her tray and smiling fit to split her face at every man in sight mat frowned after her a gilded woman in his room the chest of gold rested now in a small hollow beneath the kitchen floor in front of one of the stoves but the dice in his head drummed like thunder suddenly the sounds of merriment faded a little as he slowly climbed the stairs in front of his door he paused listening to the dice two attempts to rob him so far today twice his skull could have been broken he was sure that darkfriend had not seen him and no one could call her gilded but he fingered a hilt under his coat then took his hand away as a woman flared in his thoughts a tall woman falling with the hilt of a knife protruding between her breasts his knife luck would just have to be with him sighing he pushed open the door the hunter that elayne had made her warder turned hefting his unstrung two rivers bow her golden braid drawn over her shoulder her blue eyes fastened on him purposefully and her face fixed itself in determination she looked ready to drub him with the bow if she did not get what she wanted if this is about olver he began and suddenly a twist of memory unfolded a mist thinned over one day one hour in his life there was no hope with seanchan to the west and whitecloaks to the east no hope and only one chance so he raised the curled horn and blew not really knowing what to expect the sound came golden as the horn so sweet he did not know whether to laugh or cry it echoed and the earth and heavens seemed to sing while that one pure note hung in the air a fog began to rise appearing from nowhere thin wisps thickening billowing higher until all was obscured as if clouds covered the land and down the clouds they rode as though down a mountainside the dead heroes of legend bound to be called back by the horn of valere artur hawkwing himself led tall and hooknosed and behind came the rest little more than a hundred so few but all those the wheel would spin out again and again to guide the pattern to make legend and myth mikel of the pure heart and shivan the hunter behind his black mask he was said to herald the end of ages the destruction of what had been and the birth of what was to be he and his sister calian called the chooser who rode redmasked at his side amaresu with the sword of the sun glowing in her hands and paedrig the goldentongued peacemaker and there carrying the silver bow with which she never missed he pushed the door shut trying to lean against it he felt dizzy dazed you are she birgitte for true burn my bones to ash itвђs impossible how how the woman of legend gave a resigned sigh and propped his bow back in the corner next to his spear i was ripped out untimely hornsounder cast out by moghedien to die and saved by elayneвђs bonding she spoke slowly studying him as if to be sure he understood i feared you might remember who i used to be still feeling hit between the eyes he flung himself scowling into the armchair beside his table who she used to be indeed fists on hips she confronted him challengingly no whit different from the birgitte he had seen ride out of the sky even her clothes were the same though this short coat was red and the wide trousers yellow elayne and nynaeve know and kept it from me true i weary of secrets birgitte and they harbor secrets as a grain barn harbors rats theyвђve become aes sedai eyes and hearts even nynaeve is twice a stranger now you have your own secrets folding her arms under her breasts she sat on the foot of his bed the way she looked at him you would have thought he was a tavern puzzle for one youвђve not told them you blew the horn of valere the smallest of your secrets from them i think mat blinked he had assumed they had told her after all she was birgitte what secrets do i have those women know my toenails and dreams she was birgitte of course he leaned forward make them see reason youвђre birgitte silverbow you can make them do as you say this city has a pittrap at every crossing and i fear the stakes grow sharper by the day make them come away before itвђs too late she laughed put a hand over her mouth and laughed you have the wrong end hornsounder i do not command them i am elayneвђs warder i obey her smile became rueful birgitte silverbow faith of the light iвђm not sure i still am that woman so much of what i was and knew has faded like mist beneath the summer sun since my strange new birth iвђm no hero now only another woman to make my way and as for your secrets what language do we speak hornsounder he opened his mouth and stopped really hearing what she had just asked nosane iro gavane domorakoshi diynenвђdвђmaвђpurvenespeak we what language sounder of the horn the hair on his neck tried to stand the old blood he said carefully not in the old tongue an aes sedai once told me the old blood runs strong in вђ what are you bloody well laughing at now you mat she managed while trying not to double over at least she was not speaking the old tongue any more either she knuckled a tear from the corner of her eye some people speak a few words a phrase or two because of the old blood usually without understanding what they say or not quite but you one sentence youвђre an eharoni high prince and the next a first lord of manetheren accent and idiom perfect no donвђt worry your secret is safe with me she hesitated is mine with you he waved a hand still too flabbergasted to be offended do i look like my tongue flaps he muttered birgitte in the flesh burn me i could use a drink before that was out of his mouth he knew it was the wrong thing to say women never вђ that sounds the right notion to me she said i could use a pitcher of wine myself blood and ashes when i saw youвђd recognized me i nearly swallowed my tongue he sat up straight as if he had been jerked staring she met his gaze with a merry twinkle and a grin thereвђs enough noise in the common room we could talk without being overheard besides i wouldnвђt mind sitting and looking a bit elayne preaches like a tovan councilor if i ogle a man for longer than a heartbeat he nodded before he thought other menвђs memories told him tovans were a stark and disapproving people abstemious to the point of pain at least they had been a thousand years gone and more he was not sure whether to laugh or groan on the one hand a chance to talk with birgitte вђ birgitte he doubted he would ever get over the shock вђ but on the other he doubted he would be able to hear the music downstairs for the noise of those dice rattling in his skull she must be a key to it somehow a man with any brains would climb out the window right now a pitcher or two sounds fine to me he told her a stiff salt breeze up from the bay carried a touch of coolness for a wonder but the night felt oppressive to nynaeve music and snatches of laughter drifted into the palace and faintly from within as well she had been invited to the ball by tylin herself and elayne and aviendha too but all declined with varying degrees of politeness aviendha had said there was only one dance she was willing to do with wetlander men which made tylin blink uncertainly for herself nynaeve would have liked to go вђ only a fool passed up any chance to dance вђ yet she knew if she had she would have done exactly what she was doing sat somewhere worrying and trying not to chew her knuckle to a nub so there they all were closeted in their apartments with thom and juilin anxious as caged cats while everyone else in ebou dar made merry well she was anyway what could be keeping birgitte how long did it take to tell a man to present himself first thing in the morning light the whole effort was useless and it was long past time for bed long past if she could only sleep she could put away memories of the morningвђs horrible journeys by boat worst of all her weather sense told her a storm was on the way told her the wind should be howling outside and the rain sheeting down so thick no one could see ten feet it had taken her some time to understand about the times she listened to the wind and seemed to hear lies at least she thought she understood another kind of storm was coming not wind or rain she had no proof but she would eat her slippers if mat cauthon was not part of it somehow she wanted to sleep for a month a year to forget worries until lan wakened her with a kiss like the sun king with talia which was ridiculous of course that was only a story and a very improper one at that and anyway she was not about to become any manвђs pet not even lanвђs she would find him though somehow and bond him hers she would light if she had not thought the others would stare at her she would have paced the soles out of her slippers the hours wore on she read and reread the short letter mat had left with tylin aviendha sat quietly beside her highbacked chair crosslegged on the pale green floor tiles as usual an ornately gilded leatherbound copy of the travels of jain farstrideropen on her knees no anxiety there not to see but then the woman would not turn a hair if someone stuffed a viper down her dress since returning to the palace she had donned the intricate silver necklace she wore nearly day and night except on the boat trip she had said she did not want to risk it then idly nynaeve wondered why she no longer wore her ivory bracelet there had been an overheard conversation something about not wearing it until elayne had its like which made little sense and mattered as little as the bracelet of course the letter called from her lap the sittingroom standlamps made reading easy though matвђs unformed boyish hand did present difficulties it was the contents that clenched nynaeveвђs middle into knots thereвђs nothing here but heat and flies and we can find plenty of those in caemlyn are you sure you didnвђt tell him anything she demanded across the room juilin paused with his hand over the stones board giving her a look of outraged innocence how often must i say so outraged innocence was one of the things men did best especially when they were guilty as foxes in the henyard interesting that the carving around the boardвђs rim was of foxes thom seated across the lapisinlaid table from the thiefcatcher looked as little the gleeman in his finely cut coat of bronze wool as he did the man who had once been queen morgaseвђs lover gnarled and whitehaired with long mustaches and thick eyebrows he was frustrated patience from his sharp blue eyes to his boot soles i canвђt see how we could have nynaeve he said dryly given that you told us next to nothing until tonight you should have sent juilin and me nynaeve sniffed loudly as if those two had not been running around like chickens with their heads off ever since they arrived prying into her and elayneвђs affairs on matвђs sayso those three could not be together two minutes without gossiping either men never could they the truth of it was she admitted reluctantly using the men had never occurred to them youвђd have gone off carousing and drinking with him she muttered donвђt tell me you would not that must be where mat was leaving birgitte to cool her feet at the inn that man would find some way to set the whole scheme awry and what if they had leaning beside one of the tall arched windows peering out at the night through the whitepainted iron balcony elayne giggled she was tapping her foot though how she could make out one tune from all those floating in the darkness was a wonder it is a night for carousing nynaeve frowned at her back elayne had been increasingly peculiar all night if she had not known better she would have suspected the other woman had been sneaking out to snatch sips of wine gulps of it actually even if elayne had not been under her eye though that was impossible each of them had had a rather unfortunate experience with too much wine and neither had again let herself have more than a single cup at a time it is jaichim carridin who interests me aviendha said closing the book and setting it beside her she refused to consider how odd she looked sitting on the floor in a blue silk dress among us shadowrunners are killed as soon as found and not clan sept society or firstsister will raise a hand in protest if jaichim carridin is a shadowrunner why does tylin mitsobar not kill him why do we not matters are a little more complex here nynaeve told her though she had wondered the same not why carridin was not killed of course but why he was still allowed to come and go as he wished she had seen him in the palace that very day after she had been handed matвђs letter after she had told tylin what it contained he had spoken with tylin above an hour and departed with as much honor as when he arrived she had meant to discuss it with elayne but the question of what mat knew and how kept intruding that man would make trouble he would somehow this business was going to go wrong no matter what anyone said bad weather was coming thom cleared his throat tylin is a weak queen and carridin the ambassador of a power placing a stone he kept his eyes on the board he sounded as though he was thinking aloud by definition a whitecloak inquisitor cannot be a darkfriend at least thatвђs how it is defined in the fortress of the light if she arrests him or even charges him sheвђll find a whitecloak legion in ebou dar before she can blink they might leave her the throne but sheвђd be a puppet from then on strings pulled from the dome of truth arenвђt you ready to concede yet juilin the thiefcatcher glared at him then bent to a furious study of the board i did not think her a coward aviendha said disgustedly and thom gave her an amused smile you have never faced something you could not fight child he said gently something so strong your only choice is to flee or be consumed alive try to hold judgment on tylin till you have for some reason aviendhaвђs face reddened normally she hid her emotions so well her face was like stone i know elayne said suddenly weвђll find proof even pedron niall must accept she skipped back into the room no she danced we will disguise ourselves and follow him suddenly it was no longer elayne standing there in a green ebou dari gown but a domani woman in thin clinging blue nynaeve leaped up before she could stop and her mouth tightened with exasperation at herself just because she could not see the weaves at the moment was no reason to be startled by illusion she darted a glance at thom and juilin even thomвђs mouth hung open unconsciously she took a firm grip on her braid elayne was going to reveal everything what was the matter with her illusion worked best the closer you stayed to what was there before in shape and size at least so bits of the ebou dari dress flashed through the domani garment as elayne whirled to examine herself in one of the roomвђs two large mirrors she laughed and clapped her hands oh he will never recognize me or you nearsister abruptly a taraboner woman sat beside nynaeveвђs chair with brown eyes and yellow braids strung with red beads just the shade of her snugfitting dress of folded silk she watched elayne quizzically nynaeveвђs hand tightened on her braid and we canвђt forget you elayne babbled on i know justthe thing this time nynaeve saw the glow around elayne she was furious seeing the flows being woven about herself did not tell her what image elayne gave her of course it took looking into one of the mirrors to do that a sea folk woman stared back at her aghast with a dozen begemmed rings in her ears and twice as many golden medallions dangling from the chain running to her nose ring aside from the jewelry she wore wide trousers of brocaded green silk and not a stitch else the way women of the athaвђan miere did out of sight of land it was just illusion she was still decently clothed under the weaving but beside her reflection she saw those of thom and juilin both fighting grins a strangled squawk erupted from her throat close your eyes she shouted at the men and began leaping about waving her arms anything to make her dress show through close them burn you oh they had bristling with indignation she stopped capering they were not fighting those grins anymore though for that matter aviendha was laughing quite openly rocking to and fro nynaeve gave her skirts a jerk вђ in the mirror the sea folk woman seemed to pluck at her trousers вђ and fixed elayne with a glare stop this elayne the domani woman stared back mouth open and eyes wide with incredulity only then did nynaeve realize how angry she was the true source beckoned from just beyond the edge of sight embracing saidarshe slammed a shield between elayne and the source or rather she tried to shielding someone who already held the power was not easy even when you were the stronger once as a girl she had swung master luhhanвђs hammer against his anvil as hard as she could and the shiver of it ran all the way to her toes this was about twice that love of the light elayne are you drunk the glow around the domani woman faded away and so did the domani woman nynaeve knew the weave was gone from around herself but she still glanced at the mirror and drew a relieved breath to see nynaeve alвђmeara there in yellowslashed blue no elayne said slowly color burned in her face but it was not embarrassment or not entirely her chin rose and her voice frosted iam not the door to the corridor banged open and birgitte staggered in with a broad smile well perhaps she did not quite stagger but she was decidedly unsteady i did not expect you all to remain awake for me she said brightly well youвђll be interested to hear what i have to say but first with the too steady steps of someone carrying considerable drink inside she vanished into her room thom stared at her door with a bemused grin juilin with an incredulous one they knew who she was the truth of it elayne just glared down her nose from birgitteвђs bedchamber came a splashing as if a pitcher had been upended on the floor nynaeve exchanged puzzled looks with aviendha birgitte reappeared with her face and hair dripping and her coat soaked from shoulders to elbows now my wits are clearer she said settling into one of the ballfooted chairs with a sigh that young man has a hollow leg and a hole in the bottom of his foot he even outdrank beslan and i was beginning to think wine was water to that lad beslan nynaeve said her voice rising tylinвђs son what was he doing there why did you allow it birgitte elayne exclaimed mat cauthon will corrupt the boy and his mother will blame us the boyis the same age as you thom told her in stuffy tones a baffled look passed between nynaeve and elayne what was his point everyone knew that a man did not achieve his proper wits such as they were until ten years later than a woman the puzzlement faded from elayneвђs face replaced by firmness and no little anger as she focused on birgitte again words were going to be said words both women might regret tomorrow if you and juilin will leave us now thom nynaeve said quickly it was extremely unlikely they would see the need on their own you need your sleep to be fresh first thing in the morning they sat there gaping at her like belled fools so she made her tone firmer now this game was done twenty stones ago thom said glancing at the board what do you say we go down to our own room and start another iвђll spot you ten stones to place as you will any time during the game ten stones juilin yelped scraping back his chair will you offer me fish broth and milkbread as well they argued all the way out but at the door each of them glanced back in sullen resentment she would not put it past them to remain awake all night just because she had sent them to bed mat wonвђt corrupt beslan birgitte said dryly as the door closed behind the men i doubt nine feather dancers with a shipload of brandy could corrupt him they wouldnвђt know where to begin nynaeve was relieved to hear it though something was odd about the womanвђs tone вђ likely the drink вђ but beslan was not at all the issue she said so and elayne added no he isnвђt you got drunk birgitte and ifelt it i stillfeel tipsy if i donвђt concentrate the bond is notsupposed to work that way aes sedai donвђt fall over giggling if their warders drink too much nynaeve threw up her hands donвђt look at me that way birgitte said you know more than i do aes sedai and warders have always been men and women before maybe thatвђs the difference maybe we are too alike her grin was skewed slightly there had not been near enough water in that pitcher that might be embarrassing i suppose if we could stay with what is important nynaeve said tightly such as mat elayne had her mourn open for a retort to birgitte but she closed it quickly the red spots in her cheeks most definitely chagrin this time now nynaeve went on will mat be here in the morning or is he in the same revolting state as you he might come birgitte said taking a cup of mint tea from aviendha who of course sat down on the floor elayne frowned at her a moment then of all things folded up her legs and sat beside her what do you mean he might nynaeve demanded she channeled and the chair she had been sitting in floated over to her and if it banged to the floor she meant it to drinking too much sitting on the floor what was next if he expects us to come to him on hands and knees birgitte took a sip of the tea with a grateful murmur and oddly when she looked at nynaeve again she did not seem so intoxicated i talked him out of that i donвђt think he was really serious all he wants now is an apology and thanks nynaeveвђs eyes popped she had talked him outof that apologize to matrim cauthon never she growled for what elayne wanted to know as if that mattered she pretended not to see nynaeveвђs glare the stone of tear birgitte said and nynaeveвђs head whipped around the woman no longer sounded intoxicated at all he says he went into the stone him and juilin to free the pair of you from a dungeon you couldnвђt escape on your own she shook her head slowly in wonder i donвђt know that i would have done that for anyone short of gaidal not the stone he says you gave him a backhanded thanks and made him feel he ought to be grateful you didnвђt kick him it was true in a way but all distorted there mat had been with that mocking grin of his saying he was there to pull their chestnuts off the fire or some such even then he had thought he could tell them what to do only one of the black sisters was on guard in the dungeon nynaeve muttered and we had taken care of her true they hadnвђt yet been able to figure out how to open the door shielded beвђlal wasnвђt really interested in us anyway вђ it was just to lure rand moiraine may already have killed him by then for all we know the black ajah birgitteвђs voice was flatter than the floor tiles and one of the forsaken mat never mentioned them you owe him thanks on your knees elayne both of you do the man deserves it and juilin as well blood rushed to nynaeveвђs face he had never mentioned that despicable despicable man i will not apologize to matrim cauthon not on my deathbed aviendha leaned toward elayne touching her knee nearsister i will say this delicately she looked and sounded about as delicate as a stone post if this is true you have tohtoward mat cauthon you and nynaeve and you have made it worse since just by the actions i have seen toh nynaeve exclaimed those two were always talking about this tohfoolery we arenвђt aiel aviendha and mat cauthon is a thorn in the foot to everybody he meets but elayne was nodding i see you are right aviendha but what must we do you will have to help me nearsister i donвђt intend to try to become aiel but i i want you to be proud of me we will notapologize nynaeve snapped i have pride in knowing you aviendha said touching elayneвђs cheek lightly an apology is a beginning yet not enough to meet toh now are you listening to me nynaeve demanded i said i will вђ not вђ apologize they went right on talking only birgitte looked at her and the woman wore a smile not far from outright laughter nynaeve throttled her braid with both hands she had known that they should have sent thom and juilin chapter flame of tar valon small sacrifices squinting up at the sign above the innвђs arched door a crudely drawn woman with a walking staff peering hopefully into the distance elayne wished she were back in her bed instead of up with the sun not that she could have slept mol hara square stood empty behind her except for a few creaking ox and donkeycarts on their way to the markets a scattering of women balancing huge baskets on their heads a onelegged beggar sat with his bowl at a corner of the inn the first of many who would dot the square later she had already given him a silver mark enough to feed him for a week even now but he tucked it under his ragged coat with a toothless grin and waited on the sky was still gray yet the day already promised to scorch keeping concentration well enough to ignore the heat was a problem this morning the last remnants of birgitteвђs morningafter head remained in the back of her own dwindling but not yet gone if only her small ability with healing had not proved too small she hoped aviendha and birgitte would manage to learn something useful about carridin this morning in their illusion disguises not that carridin would know any of them from a shoemaker of course but it was best to be careful she felt pride that aviendha had not asked to come along here had in fact been surprised at the suggestion aviendha did not believe she needed anyone to watch her to make sure she did what was needful with a sigh she straightened her dress though there was no need blue and cream with a bit of creamcolored vandalra lace the garment did make her feel just a touch exposed the only time she had balked at donning a local fashion was while she and nynaeve traveled to tanchico with the sea folk but in its own way ebou dari fashion was almost she sighed again she was just trying to delay aviendha should have come to lead her by the hand i will not apologize nynaeve said suddenly at her shoulder she clutched her own gray skirts with both hands staring at the wandering woman as though moghedien herself waited inside i wonвђt you should have worn white after all elayne murmured earning a suspicious sideways glance after a moment she added you did say it was the color for funerals which produced a satisfied nod though it was not what she had meant at all this wouldbe disaster if they could not keep peace among themselves birgitte had had to settle for an infusion of herbs this morning and a particularly bitter mix at that because nynaeve claimed she was not angry enough to channel she had gone on in the most dramatic manner about funeral white being the only suitable color insisted she was not coming until elayne dragged her out of their apartments and announced at least twenty times since that she would not apologize peace had to be kept but you agreed to this nynaeve no i donвђt want to hear any more about the rest of us bullying you you agreed so stop sulking nynaeve spluttered eyes going wide with outrage she was not to be diverted though despite one fiercely incredulous sulkingunder her breath we need to discuss this further elayne there is no need to be so hasty there must be a thousand reasons why this wonвђt work taвђverenor no taвђveren and mat cauthon is nine hundred of them elayne gave her a level look did you deliberately choose the bitterest herbs that would work this morning wideeyed outrage turned to wideeyed innocence but red stained nynaeveвђs cheeks elayne pushed open the door nynaeve followed muttering elayne would not have been surprised if she stuck out her tongue too sulky was not even in it this morning the smell of breads baking wafted from the kitchens and all the shutters were open to air out the common room a plumpcheeked serving woman standing atop a tall stool stretched on tiptoes to take down bedraggled evergreen branches from above the windows while others replaced tables and benches and chairs that must have been taken away for the dancing this early no one else was about except for a skinny girl in a white apron sweeping halfheartedly with a brushbroom she might have been pretty if her mouth had not seemed set in a constant pout there was surprisingly little mess considering that inns were supposed to be riotous even licentious during festivals a part of her wished she could have seen it though could you direct me to master cauthonвђs rooms she asked the skinny girl with a smile proffering two silver pennies nynaeve sniffed shewas tight as the skin on a fresh apple she had given the beggar one copper the girl eyed them sullenly вђ and surprisingly the coins as well вђ and mumbled something sour that sounded like a gilded woman last night and ladies this morning she gave directions grudgingly for a moment elayne thought she intended to scorn the pennies but on the point of turning away the girl snatched the silver from her hand without so much as a word of thanks pausing only to tuck them into the neck of her dress of all places before she set to swinging her broom as if to beat the floor to death perhaps she had a pocket sewn in there you see nynaeve grumbled under her breath you mark me he tried to push his attentions on that young woman thatвђs the sort of man you want me to apologize to elayne said nothing only led the way up the railless steps at the back of the room if nynaeve did not stop complaining the first hallway on the right the girl had said and the last door on the left but in front of it she hesitated biting her lower lip nynaeve brightened you see itвђs a bad idea now donвђt you we arenвђt aiel elayne i like the girl well enough for all sheвђs forever fondling that knife of hers but just think of the absolute drivel she talked itвђs impossible you must know it is we did not agree to anything impossible nynaeve keeping her voice firm took an effort some of what aviendha had suggested apparently in all seriousness she actually had suggested letting the man switch them what we did agree to is quite possible barely she rapped loudly on the paneled door with her knuckles there was a fish carved on the door a round thing with stripes and a snout all of the doors had different carvings most of fish there was no answer nynaeve puffed out a breath she must have been holding perhaps he has gone out weвђll just have to come back another time at this hour she rapped once more you say he always lies abed when he can still no sound from inside elayne if birgitte is any indication mat got himself juicy as a fiddler last night he wonвђt thank us for waking him why donвђt we just go away and вђ elayne lifted the latch and went in nynaeve followed with a sigh that could have been heard back in the palace mat cauthon was sprawled on his bed atop the knitted red coverlet a folded cloth lying over his eyes and dripping onto the pillow the room was not very tidy despite the absence of dust a boot stood on the washstand вђ the washstand вђ next to a white basin full of unused water the standmirror sat askew as if he had stumbled into it and simply left it tilted back sharply and his wrinkled coat lay tossed across a ladderback chair he wore everything else including that black scarf he seemed never to take off and the other boot the silver foxhead dangled from his unlaced shirt the medallion made her fingers itch if he really was lying there sodden with drink she might be able to remove it unfelt one way or another she intended to find out how the thing absorbed the power finding out how almost anything worked was a fascination to her but that foxhead was all the puzzles in the world rolled into one nynaeve caught her sleeve and jerked her head toward the door silently mouthing asleep and something else she could not make out probably another plea to go leave me alone nerim he mumbled suddenly i told you before i donвђt want anything but a new skull and close the door softly or iвђll pin your ears to it nynaeve jumped and tried to pull her toward the door but she stood her ground it is not nerim master cauthon raising his head from the pillow he used both hands to lift the cloth a trifle and squinted at them with reddened eyes grinning nynaeve made no effort at all to hide her pleasure at his wretched state what elayne could not understand at first was why she wanted to grin too her one experience with drinking too much had left her with nothing but pity and sympathy for anyone so snared in the back of her mind she felt birgitteвђs head throbbing still and it came to her certainly she could not like birgitte drowning herself in drink whatever the reason but neither could she like the thought that anyone could do anything at all better than her first warder a ridiculous thought embarrassing but satisfying too what are you doing here he demanded hoarsely then winced and lowered his voice itвђs the middle of the night itвђs morning nynaeve said sharply donвђt you remember talking with birgitte could you not be so loud he whispered closing his eyes the next instant they popped open again birgitte sitting up abruptly he swung his legs over the side of the bed for a time he just sat there peering at the floorboards elbows on his knees and the medallion swinging from its thong around his neck at last he turned his head to look at them balefully or perhaps his eyes just made it seem so what did she tell you she informed us of your demands master cauthon elayne said formally this must be how it felt to stand before the headsmanвђs block there was nothing for it but to keep her head high and face whatever came proudly i wish to thank you from my heart for rescuing me from the stone of tear there she had begun and it had not hurt not very much nynaeve stood there glowering her lips growing tighter and tighter the woman was notgoing to leave her to do this alone elayne embraced the source almost before she thought and channeled a thin flow of air that flicked nynaeveвђs earlobe like a snapping finger the woman clapped a hand to her ear and glowered but elayne simply turned coolly back to master cauthon and waited i thank you too nynaeve mumbled sullenly at last from the heart elayne rolled her eyes in spite of herself well he had asked them to speak more softly and he did seem to hear strangely he shrugged with embarrassment oh that it was nothing likely thing youвђd have gotten yourself free in another tick without me his head sank to his hands and he pressed the damp cloth to his eyes once more on your way out would you ask caira to bring me some winepunch a slender girl pretty with a warm eye elayne quivered nothingthe man demandedan apology she humbledherself to give it and now it was nothing he was not deserving of sympathy or pity she still held saidar and she considered thumping him with a much thicker flow than she had used on nynaeve not that that would do any good so long as he wore the foxhead then again it hung loose not touching him did it offer the same protection when it was not nynaeve ended her speculation by lunging for him fingers clawed elayne managed to put herself between them and seize the other woman by the shoulders for a stretched moment they stood nosetonose except for the difference in their heights with a grimace nynaeve finally relaxed and elayne felt it was safe to release her the man still had his head bowed all unaware whether the medallion protected him or not she could snatch his bowstave from the corner and beat him till he howled she felt heat rise in her face she had stopped nynaeve from ruining everything only to think of ruining it herself worse by the smirky selfsatisfied little smile the other woman gave her she knew very well what had been in her head there is more master cauthon she announced squaring her shoulders the smile vanished from nynaeveвђs face we also wish to apologize for delaying so long in giving you your much deserved thanks and we apologize humbly she stumbled a little on that for the way we have treated you since nynaeve stretched out a beseeching hand that she ignored to show the depth of our regret we undertake the following promises aviendha had said an apology was only a beginning we will not belittle or demean you in any way nor shout at you for any reason nor nor attempt to give you orders nynaeve winced elayneвђs mouth tightened too but she did not stop recognizing your due concern for our safety we will not leave the palace without telling you where we are going and we will listen to your advice light she had no wish to be aiel no wish to do any of this but she wanted aviendhaвђs respect if you if you decide that we are not that she had any intention of becoming a sisterwife вђ the very ideawas indecent вђ but she did like her are putting ourselves in needless danger it was not aviendhaвђs fault that rand had caught both their hearts and minвђs as well we will accept bodyguards of your choosing fate or taвђverenor whatever what was was she loved both women like sisters and keep them with us as long as possible burnthe man for doing this to her it was not mat cauthon she meant this i swear by the lion throne of andor she breathed in as if she had run a mile nynaeve wore a face like a cornered badger his head swiveled toward them ever so slowly and he lowered the cloth just enough to expose one redstreaked eye you sound like you have an iron rod down your throat my lady he said mockingly you have my permission to call me mat odious man he would not know civility if it bit him on the nose that sanguine eye slanted toward her what about you nynaeve i heard a lot of вђweвђ from her but not a word from you i wonвђt shout at you nynaeve shouted and all the rest too i promise you you she gobbled on the edge of swallowing her tongue as she realized she could not call him one of the names he warranted without breaking the promise already and yet the effect of her shout was most gratifying with a cry he shuddered and dropped the cloth clutched his head with both hands his eyes bulged flaming dice he whimpered or something very like it suddenly struck elayne that he would be a very good source of pithy language stablemen and the like always seemed to scrape their tongues clean the moment they saw her of course she had promised herself to civilize him to make him useful to rand but that need not interfere too much with his language in fact she realized there was a good deal she had notpromised not to do pointing that out should settle nynaeve considerably after a long moment he spoke in a hollow voice thank you nynaeve he paused to swallow hard i thought you two must be somebody else in disguise there for a bit since i still seem to be alive we might as well take care of the rest of it i seem to recall that birgitte said you wanted me to find something for you what you wonвђt find it nynaeve told him in a firm voice well perhaps more hard than firm but elayne did not think of calling her down he merited every wince you will accompany us and we will find it backtracking already nynaeve somehow he managed a derisive sneer especially hideous with his eyes you just finished promising to do as i say if you want a tame taвђverenon a leash go ask rand or perrin and see what answer you get we promised no such thing matrim cauthon nynaeve snapped going up on her toes i promised no such thing she looked about to fling herself at him again even her braid seemed to bristle elayne kept a better rein on her temper they would get nowhere bludgeoning him we will listento your advice and accept it if it is reasonable master mat she chided gently surely he could not really believe they had promised to looking at him though she saw that he did oh light nynaeve was right he wasgoing to be trouble she held that rein firmly channeling again she lifted his coat from the chair to a proper place on one of the pegs on the wall so she could sit back straight arranging her skirts carefully keeping her promises to master cauthon вђ mat вђ and to herself was going to be difficult but nothing he said or did could touch her nynaeve eyed the only other place to sit a low carved wooden footstool and remained standing one hand moved toward her braid before she folded her arms her foot tapped ominously the athaвђan miere call it the bowl of the winds master mat it is a terвђangreal by the end a light of excitement shone through his sickliness now that would be a thing to find he murmured in the rahad he shook his head and flinched iвђll tell you this now neither of you is setting foot on the other side of the river without four or five of my redarms each not outside the palace for that matter did birgitte tell you about the note that was stuffed in my coat iвђm sure i told her and thereвђs carridin and his darkfriends you canвђt tell me he isnвђt up to something any sister who supports egwene as amyrlin is in danger from the tower bodyguards everywhere light a dangerous light shone in nynaeveвђs eyes and her foot tapped faster we cannot hide mast mat and we will not jaichim carridin will be taken care of in due course they had not promised to tell him everything and they could not let him be diverted there are more important matters afoot due course he began voice rising in disbelief but nynaeve cut him short four or five each she said sourly thatвђs ridicвђ her eyes shut for a moment and her tone became milder slightly milder i mean to say it isnвђt sensible elayne and me birgitte and aviendha you donвђt have that many soldiers anyway all we really need is you that last came out as though dragged it was much too much an admission birgitte and aviendha donвђt need minders he said absently i suppose this bowl of the winds is more important than carridin but it doesnвђt seem right letting darkfriends walk loose slowly nynaeveвђs face turned purple elayne checked her own in the standmirror relieved to see she was maintaining her composure on the outside anyway the man was reprehensible minders she was not sure which would be worse that he had flung that offhand insult on purpose or that he had done so without realizing she eyed herself in the mirror again and lowered her chin a trifle minders she was poise itself he studied them with those bloodshot eyes but saw nothing apparently was that all birgitte told you he asked and nynaeve snapped back that was quite enough iвђd think even for you inexplicably he looked surprised and quite pleased nynaeve gave a start then folded her arms around herself tighter since youвђre in no condition to go anywhere with us now вђ donвђt scowl at me mat cauthon that isnвђt demeaning itвђs simple truth вђ you can spend the morning moving yourself into the palace and you neednвђt think weвђll help carry your things i didnвђt promise to be a packhorse the wandering woman is plenty good enough he began angrily then stopped a wondering expression spreading over his face a horrified expression elayne would have said that should teach him to growl when he had a head like a melon at least that was what hers had felt like the time she drank too much of course he would not learn from it men kept sticking their hands in the fire thinking this time it would not burn so lini always said you can hardly expect weвђll find the bowl the first time we try nynaeve went on taвђverenor no going out each day will be much simpler if you donвђt have to come across the square if they did not have to wait for him every morning was what she meant according to her drunkenness was not the only excuse he could find for lying in bed till all hours far from it besides elayne added that way you can keep an eye on us nynaeve made a sound in her throat very close to a groan did she not see that he must be enticed it was not as if she had promised to actually allow him to keep an eye on them he seemed not to have heard her or nynaeve haggard eyes stared right through her why did they bloody well have to stop now he moaned so softly she barely heard what under the light did he mean by that the rooms are fit for a king master mat tylin herself chose them just down from her own she has taken a very personal interest mat you wouldnвђt have us offend the queen would you one look at his face and elayne hurriedly channeled to push open the window and empty the washbasin through it if she had ever seen a man about to lose the contents of his stomach he was staring redeyed at her right that minute i donвђt see why youвђre making such a fuss she said actually she supposed she did some of the serving women here probably let him paw them but she doubted many in the palace would if any he would not be able to drink and gamble his nights away either tylin surely would not allow a bad example for beslan we all must make sacrifices with an effort she stopped there not telling him that his was small and only right theirs monstrous and unjust no matter what aviendha said nynaeve had certainly railed against anysacrifice he put his head in his hands again making strangled noises while his shoulders shook he was laughing she hefted the basin on a flow of air considering hitting him with it when he raised his eyes again though he looked outraged for some reason sacrifices he snarled if i asked you to make the same youвђd box every ear in sight and pull the roof down on my head could he still be drunk she decided to ignore his frightful glare speaking of your head if you would like healing iвђm sure nynaeve would oblige if she had ever been angry enough to channel she was now nynaeve gave a small jerk and glanced at her from the corner of one eye of course she said hurriedly if you want the color in her cheeks confirmed all of elayneвђs suspicions about that morning gracious as ever he sneered you just forget my head i do very well without aes sedai and then just to confuse matters she was sure he added in a hesitant voice i thank you for asking though almost as if he meant it elayne managed not to gape her knowledge of men was limited to rand and what lini and her mother had told her was rand going to be as confusing as mat cauthon last thing before going she remembered to secure a promise that he would start moving to the palace immediately he kept his word once given so nynaeve had made clear however reluctantly but leave one crack and he could find a hundred ways to slip through thatshe had been all too eager to emphasize he gave his promise with a bleak resentful grimace or maybe that was just his eyes again when she set the basin down at his feet he actually looked grateful she would not feel sympathy she would not once back in the corridor with the door to matвђs room closed nynaeve shook her fist at the ceiling that man could try the patience of a stone iвђm glad he wants to cuddle with his head do you hear me glad he will make trouble he will you two will make more trouble for him than he ever could the speaker stalked down the hall toward them a woman with a touch of gray in her hair a strong face and a commanding voice she also wore a frown little short of a scowl despite the marriage knife hanging into her cleavage she was too fair for an ebou dari i couldnвђt believe it when caira told me i doubt iвђve ever seen so much foolishness poured into just two dresses elayne eyed the woman up and down not even as a novice had she gotten used to being addressed in that tone and who might you be my good woman i might be and am setalle anan the owner of this inn child was the dry reply and with that the woman flung open a door across the hallway seized them each by an arm and hustled them through so fast elayne thought her slippers had left the floor you seem under some misapprehension mistress anan she said coolly as the woman released them to shut the door nynaeve was in no mood for niceties holding her hand so her great serpent ring was plain she said heatedly now you look here вђ very pretty the woman said and pushed each of them so hard they found themselves sitting sidebyside on the bed elayneвђs eyes popped in disbelief this anan woman confronted them grimfaced fists on her hips for all the world like a mother about to castigate her daughters flaunting that just shows how silly you are that young man will dandle you on his knee вђ one on each i shouldnвђt wonder if you allow вђ heвђll take a few kisses and as much else as youвђre willing to give but he wonвђt harm you you can harm him though if you keep on with this harmhim the woman thought they вђ she thought he had dandledвђ she thought вђ elayne did not know whether to laugh or cry but she stood up straightening her skirts as i said mistress anan you are under a misapprehension her voice became smoother as she went on confusion giving way to calm i am elayne trakand daughterheir of andor and aes sedai of the green ajah i donвђt know what you think вђ her eyes nearly crossed as mistress anan pushed a finger to the tip of her nose elayne if that is your name all that keeps me from dragging you down to the kitchen and washing your mouth out yours and that other foolish girlвђs there is the possibility that you actually can channel somewhat or are you silly enough to wear that ring when you canвђt even do that i warn you it will make no difference to the sisters over in the tarasin palace do you even know about them if you do frankly you are not foolish youвђre blind stupid elayneвђs temper grew by the word foolish girl blind stupid she would not put up with it especially not right after being forced to crawl to mat cauthon dandle mat cauthon she maintained her outward composure though but not so nynaeve she glared in a fury and the glow of saidarenveloped her as she bounded to her feet flows of air wrapped mistress anan from shoulders to ankles crushing her skirts and petticoats against her legs just short of tight enough to topple her i happen to be one of those sisters in the palace nynaeve alвђmeara of the yellow ajah to be exact now would you like me to carry you down to the kitchens i know something of how to wash out a mouth elayne stepped away from the innkeeperвђs outstretched arm the woman had to feel the pressure of the flows and even a halfwit would have known what those invisible bonds must be yet she did not blink her greenflecked eyes narrowed no more so one of you can channel at least she said calmly i should let you drag me downstairs child whatever you do to me you would be in the hands of real aes sedai by noon iвђll wager that didnвђt you hear me nynaeve demanded i вђ the anan woman did not even pause youвђll not only spend the next year blubbering you will do part of it in front of anyone you told that you are aes sedai be sure theyвђll make you tell they will turn your liver to water i should let you go blundering on your way or else run across to the palace as soon as you loose me the only reason i donвђt is that theyвђll make an example of lord mat nearly as much as of you if they even suspect heвђs helped you and as i said i like the young man iвђm telling you вђ nynaeve tried again but stillthe innkeeper gave her no chance to tell anything tied like a bundle the woman was a boulder rolling downhill she was the whole hillside falling flattening whatever lay in its path trying to keep up the lie does no good nynaeve you look to be oh twentyone give or take a year so you might be as much as ten years older if youвђve already reached the slowing you might even have worn the shawl four or five years except for one thing her head the only part of her she could move swiveled toward elayne you child arenвђt old enough to have slowed yet and no woman has ever worn the shawl as young as you never in the history of the tower if you ever were in the tower iвђll wager you wore white and squeaked every time the mistress of novices glanced your way you had some goldsmith make that ring for you вђ there are some fool enough i hear вђ or maybe nynaeve stole it for you if she has any right to hers either way since you canвђt be a sister neither can she no aes sedai would travel with a woman who was pretending elayne frowned not noticing that she was chewing her lower lip slowed slowing how did an innkeeper in ebou dar know those words maybe setalle anan had gone to the tower as a girl though she would not have remained long since she clearly could not channel elayne would have known even if her ability had been as small as her own motherвђs and morgase trakand had had an ability so small she would have been sent away in a matter of weeks probably had she not been heir to a strong house release her nynaeve she said smiling she truly did feel more welldisposed toward the woman now it must have been terrible to make that journey to tar valon only to be turned away there was no reason the woman hadto believe them вђ something tickled at that but she could not say what вђ no reason at all but if she had made the trip to tar valon maybe she would walk across the mol hara merilille or any of the other sisters could set her straight release her nynaeve yelped elayne release her mistress anan i see the only way to convince you is вђ the amyrlin seat and three sitters couldnвђt convince me child light did she ever let anyone finish a sentence now i donвђt have time for any more games i can help the pair of you i know those who can anyway some women who take in strays you can thank lord mat that iвђm willing to take you to them but i must know were you ever in the tower or are you wilders if you were there were you put out or did you run away the truth they handle each in a different way elayne shrugged they had done what they came for she was more than ready to stop wasting time and get on with what needed doing next if you wonвђt be convinced then thatвђs all there is to it nynaeve it is past time we were on our way the flows around the innkeeper vanished and the glow around nynaeve too but nynaeve stood there watching the woman warily hopefully she wet her lips you know a group of women who can help us nynaeve elayne said we donвђt need any help we areaes sedai remember with a wry glance in her direction mistress anan gave her skirts a shake to straighten them and bent to smooth her exposed petticoats her real attention was on nynaeve elayne had never felt so completely shunted aside in her life i know a few women who take in the occasional wilder or runaway or woman who failed her test for accepted or the shawl there must be at least fifty of them altogether though the number changes they can help you find a life without the risk of a real sister making you wish sheвђd just skin you and be done now donвђt lie to me were you ever in the tower if youвђve run away you might as well decide to go back the tower managed to find most runaways even during the war of the hundred years so you neednвђt think this little bother now will stop them in truth my suggestion then would be to go across the square and throw yourself on a sisterвђs mercy it will be a small mercy iвђm afraid but you can believe me itвђs more than youвђll find if they have to drag you back you wonвђt even think of so much as leaving the tower groundswithout permission after that nynaeve drew a deep breath we were told to leave the tower mistress anan i will swear to that however you ask elayne stared in disbelief nynaeve what are you saying mistress anan we areaes sedai the anan woman laughed child let me talk with nynaeve who at least seems old enough to have sense you tell the circle that and they will not take it kindly they wonвђt care you can channel they can too and theyвђll smack your bottom or toss you out in the street on your nose if you play the fool who is this circle elayne demanded we areaes sedai you come across to the tarasin palace and you will see iвђll keep her in hand nynaeve had the gall to say all the while frowning and grimacing at elayne as if she were the one who had gone mad the anan woman merely nodded good now take off those rings and put them away the circle doesnвђt allow that sort of pretending theyвђll have them melted down to give you a start though by the look of your dresses you have coin if you stole it donвђt let reanne know one of the first rules youвђll have to learn is donвђt steal even if you are starving they donвђt want to draw attention elayne made a fist and thrust it behind her back and watched nynaeve meekly slip her ring off and tuck it into her belt pouch nynaeve who howled every time merilille or adeleas or any of them forgot she was a full sister trust me elayne nynaeve said which elayne would have had an easier time of if she had any notion what the woman was up to still she did trust her mostly a small sacrifice she muttered aes sedai did go without their rings when the need arose and she had too while passing for a sister but it was hers by right now removing that band of gold almost hurt physically talk to your friend child the anan woman told nynaeve impatiently reanne corly wonвђt put up with all this sulky pouting and if you make me waste my morning for nothing come along come along itвђs lucky for you i like lord mat elayne held on to cool composure by a fingernail sulky pouting sulky pouting when she had the chance she was going to kick nynaeve where it hurt chapter serpent and wheel next door to a weaver nynaeve did want to talk to elayne away from the innkeeperвђs ears but she did not find the chance right away the woman marched them out of the room doing a fine imitation of a guard on prisoners her stony impatience undented by the wary look she cast at matвђs door at the back of the inn a set of unrailed stone steps led down into a large hot kitchen full of baking smells where the roundest woman nynaeve had ever seen was wielding a large wooden spoon like a scepter directing three others in sliding crusty brown loaves from the ovens and replacing them with rolls of pale dough a large pot of the coarse white porridge that was eaten for breakfast hereabout bubbled gently on one of the whitetiled stoves enid mistress anan addressed the round woman i am going out for a little while i need to take these two children to someone who has time to mother them properly wiping broad floury hands on a piece of white toweling enid studied nynaeve and elayne disapprovingly everything about her was round her sweaty oliveskinned face her dark eyes all of her she seemed made of very large balls stuffed into a dress the marriage knife she wore hanging outside her snowy apron sparkled with a full dozen stones is this the pair of barkers caira was chattering about mistress fancy bits for the young lordвђs taste iвђd have said he likes them with a bit of wiggle that amused her by her tone the innkeeper shook her head in vexation i told that girl to hold her tongue i wonвђt let that sort of rumor touch the wandering woman remind caira for me enid and use your spoon to get her attention if need be the gaze she turned on nynaeve and elayne was so disparaging that nynaeve nearly gasped would anyone with half their wits believe these two were aes sedai spent all their coin on dresses to impress the man and now theyвђd starve unless they smile for him aes sedai giving enid no chance to answer she seized nynaeveвђs ear with her right hand elayneвђs with her left and in three quick steps had them out into the stableyard that was as long as nynaeveвђs shock held then she pulled free or tried to because the woman let go at the same instant and she stumbled half a dozen paces glaring indignantly she had not bargained for being dragged about elayneвђs chin rose her blue eyes so cold nynaeve would not have been surprised to see frost forming in her curls hands on hips mistress anan seemed not to notice or perhaps she simply did not care i can hope no one in there believes caira after that she said calmly if i could have been sure you had the wits to keep your mouths shut iвђd have said and done more and made certain she was calm but not at all pleasant or soft they had troubled her morning now follow me and donвђt get lost or if you do do not show your faces anywhere near my inn again or iвђll send somebody to the palace to tell merilille andteslyn they are two of the real sisters and theyвђll probably rip you each down the middle and share you out elayne shifted her gaze from the innkeeper to nynaeve not a glare or a frown yet a very meaning look just the same nynaeve wondered whether she was going to be able to go through with this the thought of mat convinced her any chance was better than that we wonвђt lose ourselves mistress anan she said striving for meekness she thought she did fairly well considering how foreign meekness was to her thank you for helping us smiling at the innkeeper she did her best to ignore elayne whose stare became more meaningful hard as that was to credit looks or no looks she had to make sure the woman continued to think them worth the trouble we are truly grateful mistress anan mistress anan eyed her askance then sniffed and shook her head when this was done nynaeve decided she was going to drag the innkeeper to the palace if need be and makethe other sisters acknowledge her in mistress ananвђs presence this early the stableyard was empty save for a lone boy of ten or twelve with a bucket and a sieve who sprinkled water to dampen the hardpacked ground against dust the white plastered stableвђs doors were wide open and a barrow sat in front with a dungfork resting across it sounds like a huge frog being stepped on floated out nynaeve decided it was a man singing would they have to ride to reach their destination even a short journey would not be pleasant walking only across the square and meaning to be back before the sun rose very high they had brought neither hats nor parasols nor hooded cloaks mistress anan led them through the stableyard however down a narrow alleyway between the stable and a high wall that had droughtbedraggled trees poking above the top someoneвђs garden no doubt a small gate at the end let into a dusty alley so cramped dawn had not completely reached it yet you children keep up now mind you the innkeeper told them starting away down the dim alley you lose yourselves and i vow iвђll go to the palace myself nynaeve took a grip on her braid with both hands as she followed to keep them from the anan womanвђs throat how she yearned for her first gray hairs first the other aes sedai then the sea folk вђ light she did not want to think about them вђ and now an innkeeper no one took you seriously until you had at least a little gray even an aes sedaiвђs ageless face could not possibly do as well in her estimation elayne was lifting her skirts out of the dust though their slippers still kicked up little puffs that settled on the hems of their dresses let me see elayne said softly looking straight ahead softly but coolly very coolly in fact she had a way of slashing someone to tatters without letting her tone heat that nynaeve admired usually now it just made her want to box the other womanвђs ears we could be back in the palace drinking blueberry tea and enjoying the breezes while we waited for master cauthon to move his belongings perhaps aviendha and birgitte might return with something useful we could finally be settling exactly what to do with the man do we simply follow him along the streets of the rahad and see what happens or take him into buildings that look likely or let him choose there must be a hundred worthwhile uses for this morning including deciding whether itвђs safe to go back to egwene вђ ever вђ after that bargain the sea folk wrung out of us we have to talk about that sooner or later ignoring it wonвђt help instead we are off on a walk of who knows what length squinting into the sun the whole way if we keep on as we are to visit women who feed runaways from the tower myself i donвђt have much interest in catching runaways this morning or any morning but iвђm sure you can explain it so i will understand i do so want to understand nynaeve i would hate to think iвђm going to kick you the length of the mol hara for nothing nynaeveвђs eyebrows drew down kick her elayne really was becoming violent spending so much time with aviendha someone ought to slap some sense into that pair the sun isnвђt high enough to make us squint yet she muttered it would be soon unfortunately think elayne fiftywomen who can channel helping wilders and women put out of the tower she felt guilty sometimes using the term wilders in the mouths of most aes sedai it was an insult but she intended to make them speak it as a badge of pride one day and she called them вђthe circleвђ that doesnвђt sound like a few friends to me it sounds organized the alley meandered between high walls and the backs of buildings many showing bare brick through the plaster between palace gardens and shops where an open back door revealed silversmiths or tailors or woodcarvers at work every so often mistress anan looked over her shoulder to make sure they still followed nynaeve gave her smiles and nods she hoped would convey eagerness nynaeve if twowomen who could channel made a society the tower would fall on them like a pack of wolves how would mistress anan know whether they can or not anyway women who can and arenвђt aes sedai do not go about making a show of themselves you know not for very long anyway in any case i canвђt see it makes a difference egwene might want to bring every woman who can channel into the tower somehow but that is not what we are about here the frosty patience in elayneвђs voice tightened nynaeveвђs hands on her braid how could the woman be so dense she bared her teeth again for mistress anan and managed not to scowl at the innkeeperвђs back when her head turned forward once more fifty women isnвђt two nynaeve whispered fiercely they could channel they must be able to everything hinged on that itвђs beyond reason that this circle can be in the same city with a storeroom packed full of angrealand such without at least knowing of it and if they do she could not keep satisfaction from honeying her voice weвђll have found the bowl without master matrim cauthon we can forget those absurd promises they were not a bribe nynaeve elayne said absently i will keep them and so will you if you have any honor and i know you do she was spending entirely too much time with aviendha nynaeve wished she knew why elayne had begun thinking they all had to follow this preposterous aiel jiwhateveritwas elayne bit her underlip frowning all that iciness seemed to have vanished she was herself again apparently finally she said we would never have gone to the inn without master cauthon so weвђd never have met the remarkable mistress anan or been taken to this circle so if the circle does lead us to the bowl we have to say he was the root cause mat cauthon his name boiledin her head nynaeve stumbled over her own feet and let go of her braid to lift her skirts the alley was hardly as smooth as a paved square much less a palace floor at times elayne in a taking was better than elayne thinking clearly remarkable she muttered iвђll вђremarkableвђ her till her eyes cross no one has ever treated us this way elayne not even people who doubted not even the sea folk most people would step wary if a tenyearold said she was aes sedai most people donвђt really know what an aes sedaiвђs face looks like nynaeve i think she went to the tower once she knows things she couldnвђt otherwise nynaeve snorted glowering at the back of the woman striding ahead setalle anan might have been to the tower ten times a hundred but she was going to acknowledge nynaeve alвђmeara as aes sedai and apologize and learn what it was like to be hauled about by her ear too mistress anan glanced back and nynaeve flashed her a rigid smile nodded as if her neck was a hinge elayne if these women do know where the bowl is we donвђt have to tell mat how we found it that was not quite a question i do not see why elayne replied then dashed all her hopes by adding but iвђll have to ask aviendha to be sure if she had not thought the anan woman might abandon them on the spot nynaeve would have screamed the wandering alley gave way to a street and there was no talking then to amount to anything the sunвђs thin rim glared blindingly above the rooftops ahead elayne shaded her eyes with one hand very ostentatiously nynaeve refused to it was not that bad she barely had to squint at all really a clear blue sky mocked her weather sense that still told her a storm was right on top of the city even this early a few brightly lacquered coaches were about in the winding streets and a double fistful of brighter sedan chairs two or sometimes four barefoot bearers in greenandred striped vests to each trotting because they carried passengers hidden behind the grilled wooden screens carts and wagons rumbled over the paving stones and people began to fill the streets as shop doors opened and awnings went up vested apprentices hurrying on errands and men with great rolled carpets balanced on their shoulders tumblers and jugglers and musicians readying themselves at likely corners and hawkers with their trays of pins or ribbons or shabby fruit the opensided fishand meatmarkets had long since been in full cry all the fishmongers were women and most of the butchers too except those dealing in beef dodging through the crowds past the coaches and sedan chairs and wagons that seemed to think they had no reason to slow mistress anan set a fast pace to make up for interruptions there were plenty of those she seemed to be a wellknown woman hailed by shopkeepers and craftsmen and other innkeepers standing in their doorways the shopkeepers and craftsmen received a few words a pleasant nod but she always stopped to chat a moment with the innkeepers after the first nynaeve wished fervently that she would not again after the second she prayed for it after the third she stared straight ahead and tried in vain not to hear elayneвђs face grew tighter and tighter colder and colder her chin rose till it was a wonder she could see to walk there was a reason nynaeve had to admit grudgingly in ebou dar someone wearing silk might stroll the length of a square maybe but no further everybody else in sight wore wool or linen seldom with much embroidery except for an occasional beggar who had acquired a castoff silk garment frayed on every edge and more hole than cloth she just wished mistress anan had chosen some other explanation for why she was leading the pair of them through the streets she wished she did not have to listen one more time to a tale of two flighty girls who had spent all their money on fine clothes to impress a man mat came out of it well burn him a fine young fellow if mistress anan had not been married a beautiful dancer with just a touch of the rogue all of the women laughed not her or elayne though not the brainless little honeykissers вђ that was the word she used nynaeve could guess what it meant вђ honeykissers penniless from chasing after a man and their purses full of brass bits and tin to fool fools witless loobies who would have been reduced to beggary or theft had mistress anan not known someone who might give them work in the kitchen she doesnвђt have to stop at every inn in the city nynaeve growled as she stalked away from the stranded goose three broad stories with an innkeeper who wore large garnets at her ears despite the humble name mistress anan hardly even glanced back to see they followed now do you realize weвђll never be able to show our own faces in any of those places i suspect that is exactly the point every word out of elayneвђs mouth was chipped from ice nynaeve if youвђve sent us running after a wild pig there was no need to complete the threat with birgitte and aviendha to help and they would elayne could make her life miserable until she was satisfied they will take us right to the bowl she insisted flapping her hands to shoo a beggar with a horrible purple scar that obliterated one eye she could recognize flour paste dyed with bluewort when she saw it i know they will elayne sniffed in an offensively expressive manner nynaeve lost count of the number of bridges they crossed large and small with barges poling beneath the sun climbed its own height above the rooftops then twice the anan woman did not follow even so straight a line as she might have вђ she really did seem to be going out of her way to find inns вђ but they continued generally east and nynaeve thought they must be nearing the river when the hazeleyed woman suddenly rounded on them you watch your tongues now speak when youвђre spoken to and not else you embarrass me and with a final frown and a mutter half under her breath that she was probably making a mistake she jerked her head for them to follow again to a flatroofed house right opposite it was not a large house two stories without one balcony cracked plaster and brick showing in several places and hardly in an agreeable location with the loud rattling of a weaverвђs looms to one side and the acrid stinks of a dyerвђs shop to the other a maid answered the door though a graying woman with a square jaw shoulders like a blacksmith and a steely eye unsoftened by the sweat on her face as nynaeve followed mistress anan in she smiled somewhere in that house a woman was channeling the squarejawed maid obviously knew setalle anan on sight but her reaction was odd she curtsied with a very real respect yet she was plainly surprised to see her and obviously doubtful about her being there she almost fluttered before letting them in nynaeve and elayne were greeted with no ambivalence though they were shown to a sitting room one flight up and the maid told them firmly donвђt stir a toe and donвђt touch anything or youвђll catch the old whatfor then vanished nynaeve looked at elayne nynaeve one woman channeling doesnвђt mean вђ the feel changed swelling for a moment then subsiding lower than before even two women doesnвђt mean anything elayne protested but she sounded doubtful that was the most illmannered maid iвђve ever seen she took a tallbacked red chair and after a moment nynaeve sat too but she perched on the edge from eagerness not nerves not nerves at all the room was not grand but the blueandwhite floor tiles glistened and the pale green walls looked freshly painted no trace of gilt showed anywhere of course yet fine carving covered the red chairs arrayed along the walls and several small tables of a darker blue than the tiles the lamps hanging from sconces were clearly brass polished till they shone carefully arranged evergreen branches filled the swept hearth and the lintel above the fireplace was carved not plain stonework the carving seemed an odd choice вђ what people around ebou dar called the thirteen sins a man with eyes that nearly filled his whole face for envy a fellow with his tongue hanging to his ankles for gossip a snarling sharptoothed man clutching coins to his chest for greed and so on вђ but all in all it satisfied her very much whoever could afford that room could afford fresh plaster outside and the only reason not to put it up was to keep low avoiding notice the maid had left the door open and suddenly voices coming up the hall drifted through i cannot believe you brought them here the speakerвђs tone was tight with incredulity and anger you know how careful we are setalle you know more than you should and you surely know that i am very sorry reanne mistress anan answered stiffly i suppose i didnвђt think i submit myself both to stand surety for these girlsвђ behavior and to your judgment of course not reanneвђs tone was high with shock now that is to say i mean you shouldnвђt have but setalle i apologize for raising my voice say you forgive me you have no reason to apologize reanne the innkeeper managed to sound rueful and reluctant at the same time i did wrong to bring them no no setalle i shouldnвђt have spoken to you so please you must forgive me please do the anan woman and reanne corly entered the sitting room and nynaeve blinked in surprise from the exchange she had expected someone younger than setalle anan but reanne had hair more gray than not and a face full of what might have been smile lines though they were creased in worry now why would the older woman humble herself so to the younger and why would the younger allow it however halfheartedly customs were different here the light knew some more different than she liked to think about yet not this much surely of course she had never gone very far toward being humble with the womenвђs circle back home but this of course reanne could channel вђ she had expected that hoped for it anyway вђ but she had not expected the strength reanne was not as strong as elayne or even nicola вђ burn that wretched girl вђ but she easily equaled sheriam say or kwamesa or kiruna not many women possessed so much strength and for all she herself bettered it by a fair margin she was surprised to find it here the woman must be one of the wilders the tower would have found a way to keep its hands on a woman like this if they had to hold her in a novice dress her whole life nynaeve rose as they came through the doorway smoothing her skirts not from nervousness certainly certainly not oh but if only this came out right reanneвђs sharp blue eyes studied the two of them with the air of someone who had just found a pair of pigs in her kitchen fresh from the sty and dripping mud she dabbed at her face with a tiny handkerchief though the interior of the house was cooler than outside i suppose weвђll have to do something with them she murmured if they are what they claim her voice was quite high even now musical and almost youthful as she finished speaking she gave a small start for some reason and eyed the innkeeper sideways which set off another round of mistress ananвђs reluctant apologies and mistress corlyвђs flustered attempts to deflect them in ebou dar when folk were truly being polite apologies back and forth could flow for an hour elayne had risen too wearing a slightly fixed smile she raised an eyebrow at nynaeve cupped her elbow in one hand and laid a finger against her cheek nynaeve cleared her throat mistress corly my name is nynaeve alвђmeara and this is elayne trakand we are looking for вђ setalle has told me all about you the blueeyed woman cut in ominously however many gray hairs on her head nynaeve suspected she was also hard as a stone fence abide with patience girl and iвђll deal with you directly she turned back to setalle blotting her cheeks with the handkerchief barely suppressed diffidence once more tinged her voice setalle if you will please excuse me i must question these girls and вђ look who is returned after all these years a short stout woman in her middle years blurted as she barged into the room nodding at her companion despite her redbelted ebou dari dress and a tanned face that glistened damply her accents were pure cairhienin her equally sweaty companion in the dark plainly cut woolens of a merchant was a head taller no older than nynaeve with dark tilted eyes a strongly hooked nose and a wide mouth itвђs garenia she вђ the flow of words terminated abruptly in confusion as the stout woman realized others were present reanne clasped her hands as if in prayer or perhaps because she wanted to hit someone berowin she said with an edge one day you will run right off a cliff before you see it under your feet i am sorry eldвђ blushing the cairhienin lowered her eyes the saldaean became intent on fiddling with a circle of red stones pinned at her breast for nynaeveвђs part she gave elayne a triumphant look both newcomers could channel and saidarwas still being wielded somewhere in the house two more and while berowin was not very strong garenia stood even above reanne she could match lelaine or romanda not that that mattered of course yet this made at least five elayneвђs chin set stubbornly but then she sighed and gave a small nod sometimes it took the most incredible effort to convince her of anything your name is garenia mistress anan said slowly frowning at the woman in question you look very much like someone i met once zarya alkaese dark tilted eyes blinked in surprise plucking a lacetrimmed handkerchief from her sleeve the saldaean merchant touched her cheeks that is my grandmotherвђs sisterвђs name she said after a moment iвђm told i favor her strongly was she well when you saw her she forgot her family completely after she went off to become aes sedai your grandmotherвђs sister the innkeeper laughed softly of course she was well when i saw her but that was a long time ago i was younger than you are now reanne had been hovering at her side all but grabbing her elbow and now she leaped in setalle i truly am sorry but i really must ask you to excuse us you will forgive me not showing you to the door mistress anan made her own apologies as if she was at fault because the other woman could not escort her down and departed with a last very dubious look at nynaeve and elayne setalle garenia exclaimed as soon as the innkeeper was gone that was setalle anan how did she вђ light of heaven even after seventy years the tower would вђ garenia mistress corly said in an extremely sharp tone her stare was sharper still and the saldaeanвђs face reddened since you two are here we can make up the three for questioning you girls stay where you are and keep silent that last was for nynaeve and elayne the other women withdrew to a corner in a huddle and began conversing in soft murmurs elayne moved nearer nynaeve i did not like being treated as a novice when i wasa novice how long do you intend to continue this farce nynaeve hissed at her for quiet iвђm trying to listen elayne she whispered using the power was out of the question of course the three would have known on the instant fortunately they wove no barriers perhaps not knowing how and sometimes their voices rose just enough said they may be wilders reanne said and shock and revulsion bloomed on the other womenвђs faces then we show them the door berowin said the back door wilders i still want to know who this setalle anan is garenia put in if you canвђt keep your mind on the straight reanne told her perhaps you should spend this turn on the farm alise knows how to concentrate a mind wonderfully now the words dropped back to a buzz another maid appeared a slender woman pretty except for a sullen expression with a rough gray woolen dress and a long white apron setting a greenlacquered tray on one of the small tables she surreptitiously wiped her cheeks with a corner of her apron and began fussing with blueglazed cups and a matching teapot nynaeveвђs eyebrows rose this woman could channel too if not to any high degree what was she doing as a servant garenia glanced over her shoulder and gave a start what did derys do to earn penance i thought fish would sing the day she cracked a rule much less broke one berowin sniffed loudly but her reply was barely audible she wanted to marry she will advance a turn and go with keraille the day after the feast of the half moon that will settle for master denal perhaps you both wish to hoe the fields for alise reanne spoke dryly and the voices fell again nynaeve felt a rush of exultation she did not care much for rules at least for other peopleвђs rules вђ other people rarely saw the situation as clearly as she and thus made stupid rules why should that woman derys not marry if she wished for example вђ but rules and penances spoke of a society she wasright and another thing she nudged elayne until the other woman bent her head berowinвђs wearing a red belt she whispered that indicated a wise woman one of ebou darвђs fabled healers their care known far and wide as the next best to being healed by an aes sedai curing just about anything supposedly it was all done with herbs and knowledge but how many wise women have we seen elayne how many could channel how many were ebou dari or even altaran seven counting berowin was the slow answer and only one i was sure was from here hah the others plainly had not been elayne took a deep breath though she went on softly nonehad anywhere near these womenвђs strength though at least she had not suggested they were mistaken somehow all of those wise women had been able nynaeve are you really suggesting that the wise womenallthe wise women are that would be beyondincredible elayne this city has a guild for the men who sweep the squares every night i think weвђve just found the ancient mucketymuck sisterhood of wise women the stubborn woman shook her head the tower would have had a hundred sisters here years ago nynaeve two hundred anything of the sort would have been squashed flat in short order maybe the tower doesnвђt know nynaeve said maybe the guild keeps low enough that the tower never thought they were worth troubling thereвђs no law against channeling if you arenвђt aes sedai only against claiming to be aes sedai or misusing the power or bringing discredit that meant doing anything that might possibly cast a bad light on real aes sedai should anyone happen to think you were one which was going pretty far to her way of thinking the real trouble though was that she did not believe it the tower seemed to know everything and they probably would break up a quilting circle if the women in it could channel yet there had to be some explanation for only halfaware she felt the true source being embraced but suddenly she became very aware her mouth fell open as a flow of air snared her braid right at the base of her skull and ran her across the room on her toes elayne ran right beside her redfaced with fury the worst of it was they were both shielded the short run ended when they were allowed to settle their heels in front of mistress corly and the other two all three seated against the wall in red chairs all surrounded by the glow of saidar you were told to be quiet reanne said firmly if we decide to help you you will have to learn that we expect strict obedience no less than the white tower itself she imbued those last words with a tone of reverence i will tell you that you would have been treated more gently if you had not come to us in this irregular fashion the flow gripping nynaeveвђs braid vanished elayne tossed her head angrily as she was released appalled astonishment became fiery outrage as nynaeve realized that berowin held her shield most aes sedai she had met stood above berowin nearly all gathering herself she strained to reach the source expecting the weaves to shatter she would at least show these women she would not be the weaves stretched the round cairhienin woman smiled and nynaeveвђs face darkened the shield stretched further further bulging like a ball it would not break that was impossible anyone could block her from the source if they caught her by surprise of course and someone weaker could hold the shield once woven but not thismuch weaker and a shield did not bend that far without breaking it was impossible you could burst a blood vessel if you keep at that berowin said almost companionably we do not try to reach above our station but skills are honed with time and this was always nearly a talent with me i could hold one of the forsaken scowling nynaeve gave over she could wait since she had no choice she could derys came bearing her tray distributing cups of dark tea to the three seated women she never so much as glanced at nynaeve or elayne before making a perfect curtsy and returning to her table we could have been drinking blueberry tea nynaeve elayne said shooting such a look at her that she came close to stepping back maybe it would be best not to wait too long be quiet girl mistress corlyвђs tone might be calm but she patted her handkerchief to her face angrily our report of you says you both are froward and contentious that you chase after men and lie to which i add that you cannot follow simple instructions all of which must change if you seek our help all of it this is most irregular be grateful weвђre willing to speak to you we do seek your help nynaeve said she wished elayne would stop glaring so it was worse than the corly womanвђs hard stare well as bad anyway we desperately need to find a terвђangrealвђ reanne corly broke in as if she had been standing there silent usually we know the girls brought to us beforehand but we must make certain you are what you say how many doors to the tower library may a novice use and which she took a sip of tea waiting two the word dripped venom from elayneвђs mouth the main door to the east when a sister sends her or the small door at the southwest corner called the novice door when she goes for herself how long nynaeve garenia who held elayneвђs shield channeled another slender flow of air not gently elayne quivered then again and nynaeve winced wondering that she did not grab at the back of her skirt a civil tongue is another requirement garenia murmured wryly into her cup that is the right answer mistress corly said as if nothing else had happened although she did eye the saldaean woman briefly over her tea now how many bridges in the water garden three nynaeve snapped mainly because she knew she had not known about the library having never been a novice we need to know вђ berowin could not spare anything to channel a flow of air but mistress corly could and did barely keeping her face smooth nynaeve knotted her hands in her skirts to hold them still elayne had the gall to give her a small chilly smile chilly but satisfied a dozen more questions hammered at them from how many floors the novice quarters contained вђ twelve вђ to under what circumstances a novice was allowed into the hall of the tower вђ to carry messages or to be expelled from the tower for a crime no others вђ hammered without nynaeve getting in more than two words and those two answered silently by the horrible corly woman she began to feel like a novice in the hall they were not allowed to speak a word either that was one of the few answers she knew but luckily elayne responded promptly when she did not nynaeve might have done better had they asked about accepted a little better at least but it was what a novice should know that interested them she was just glad elayne was willing to go along though by her pale cheeks and raised chin that could not last much longer i suppose nynaeve was really there reanne said finally exchanging glances with the other two if elayne taught her to pass i think she would have done a better job some people live in perpetual fog garenia sniffed then nodded slowly berowinвђs nod came entirely too promptly for nynaeveвђs liking please she said politely she could be polite when there was reason whatever anyone said we truly need to find a terвђangrealthe sea folk call the bowl of the winds itвђs in a dusty old storeroom somewhere in the rahad and i think your guild your circle must know where please help us three suddenly stony faces stared at her there is no guild mistress corly said coolly only a few friends who found no place in the white tower again that reverential tone and who are foolish enough occasionally to reach out a hand where itвђs needed we have no truck with terвђangreal or angreal or saвђangrealeither we are not aes sedai aes sedai echoed with veneration as well in any case you are not here to ask questions we have more for you to see how far youвђve gone after which you will be taken to the country and given into the care of a friend she will keep you until we decide what to do next until we can be sure the sisters are not looking for you you have a new life ahead of you a new chance if you can only let yourself see it whatever held you back in the tower does not apply here whether a lack of dexterity or fear or anything else no one will push you to learn or do what you cannot what you are is sufficient now enough elayne said in a wintery voice long enough nynaeve or do you intend to wait in the country for however long they do nothave it nynaeve removing her great serpent ring from her belt pouch she thrust the circle of gold onto her finger from the way she looked at the seated women no one would believe her shielded she was a queen out of patience she was aes sedai to her hair was what she was i am elayne trakand high seat of house trakand i am daughterheir of andor and aes sedai of the green ajah and i demandyou release me immediately nynaeve groaned garenia grimaced with disgust and berowinвђs eyes widened inhorror reanne corly shook her head ruefully but when she spoke her voice was iron i had hoped setalle had changed your mind concerning that particular lie i know how hard it is to set out proudly for the white tower then find yourself faced with returning home to admit failure but that is never said even in joke i made no joke elayne said lightly snow was light garenia leaned forward with a scowl a flow of air already forming until mistress corly raised her hand and you nynaeve do you persist in this madness too nynaeve filled her lungs these women had to know where the bowl was they just had to nynaeve elayne said peevishly she was not going to let her forget this even if they did have to effect an escape she had a way of harping on every little misstep in a manner that cut the ground right from under your feet i am an aes sedai of the yellow ajah nynaeve said wearily the true amyrlin seat egwene alвђvere raised us to the shawl in salidar sheвђs no older than elayne you must have heard not a glimmer of change in those three hard faces she sent us to find the bowl of the winds with it we can mend the weather not a flicker of change she tried to hold her anger down she truly did it just oozed up despite her you must want that look around you the dark one is strangling the world if you have even a hint of where the bowl might be tell us mistress corly motioned for derys who came and took the cups casting fearful wideeyed looks at nynaeve and elayne when she scurried away out of the room in fact the three women stood slowly standing like grim magistrates pronouncing sentence i regret that you will not accept our help mistress corly said coldly i regret this whole affair reaching into her pouch she pressed three silver marks into nynaeveвђs hand and another three into elayneвђs these will take you a little way you can also get something for those dresses i should think if not what you paid those are hardly suitable garments for a journey by tomorrow sunrise you will be gone from ebou dar we arenвђt going anywhere nynaeve told her please if you know вђ she might as well have kept silent the measured flow of words did not slow at that time we will begin circulating your descriptions and we will make certain they reach the sisters in the tarasin palace if you are seen after sunrise we will see that the sisters know where you are and the whitecloaks as well your choice then will be to run surrender to the sisters or die go do not return and you should live long if you give over this repulsive and dangerous ruse we are done with you berowin see to them please brushing between them she went from the room without looking back sullenly nynaeve let herself be herded down to the front door a struggle would not achieve anything except maybe being thrown out bodily but she did not like giving up light she did not elayne marched frozen determination to leave and be done shining in every line of her in the small entry hall nynaeve decided to try once more please garenia berowin if you have any hint tell us any clue at all you must see how important this is you must вђthe blindest are those who keep their eyes shutвђ elayne quoted not quite under her breath berowin hesitated but not garenia she put her face right in nynaeveвђs do you think weвђre fools girl iвђll tell you this if i had my way we would bundle you out to the farm no matter what you say a few months of aliseвђs attentions and youвђd learn to guard your tongue and be grateful for the help you spit on nynaeve considered hitting her on the nose she did not need saidarto use her fist garenia berowin said sharply apologize we do not hold anyone against her will and you know it well apologize immediately and wonder of wonders the woman who would have stood very close to the top had she been aes sedai looked sideways at the woman who would have stood near the bottom and blushed crimson i ask forgiveness garenia mumbled at nynaeve my temper gets the better of me sometimes and i say what i have no right to i humbly ask forgiveness another sidelong glance at berowin who nodded producing a sigh of open relief while nynaeve was still gaping the shields were released and she and elayne were pushed into the street the door slamming shut behind them chapter flame of tar valon the kin incredible reanne thought watching from a window as the two strange girls vanished down the street among the tradesmen and beggars and occasional sedan chairs she had returned to the meeting room as soon as the pair was escorted from it she did not know what to make of them and their persistent claims in the face of all reason were only part of her confusion they did not perspire berowin whispered at her shoulder yes she would have arranged for the news to reach the tarasin place in the next hour if she had not given her word and if not for the danger fear bubbled in her middle the same panic that had overtaken her after one passage through the silver arches when she went to test for accepted just as she had every time it had stirred in the years since she took a fresh grip on herself in truth she did not realize that the fear she might run screaming again had long since conquered any possibility that she would she prayed that those girls would abandon their insanity she prayed that if they did not they were caught far from ebou dar and either kept silent or were not believed precautions would have to be taken safeguards carried out that had not been used in years aes sedai were as near omnipotent as made no difference though that she knew in her bones eldest could it be possible that the older of the two really is we channeled and berowin trailed off miserably but reanne did not need to consider not even setting aside the younger girl why would any aes sedai pretend to be less so much less besides any real aes sedai would have put them all on their knees begging mercy not stood there so submissively we did not channel in front of an aes sedai she said firmly we broke no rule those rules applied to her as strictly as anyone else the very first was that they were all one even those set above for a time how could it have been otherwise when those who were above must eventually step down only through movement and change could they remain hidden but some of the rumors do mention a girl as amyrlin eldest and she knew вђ rebels reanne put into that all the outraged disbelief she felt that anyone should dareto rebel against the white tower it was hardly strange for unbelievable tales to attach to anyone like that what about logain and the red ajah garenia demanded and reanne fixed her with a stare the woman had gotten herself another cup of tea before coming back up and she managed to sip defiantly whatever the truth garenia it is not our place to criticize anything aes sedai might do reanneвђs mouth tightened that hardly squared with what she felt toward the rebels but how could any aes sedai do such a thing the saldaean bent her neck in acquiescence though and perhaps to hide the sullen twist of her mouth reanne sighed she herself had given up dreams of the green ajah long long ago but there were those like berowin who believed secretly they thought that somehow they might one day return to the white tower somehow yet become aes sedai and then there were women like garenia almost as poor at keeping their wishes secret though those wishes were ten times as forbidden they actually would have accepted wilders and even gone out to find girls who could be taught garenia was not done she always skirted the edges of discipline and frequently stepped over what of this setalle anan then those girls know about the circle the anan woman must have told them though how she knows she shuddered in a way that would have been entirely too ostentatious for most others but she had never been able to conceal her emotions even when she should whoever betrayed us to her must be found and her betrayal punished too sheвђs an innkeeper and she must be taught to guard her tongue berowin gasped wideeyed with shock and dropped into a chair so hard she nearly bounced remember who she is garenia reanne said sharply if setalle had betrayed us we would be crawling to tar valon begging forgiveness the whole way when she first came to ebou dar she had been told the story of a woman made to crawl to the white tower and nothing she had seen since of aes sedai made her question it in the least she has kept the few secrets she knows from gratitude and i doubt that has faded she would have died in her first childbirth if the kin had not helped her what she knows comes from careless tongues when it was thought she could not hear and the owners of those tongues were punished more than twenty years ago still she wished there was some way she could bring herself to ask setalle to be more circumspect she must have spoken carelessly in front of those girls the woman bowed her head again but her mouth was set stubbornly at least part of this turn reanne decided garenia would spend at the retreat and she would have special instructions to relay with her own stubborn mouth alise seldom required more than a week to make a woman decide stubbornness did not pay before she could inform garenia though derys was curtsying in the doorway announcing sarainya vostovan as usual sarainya swept right in before reanne could say to admit her in some ways the strikingly handsome woman made garenia appear supple despite keeping the form of every rule exactly reanne was sure she would have worn her hair in braids and bells given the choice and never mind how that would have looked with her red belt but then given the choice she would not have served even one turn with the belt sarainya did curtsy at the door of course and kneel before her head lowered but fifty years had not made her forget that she would have been a woman of considerable power had she been able to make herself return home to arafel curtsy and the rest all were concessions when she spoke in that husky forceful voice whether the woman would ever reconcile herself and the problem of garenia left reanneвђs mind callie is dead eldest sister her throat was cut and she apparently had been robbed even of her stockings but sumeko says that it was the one power killed her that is impossible berowin burst out no kinswoman would do such a thing an aes sedai garenia said hesitant for once but how the three oaths sumeko must be wrong reanne raised a hand for silence sumeko was never wrong not in this area she would have been yellow ajah had she not broken down completely while testing for the shawl and although it was forbidden despite countless penances she worked to learn more whenever she thought no one was watching no aes sedai could have done this obviously and no kinswoman would have but those girls so insistent knowing what they should not the circle had lasted too long offered succor to too many women to be destroyed now this is what must be done she told them that flutter of fear began again but for once she hardly noticed nynaeve stalked away from the small house in outrage it was incredible those women did have a guild she knew they did whatever they said she was sure they knew where the bowl was too she would have done whatever was necessary to bring them to tell her pretending docility before them for a few hours would have been a deal easier than putting up with mat cauthon for the light knew how many days i could have been as acquiescent as they wanted she thought irritably theyвђd have thought i was a pliable old slipper i could have that was a lie and it did not take a foul remembered taste to convince her given half a chance she would have shaken every one of those women till they told her what she wanted to know she would have given them aes sedai till they squeaked she scowled sideways at elayne the other woman seemed lost in thought nynaeve wished she did not know what the woman was thinking about a wasted morning and not far short of complete humiliation she did not like being in the wrong she was not yet used to admitting she was really and now she was going to have to apologize to elayne she trulyhated apologizing well it would be bad enough back in their rooms with birgitte and aviendha still out it was to be hoped she was not about to begin in the street with who knew who streaming by the throng had thickened though the sun hardly seemed much higher through the wheeling clouds of seabirds that cried overhead finding their way was not easy after all those twists and turns nynaeve had to ask directions half a dozen times while elayne stared in another direction pretending indifference she stalked along across bridges ducked around wagons and carts jumped out of the way of racing sedan chairs that wove through the crowds wished elayne would say something nynaeve knew how to nurse a grudge and the longer she herself kept silent the worse it was when she spoke so the longer elayne walked without speaking the darker became the image in her mind of how it was going to be back in their rooms that made her furious she had admitted she was wrong if only to herself elayne had no right to make her suffer this way she began wearing such a face that even people who did not notice their rings gave them a clear path people who did notice usually seemed to find an urgent need to be a street away even some sedanchair bearers skirted around her how old did reanne look to you elayne asked suddenly nynaeve nearly jumped they were almost back to mol hara fifty years maybe sixty i donвђt see it matters she ran her eyes over the crowd to see if anyone was close enough to hear a passing hawker her tray displaying a bitter little yellow fruit called a lemon tried to swallow her cry in midshout when nynaeveвђs gaze rested on her for a moment with the result that she doubled over her tray coughing and choking nynaeve sniffed the woman probably had been eavesdropping if not planning to cut a purse they area guild elayne and they doknow where the bowl is i just know they do that was not what she had intended to say at all if she apologized for dragging elayne into this now maybe it would not be so bad i suppose they are elayne said absently i suppose they might how is it that she can have aged so nynaeve stopped dead in the middle street after all that arguing after getting them thrown out she supposed well isuppose she aged the same way as the rest of us a day at a time elayne if you believed why did you announce who you were like rhiannon at the tower she rather liked that according to the story what queen rhiannon got was far from what she had wanted the question did not seem to register with elayne for all her education she pulled nynaeve to one side as a curtained green carriage rumbled past вђ the street was not very wide there вђ over to the front of a seamstressвђs shop with a wide doorway showing several dressmakerвђs forms clothed in halfdone dresses they were not going to tell us anything nynaeve not if you got down on your knees and begged nynaeve opened her mouth indignantly then snapped it shut she had never said anything about begging anyway why should she have been the only one better any woman at all than mat cauthon elayne had a fly up her nose though and was not to be distracted nynaeve she must have slowed like everyone else how old is she to look fifty or sixty what are you talking about without thinking nynaeve noted the location in a corner of her mind the seamstressвђs work looked quite good worth closer examination she probably doesnвђt channel any more than she can help afraid as she is of being mistaken for a sister she wouldnвђt have wanted her face too smooth after all you never listened in class did you elayne murmured she saw the plump seamstress beaming in the doorway and drew nynaeve toward the corner of the building considering the amount of lace the seamstress wore on her own dress the bodice buried in it and paces of it drooping over her exposed petticoats she would bear close watching if nynaeve did order anything forget clothes for one moment nynaeve who is the oldest accepted you remember she gave elayne a very level look the woman made it sound as if she never thought of anything else and she had too listened sometimes elin warrel i think sheвђs about my age i think of course the seamstressвђs own dress would look fine with a more modest neckline and much less lace in green silk lan liked green though she certainly was not going to choose her dresses for him he liked blue as well elayne barked such a laugh that nynaeve wondered whether she had spoken aloud coloring fiercely she tried to explain вђ she was sure she could by bel tine вђ but the other woman gave her no opportunity for a word elinвђs sister came to visit her just before you first arrived at the tower nynaeve her youngersister the woman had grayhair well some of it was she must have been over forty nynaeve elin warrel was past forty but what are you saying elayne no one was close enough to listen and no one seemed to be giving them a second glance except the still hopeful seamstress but elayne lowered her voice to a whisper we slow nynaeve somewhere between twenty and twentyfive we begin aging more slowly how much depends on how strong we are but when doesnвђt any woman who can channel does it takima said she thought it was the beginning of achieving the ageless look though i donвђt think anyone has ever reached that until theyвђve worn the shawl at least a year or two sometimes five or more think you knowany sister with gray hair is old even if you arenвђt supposed to mention it so if reanne slowed and she must have how old is she nynaeve did not care how old reanne was she wanted to cry no wonder everyone refused to believe her age it explained why the womenвђs circle back home had looked over her shoulder as if unsure she was old enough to be trusted fully achieving a sisterвђs ageless face was all very well but how long before she had her gray hairs blinking she turned away angrily and something struck her a glancing blow on the back of the head staggering she rounded on elayne in astonishment why had the woman hit her only elayne lay in a heap eyes closed and a nasty purple lump rising on her temple groggily nynaeve fell to her knees and gathered her friend into her arms your friend must be taken ill a long nosed woman said kneeling beside them careless of a yellow dress that showed far too much bosom even by ebou dari standards let me help a tall fellow handsome in his embroidered silk vest except for a rather oily grin bent to take nynaeveвђs shoulders here i have a carriage weвђll take you somewhere more comfortable than a paving stone go away nynaeve told them politely we donвђt need your help the man kept trying to raise her to her feet though to guide her toward a red carriage where a startledappearing woman in blue beckoned vigorously the longnosed woman actually tried to lift elayne thanking the man for his help and chattering how his carriage sounded a fine idea a crowd of onlookers seemed to have gathered out of air in a semicircle women murmuring sympathy about fainting from the heat men offering to help carry the ladies a scrawny fellow bold as you please reached for nynaeveвђs purse almost right under her nose her head still swam enough to make embracing saidardifficult but if all those nattering folk had not fueled her temper what she saw lying in the street would have an arrow with a blunt stone head the one that had grazed her or the one that had struck elayne she channeled and the scrawny cutpurse doubled over clutching himself and squealing like a pig in briars another flow and the longnosed woman fell over backward with a shriek twice as high the man in the silk vest apparently decided they did not need his help after all because he turned and ran for the carriage but she gave him a dose anyway he outbellowed any outraged bull as the woman in the carriage hauled him in by his vest thank you but we donвђt need any help nynaeve shouted politely few remained to hear once it became clear that the one power was being used вђ and folk suddenly leaping about and yelling for no visible cause made it clear enough to most вђ they hurried elsewhere the longnosed woman gathered herself up and actually jumped onto the back of the red carriage clinging precariously as the darkvested driver whipped the horses away through the crowd people leaping aside even the cutpurse hobbled off as fast as he could nynaeve could not have cared less had the earth opened and swallowed the whole lot chest aching she ran fine flows of wind and water earth fire and spirit mixed and blended through elayne it was a simple weave no bother despite her faint dizziness and the result let her breathe again the bruise was not serious the bones of elayneвђs skull were unbroken normally she would have redirected those same flows into much more complex weaves the healing she had discovered herself at the moment simpler weaves were all she could manage though with just spirit wind and water she wove the healing that yellows had used since time immemorial elayneвђs eyes shot open wide and with a gasp that seemed to take all the air in her she convulsed like a netted trout slippered heels drumming on the pavement that only lasted a moment of course but in that moment the bruise shrank and vanished nynaeve helped her to her feet вђ and a womanвђs hand appeared holding a pewter cup full of water even an aes sedai might be thirsty after that the seamstress said elayne reached for it but nynaeve laid fingers on her wrist no thank you the woman shrugged and as she turned away nynaeve added in a different tone thank you it seemed to come easier the more you said it she was not sure she liked that that ocean of lace heaved as the seamstress shrugged again i make dresses for anyone i can do better for your coloring than that she vanished back into her shop nynaeve frowned after her what happened elayne demanded why wouldnвђt you let me take a drink iвђm thirsty andhungry with a last frown for the seamstress nynaeve bent to pick up the arrow the other woman needed no explanations saidarshone around her in a flash teslyn and joline nynaeve shook her head the slight wooziness seemed to be fading she did not think those two would stoop to this she did not think so what about reanne she said quietly the seamstress was back in the doorway still hopeful she might want to make sure we leave or worse maybe garenia that was almost as chilling as teslyn and joline and twice as infuriating somehow elayne managed to look pretty while scowling whoever it was we will settle them youвђll see the scowl faded nynaeve if the circle does know where the bowl is we can find it but she bit her lip hesitating i only know one way to be sure nynaeve nodded slowly though she would rather have eaten a handful of dirt today had seemed so bright for a time but then it had spiraled into darkness from reanne to oh light how long before she had her gray hair donвђt cry nynaeve mat canвђt possibly be that bad heвђll find it for us in a few days i know nynaeve only cried harder chapter snakey square mindtrap moghedien did not want to dream the dream again but wanting to wake wanting to scream did no good sleep held her faster than any manacles the beginning went by quickly a sketchy blur no mercy she would have to relive the rest that much sooner she barely recognized the woman who entered the tent where she was held prisoner halima secretary to one of these fools who called themselves aes sedai fools yet they held her tightly enough by the band of silver metal around her neck held her and made her obey fast movement though she prayed for slowness the woman channeled to make a light and moghedien saw only the light it had to besaidin вђ among the living only the chosen knew how to tap the true powerвђ the power that came from the dark one вђ and few were fool enough to except in direst need вђ but that was impossibleblurring quickness the woman named herself aranвђgar and called moghedien by name she gave summons to the pit of doom and removed theaвђdam necklace flinching at pain no woman should have felt againвђ how many times had she done this вђ again moghedien wove a small gateway in the tent she skimmed to give herself time to think in the endless dark but no sooner did she step onto her platform like a small enclosed marble balcony complete with a comfortable chair than she arrived on the black slopes of shayol ghul forever shrouded in twilight where vents and tunnels emitted steam and smoke and harsh vapors and a myrddraal came to her in its dead black garb like a slugwhite eyeless man but taller more massive than any other halfman it regarded her arrogantly and gave its odd name unbidden and commanded her to come these were not things myrddraal did with the chosen now she screamed in the depths of her mind for the dream to move faster to blur beyond seeing beyond knowing but now as she followed shaidar haranвђs back into the entrance to the pit of doom now all flowed at its normal pace and seemed more real thantelвђaranвђrhiod or the waking world tears leaked from moghedienвђs eyes down cheeks that already glistened she twitched on her hard pallet arms and legs jerking as she fought desperately futilely to wake she was no longer aware that she dreamed вђ all seemed real вђ but deep memories remained and in those depths instinct shrieked and clawed for escape she was well familiar with the sloping tunnel ceilinged in stone daggers like fangs the walls glowing with pale light many times she had made this downward journey since the day so long ago when she first came to make obeisance to the great lard and pledge her soul but never as now never with her failure known in all its magnitude always before she had managed to hide failures even from the great lord many times things could be done here that could be done nowhere else things could happen here that could happen nowhere else she gave a start as one of the stone fangs brushed her hair then gathered herself as best she could those spikes and blades still cleared the strange tootall myrddraal easily but though it overtopped her by head and shoulders and more she was forced to move her head around their points now reality was clay to the great lord here and he often made his displeasure known so a stone tooth struck her shoulder and she ducked to go under another there was no longer enough height in the tunnel for her to straighten as she walked she bent lower scurrying crouched in the myrddraalвђs wake trying to get closer its stride never changed but no matter how quickly she scuttled the interval between them did not lessen the ceiling descending the great lordвђs fangs to rend traitors and fools and moghedien dropped to hands and knees crawling then flattened to elbows and knees light flared and flickered in the tunnel cast from the entrance to the pit itself just ahead and moghedien slithered on her belly pulled herself along with her hands pushed with her feet stone points dug at her flesh caught at her dress panting she wriggled the last distance to the sound of ripping wool staring back over her shoulder she shivered convulsively where the tunnel mouth should have been stood a smooth stone wall perhaps the great lord had timed it all exactly and perhaps had she been slower the ledge on which she lay projected above a blackmottled red lake of molten rock where flames the size of men danced and died and reappeared overhead the cavern rose roofless through the mountain to a sky where wild clouds raced striated red and yellow and black as if on the winds of time themselves it was not the darkclouded sky seen outside on shayol ghul none of that earned a second glance and not just because she had seen it many times the bore into the great lordвђs place of imprisonment was no closer here than anywhere else in the world but here she could feel it here she could bathe in the radiant glory of the great lord the true power washed around her so strong here that attempting to channel it would fry her to a cinder not that she had any desire to pay the price elsewhere either she started to push up to her knees and something struck her between the shoulder blades driving her down hard onto the stone ledge crushing the air from her lungs stunned she struggled for breath then stared back up over her shoulder the myrddraal stood with one massive boot planted firmly on her back almost she embracedsaidar though channeling here without express permission was a good way to die the arrogance on the slopes above was one thing but this do you know who i am she demanded i am moghedien that eyeless gaze watched her as it might an insect she had often seen myrddraal look at ordinary humans that way moghedien that voice inside her head flushed away all thought of the myrddraal it nearly flushed away all thought beside this any human loverвђs deepest embrace was a drop of water beside the ocean how deep is your failure moghedien the chosen are always the strongest but you let yourself be captured you taught those who would oppose me moghedien eyelids fluttering she fought for coherence great lord i taught them only small things and i fought them as i could i taught them a supposed way to detect a man channeling she managed to laugh practicing it gives them such headaches they cannot channel for hours silence perhaps as well they had given up trying to learn that long before her rescue but the great lord did not need to know that great lord you know how i have served you i serve in the shadows and your enemies never feel my bite until my venom is working she did not quite dare say she had deliberately let herself be captured to work from within but she could suggest great lord you know how many of your enemies i brought down in the war of power from the shadows unseen or if seen ignored because i could not possibly be a threat silence and then my chosen are always the strongest my hand moves that voice reverberating in her skull turned her bones to boiling honey and her brain to fire the myrddraal had her chin in its hand forcing her head up before her vision cleared enough to see the knife in its other hand all her dreams were to end here in a slit throat her body going to feed the trollocs perhaps shaidar haran would save a choice cut for itself perhaps no she knew she was going to die but this myrddraal would not eat one shred of her she reached to embracesaidar and her eyes bulged there was nothing there nothing it was as if she had been severed she knew she had not вђ it was said that tearing was the deepest pain anyone could know beyond any power to deaden вђ but вђ in those stunned moments the myrddraal forced her mouth open scraped the blade along her tongue then nicked her ear and as it straightened with her blood and saliva she knew even before it produced what appeared to be a tiny fragile cage of gold wire and crystal some things could only be done here some only to those who could channel and she had brought a number of men and women for this very purpose no she breathed her eyes could not leave thecourвђsouvra no not me not me ignoring her shaidar haran scraped the fluids from the knife onto thecourвђsouvra the crystal turned a milky pink the first setting with a flick of its wrist it tossed the mindtrap out over the lake of molten stone for the second the goldandcrystal cage arched through the air and suddenly stopped floating at the very spot where it seemed the bore was the place where the pattern lay thinnest of all moghedien forgot the myrddraal she flung out her hands toward the bore mercy great lord she had never noticed that the great lord of the dark possessed any mercy but had she been bound in a cell with rabid wolves or with adarathin moult she would have begged the same in the right circumstances you begged even for the impossible thecourвђsouvra hung in midair turning slowly glittering in the light of leaping fires below i have served you with all my heart great lord i beg mercy i beg mercyyyyyyy you may serve me still the voice flung her into ecstasy beyond knowing but at the same instant the sparkling mindtrap suddenly glowed like the sun and in the midst of rapture she knew pain as if she had been immersed in the fiery lake they blended and she howled thrashing like a mad thing thrashing in endless pain endless until after ages after nothing remained but agony and the memory of agony the tiny mercy of darkness overwhelmed her moghedien stirred on the pallet not again please she barely recognized the woman who entered the tent where she was held prisoner please she shrieked in the depths of her mind the woman channeled to make a light and moghedien saw only the light deep in sleep she quivered vibrating from head to toe please the woman named herself aranвђgar and called moghedien by name she gave summons to the pit of doom and вђ wake woman said a voice like rotted bone crumbling and moghedienвђs eyes popped open she almost wished for the dream back no door or window broke the featureless stone walls of her small prison and there were no glowbulbs or even lamps but light came from somewhere she did not know how many days she had been there only that tasteless food appeared at irregular intervals that the single bucket serving for sanitation was emptied at even more irregular times and soap and a bucket of perfumed water were somehow left for her to clean herself she was not sure whether that was a mercy or not the glad thrill at seeing a bucket of water reminded her how far she had fallen shaidar haran was in the cell with her now hurriedly rolling from her pallet she knelt and put her face to the bare stone floor she had always done whatever was necessary for survival and the myrddraal had been all too glad to teach her what was necessary i greet you eagerly miaвђcova the lashedtogether title burned on her tongue one who owns me it meant or simply my owner the strange shield shaidar haran had used on her вђ myrddraal could not but it did вђ the shield was not in evidence yet she did not consider channeling the true power was denied her of course вђ that could be drawn only with the great lordвђs blessing вђ but the source tantalized though the glow just beyond sight seemed somehow odd she still did not consider it every time the myrddraal visited it displayed her mindtrap channeling too near your own courвђsouvrawas extremely painful the nearer the more the pain this close she did not think she would survive a simple touch on the source and that was the least of the mindtrapвђs dangers shaidar haran chuckled a rasp of dried cracked leather that was another difference about this myrddraal far more cruel than trollocs who were merely bloodthirsty myrddraal were cold and dispassionate in it shaidar haran often showed amusement though so far she felt lucky to have only bruises most women would have been on the brink of madness by now if not beyond and are you eager to obey that rustling grating voice asked yes i am eager to obey miaвђcova whatever was necessary to survive but she still gasped when cold fingers suddenly tangled in her hair she scrambled to her feet on her own as much as possible but still was hauled up at least this time her feet remained on the floor the myrddraal studied her expressionless remembering past visits it required an effort not to flinch or scream or simply reach for saidarand make an end close your eyes it told her and keep them closed until you are commanded to open them moghedienвђs eyes snapped shut one of shaidar haranвђs lessons had been instant obedience besides with her eyes closed she could try to pretend that she was somewhere else whatever was necessary abruptly the hand in her hair rushed her forward and she screamed in spite of herself the myrddraal meant to run her into the wall her hands went up for protection and shaidar haran released her she staggered at least ten steps вђ but her cell was not ten paces corner to corner wood smoke she smelled a faint touch of wood smoke she kept her eyelids firmly closed though she meant to continue with no more than bruises and as few bruises as possible for as long as she could manage you can look now a deep voice said she did cautiously the speaker was a tall broadshouldered young man in black boots and breeches and a flowing white shirt unlaced at the top who watched her with startlingly blue eyes from a deep cushioned armchair in front of a marble fireplace where flames danced along long logs she stood in a woodpaneled room that might have belonged to a wealthy merchant or noble of moderate rank in this time the furniture lightly carved and touched with gilt the rugs woven in redandgold arabesques she did not doubt it was somewhere close by shayol ghul though it did not have the feel of telвђaranвђrhiod the only other possibility swiveling her head hastily she drew a deep breath the myrddraal was nowhere to be seen tight bands of cuandeseemed to vanish from around her chest did you enjoy your time in the vacuole moghedien felt icy fingers dig into her scalp she was no researcher or maker but she knew that word she did not even think to ask how a young man of this time did too sometimes there were bubbles in the pattern though someone like mesaana would say that was too simple an explanation vacuoles could be entered if you knew how and manipulated much like the rest of the world вђ researchers had often done great experiments in vacuoles so she vaguely remembered hearing вђ but they were outside the pattern really and sometimes they closed up or perhaps broke off and drifted away even mesaana could not say what happened вђ except that anything in them at the time was gone forever how long she was surprised her voice was so steady she rounded on the young man who sat there showing her white teeth i said how long or donвђt you know i saw you arrive he paused lifting a silver goblet from the table beside his chair eyes smiling at her over the rim as he drank the night before last she could not hide a relieved gasp the only reason anyone would want to enter a vacuole was that time flowed differently there sometimes slower sometimes faster sometimes much faster she would not have been entirely surprised to learn that the great lord had really imprisoned her for a hundred years or a thousand to emerge into a world already his to make her way feeding among carrion while the other chosen stood at the pinnacle she was still one of the chosen in her own mind at least until the great lord himself said she was not she had never heard of anyone being released once a mindtrap was set but she would find a way there was always a way for those who were cautious while those fell who called caution cowardice she herself had carried a few of that socalled brave sort to shayol ghul to be fitted with courвђsouvra suddenly it occurred to her that this fellow knew a great deal for a friend of the dark especially one not many years past twenty he swung one leg over an arm of the chair lounging insolently under her scrutiny graendal might have snatched him if he had any position or power only too strong a chin kept him from being pretty enough she did not think she had ever seen eyes so blue with his insolence in her very face and what she had had to endure at shaidar haranвђs hands so fresh with the source calling her and the myrddraal gone she considered teaching this young friend of the dark a sharp lesson the fact that her clothes were grimy added their part she herself smelled faintly of the perfume in the wash water but she had had no way to clean the rough woolen dress in which she fled egwene alвђvere with its rips from her journey down to the pit prudence prevailed вђ this room must be close to shayol ghul вђ but barely what is your name she demanded do you have any idea who you are speaking to yes i do moghedien you may call me moridin moghedien gasped not for the name any fool could call himself death but a tiny black fleck just large enough to see floated straight across one of those blue eyes and then across the other in the same line this moridin had tapped into the true power and more than once much more she knew that some men who could channel survived in this time aside from alвђthor вђ this fellow was much of a size with alвђthor вђ but she had not expected the great lord to allow one that particular honor an honor with a bite as any of the chosen knew in the long run the true power was far more addictive than the one power a strong will could hold down the desire to draw more saidaror saidin but she herself did not believe the will existed strong enough to resist the true power not once the saaappeared in your eyes the final price was different but no less terrible you have been given distinction greater than you know she told him as though her filthy dress was the finest streith she took the armchair opposite him bring me some of that wine and i will tell you only twentynine others have ever been granted вђ to her shock he laughed you misapprehend moghedien you still serve the great lord but not quite as you once did the time for playing your own games has passed if you had not managed to do some good by accident you would be dead now i am one of the chosen boy she said fury burning through caution she sat up straight facing him with all the knowledge of an age that made his little different from times of mud huts as much of that knowledge as she had anyway and in some areas concerning the one power no one outstripped her she almost embraced the source no matter how close shayol ghul lay your mother probably used my name to frighten you not so many years gone but know that grown men who could crumple you like a rag sweated when they heard it you will watch your tongue with me he reached into the open neck of his shirt and her own tongue clove to the roof of her mouth her eyes fixed on the small cage of gold wire and bloodred crystal that he drew out dangling on a cord she thought vaguely that he tucked another just like it back in but she had eyes only for her own it definitely was hers his thumb stroked and she felt that caress across her mind her soul breaking a mindtrap did not require much more pressure than he was using she could be on the other side of the world or farther and it would not matter a hair the part of her that was herwould be separated she would still see with her eyes and hear with her ears taste what crossed her tongue and feel what touched her but helpless within an automaton that was utterly obedient to whoever held the courвђsouvra whether or not there was any way to get free of it a mindtrap was just what its name implied she could feel the blood draining from her face you understand now he said you still serve the great lord but now it will be by doing as i say i understand miaвђcova she said automatically again he laughed a deep rich sound that mocked her as he put the mindtrap away beneath his shirt there is no need for that now youвђve had your lesson i will call you moghedien and you will call me moridin you are still one of the chosen who is there to replace you yes of course moridin she said tonelessly whatever he said she knew that she was owned chapter sunburst the irrevocable words morgase lay awake staring at the ceiling through the moonlit darkness and tried to think of her daughter a single pale linen sheet covered her but despite the heat she sweated in a thick woolen sleeping gown laced tightly to the neck sweat hardly mattered no matter how many times she bathed no matter how hot the water she did not feel clean elayne must be safe in the white tower at times it seemed years since she could make herself trust aes sedai yet whatever the paradox the tower was surely the safest place for elayne she tried to think of gawyn вђ he would be in tar valon with his sister full of his pride for her so earnest in his desire to be her shield when she needed one вђ and of galad вђ why would they not let her see him she loved him as much as if he had come out of her own body and in so many ways he needed it more than the other two she tried to think of them it was difficult to think of anything except wide eyes stared up into the darkness glistening with unshed tears she had always thought she was brave enough to do whatever needed doing to face whatever came she had always believed she could pick herself up and continue to fight in one endless hour without leaving more than a few bruises that were already fading rhadam asunawa had begun teaching her differently eamon valda had completed her education with one question the bruise her answer had left on her heart had not faded she should have gone back to asunawa herself and told him to do his worst she should have she prayed that elayne was safe perhaps it was not fair to hope more for elayne than for galad or gawyn but elayne would be the next queen of andor the tower would not miss the chance to put an aes sedai on the lion throne if only she could see elayne see all her children once more something rustled in the dark bedchamber and she held her breath fought against trembling the faint moonlight barely let her make out the bedposts valda had ridden north from amador yesterday him and asunawa with thousands of whitecloaks to face the prophet but if he had come back if he a shape in the darkness resolved into a woman too short for lini i thought you might still be awake breaneвђs voice said softly drink this it will help the cairhienin woman tried to put a silvery cup into morgaseвђs hand it gave off a slightly sour smell wait until youвђre summoned to bring me drink she snapped pushing the cup away warm liquid spilled onto her hand onto the linen sheet i was almost asleep when you came stamping in she lied leave me instead of obeying the woman stood looking down at her face shadowed morgase did not like breane taborwin whether breane truly was nobly born and come down in the world as she sometimes claimed or merely a servant who had learned to counterfeit her betters she obeyed when and as she chose and let her tongue run entirely too free as she proved now you moan like a sheep morgase trakand even kept low her voice seethed in anger she set the cup on the small bedside table with a thump more of the contents splashed onto the tabletop bah many others have seen far worse you are alive none of your bones are broken your wits are whole endure let the past pass and go on with your life you have been so much on edge that the men walk on their toes even master gill lamgwin has hardly slept a wink these three nights morgase flushed with annoyance even in andor servants did not speak so she caught the womanвђs arm in a tight grip but anxiety warred with displeasure they donвђt know do they if they did they would try to avenge her rescue her they would die tallanvor would die lini and i drape linen over their eyes for you breane sneered pulling her hand away and flinging it back at her if i could save lamgwin i would let them know you for the bleating sheep you are he sees the light made flesh in you i see a woman without courage to accept the day i will not let you destroy him with your cowardice cowardice outrage welled up in morgase yet no words came her fingers knotted in the sheet she did not think she could have decided in cold blood to lie with valda but had she she could have lived with it she thought she could another matter entirely to say yes because she feared facing asunawaвђs knotted cords and needles again feared worse that he would have gotten to eventually however she had screamed under asunawaвђs ministrations valda was the one who had showed her the true borders of her courage so far short of where she had believed valdaвђs touch his bed could be forgotten with time but she would never be able to wash the shame of that yes from her lips breane hurled the truth in her face and she did not know how to reply she was spared the need by a rush of boots in the outer room the bedchamber door flung open and a running man stopped a pace inside so youвђre awake good tallanvorвђs voice said after a moment which allowed her heart to start beating again allowed her to breathe she tried to release breaneвђs hand вђ she did not remember clasping it вђ but to her surprise the woman squeezed once before letting go something is happening tallanvor went on striding to the lone window standing to one side as if to avoid being seen he peered into the night moonlight outlined his tall form master gill come and tell what you saw a head appeared in the doorway bald top shining in the darkness behind in the other room a hulking shadow moved lamgwin dorn when basel gill realized she was still in bed that faint shining from his scalp jerked as he directed his eyes elsewhere though he probably had difficulty making out more than the bed itself master gill was even wider than lamgwin but not nearly as tall forgive me my queen i didnвђt mean to he cleared his throat violently and his boots scraped on the floor shifting had he had a cap he would have been turning it in his hands or wadding it nervously i was in the long corridor on my way to to to the jakes was what he could not bring himself to say to her anyway i glanced out one of the windows and i saw a a big bird i think land on top of the south barracks a bird liniвђs thin voice drove master gill to leap into the room clearing the doorway or maybe it was a sharp poke in his stout ribs lini usually took every advantage her gray hair offered she stalked by him still belting her nightrobe fools oxbrained lummoxes you woke my chвђ she stopped with a fierce cough lini never forgot that she had been morgaseвђs nurse and her motherвђs as well but she never slipped in front of others she would be cross that she had now and it showed in her voice you woke your queen for a bird patting her hairnet she automatically tucked in a few strands that had escaped in her sleep have you been drinking basel gill morgase wondered that herself i donвђt know it was a bird master gill protested it didnвђt look like any bird but what else flies except bats it was big men climbed off its back and there was another still on its neck when it took off again while i was slapping my face to wake up another of the things landed and more men climbed down and then another came and i decided it was time to tell lord tallanvor lini did not sniff but morgase could almost feel her stare and it was not directed at her the man who had abandoned his inn to follow her certainly felt it the lightвђs own truth my queen he insisted light tallanvor announced like an echo something something just landed atop the north barracks morgase had never heard him sound shaken before all she wanted was to make them all go away and leave her alone in her misery but there seemed no hope tallanvor was worse than breane in many ways much worse my robe she said and for once breane was quick to hand her one master gill hastily turned his face to the wall while she climbed from the bed and put on the silk robe she strode to the window tying the sash the long north barracks loomed across the wide courtyard four hulking floors of flatroofed dark stone not a light showed there or anywhere in the fortress all was stillness and silence i see nothing tallanvor he drew her back just watch he said another time she would have regretted his hand leaving her shoulder and been irritated at her own regret as well as his tone now after valda she felt relief and irritation at the relief as well as his tone he was too disrespectful by miles far too stubborn too young not much older than galad shadows moved as the moon did but nothing else stirred off in the city of amador a dog bayed answered by more then as she opened her mouth to dismiss tallanvor and all of them darkness atop the massive barracks humped up and hurled itself off the roof something tallanvor had called it and she had no better name an impression of a long body that seemed thicker than a man was tall great ribbed wings like a batвђs sweeping down as the creature fell toward the courtyard a figure a man sitting just behind a sinuous neck and then the wings caught air and the something soared up blocking the moonlight as it swept over her head trailing a long thin tail morgase closed her mouth slowly the only thought that came to her was shadowspawn trollocs and myrddraal were not the only shadowtwisted creatures in the blight she had never been taught of anything like this but her tutors in the tower said that things lived there no one had ever seen clearly and lived to describe how could it be so far south though abruptly a flash of light flared with a great boom in the direction of the main gates and then again at two more places along the great outer wall those were gates too she believed what in the pit of doom was that tallanvor muttered in a moment of silence before alarm gongs began resounding in the darkness shouts rose and screams and hoarse cries like some sort of horn fire leaped with a crash of thunder then again elsewhere the one power morgase breathed she might not be able to channel or as well as not but she could tell that notions of shadowspawn fled it it must be aes sedai she heard someoneвђs breath catch behind her lini or breane basel gill excitedly murmured aes sedai and lamgwin murmured back too low for her to understand off in the darkness metal clashed on metal fire bellowed and lightning streaked from the cloudless sky faintly through the din came alarm bells from the city at last but strangely few aes sedai tallanvor sounded doubtful why now to rescue you morgase i thought they couldnвђt use the power against men only shadowspawn besides if that winged creature wasnвђt shadowspawn i will never see one you donвђt know what you are talking about she said confronting him heatedly you вђ a crossbow bolt clashed against the windowframe in a spray of stone chips air stirred against her face as it ricocheted between them and planted itself in one of the bedposts with a solid tchunk a few inches to the right and all her troubles would have been ended she did not move but tallanvor pulled her away from the window with an oath even by moonlight she could see his frown as he studied her for a moment she thought he might touch her face if he did she did not know whether she would weep or scream or order him to leave her forever or instead he said more likely itвђs some of those men those shamin or whatever they call themselves he insisted on accepting the strange impossible tales that had seeped even into the fortress i think i can get you out right now everything will be confusion come with me she did not correct him few people knew anything about the one power much less the differences between saidarand saidin his idea had its attractions they might be able to escape in the bedlam of a battle take her out into that lini screeched flaring lights drowned the moon at the window crashes and thunders drowned the din of men and swords i thought you had more wits martyn tallanvor вђonly fools kiss hornets or bite fireвђ you heard her say itвђs aes sedai do you think she doesnвђt know do you my lord if it is aes sedai master gill trailed off tallanvorвђs hands fell away from her and he grumbled under his breath wishing he had a sword pedron niall had allowed him to keep his blade eamon valda was not so trusting for an instant disappointment swelled in her breast if only he had insisted had dragged her what was the matter with her had he tried to drag her anywhere for any reason she would have had his hide she needed to take hold of herself valda had dented her confidence вђ no he had casually ripped it to shreds вђ but she must cling to those shreds and knit them up again somehow if the tatters were worth knitting up again at least i can find out what is happening tallanvor growled striding for the door if it isnвђt your aes sedai вђ no you will remain here please she was very glad of the pale darkness hiding her furiously flushing face she would have bitten her tongue off before saying that last word but it had slipped out before she knew she went on in firmer tones you will remain here guarding your queen as you should in the dun light she could see his face and his bow seemed quite proper but she would have wagered her last copper both were angry i will be in your anteroom well there was no doubt about his voice for once though she cared neither how angry he was nor how little he hid it very possibly she might kill the infuriating man with her own hands but he was not going to die tonight cut down by soldiers with no way to tell which side he was on there was no hope of sleep now even had she been able without lighting any lamps she washed her face and teeth breane and lini helped her dress in blue silk slashed with green with spills of snowy lace at her wrists and beneath her chin it would do very well for receiving aes sedai saidarraged in the night they had to be aes sedai who else could it be when she joined the men in the anteroom they were sitting in darkness except for the moonlight through the windows and the occasional flash of powerwrought fire even a candle might attract unwanted attention lamgwin and master gill sprang from their chairs respectfully tallanvor stood more slowly and she needed no light to know he regarded her with a sullen frown furious that she had to ignore him вђ she was his queen вђ furious and barely able to keep it from her voice she ordered lamgwin to bring more of the tall wooden chairs further from the windows in silence they sat and waited at least silence on their part outside thunderous crashes and roars still echoed horns cried and men shouted and through it she felt saidarsurge and fall and surge again slowly after at least an hour the battle dwindled and died voices still shouted incomprehensible orders wounded screamed and sometimes those strange hoarse horns gave voice but no more did steel ring on steel saidarfaded she was sure women still held it inside the fortress but she did not think any channeled now all seemed close to peaceful after the clamor and commotion tallanvor stirred but she waved him back before he could rise for a moment she thought he would not obey night weakened and sunlight crept in through the windows shining on tallanvorвђs glower she held her hands still in her lap patience was but one of the virtues that young man needed to learn patience stood second only to courage as a noble virtue the sun rose higher lini and breane began whispering together in increasingly worried tones shooting glances in her direction tallanvor scowled dark eyes smoldering sitting rigid in that dark blue coat that fit him so well master gill fidgeted running first one hand then the other across his grayfringed head mopping his pink cheeks with a handkerchief lamgwin slouched in his chair the onetime street toughвђs heavylidded eyes making him seem half asleep but whenever he glanced at breane a smile flickered on his scarred brokennosed face morgase focused on her breathing almost like the exercises she had done during her months in the tower patience if someone did not come soon she was going to have sharp words to say aes sedai or not despite herself she jumped at an abrupt pounding on the door to the hallway before she could tell breane to see who was there the door swung open banging against the wall morgase stared at who entered a tall dark hooknosed man stared back at her coldly the long hilt of a sword rising above his shoulder strange armor covered his chest overlapping plates lacquered glistening gold and black and he held a helmet on his hip that looked like an insectвђs head black and gold and green with three long thin green plumes two more armored like him came at his heels wearing their helmets though without plumes their armor seemed painted rather than lacquered and they carried crossbows ready still more stood in the hall outside with goldandblack tasseled spears tallanvor and lamgwin and even stout master gill scrambled to their feet placing themselves between her and her peculiar visitors she had to push a way through the hooknosed manвђs eyes went straight to her before she could demand an explanation you are morgase queen of andor his voice was harsh and he drawled his words so badly she barely understood he stepped on her reply you will come with me alone he added as tallanvor and lamgwin and master gill all moved forward the crossbowmen presented their weapons the heavy quarrels looked made to punch holes in armor a man would hardly slow one down i have no objection to my people remaining here until i return she said a good more calmly than she felt who were these people she was familiar with the accents of every nation familiar with their armor i am sure you will see to my safety very well captain he did not supply a name only motioned curtly for her to follow to her vast relief tallanvor made no fuss despite his hot gaze to her vast irritation master gill and lamgwin looked to him before stepping back in the hallway the soldiers formed around her the hooknosed officer and the two crossbowmen in the lead a guard of honor she tried to tell herself this soon after a battle wandering around unprotected was worse than foolish there might be holdouts who would seize a hostage or kill any who saw them she wished she believed that she tried questioning the officer but he never spoke a word never slackened his stride or turned his head and she stopped trying none of the soldiers so much as glanced at her they were hardeyed men of the kind she knew from her own queenвђs guards men who had seen fighting before more than once but who were they their boots struck the floorstones as one in an ominous drumbeat emphasized by the stark fortress corridors there was little color nothing for beauty except scattered tapestries showing whitecloaks in bloody battle she realized they were taking her toward the lord captain commanderвђs quarters and a queasiness settled in the pit of her stomach she had grown almost pleasantly accustomed to the way while pedron niall lived she had come to dread it in the few days since he died вђ but as they rounded a corner she started at the sight of some two dozen archers marching behind their own officer men in baggy trousers and boiled leather breastplates painted in horizontal stripes of blue and black each man wore a conical steel cap with a veil of gray steel mail covering his face to the eyes here and there the ends of mustaches dangled below the veils the archersвђ officer bowed to the one leading her guard who merely raised his hand in reply taraboners she had not seen a taraboner soldier in a good many years but those men were taraboners in spite of those stripes or she would eat her slippers yet that made no sense tarabon was chaos come to life a hundredsided civil war between pretenders to the throne and dragonsworn tarabon could never have launched this attack on amador itself unless incredibly one claimant had won out over the rest and over the dragonsworn and it was impossible and it did not explain these strangely armored soldiers or that winged beast or she thought she had seen strangeness she thought she had known queasiness then she and her guard turned another corner and encountered two women one was slender short as any cairhienin and darker than any tairen in a blue dress that stopped well short of her ankles silver lightning forked across red panels on her breast and the sides of her wide divided skirts the other woman in drab dark gray stood taller than most men with golden hair to her shoulders that had been brushed till it glistened and frightened green eyes a silver leash connected a silver bracelet on the shorter womanвђs wrist to a necklace worn by the taller they stood aside for morgaseвђs guard and when the hooknosed officer murmured derвђsulвђdam вђ morgase thought that was it his slurred accent made understanding difficult вђ when he murmured in tones nearly but not quite to an equal the dark woman bowed her head slightly twitched at the leash and the goldenhaired woman sank to the floor folding herself with her head on her knees and her palms flat on the floorstones as morgase and her guards passed by the dark woman bent to pat the other fondly on the head as she might a dog and worse the kneeling woman looked up with pleasure and gratitude morgase made the necessary effort to keep walking to keep her knees from folding to keep her stomach from emptying itself the sheer servility was bad enough but she was certain the woman being patted on the head could channel impossible she walked in a daze wondering whether this could be a dream a nightmare praying that it was she had a vague awareness of stopping for more soldiers these in redandblack armor then pedron nailвђs audience chamber вђ valdaвђs now or rather whoever had taken the fortress вђ was changed the great golden sunburst remained set in the floor but all niallвђs captured banners which valda had kept as if they were his were gone and so were the furnishings except for the plainly carved highbacked chair niall and then valda had used flanked now by two tall luridly painted screens one showed a whitecrested black bird of prey with a cruel beak its whitetipped wings spread wide the other a blackspotted yellow cat with one paw on a dead deerlike creature half its size with long straight horns and white stripes there were a number of people in the room but that was all she had time to notice before a sharpfaced woman in blue robes stepped forward one side of her head shaved and the remaining hair in a long brown braid that hung in front of her right shoulder her blue eyes full of contempt could have done for the eagleвђs or the catвђs you are in the presence of the high lady suroth who leads those who come before and succors the return she intoned in that same slurring accent without warning the hooknosed officer seized the back of morgaseвђs neck and bore her down prostrate beside him stunned not least because the breath was knocked out of her she saw him kiss the floor release her elbar another woman drawled angrily the queen of andor is not to be treated so the man elbar rose as far as his knees head bent i abase myself high lady i beg forgiveness his voice was as cold and flat as that accent allowed i have small forgiveness for this elbar morgase looked up suroth took her aback the sides of her head were shaved leaving a glossy black crest across the top of her head and a mane that flowed down her back perhaps when you are punished report yourself now leave me go a sweeping gesture flashed fingernails at least an inch long the first two on each hand a glistening blue elbar bowed on his knees then rose smoothly backing away through the door for the first time morgase realized none of the other soldiers had followed them in she realized something else as well he gave her one final glance before he vanished and instead of flickering resentment for the one who had caused his punishment he considered there would be no punishment the entire exchange had been arranged beforehand suroth swept toward morgase carefully holding her pale blue robe to keep her skirts exposed snowwhite with hundreds of tiny pleats embroidered vines and lush red and yellow flowers spread across the robe for all her sweeping morgase noticed the woman did not reach her until she had regained her feet on her own you are unharmed suroth asked if you are harmed i will double his punishment morgase brushed at her dress so she would not have to look at the false smile that never touched the womanвђs eyes she took the opportunity to look around the room four men and four women knelt against one wall all young and more than goodlooking all wearing she jerked her eyes away those long white robes were very nearly transparent at the far sides of the screens two more pairs of women knelt one of each in the gray dress one in the blue embroidered with lightning bound by the silvery leash from wrist to neck morgase was not close enough to say for sure but she had the sickmaking certainty that the grayclad women could channel i am quite all right thank вђ a huge reddish brown shape lay sprawled on the floor вђ a heap of tanned cowskins perhaps then it heaved what is that she managed not to gape but the question popped from her tongue before she could stop it you admire my lopar suroth swept away a good deal quicker than she had come the enormous shape raised a great round head for her to stroke it under the chin with a knuckle the creature put morgase in mind of a bear though it was easily half again as big as the largest bear she had ever heard tell of and hairless to boot with no muzzle to speak of and heavy ridges surrounding its eyes almandaragal was given to me as a pup for my first truename day he foiled the first attempt to kill me that same year when he was only a quarter grown there was real affection in the womanвђs voice the loparвђs lips peeled back to reveal thick pointed teeth as she stroked its forepaws flexed claws sheathing and unsheathing from six long toes on each and it began to purr a bass rumble fit for a hundred cats remarkable morgase said faintly truename day how many attempts had there been to kill this woman that she could speak of the first so casually the loparwhined briefly when suroth left it but quickly settled with its head on its paws disconcertingly its eyes did not follow her but settled mainly on morgase now and then flicking toward the door or the narrow arrowslit windows of course however loyal a lopar it cannot match damane no affection touched surothвђs voice now pura and jinjin could slay a hundred assassins before almandaragal blinked his eye at the mention of each name one of the blueclad women twitched her silvery leash and the woman at the other end doubled herself as the one in the corridor had we have many more damanesince returning than before this is a rich hunting ground for marathвђdamane pura she added casually was once a woman of the white tower morgaseвђs knees wobbled aes sedai she studied the bent back of the woman called pura refusing to believe no aes sedai could be made to cringe like that but any woman who could channel not just an aes sedai should be able to take that leash and strangle her tormentor anyone at all should be able to no this pura could not be morgase wondered if she dared ask for a chair that is very interesting at least her voice was steady but i do not think you asked me here to speak of aes sedai of course she had not been asked suroth stared at her not a muscle moving except that the longnailed fingers of her left hand twitched thera the sharpfaced woman with half her head shaved barked suddenly kaf for the high lady and her guest one of the women in diaphanous robes the eldest but still young leaped gracefully to her feet her rosebud mouth had a petulant look to it but she darted behind the tall screen painted with the eagle and in moments reappeared bearing a silver tray with two small white cups kneeling sinuously before suroth she bowed her dark head as she raised the tray so her offering stood higher than she morgase shook her head any servant in andor asked to do that вђ or wear that robe вђ would have stormed off in a dudgeon who are you where do you come from suroth raised one of the cups on her fingertips inhaling the steam rising from it her nod was entirely too much permission for morgaseвђs liking but she took a cup anyway one sip and she stared into her drink in amazement blacker than any tea the liquid was also more bitter no amount of honey would make it drinkable suroth put her own cup to her lips and sighed with enjoyment there are many things we must speak of morgase yet i will be brief at this first talk we seanchan return to reclaim what was stolen from the heirs of the high king artur paendrag tanreall pleasure over the kaf became a different pleasure in her voice both expectation and certainty and she watched morgaseвђs face closely morgase could not take her eyes away what was ours will be ours again in truth it always has been a thief gains no ownership i have begun the recovery in tarabon many nobles of that land have already sworn to obey await and serve it will not be long before all have their king вђ i cannot recall his name вђ died opposing me had he lived in rebellion against the crystal throne and not even of the blood he would have been impaled his family could not be found to be made property but there is a new king and a new panarch who have sworn their fealty to the empress may she live forever and the crystal throne the bandits will be eradicated no longer will there be strife or hunger in tarabon but the people will shelter beneath the wings of the empress now i begin in this amadicia soon all will kneel to the empress may she live forever the direct descendant of the great artur hawkwing if the serving woman had not gone with the tray morgase would have put her cup back no tremor disturbed the dark surface of the kaf but much of what the woman spouted was meaningless to her empress seanchan there had been wild rumors a year or more ago about artur hawkwingвђs armies come back from across the aryth ocean but only the most credulous could have believed and she doubted that the worst gossipmonger in the markets still told the tale could it have been truth in any case what she did understand was more than enough all honor the name of artur hawkwing suroth the sharpfaced woman opened her mouth angrily subsiding at the move of a bluenailed finger by the high lady but his time is long past every nation here has an ancient lineage no land will surrender to you or your empress if you have taken some part of tarabon surothвђs indrawn breath hissed and her eyes glittered remember that it is a troubled land divided against itself amadicia will not fall easily and many nations will ride to her aid when they learn of you couldit be true however many you are you will find no easy game for your spit we have faced great threats before and overcome them i advise you to make peace before you are crushed morgase remembered saidarraging in the night and avoided looking at the вђ damane had she called them by strong effort she managed not to wet her lips suroth smiled that maskвђs smile again eyes shining like polished stones all must make choices some will choose to obey await and serve and will rule their lands in the name of the empress may she live forever she took a hand from her cup to gesture a slight movement of long fingernails and the sharpfaced woman barked thera poses of the swan for some reason surothвђs mouth tightened not the swan alwhin you blind fool she hissed half under her breath though her accent made understanding difficult the frozen smile returned in an instant the serving woman rose from her place at the wall again running out to the middle of the floor in an odd way on tiptoe with her arms swept back slowly atop the flaring golden sun symbol of the children of the light she began a sort of stylized dance her arms unfolded to the sides like wings then folded back twisting she slid her left foot out lowering herself over the bending knee both arms outstretched as if appealing until arms and body and right leg made a straight slanted line her sheer white robe made the whole thing scandalous morgase felt her cheeks growing hot as the dance if it could be called that continued thera is new and not well trained yet suroth murmured the poses are most often done with ten or twenty daвђcovaletogether men and women chosen for the clean beauty of their lines but sometimes it is pleasant to view only one it is very pleasant to own beautiful things is it not morgase frowned how could anyone own a person suroth had spoken earlier about making someone property she knew the old tongue and the word daвђcovalewas not familiar to her but thinking it out she came up with person who is owned it was disgusting horrendous incredible she said dryly perhaps i should leave you to enjoy the dance in one moment suroth said smiling at the posturing thera morgase avoided looking all have choices to make as i said the old king of tarabon chose to rebel and died the old panarch was captured yet refused the oath each of us has a place where we belong unless raised by the empress but those who reject their proper place can also be cast down even to the depths thera has a certain grace strangely alwhin shows great promise in teaching so i expect that before many years thera will learn the skill in the poses to go with her grace that smile swiveled toward morgase that glittering gaze a very significant gaze but why something to do with the dancer her name mentioned so often as if to highlight it but what morgaseвђs head whipped around and she stared at the woman up on her toes and slowly pivoting in one spot with her hands flat together and arms stretched up as high as they would go i donвђt believe it she gasped i wonвђt thera suroth said what was your name before you became my property what title did you hold thera froze in her upstretched posture quivering shooting a look half panic half terror at sharpfaced alwhin a look of pure terror at suroth thera was called amathera if it pleases the high lady she said breathily thera was the panarch of tarabon if it pleases the high lady the cup dropped from morgaseвђs hand smashing to bits on the floor spraying the black kaf it had to be a lie she had never met amathera but she had heard a description once no many women of the right age could have large dark eyes and a petulant mouth pura had never been aes sedai and this woman pose alwhin snapped and thera flowed on without so much as one more glance at suroth or anyone whoever she was clearly the foremost thought in her head now was an urgent desire not to make a mistake morgase concentrated on not vomiting suroth stepped very close face cold as midwinter all confront choices she said quietly her voice could have marked steel some of my prisoners say that you spent time in the white tower by law no marathвђdamanemay escape the leash but i pledge to you that you who named me to my eyes and called lie on my word you will not face thatfate the emphasis made quite clear that her pledge covered no other possible fate the smile that never reached her eyes returned i hope that you will choose to swear the oath morgase and rule andor in the name of the empress may she live forever for the first time morgase was absolutely certain the woman lied i will speak to you again tomorrow or perhaps the next day if i have time turning away suroth glided past the lone dancer to the highbacked chair as she sat spreading her robe gracefully alwhin barked again she did not seem to have any other voice all poses of the swan the young men and women kneeling against the wall leaped forward to join thera joining her movements exactly in a line before surothвђs chair only the loparвђsgaze still acknowledged morgaseвђs existence she did not believe she had ever been dismissed so thoroughly in her life gathering her dignity with her skirts she left she did not go far alone of course those redandblack armored soldiers stood in the anteroom like statues with redandblack tasseled spears faces impassive in their lacquered helmets hard eyes seeming to stare from behind the mandibles of monstrous insects one not much taller than she fell in at her shoulder without a word and escorted her back to her rooms where two taraboners with swords flanked her door these in steel breastplates but still painted in horizontal stripes they bowed low hands on their knees and she thought it was for her until her escort spoke for the first time honor met he said in a harsh dry voice and the taraboners straightened never glancing at her until he said watch her well she has not given the oath dark eyes flickered toward her above steel veils but their short bows of assent were for the seanchan she tried not to hurry inside but once the door was closed behind her she leaned against it attempting to settle her whirling thoughts seanchan and damane empresses and oaths and people owned lini and breane stood in the middle of the room looking at her what did you learn lini asked patiently in much the tone in which she had questioned the child morgase about a book read nightmares and madness morgase sighed suddenly she stood up straight looking around the room anxiously whereas вђ where are the men breane answered the unasked question in a dryly mocking tone tallanvor went to see what he could find out her fists planted themselves on her hips and her face became deadly serious lamgwin went with him and master gill what did youfind out who are these seanchan she said the name awkwardly frowning around it we heard that much for ourselves she affected not to notice liniвђs biting stare what are we to do now morgase morgase brushed between the women crossing to the nearest window not as narrow as those in the audience chamber it looked down twenty feet or more to the stone paving of the courtyard a dispirited column of bareheaded disheveled men some with bloodstained bandages shambled across the courtyard under the watchful gaze of taraboners carrying spears several seanchan stood atop a nearby tower peering into the distance between the crenellations one wore a helmet decorated with three slender plumes a woman appeared in a window across the court the lightningembroidered red panel plain on her breast frowning down at the whitecloak prisoners those stumbling men looked stunned unable to believe what had happened what were they to do a decision morgase dreaded it seemed that she had not made so much as a decision on fruit for breakfast in months without it leading to disaster a choice suroth had said aid these seanchan in taking andor or one last service she could do for andor the tail end of the column appeared followed by more taraboners who were joined by their countrymen they passed a twentyfoot fall and suroth lost her lever maybe it was the cowardвђs way out but she had already proved herself that still the queen of andor should not die so under her breath she spoke the irrevocable words that had been used only twice before in the thousandyear history of andor under the light i relinquish the high seat of house trakand to elayne trakand under the light i renounce the rose crown and abdicate the lion throne to elayne high seat of house trakand under the light i submit myself to the will of elayne of andor her obedient subject none of that made elayne queen true but it cleared the way what are you smiling at lini asked morgase turned slowly i was thinking of elayne she did not think her old nurse had been close enough to hear what no one really needed to liniвђs eyes widened though and her breath caught you come away from there now she snapped and suiting actions to words seized her arm and physically pulled her from the window lini you forget yourself you stopped being my nurse a long вђ morgase drew a deep breath and softened her tone meeting those frightened eyes was not easy nothing frightened lini what i do is for the best believe me she told her gently thereвђs no other way вђ no other way breane broke in angrily gripping her skirts till her hands shook clearly she would rather have had them wrapped around morgaseвђs throat what fool nonsense are you spouting now what if these seanchan think we killed you morgase compressed her lips had she become so transparent shut up woman lini never got angry either or raised her voice but she did both now her withered cheeks red she raised a bony hand you hold your mouth or iвђll slap you sillier than you are slap her if you want to slap someone breane shouted back so fiercely that spittle flew queenmorgase she will send you and me and my lamgwin to the gallows and her precious tallanvor too because she lacks the belly of a mouse the door opened to admit tallanvor and put an abrupt end to it no one was about to shout in front of him lini pretended to examine morgaseвђs sleeve as though it might need mending as master gill and lamgwin followed tallanvor in breane put on a bright smile and smoothed her skirts the men noticed nothing of course morgase noticed a great deal for one thing tallanvor had a sword belted on and so did master gill and even lamgwin though his was a shortsword she had always had the feeling he was more comfortable with his fists than any other weapons before she could ask how the skinny little man who brought up the rear closed the door carefully behind him majesty sebban balwer said forgive the intrusion even his bow and his smile seemed dry and precise but as his eyes flicked from her to the other women morgase decided that whether the other men noticed the atmosphere in the room or not pedron niallвђs onetime secretary did i am surprised to see you master balwer she said i heard there was some unpleasantness with eamon valda what she had heard was that valda had said if he laid eyes on balwer he would kick him over one of the fortress walls balwerвђs smile tightened he knew what valda had said he has a plan to take us all out of here tallanvor broke in today now he gave her a look not that of subject to queen we are accepting his offer how she said slowly forcing her legs to remain straight what help could this prissy little stick of a man offer escape she wanted very much to sit down but she was not going to not with tallanvor looking at her in that fashion of course she was not his queen now but he did not know that another question occurred why master balwer iвђll not shun any true offer of help but why would you risk yourself these seanchan will make you regret it should they find out i laid my plans before they came he said carefully it seemed imprudent to leave the queen of andor in valdaвђs hands consider it my way of repaying him i know i am not much to look at majesty he hid a selfdeprecating cough behind his hand but the plan will work these seanchan actually make it easier i would not have been ready for days yet without them for a newly conquered city they allow remarkable freedom to anyone willing to say their oath not an hour after sunrise i obtained a pass allowing myself and up to ten more who have taken the oath to depart amador they believe i intend to buy wine and wagons to carry it in the east it must be a trap the words tasted bitter better the window than falling into some snare they wonвђt allow you to carry word of them ahead of their army balwerвђs head tilted to one side and he began drywashing his hands then stopped abruptly in truth majesty i considered that the officer who gave me the pass said it did not matter his exact words вђtell who you will what you have seen and let them know they cannot stand against us your lands will know soon enough anywayвђ i have seen several merchants take the oath this morning and depart with their wagons tallanvor moved close to her too close she could almost feel his breath she could feel his eyes we are accepting his offer he said for her ears alone if i must bind and gag you i think he can find a way even so he seems a very resourceful little fellow she met him stare for stare the window or a chance if tallanvor had only held his tongue it would have been much easier to say i accept with gratitude master balwer but she said it she stepped away as if to see balwer without having to crane past tallanvor it was always disturbing being so near to him he was too young what is to do first i doubt those guards at the door will accept your pass for us balwer bowed his head as if acknowledging her foresight i fear they must meet with accidents majesty tallanvor eased his dagger in its scabbard and lamgwin flexed his hands like the loparflexing its claws she did not believe it could be so easy even after they had packed up what they could carry and the two taraboners had been stuffed beneath her bed at the main gates holding her linen dustcloak close awkwardly because of the bundle on her back she bowed hands on her knees the way balwer had shown her while he told the guards that they had all sworn to obey await and serve she thought of how to make sure she was not taken alive it was not until they were actually riding out of amador past the last guards on the horses balwer had had waiting that she began to believe of course balwer probably expected some fine reward for rescuing the queen of andor she had not told anyone that that was done with beyond going back she knew she had spoken the words and no one else needed to know regretting them was useless now she would see what sort of life she could find without a throne a life far from a man who was much too young and much too disturbing why is your smile so sad lini asked reining her slabsided brown mare closer the animal looked motheaten morgaseвђs bay was no better none of the horses were the seanchan might have been willing to let balwer go with his pass but not with decent mounts there is a long road ahead yet morgase told her and thumped her mare into some semblance of a trot after tallanvor chapter wolf to be alone slipping the haft of his axe through the loop on his belt opposite his quiver perrin took his unstrung longbow from the corner slung his saddlebags over his shoulder and left the rooms he had shared with faile without a backward look they had been happy there вђ most of the time he did not think he would ever be back sometimes he wondered whether being happy somewhere with faile meant he would never return there he hoped not the servants he saw in the palace corridors wore unrelieved black livery perhaps rand had ordered it and perhaps the servants themselves had simply adopted it they had been uneasy without livery as though they did not know where they belonged and black seemed safe as randвђs color because of the ashaвђman those who saw perrin scampered away as fast as they could not waiting for any bows or curtsies fear scent drifted behind them for once his yellow eyes had nothing to do with anyone being afraid it might not be safe to loiter near a man at whom the dragon reborn had unleashed his rage so publicly this very morning perrin eased the shoulder under his saddlebags a long while had passed since anyone had been able to pick him up and throw him of course no one had ever used the power to try before one moment in particular stuck with him he pushed himself up holding his shoulder sliding his back up the square column that had stopped his flight he thought a few ribs might have cracked around the grand hall of the sun a scattering of nobles who had come to appeal one thing or another to rand tried to look anywhere else tried to pretend they were anywhere else only dobraine watched shaking his gray head as rand stalked across the throne room i will deal with the aes sedai as i choose rand shouted do you hear me perrin asi choose youвђve just handed them over to the wise ones he growled back shoving away from the column you donвђt know whether theyвђre sleeping on silk or had their throats cut you are not the creator with a snarl of rage rand threw his head back i am the dragon reborn he cried i donвђt care how theyвђre treated they deserve a dungeon perrinвђs hackles stirred as randвђs eyes lowered from the vaulted ceiling blue ice would have been warm and soft beside them the more so because they stared from a face twisted with pain get out of my sight perrin do you hear me get out of cairhien today now i never want to see you again pivoting on his heel he strode away with nobles all but throwing themselves to the floor as he passed perrin thumbed a trickle of blood from the corner of his mouth for one moment there he had been sure rand was going to kill him shaking his head to rid himself of the thought he rounded a corner and nearly ran into loial with a large bundle strapped to his back and a scrip big enough to hold a sheep slung on his shoulder the ogier was using his longhandled axe as a walking staff the capacious pockets of his coat bulged with the shapes of books loialвђs tufted ears perked up at the sight of him then suddenly drooped his whole face drooped eyebrows hanging on his cheeks i heard perrin he boomed sadly rand should not have done that quick words make long troubles i know heвђll reconsider tomorrow maybe itвђs all right perrin told him cairhien is too polished for me anyway iвђm a blacksmith not a courtier by tomorrow iвђll be a long way gone you and faile could come with me karldin and i are going to visit the stedding perrin all of them about the waygates a narrowfaced palehaired young fellow standing behind loial stopped frowning at perrin to frown at the ogier he had a scrip and a bundle too and a sword on his hip despite the blue coat perrin recognized one of the ashaвђman karldin did not look pleased to recognize perrin besides his smell was cold and angry loial peered down the hallway behind perrin where is faile sheвђs meeting me in the stables we had words that was simple truth faile seemed to likeshouting sometimes he lowered his voice loial i wouldnвђt talk about that where anyone could hear the waygates i mean loial snorted hard enough to make a bull jump but he did drop his tone i donвђt see anyone but us he rumbled no one more than two or three paces beyond karldin could have heard clearly his ears lashed was the only word and laid back angrily everyoneвђs afraid to be seen near you after all youвђve done for rand karldin tugged at loialвђs sleeve we have to go he said glaring at perrin anyone the dragon reborn shouted at was outside the gates so far as he was concerned perrin wondered whether he was holding the power right then yes yes loial murmured waving a hamsized hand but he leaned on his axe frowning pensively i donвђt like this perrin rand chases you away he sends me off how iвђm to finish my book his ears twitched and he coughed well thatвђs neither here nor there but you me and the light only knows where mat is heвђll send min away next he hid from her this morning he sent me out to tell her he wasnвђt there i think she knew i was lying heвђll be alone then perrin вђitвђs terrible to be aloneвђ thatвђs what he said to me he is planning to send all of his friends away the wheel weaves as the wheel wills perrin said loial blinked at that echo of moiraine perrin had been thinking of her a lot recently she had been a restraining influence on rand farewell loial keep safe and donвђt trust anyone you donвђt have to he did not quite look at karldin you donвђt mean that perrin loial sounded shocked he seemed to trust everyone you cannot come with me you and faile weвђll meet again one day perrin told him gently and hurried past before he had to say more he did not like lying especially not to a friend in the north stable things were much the same as inside the palace grooms saw him walk in and dropped dung forks and curry combs crowding out through small doors at the back rustles in the loft high above that might have escaped anotherвђs ears told of folk hiding there he could hear anxious fearful breaths he brought stepper out of a greenstreaked marble stall slipped on his bridle and tied the dun stallion to a gilded hitching ring he went to fetch blanket and saddle from a marble tack room where half the saddles were mounted with silver or gold the stable fit very well in a palace with tall square marble columns and a marble floor even under the straw in the stalls he rode out glad to see the back of grandeur north of the city he followed the road he had come down so desperately with rand just a few days before rode until folds in the land hid cairhien then he turned off to the east where a fair patch of forest remained running down one tall hill and over the next taller one just inside the trees faile booted swallow to meet him aram heeling her like a hound on his own horse aramвђs face brightened at the sight of him though that was not saying much he merely divided his faithful hound looks between him and faile husband she said not too coolly but razorsharp anger and spiky jealousy still threaded through the clean scent of her and her herbal soap she was garbed for travel with a thin dustcloak hanging down her back and red gloves that matched the boots peeking out beneath the dark narrow riding skirts she favored no fewer than four sheathed daggers were tucked behind her belt movement behind her turned into bain and chiad and sulin with a dozen more maidens perrinвђs eyebrows rose he wondered what gaul thought of that the aielman had said he was looking forward to getting bain and chiad alone even more surprising were faileвђs other companions what are they doing here he nodded toward a small cluster who held their horses back he recognized selande and camaille and the tall tairen woman all still in menвђs clothes and wearing swords the blocky fellow in a fatsleeved coat who had kept his beard oiled and trimmed to a point despite wearing his hair tied back with a ribbon also looked familiar the other two men both cairhienin he did not know but he could guess by their youth and the ribbon tying their hair if nothing else that they were part of selandeвђs society i took selande and a few of her friends into my service faile spoke lightly but suddenly she gave off foggy waves of caution they would have gotten themselves into trouble in the city sooner or later they need someone to give them direction think of them as charity i wonвђt let them get under your feet perrin sighed and scratched his beard a wise man did not tell his wife to her face that she was hiding things especially when that wife was faile she was going to be as formidable as her mother if she was not already under his feet how many of these puppies had she taken on is everything ready pretty soon some idiot back there will decide he can curry favor by bringing rand my head iвђd like to be gone before that aram growled in his throat no one is going to take your head husband faile showed white teeth and went on in a whisper she knew he would catch except perhaps me in a normal voice she said all is ready in a clear fairly flat hollow beyond the trees the two rivers men stood beside their horses a column of twos that wound out of sight around the side of the hill perrin sighed again the red wolfhead banner and the red eagle of manetheren stirred slightly in a hot breeze at the head of the column maybe another dozen maidens squatted on their heels near the banners on the other side gaul wore as close to a sullen expression as perrin had ever seen on an aiel as he dismounted two blackcoated men came to him saluting with fist pressed to heart lord perrin jur grady said weвђve been here since last night we are ready gradyвђs weathered farmerвђs face made perrin almost comfortable with him but fager neald was another matter maybe ten years younger than grady he might have been a farmer too for all perrin knew but he affected airs and graces and wore his pitiful mustache waxed to a semblance of points where grady was one of the dedicated he was a soldier without the silver sword pinned to his collar but that did not hold him back from speaking lord perrin is it really necessary to take those women with us theyвђll be nothing but trouble they will the whole lot of them and you know it well some of the women he was talking about stood not far from the two rivers men shawls looped over their arms edarra appeared the eldest of the six wise ones impassively watching the two women neald had nodded to in truth that pair worried perrin as well seonid traighan all coolness and reserve in green silk had been haughtily trying to ignore the aiel women вђ most cairhienin who were not pretending to be aiel despised them вђ but when she saw perrin she shifted her bayвђs reins to the other hand and gave masuri sokawa a nudge in the ribs masuri started вђ browns seemed to go off in daydreams fairly often вђ stared at the green sister blankly then directed her stare at perrin this one was more the sort she might have given some peculiar and perhaps dangerous animal one she intended to be sure of before she was done they had sworn to obey rand alвђthor but how would they do obeying perrin aybara giving orders to aes sedai seemed unnatural but better than the other way around at least everybody comes perrin said letвђs be gone before we are seen faile sniffed grady and neald saluted again and strode out to the middle of the treeless area perrin had no idea which of them did what was necessary but suddenly the nowfamiliar silvery vertical flash in the air rotated into a gateway not quite tall enough to ride through trees showed beyond the opening not that much different from those on the surrounding hills grady strode through immediately but even so he was nearly knocked down by sulin and a small horde of veiled maidens they seemed to have taken the honor of being first through a gateway for themselves and were not about to let anyone usurp it foreseeing a hundred problems he had not thought of perrin led stepper through into a land not so hilly there was no clearing but it was not so thickly treed as the hollow back in cairhien either the scattered trees were taller but just as sere even the pines he did not recognize much else except for oak and leatherleaf the air seemed a little hotter faile followed him but when he turned to the left she took swallow right aramвђs head swung worriedly between them until perrin nodded toward his wife the onetime tinker hauled his gelding after her but quick as he was he was not before bain and chiad still veiled and for all perrinвђs orders that the two rivers men were to be next selande and a good two dozen young cairhienin and tairens poured out of the gateway drawing their horses along two dozen shaking his head perrin stopped beside grady who turned this way and that studying the sparse woodland gaul came stalking up as dannil finally began leading the two rivers men out at a run pulling their horses those bloody banners appeared right behind dannil going up as soon as they were clear the man ought to shave those fool mustaches women are beyond any belief gaul muttered perrin opened his mouth to defend faile before he realized it must be bain and chiad the man was glaring at to cover he said do you have a wife grady sora grady answered absently his attention still on the surrounding trees perrin would have wagered he held the power now for sure anyone could see a long way in this compared to any woods back home but someone could still sneak up on you sheвђs missing me grady went on almost to himself you learn to recognize that one right off i wish i knew why her knee hurts though her knee hurts perrin said flatly right this minute it hurts grady seemed to realize he was staring and gaul was too he blinked but went right back to his study forgive me lord perrin i need to keep a watch for a long moment he said nothing then began slowly itвђs something a fellow named canler worked out the mвђhael doesnвђt like us trying to figure out things on our own but once it was done his slight grimace said perhaps taim had not been all that easy about it even then we think maybe itвђs something like the bond between warders and aes sedai maybe one in three of us is married anyway thatвђs how many wives stayed instead of running off when they learned what their husbands were this way when youвђre apart from her you know sheвђs all right and she knows you are a man likes to know his wifeвђs safe that he does perrin said what was faile up to with those fools she was mounted on swallow now and they were all standing close around looking up at her he would not put it past her to leap into this jiвђeвђtohnonsense herself seonid and masuri glided behind the last of the two rivers men with the three warders they had between them and the wise ones right behind them which was no surprise they were along to keep an eye on the aes sedai seonid gathered her reins as if to mount but edarra said something in a low voice pointing to a fat lopsided oak and the two aes sedai looked at her heads swiveling as one then exchanged glances and led their horses to the tree matters would go a deal smoother if that pair was always so meek вђ well not meek exactly seonidвђs neck was stiff as a rod after that came the remounts a herd of spare horses tied ten to a lead under the watchful eyes of folk from dobraineвђs estates who supposedly knew what they were about perrin automatically picked out stayer on a lead by himself the woman taking care of him better know what she was doing a great many highwheeled supply carts came through drivers tugging the horses and shouting as if they feared the gateway might close on them вђ a great many because carts could not carry as much as wagons and carts because a wagon and team would not fit through the gateway it seemed neither neald nor grady could make one as big as rand could or dashiva when the last cart finally trundled out on a squealing axle perrin considered ordering the gateway closed right then but neald was the man holding the thing open and him on the other side of it back in cairhien a moment later it was too late berelain strode through leading a mare as white as swallow was black and he offered up small thanks that her gray riding dress had a neck right to her chin on the other hand from the waist up it fit as snugly as any taraboner dress perrin groaned with her came nurelle and bertain gallenne the lord captain of her winged guards a grayhaired fellow who wore his black eyepatch as another man might a plume in his hat and then the redarmored winged guards themselves more than nine hundred of them nurelle and the rest who had been at dumaiвђs wells wore a yellow cord tied high on the left arm climbing onto her mare berelain rode off to one side with gallenne while nurelle formed the winged guards among the trees there must have been fifty paces between her and faile and dozens of trees but she placed herself where they could stare at each other stare with so little expression that perrinвђs skin crawled putting berelain at the rear as far from faile as he could manage had seemed a good notion but he was going to face this every bloody evening burn rand now neald popped out of the gateway stroking his ridiculous mustache and preening for anyone who might be watching as the opening vanished no one was and he climbed onto his horse with a disgruntled expression mounting stepper perrin rode to a slight rise not everyone could see him because of the trees but it was enough they could hear a stir ran through the assemblage as he reined in people shifting for a better look as far as anyoneвђs eyesandears back in cairhien know he said loudly iвђve been banished the first of mayene is on her way back home and the rest of you have just disappeared like fog in the sun to his surprise they laughed a cry of perrin goldeneyes went up and not just from the two rivers folk he waited for it to quiet that took a while faile neither laughed nor shouted nor did berelain each woman shook her head neither believed he should tell as much as he intended to then they saw each other and those shaking heads froze as if trapped in amber they did not like agreeing it was no surprise when their eyes swung to him with identical expressions there was an old saying in the two rivers though how you said it and what you meant depended on circumstance and who you were itвђs always a manвђs fault one thing he had learned women were better at than anything else teaching a man to sigh some of you may be wondering where we are and why he went on when silence fell at last a smaller ripple of laughter this is ghealdan murmurs of awe and maybe disbelief at having crossed fifteen hundred miles or more in a step the first thing we have to do is convince queen alliandre we arenвђt here to invade berelain was supposed to talk to alliandre and faile was going to give him fits for it then weвђre going to find a fellow who calls himself the prophet of the lord dragon that would not be much pleasure either masema had been no joy before he tipped over the edge this prophet has been causing some problems but weвђre going to let him know rand alвђthor doesnвђt want anybody frightened into following him and weвђll take him and any of his people who want to come back to the lord dragon and weвђll frighten the breeches off masema to do it if need be he though wryly they cheered they whooped and shouted that they would march this prophet back to cairhien for the lord dragon till perrin hoped this spot was even farther from any village than it was supposed to be even the cart drivers and horse handlers joined in more than that he prayed that everything went smoothly and quickly the sooner he could put as much distance as possible between berelain and himself and faile the better no surprises that was what he wanted once they rode south it was about time his being taвђverenshowed itself good for something chapter dice bread and cheese mat knew he was in trouble from the day he moved into the tarasin palace he could have refused just because the flaming dice started or stopped did not mean he had to doanything usually when they stopped spinning it was too late not to do something the problem was he wanted to know why before very many days he wished he had taken his curiosity by the throat and throttled it after nynaeve and elayne left his room once he could manage to reach his feet without his head falling off he spread the word among his men nobody seemed to see the disadvantages he just wanted to prepare them but nobody listened very good my lord nerim murmured tugging matвђs boot onto his foot my lord will finally have decent rooms oh very good for a moment he seemed to lose his mournful expression for just a moment i will brush the red silk coat for my lord my lord has stained the blue rather badly with wine mat waited impatiently put on the coat and headed down the hall aes sedai nalesean muttered as his head popped out at the top of a clean shut his roundbellied manservant lopin was hovering behind him burn my soul i donвђt much like aes sedai but the tarasin palace mat mat winced bad enough the man could drink a barrel of brandy with no effect the next morning but did he have to grin so ah mat now we can forget dice and play cards with our own kind he meant nobles the only ones who could afford to play except for welltodo merchants who would not remain welltodo long if they began betting for the stakes nobles did nalesean rubbed his hands briskly while lopin tried to settle his laces even his beard seemed eager silk sheets he murmured whoever heard of silk sheets those old memories nudged but mat refused to listen full of nobles vanin growled downstairs pursing his lips to spit his glance searching for mistress anan was automatic now he decided instead to swallow from the mug of rough wine that was his breakfast be good to see the lady elayne again though he mused his free hand rose as if to knuckle his forehead he did not seem aware of the gesture mat groaned that woman had ruined a good man you want me to look in on carridin again vanin went on as if the rest was unimportant his streetвђs so full of beggars itвђs hard to see anything but he has an awful lot of folk come to call mat told him that would be fine no wonder vanin did not care whether the palace was full of nobles and aes sedai he would spend the day sweating in the sun and jostled by the crowds much more comfortable there was no point trying to warn harnan and the rest of the redarms all shoveling down white porridge and tiny black sausages while they nudged one another in the ribs and laughed about the serving women in the palace who they had heard were all chosen for their beauty and remarkably free with their favors a true fact they kept assuring themselves things did not get any better when he went into the kitchens searching for mistress anan to settle the bill caira was there but with all her bad temper of the night before doubled she stuck out her lower lip glowering at him and stalked out the door to the stableyard rubbing the back of her skirt maybe she had gotten herself into some misery or other but how she could blame mat cauthon was beyond him mistress anan was out it seemed вђ she was always organizing soup kitchens for refugees or leaping into some other good work вђ but enid was waving a long wooden spoon at her scurrying helpers and ready to take his coin in her stout hand you squeeze too many melons my young lord and you shouldnвђt be surprised when a rotten one breaks in your hand she said darkly for some reason or two she added after a moment nodding she leaned close tilting up her sweating round face with an intent stare youвђll only make trouble for yourself if you say a word you wonвђt that did not sound like a question not a word mat said what in the light was she talking about it seemed the right response though because she nodded and waddled away waving that spoon twice as vigorously as before for a moment he had thought she meant to thump him with it the pure truth was women all had a violent streak not just some of them one thing and another it was a relief when nerim and lopin got into a shouting match over whose masterвђs baggage would be carried over first smoothing their feathers required a good half an hour from him and nalesean both a manservant with his dander ruffled could make your life miserable then he had to settle which of the redarms were to have the honor of lugging the chest of gold across and which were to take the horses anyway it was that much longer outside the bloody tarasin palace once he was ensconced in his new rooms though he almost forgot troubles at first he had a large sitting room and a small what they called a sulking room hereabouts and an immense bedchamber with the biggest bed he had ever seen the massive bedposts carved with entwined flowers of all things and painted red most of the furniture was bright red or bright blue where it was not layered with gilt a small door near the bed led to a cramped room for nerim which the fellow seemed to think was excellent despite a narrow bed and no window matвђs rooms all had tall arched windows letting onto white wroughtiron balconies that overlooked the mol hara the standlamps were gilded and so were the mirror frames there were two mirrors in the sulking room three in the sitting room and fourin the bedchamber the clock вђ a clock вђ on the marble mantel above the fireplace in the sitting room sparkled with gilt as well the washbasin and pitcher were red sea folk porcelain he was almost disappointed to discover that the chamber pot under the bed was only plain white pottery there was even a shelf in the large sitting room with a full dozen books not that he read much even given the jarring colors of walls and ceilings and floor tiles the rooms shouted rich any other time he would have danced a jig any time when he was not aware that a woman with chambers right down the hall wanted to stick him in hot water and put a bellows to the fire if teslyn or merilille or one of that lot did not manage it first despite his medallion why hadthe dice in his head stopped tumbling as soon as elayne mentioned these bloody rooms curiosity he had heard a saying on several womenвђs lips back home usually when he had done something that looked fun at the time men teach cats curiosity but cats keep sense for themselves iвђm no bloody cat he muttered stalking out of the bedchamber into the sitting room he just had to know that was all of course youвђre not a cat tylin said youвђre a succulent little duckling is what you are mat gave a start and stared duckling and a littleduckling at that the woman stood well short of his shoulder indignation or no indignation he managed an elegant bow anyway she was the queen he had to remember that majesty thank you for these wonderful apartments iвђd love to talk with you but i have to go out and вђ smiling she advanced across the redandgreen floor tiles layered blue and white silk petticoats swishing large dark eyes fixed on him he had no desire at all to look at the marriage knife nestled in her generous cleavage or the larger gemstudded dagger thrust behind an equally gemstudded belt he backed away majesty i have an important вђ she started humming he recognized the tune he had hummed it to a few girls lately he was wise enough not to try actually singing with his voice and besides the words they used in ebou dar would have singed his ears around here they called it i will steal your breath with kisses laughing nervously he tried to put a lapisinlaid table between them but she somehow got around it first without seeming to increase her speed majesty i вђ she laid a hand flat on his chest backheeled him into a highbacked chair and plumped herself down on his lap between her and the chair arms he was trapped oh he could have picked her up and set her on her feet quite easily except that she did have that bloody big dagger in her belt and he doubted his manhandling her would be as acceptable to her as her manhandling him seemed to be this was ebou dar after all where a woman killing a man was justified until proven otherwise he could have picked her up easily except he had seen fishmongers in the city selling peculiar creatures called squid and octopus вђ ebou dari actually ate the thingsвђ but they had nothing on tylin the woman possessed ten hands he thrashed about vainly trying to fend her off and she laughed softly between kisses he breathlessly protested that someone might walk in and she just chuckled he babbled his respect for her crown and she chortled he claimed betrothal to a girl back home who held his heart in her hands she really laughed at that what she does not know cannot harm her she murmured her twenty hands not slowing for an instant someone knocked at the door prying his mouth free he shouted who is it well it was a shout a highpitched shout he was out of breath after all tylin was off his lap and three paces away so fast it seemed she was just here then there the woman had the nerve to give him a reproachful look and then she made a kiss at him that barely left her lips before the door opened and thom stuck his head in mat i wasnвђt sure that was you oh majesty for a scrawny old gleeman with pretensions thom could flourish a bow with the best in spite of his limp juilin could not but he snatched off his ridiculous red hat and did what he could forgive us we wonвђt disturb вђ thom began but mat broke in hurriedly come in thom snatching his coat back all the way on he started to stand then realized that somehow the bloody woman had untied the waist of his breecheswithout him noticing these two might miss that his shirt was undone to his belly but they would not miss his breeches falling off tylinвђs blue dress was not mussed at all juilin come in i am glad you find the rooms acceptable master cauthon tylin said dignity incarnate except for her eyes anyway when she stood so thom and juilin could not see them her eyes laced innocuous words with added meaning i look forward to having your company with pleasure i shall find it interesting having a taвђverenwhere i can reach out and touch him at will but i must leave you to your friends now no do not stand please that with just the hint of a mocking smile well boy thom said knuckling his mustaches when she was gone thereвђs luck for you being welcomed with open arms by the queen herself juilin became very interested in his cap mat eyed them warily mentally daring them to say a word more вђ just one word вђ but once he asked after nynaeve and elayne he quit worrying what they suspected the women were not back he almost leaped up breeches or no they were trying to wiggle out of their agreement already he had to explain what he meant in between their outbursts of incredulity in between expressing his opinions of nynaeve bloody alвђmeara and elayne bloody daughterheir not much chance they would have gone off to the rahad without him but he would not put it past them to try their hand spying on carridin elayne would demand a confession and expect the man to break down nynaeve would try to beat one out of him i doubt they are bothering carridin juilin said scratching behind his ear i believe aviendha and birgitte are taking a look at him from what i heard we didnвђt see them go i do not think you need to worry about him knowing what heвђs seeing even if he walks right by them thom pouring himself a golden goblet of the wine punch that mat had found waiting took up the explanation mat put a hand over his eyes disguises made with the power no wonder they had slipped away like snakes whenever they wanted those women were going to make trouble that was what women did best it hardly surprised him to learn that thom and juilin knew less about this bowl of the winds than he did after they left to ready themselves for a trip to the rahad he had time to set his clothes to rights before nynaeve and elayne came back he had time to check on olver in his room one floor down the boyвђs skinny frame had fleshed out somewhat with enid and the rest of the cooks at the wandering woman stuffing him but he would always be short even for a cairhienin and if his ears shrank to half their size and his mouth to half its width his nose would still stop him well short of handsome no fewer than three serving women fussed over him while he sat crosslegged on his bed mat doesnвђt haesel have the most beautiful eyes olver said beaming at the bigeyed young woman mat had met the last time he came to the palace she beamed back and ruffled the boyвђs hair oh but alis and loya are so sweet i could never choose a plump woman just short of her middle years looked up from unpacking olverвђs saddlebags to give him a broad grin and a slender girl with beestung lips patted the towel she had just put on his washstand then flung herself onto the bed to tickle olverвђs ribs till he fell over laughing helplessly mat snorted harnan and that lot were bad enough but now these womenwere encouraging the boy how was he ever going to learn to behave if women did that olver ought to be playing in the streets like any other tenyearold hehad had no serving women falling over him in his rooms tylin had seen to that he was sure he had time to check on olver and to look in on harnan and the rest of the redarms sharing a long room lined with beds not far from the stables and to saunter down to the kitchens for some bread and beef вђ he had not been able to face that porridge back at the inn still nynaeve and elayne had not returned he finally looked over the books in his sitting room and began reading the travels of jain farstrider though he barely made out a word for worrying thom and juilin came in just as the women finally bustled in exclaiming over finding him there as if they thought hewould not keep his word he closed the book gently set it gently on the table beside his chair where have you been why we went for a walk elayne said brightly blue eyes wider than he remembered seeing before thom frowned and produced a knife from his sleeve rolling it back and forth through his fingers he very markedly did not so much as glance at elayne we had tea with some women your innkeeper knows nynaeve said i wonвђt bore you with talk about needlework juilin started to shake his head then stopped before she noticed please donвђt bore me mat said dryly he supposed she knew one end of a needle from the other but he suspected she would as soon stick one through her tongue as talk about needlework neither woman cracked her teeth about civility confirming his worst suspicions iвђve told off two fellows to walk out with each of you this afternoon and there will be two more tomorrow and every day if youвђre not inside the palace or under my nose youвђll have bodyguards they know their turns already theyвђll stay with you at all times вђ alltimes вђ and you will let me know where youвђre headed no more making me worry till my hair falls out he expected indignation and argument he expected weaseling over what they had or had not promised he expected that demanding this whole loaf might get him a slice at the end a butt slice if his luck was in nynaeve looked at elayne elayne looked at nynaeve why bodyguards are a wonderfulidea mat elayne exclaimed her cheek dimpling in a smile i suppose you were right about that itвђs very smart of you to have your men already to a schedule it isa wonderful notion nynaeve said nodding enthusiastically very smart of you mat thom dropped the knife with a muffled curse and sat sucking on a nicked finger staring at the women mat sighed trouble he had known it and that was before they told him to forget the rahad for the time being which was how he found himself on a bench in front of a cheap tavern not far from the riverfront called the rose of the elbar drinking from one of the dented tin cups chained to the bench at least they washed the cups out for each new patron the stink from a dyerвђs shop across the way only raised the style of the rose not that it was a shabby neighborhood really though the street was too narrow for carriages a fair number of brightly lacquered sedan chairs swayed through the crowd if far more passersby wore wool and perhaps a guild vest than silk the wool was as often well cut as frayed the houses and shops were the usual array of white plaster and if most were small and even rundown the tall house of a wealthy merchant stood on a corner to his right and on the left a diminutive palace вђ smaller than the merchantвђs house at least вђ with a single greenbanded dome and no spire a pair of taverns and an inn in plain sight looked cool and inviting unfortunately the rose was the only one where a man could sit outside the only one in just the right spot unfortunately i doubt iвђve ever seen such splendid flies nalesean grumbled waving away several choice specimens from his cup what is it weвђre doing again you are swilling that foul excuse for wine and sweating like a goat mat muttered tugging his hat to shade his eyes better iвђm being taвђveren he glared at the dilapidated house between the dyerвђs and a noisy weaverвђs establishment that he had been told to watch not asked вђ told вђ that was what it came to however they phrased it squirming around their pledges oh they made it sound like asking made it sound like pleading at the end which he would believe when dogs danced but he knew when he had been bullied just be taвђveren mat he mimicked i know youвђll just knowwhat to do bah maybe elayne bloody daughterheir and her bloody dimple knew or nynaeve with her bloody hands twitching to yank her bloody braid but he would be burned if he did if the pigkissing bowl is in the rahad how am i supposed to find it on this flaming side of the river i do not remember them saying juilin said wryly and took a long swallow of some drink made from a yellow fruit grown in the countryside youвђve asked that fifty times at least he claimed the pale drink was refreshing in the heat but mat had taken a bite of one of those lemons and he was not about to swallow anything made from them with his head still throbbing faintly he himself drank tea it tasted as if the tavernkeeper a scrawny fellow with beady suspicious eyes had been dumping new leaves and water in yesterdayвђs leavings since the founding of the city the taste suited his mood what interests me thom murmured over steepled fingers is why they asked so many questions about your innkeeper he did not seem very upset at the women still keeping secrets sometimes he was decidedly odd what do setalle anan and these women have to do with the bowl women did pass in and out of the dilapidated house a steady stream of women just about some well dressed if none in silks and not one man three or four wore the red belt of a wise woman mat had considered following some of them when they left but it felt too planned he did not know how taвђverenworked вђ he had never really seen any sign of it in himself вђ but his luck was always best when everything was random like with dice most of those little iron tavern puzzles eluded him however lucky he felt he ignored thomвђs question thom had asked it at least as often as mat had asked how he was to find the bowl here nynaeve had told him to his face she had not promised to tell him every last thing she knew she said she would tell him whatever he needed to know she said watching her nearly choke from not calling him names was not nearly enough vengeance i suppose i should take a walk down the alley nalesean sighed in case one of those women decides to climb over the garden wall the narrow gap between the house and the dyer lay in full view for its whole length but another alleyway ran along behind the shops and houses mat tell me again why weвђre doing this instead of playing cards iвђll do it mat said maybe he would find out how taвђverenworked behind the garden wall he went and found out nothing by the time twilight began creeping over the street and harnan came with a baldheaded narroweyed andoran named wat the only possible effect of being taвђverenhe had seen was that the tavernkeeper brewed a fresh pot of tea it tasted almost as bad as the old back in his rooms in the palace he found a note an invitation of sorts elegantly lettered on thick white paper that smelled like a garden of flowers my little rabbit i expect to have you for dinner tonight in my apartments no signature but he hardly needed one light the woman had no shame at all there was a redpainted iron lock on the door to the corridor he found the key and locked it then for good measure he jammed a chair under the latch on the door to nerimвђs room he could do well enough without dinner just as he was about to climb into bed the lock rattled out in the hall a woman laughed at finding the door secured he should have been able to sleep soundly then but for some reason he lay there listening to his belly grumble why was she doing this well he knew why but why him surely she had not decided to toss all decency over the barn just to bed a taвђveren he was safe now anyway tylin would not batter down the door after all would she not even most birds could get in through the wroughtiron arabesques screening the balconies besides she would need a long ladder to reach that high and men to carry it unless she climbed down from the roof on a rope or she could the night passed his stomach rumbled the sun rose and he never closed his eyes or had a decent thought except that he did make a decision he thought of a use for the sulking room he certainly never sulked at first light he sneaked out of his rooms and found another of the palace servants he remembered a balding fellow named madic with a smug selfsatisfied air and a shy twist to his mouth that said he was not satisfied at all a man who could be bought though the startled look that flashed across his square face and the smirk he barely bothered to hide said he knew exactly why mat was slipping gold into his hand blood and ashes how many people knew what tylin was up to nynaeve and elayne did not seem to thank the light though that did mean they chided him about missing dinner with the queen which they had learned about when tylin inquired whether he was ill and worse please elayne said smiling almost as if the word did not pain her you must put your best foot forward with the queen donвђt be nervous youвђll enjoy an evening with her just donвђt do anything to offend her nynaeve muttered there was no doubt with her that being civil hurt her brows drew down in concentration her jaw tightened and her hands trembled to pull her braid be accommodating for once in your вђ i mean to say remember sheвђs a decent woman and donвђt try any of your вђ light you know what i mean nervous ha decent woman ha neither seemed the least concerned that he had wasted a whole afternoon elayne patted his shoulder sympathetically and asked him please to try another day or two it certainly was better than tramping through the rahad in this heat nynaeve said the exact same thing the way women did but without the shoulder pat they admitted right out that they intended to spend the day trying to spy on carridin with aviendha though they evaded his question of who it was they thought they might recognize nynaeve let that slip and elayne gave her such a look he thought he might see nynaeveвђs ears boxed for once they meekly accepted his stricture not to lose sight of their bodyguards and meekly let him see the disguises they intended to wear even after thomвђs description seeing the pair suddenly turn into ebou dari women in front of his eyes was almost as big a shock as their meekness well nynaeve made a sickly stab at meekness growling when she realized he had meant what he said about the aiel woman needing no bodyguard but she came close either one of these women folding her hands and answering submissively made him nervous both of them together вђ with aviendha nodding approvingly вђ and he was happy to send them on their way just to be sure though he ignored their suddenly flat mouths and made them demonstrate their disguises for the men he was sending along first vanin leaped at the chance to be one of elayneвђs guards knuckling his forehead right and left like a fool the fat man had not learned much watching on his own just as on the day before a surprising number of people had come to call on carridin including some in silk but that was not proof they were all darkfriends all said and done the man was the whitecloak ambassador more folk who wanted to trade into amadicia probably went to him than to the amadician ambassador whoever he or she was vanin did say two women had definitely been watching carridinвђs palace too вђ the look on his face when aviendha suddenly turned into a third ebou dari woman was a wonder вђ and also an old man he thought though the fellow proved surprisingly spry vanin had not managed to get a good look at him despite spotting him three times once vanin and the women left mat sent off thom and juilin to see what they could uncover concerning jaichim carridin and a bent whitehaired old man with an interest in darkfriends if the thiefcatcher could not discover a way to trip carridin on his face it did not exist and thom seemed to have a way of putting together all the gossip and rumor in a place and filtering out the truth all that was the easy part of course for two days he sweated on that bench with an occasional stroll down the alley beside the dyerвђs and the only thing that changed was that the tea got worse again the wine was so bad nalesean began drinking ale the first day the tavernkeeper offered fish for a midday meal but by the smell they had been caught last week the second day he offered a stew of oysters mat ate five bowls of that despite the bits of shell birgitte declined both he had been surprised when she caught up to him and nalesean hurrying across the mol hara that first morning the sun barely made a rim above the rooftops but already people and carts dotted the square i must have blinked she laughed i was waiting the way i thought youвђd come out if you donвђt mind company we move fast sometimes he said evasively nalesean looked at him sideways of course he had no idea why they had crept out through a tiny side door near the stables it was not that mat thought tylin would actually leap on him in the halls in broad daylight but then again it never hurt to be careful your company is welcome any time uh thanks she just shrugged and murmured something he did not catch and fell in on the other side of him that was the beginning with her any other woman he had ever known would have demanded to know thanks for what and then explained why none were necessary at such length that he wanted to cover his ears or upbraided him at equal length for thinking they were or sometimes made it clear she expected something more substantial than words birgitte just shrugged and over the next two days something startling occurred in his head normally to him women were to admire and smile at to dance with and kiss if they would allow to snuggle with if he was lucky deciding which women to chase was almost as much fun as chasing them if not nearly so much as catching them some women were just friends of course a few egwene for one though he was not sure how that friendship would survive her becoming amyrlin nynaeve was sort of a friend in a way if she could forget for one hour that she had switched his bottom more than once and remember he was not a boy anymore but a woman friend was different from a man you always knew her mind ran along other paths than yours that she saw the world with different eyes birgitte leaned toward him on the bench best be wary she murmured that widow is looking for a new husband the sheath on her marriage knife is blue besides the house is over there he blinked losing sight of the sweetly plump woman who rolled her hips so extravagantly as she walked and birgitte answered his sheepish grin with a laugh nynaeve would have flayed him with her tongue for looking and even egwene would have been coolly disapproving by the end of the second day on that bench he realized he had sat all that time with his hip pressed against birgitteвђs and never once thought of trying to kiss her he was sure she did not want to be kissed by him вђ frankly considering the dogugly men she seemed to enjoy looking at he might have been insulted if she had вђ and she was a hero out of legend whom he still halfexpected to leap over a house and grab a couple of the forsaken by the neck on the way but that was not it he would as soon have thought of kissing nalesean the same as the tairen just exactly the same as he likedbirgitte two days on that bench up and down to trot down the alley beside the dyer and stare at the tall wall of bare brick at the back of the houseвђs garden birgitte could have climbed it but even she might have broken her neck if she tried wearing a dress three times he decided on the spur of the moment to follow a woman coming out of the house two wearing the red belt of a wise woman random chance did seem to invoke his luck one of the wise women went around the corner and bought a bunch of shriveled turnips before going back the other walked two streets over to buy a pair of big greenstriped fish the third woman tall and dark in neat gray wool maybe a tairen crossed two bridges before entering a large shop where she was greeted with smiles by a skinny bowing fellow and began supervising the loading of lacquered boxes and trays into sawdustfilled baskets that were then loaded into a wagon by what he heard she hoped to fetch a pretty piece of silver with them in andor mat barely managed to escape without buying a box so much for random luck no one else had any either nynaeve and elayne and aviendha made their pilgrimages to the streets around carridinвђs small palace without seeing anyone they recognized which frustrated them no end they still refused to say who it hardly mattered since the people were not to be seen that was what they said showing him enough teeth for six women the grimaces were supposed to be smiles he thought it was a shame aviendha seemed to have fallen in with the other two so thoroughly but there was a moment when he was pressing them for an answer and elayne snapped at him staring down her nose and the aiel woman whispered something in her ear forgive me mat elayne said earnestly her face going so red her hair seemed to pale i humbly beg pardon for speaking so i will beg on my knees if you wish no surprise that her voice faltered at the end no need for that he said faintly trying not to goggle youвђre forgiven it was nothing the oddest thing though elayne looked at aviendha the whole time she spoke to him and did not twitch an eyelid when he replied but she heaved a great sigh of relief when aviendha nodded women were just strange thom reported that carridin gave to beggars frequently and aside from that every scrap of word about him in ebou dar was the kind to be expected depending on whether the speaker thought whitecloaks were murderous monsters or the true saviors of the world juilin learned that carridin had purchased a plan of the tarasin palace which might indicate some whitecloak intention toward ebou dar and might indicate that pedron niall wanted a palace for himself and intended to copy the tarasin if he still lived rumors had sprung up in the city that he was dead but then half said aes sedai had killed him and half said rand had which showed their worth neither juilin or thom had scuffed up a pebble concerning a whitehaired old man with a muchworn face frustration with carridin frustration with watching the bloody house and as far as the palace went mat found out how things were to go that first night when he finally got back to his rooms olver was there already fed and curled up in a chair with the travels of jain farstriderby the light of the standlamps and not at all upset over being moved out of his own room madic had been as good as his word as good as the gold he stuffed in his pouch anyway the sulking room now held olverвђs bed just let tylin try anything with a child watching her the queen had not been idle either though he sneaked down to the kitchens like a fox slipping from corner to corner flashing down stairs вђ and found there was no food to be had oh the smell of cooking permeated the air roasts turning on spits in the big fireplaces pots bubbling atop the whitetiled stoves and cooks kept popping open ovens to prod this or that there was just no food for mat cauthon smiling women in pristine white aprons ignored his own smiles and put themselves in his way so he could not get near the sources of those wonderful smells they smiled and rapped his knuckles when he tried to snatch a loaf of bread or just a bit of honeyglazed turnip they smiled and told him he must not spoil his appetite if he was to eat with the queen they knew every last one of them knew his own blushes as much as anything else drove him back to his rooms bitterly regretting that odorous fish at midday he locked the door behind him a woman who would starve a man might try anything he was lying on a green silk carpet playing snakes and foxes with olver when the second note was slipped under his door i have been told it is more sporting to take a pigeon on the wing to watch it flutter but sooner or later a hungry bird will fly to the hand what is it mat olver asked nothing mat crumpled the note another game oh yes the boy would play the fool game all day given a chance mat did you try any of that ham they cooked tonight i never tasted anything вђ just throw the dice olver just throw the bloody dice coming back for his third night in the palace he bought bread and olives and eweвђs milk cheese on the way which was just as well the kitchen still had its orders the bloody women actually laughed out loud while they wafted steaming platters of meats and fishes just beyond his reach and told him not to spoil his bloody appetite he maintained his dignity he did not grab a platter and run he made his finest leg flourishing an imaginary cloak gracious ladies your warmth and hospitality overwhelm me his withdrawal would have gone a deal better if one of the cooks had not cackled at his back the queen will feast on roast duckling soon enough lad very droll the other women roared so hard they must have been rolling on the floor very bloody droll bread and olives and salty cheese made a fine meal with a little water from his washstand to wash it down there had not been any wine punch in his room since that first day olver tried to tell him about some sort of roasted fish with mustard sauce and raisins mat told him to practice his reading nobody slipped a note under his door that night nobody rattled the lock he began to think things might turn for the better tomorrow was the festival of birds from what he had heard of the costumes some people wore men and women both it might be possible tylin would find herself a new duckling to chase after somebody might come out of that bloody house across from the rose of the elbar and hand him the bloody bowl of the winds things just had to turn for the better when he woke for his third morning in the tarasin palace the dice were rolling in his head chapter dragons fang the festival of birds waking to the dice mat considered going back to sleep until they went away but at last he got up feeling grumpy as if he did not have more than enough on his plate already he chased nerim away and dressed himself eating the last of the bread and cheese from the night before while he did then went to check on olver the boy flashed between bursts of yanking on his clothes in a hurry to be out and stopping entirely with boot or shirt in hand to spout dozens of questions that mat answered with half a mind no they would not go racing today and never mind the rich races at the circuit of heaven north of the city maybe they could go see the menagerie yes mat would buy him a feathered mask for the festival if he ever got dressed that sent him into a flurry what really occupied matвђs thoughts were those bloody dice why had they started up again he still did not know why they had before when olver was finally clothed he followed mat into the sitting room bubbling with halfheard questions вђ and bumped him from behind when he stopped dead tylin replaced the book olver had been reading the night before on the table majesty matвђs eyes darted to the door he had locked last night now standing wide open what a surprise he pulled olver around in front of him between him and the womanвђs mocking smile well maybe it was not really mocking but it surely seemed so right then she was certainly pleased with herself i was about to take olver out to see the festival and some traveling menagerie he wants a feathered mask he snapped his mouth shut to stop babbling and started edging toward the door using the boy as a shield yes tylin murmured watching through her eyelashes she made no move to intervene but her smile deepened as if she was just waiting for his foot to land in the snare much better if he has a companion instead of running with the urchins as i hear he does one hears a good deal about your lad riselle a woman appeared in the doorway and mat gave a start a fanciful mask of swirling blue and golden feathers hid most of riselleвђs face but the feathers on the rest of her costume did not hide very much else she possessed the most spectacular bosom he had ever seen olver she said sinking to her knees would you like to walk out with me at festival she held up a mask like a redandgreen hawk just the right size for a boy before mat could open his mouth olver broke free and rushed to her oh yes please thank you the ungrateful little lout laughed as she tied the hawk mask on his face and hugged him to her bosom hand in hand they ran out leaving mat gaping he recovered himself quickly enough when tylin said well for you i am not a jealous woman my sweet she produced the long iron key to his door from behind her goldandsilver belt and then another just like it waggling the pair at him people always keep keys in a box near the door that was where he had left his and no one ever thinks there might be a second key one key went back behind her belt the other was turned in the lock with a loud click before joining its fellow now lambkin she smiled it was too much the woman hounded him tried to starve him now she locked them in together like like he did not know what lambkin those bloody dice were bouncing around in his skull besides he had important business to see to the dice had never had anything to do with finding something but he reached her in two long strides seized her arm and began fumbling in her belt for the keys i donвђt have bloody time for вђ his breath froze as the sharp point of her dagger beneath his chin shut his mouth and drove him right up onto his toes remove your hand she said coldly he managed to look down his nose at her face she was not smiling now he let go of her arm carefully she did not lessen the pressure of her blade though she shook her head tsk tsk i do try to make allowances for you being an outlander gosling but since you wish to play roughly hands at your sides move the knifepoint gave a direction he shuffled backward on tiptoe rather than have his neck sliced what are you going to do he mumbled through his teeth a stretched neck put a strain in his voice a stretched neck among other things well he could try grabbing her wrist he was quick with his hands what are you going to do quick enough with the knife already at his throat that was the question that and the one he asked her if she intended to kill him a shove of her wrist right there would drive the dagger straight up into his brain will you answer me that was not panic in his voice he was not in a panic majesty tylin well maybe he was in a bit of a panic to use her name you could call any woman in ebou dar duckling or pudding all day and she would smile but use her name before she said you could and you found a hotter reception than you would for goosing a strange woman on the street anywhere else a few kisses exchanged were never enough for permission either tylin did not answer only kept him tiptoeing backward until suddenly his shoulders bumped against something that stopped him with that flaming dagger never easing a hair he could not move his head but eyes that had been focused on her face darted they were in the bedchamber a flowercarved red bedpost hard between his shoulder blades why would she bring him his face was suddenly as crimson as the bedpost no she could not mean to it was not decent it was not possible you canвђt do this to me he mumbled at her and if his voice was a touch breathy and shrill he surely had cause watch and learn my kitten tylin said and drew her marriage knife afterward a considerable time later he irritably pulled the sheet up to his chest a silk sheet nalesean had been right the queen of altara hummed happily beside the bed arms twisted behind her to do up the buttons of her dress all he had on was the foxhead medallion on its cord вђ much good thathad done вђ and the black scarf tied around his neck a ribbon on her present the bloody woman called it he rolled over and snatched his silvermounted pipe and tabac pouch from the small table on the other side from her golden tongs and a hot coal in a golden bowl of sand provided the means for lighting folding his arms he puffed away as fiercely as he frowned you should not flounce duckling and you shouldnвђt pout she yanked her dagger from where it was driven into a bedpost beside her marriage knife examining the point before sheathing it what is the matter you know you enjoyed yourself as much as i did and i she laughed suddenly and oh so richly resheathing the marriage knife as well if that is part of what being taвђverenmeans you must be very popular mat flushed like fire it isnвђt natural he burst out yanking the pipestem from between his teeth iвђm the one whoвђs supposed to do the chasing her astonished eyes surely mirrored his own had tylin been a tavern maid who smiled the right way he might have tried his luck вђ well if the tavern maid lacked a son who liked poking holes in people вђ but hewas the one who chased he had just never thought of it that way before he had never had the need to before tylin began laughing shaking her head and wiping at her eyes with her fingers oh pigeon i do keep forgetting you are in ebou dar now i left a little present for you in the sitting room she patted his foot through the sheet eat well today you are going to need your strength mat put a hand over his eyes and tried very hard not to weep when he uncovered them she was gone climbing out of the bed he tucked the sheet around him for some reason the notion of walking around bare felt uncomfortable the bloody woman might leap out of the wardrobe the garments he had been wearing lay on the floor why bother with laces he thought sourly when you can justcut somebodyвђs clothes offshe had no call to slice up his red coat that way though she had just enjoyed peeling him with her knife not quite holding his breath he pulled open the tall redandgilt wardrobe she was not hiding inside his choices were limited nerim had most of his coats for cleaning or mending dressing quickly he chose a plain coat of dark bronze silk then stuffed the sliced rags as far under the bed as he could reach until he could dispose of them without nerim seeing or anyone else for that matter too many people already knew entirely too much of what was going on between him and tylin there was no way he could face anybody knowing this in the sitting room he lifted the lid of the lacquerware box by the door then let it fall with a sigh he had not really expected tylin to replace the key he leaned against the door the unlocked door light what was he going to do move back to the inn burn why the dice had stopped before only he would not put it past tylin to bribe mistress anan and enid or the innkeeper wherever he went he would not put it past nynaeve and elayne to claim he had broken some agreement and put an end to their promises burn all women a large parcel elaborately wrapped in green paper sat on one of the tables it contained an eagle mask in black and gold and a coat covered with feathers to match there was also a red silk purse holding twenty gold crowns and a note that smelled of flowers i would have bought you an earring piglet but i noticed your ear is not pierced have it done and buy yourself something nice he nearly wept again hegave womenpresents the world was standing on its head pigletoh light after a minute he did take the mask she owed him that much for his coat alone when he finally reached the small shaded courtyard where they had been meeting each morning beside a tiny round pool of lily pads and brightly spotted white fish he found nalesean and birgitte ready for the festival of birds too the tairen had contented himself with a plain green mask but birgitteвђs was a spray of yellowandred with a crest of plumes her golden hair hung loose with feathers tied all down its length and she wore a dress with a wide yellow belt diaphanous beneath more red and yellow feathers it did not reveal nearly as much as riselleвђs yet it seemed about to every time she moved he had never thought of her wearing a dress like other women sometimes itвђs fun to be looked at she said poking him in the ribs when he commented her grin would have done for nalesean saying how much fun it was to pinch serving girls thereвђs a lot more to it than feather dancers wore but not enough to it to slow me down and anyway i cannot see weвђll have to move quickly on this side of the river the dice rattled in his head what kept you she went on you didnвђt make us wait so you could tickle a pretty girl i hope he hoped he was not blushing i вђ he was not certain what excuse he would have made but just then half a dozen men wearing feathered coats strolled into the courtyard all with those narrow swords on their hips all but one wearing an elaborate mask with colorful crest and beak that represented no bird ever seen by human eyes the exception was beslan twirling his mask by its ribbon oh blood and bloody ashes whatвђs he doing here beslan nalesean folded his hands on the pommel of his sword and shook his head in disbelief why burn my soul he says he intends to spend the festival in your company some promise you two made he says i told him it would be deadly boring but he wouldnвђt believe me i cannot think it is ever boring around mat tylinвђs son said his bow took them all in but his dark eyes especially lingered on birgitte iвђve never had so much fun as i did drinking with him and the lady elayneвђs warder on swovan night though truth i remember little he did not seem to recognize that warder strangely considering the taste she had shown in men вђ beslan was finelooking maybe a little too fine not at all her sort вђ strangely she smiled slightly and preened under his scrutiny right then mat did not care how out of character she behaved obviously beslan suspected nothing or that sword of his likely would already be out but the last thing under the light mat wanted was a day in company with the man it would be excruciating he had some sense of decency even if beslanвђs mother did not the only problem was beslan who took that bloody promise to attend all the festivals and feastdays together very seriously the more mat agreed with nalesean that the day they had planned would be dull beyond belief the more determined beslan grew after a bit his face began to darken and mat began to think that sword might be unsheathed yet well a promise was a promise when he and nalesean and birgitte left the palace half a dozen feathered fools strutted along mat was sure it would not have happened had birgitte been wearing her proper clothes the whole lot of them kept eyeing her and smiling what was all that twisting around while he was spilling his eyes all over you he muttered as they crossed the mol hara he tugged the ribbon holding the eagle mask tighter i did not twist i moved her primness was so blatantly false he would have laughed some other time slightly abruptly her grin was back and she lowered her voice for his ear alone i told you sometimes itвђs fun to be looked at just because theyвђre all too pretty doesnвђt mean i cannot enjoy them looking oh youвђll want to look at her she added pointing to a slender woman who went running by in a blue owl mask and rather fewer feathers than riselle had worn that was one of the things about birgitte she would nudge him in the ribs and point out a pretty girl for his eye as readily as any man he had ever known and expect him to point out in turn what she liked to see which was generally the ugliest man in sight whether or not she chose to go halfnaked today вђ a quarter anyway вђ she was well a friend a strange world it was turning out to be one woman he was beginning to think of as a drinking companion and another after him as intently as he had ever pursued any pretty woman in those old memories or his own more intently he had never chased any woman who let him know she did not want to be chased a very strange world the sun stood little more than halfway to its peak but already celebrants filled the streets and squares and bridges tumblers and jugglers and musicians with feathers sewn about their clothes performed at every street corner the music often drowned in laughter and shouting for the poorer folk a few feathers laced into their hair sufficed pigeon feathers gathered from the pavement for the street children dodging about and the beggars but masks and costumes grew more elaborate as purses grew heavier more elaborate and frequently more scandalous men and women alike were often decked in feathers that revealed more skin than riselle orthat woman back in the mol hara no commerce moved in the streets or canals today though a number of shops seemed to be open вђ along with every tavern and inn of course вђ but here and there a wagon made its way through the throng or a barge was poled along supporting a platform where young men and women posed in bright bird masks that covered their entireheads with spreading crests sometimes rising a full pace moving long colorful wings in such a way that the rest of their costumes were exposed only in flashes which was just as well considering according to beslan these settings as they were called were usually presented in guild halls and private palaces and houses the entire festival normally took place indoors for the most part it did not snow properly in ebou dar even when the weather was as it should be вђ beslan said he would like to see this snow one day вђ but apparently ordinary winter was cold enough to keep people from running around outdoors all but unclothed with the heat everything was spilling into the streets wait until night fell beslan said then mat would really see something as sunlight faded so did inhibitions staring at a tall slender woman gliding along through the crowd in mask and feathered cloak and beyond that six or seven feathers mat wondered what inhibitions some of these folk had left to shed he almost shouted at her to cover herself with that cloak she was pretty but out in the street before the light and everybody those wagons carrying the settings attracted followers of course thick knots of men and women who shouted and laughed as they tossed coins and sometimes folded notes onto the wagons and squeezed everyone else in the street aside he became used to fleeing ahead until they could duck down a crossing street or waiting until the setting went by to cross an intersection or bridge while waiting birgitte and nalesean tossed coins to filthy urchins and dirtier beggars well nalesean tossed birgitte concentrated on the children and pressed each coin into a grubby hand like a gift in one of those waits beslan suddenly put a hand on naleseanвђs arm raising his voice above the crowd and a cacophony of music coming from at least six different places forgive me tairen but not him a ragged man edged back into the throng warily gauntcheeked and bony he seemed to have lost whatever pitiful feathers he might have found for his hair why not nalesean demanded no brass ring on his little finger beslan replied heвђs not in the guild light mat said a man canвђt even beg in this city without belonging to a guild maybe it was his tone the beggar leaped for his throat a knife appearing in his grimy fist without thinking mat grabbed the manвђs arm and spun slinging him away into the crowd some people cursed at mat some at the sprawling beggar some tossed the fellow a coin from the corner of his eye mat saw a second skinny man in rags try to push birgitte out of the way to reach him with a long knife it was a foolish mistake to underestimate the woman because of her costume from somewhere among those feathers she produced a knife and stabbed him beneath the arm look out mat shouted at her but there was no time for warnings even as he shouted he drew from his coatsleeve and threw sidearmed the blade streaked past her face to sink into the throat of yet another beggar flaunting steel before he could plant it in her ribs suddenly there were beggars everywhere with knives and clubs studded with spikes screams and shouts rose as people in masks and costumes scrambled to get out of the way nalesean slashed a man in rags across the face sending him reeling beslan ran another through the middle while his costumed cronies fought still others mat had no time to see more he found himself backtoback with birgitte and facing his own adversaries he could feel her shifting against him hear her mutter curses but he was barely conscious of it birgitte could take care of herself and watching the two men in front of him he was not sure he could do the same the hulking fellow with the toothless sneer had only one arm and a puckered socket where his left eye had been but his fist held a club two feet long encircled by iron bands that sprouted spikes like steel thorns his ratfaced little companion still had both eyes and several teeth and despite sunken cheeks and arms that seemed all bone and sinew he moved like a snake licking his lips and flicking a rusty dagger from hand to hand mat aimed the shorter knife in his own hand first at one then the other it was still long enough to reach a manвђs vitals and they danced and shuffled each waiting for the other to leap at him first old cully wonвђt like this spar the bigger man growled and ratface darted forward rusty blade flashing from hand to hand he did not count on the knife that suddenly appeared in matвђs left hand and sliced across his wrist the dagger clattered to the paving stones but the fellow flung himself at mat anyway as matвђs other blade stabbed into his chest he squealed eyes going wide arms wrapping around mat convulsively the bald fellowвђs sneer widened his club rising as he stepped in the grin vanished as two beggars swarmed over him snarling and stabbing staring incredulously mat shoved ratfaceвђs corpse away the street was clear for fifty paces except for combatants and everywhere beggars rolled on the pavement two or three or sometimes four stabbing at one beating him with clubs or rocks beslan caught matвђs arm there was blood on his face but he was grinning letвђs get out of here and let the fellowship of alms finish its business thereвђs no honor in fighting beggars and besides the guild wonвђt leave any of these interlopers alive follow me nalesean was scowling вђ doubtless he saw no honor in fighting beggars either вђ and beslanвђs friends several with their costumes awry and one with his mask off so another could dab at a cut across his forehead the man with the cut was grinning too birgitte bore not a scratch that mat could see and her costume looked as neat as it had back in the palace she made her knife disappear there was no way she could hide a blade under those feathers but she did mat made no protest at being drawn away but he did growl do beggars always go around attacking people in this this city beslan might not appreciate hearing it called a bloody city the man laughed you are taвђveren mat thereвђs always excitement around taвђveren mat smiled back with gritted teeth bloody fool bloody city and bloody taвђveren well if a beggar slit his throat he would not have to go back to the palace and let tylin peel him like a ripe pear come to think of it she had called him her little pear bloody everything the street between the dyerвђs shop and the rose of the elbar had its share of revelers though not many scantily clad apparently you had to have coin to go near naked though the acrobats in front of the merchantвђs house on the corner came close the men barefoot and barechested in tight brightly colored breeches the women in even tighter breeches and thin blouses they all had a few feathers in their hair as did the capering musicians playing in front of the small palace at the far corner a woman with a flute another blowing on a tall twisted black tube covered with levers and a fellow beating a tambour for all he was worth the house they had come to watch looked shut up tight the tea at the rose was as bad as ever which meant it was much better than the wine nalesean stuck to the sour local ale birgitte said thanks without saying for what and mat shrugged it off silently they grinned at each other and tapped cups the sun rose and beslan sat balancing first one boot on the toe of the other then the other way around but his companions began growing restive no matter how often he pointed out that mat was taвђveren a scuffle with beggars was hardly proper excitement the street was too narrow for any settings to pass the women were not as pretty as elsewhere and even looking at birgitte seemed to pall once they realized that she did not intend to kiss even one of them with protestations of regret that beslan would not come they hurried off to find somewhere more exhilarating nalesean took a stroll down the alley beside the dyerвђs and birgitte vanished into the roseвђs murky interior to find she said whether there was anything at all fit to drink hidden in some forgotten corner i never expected to see a warder garbed like that beslan said changing his boots around mat blinked the fellow had sharp eyes she had not removed her mask once well as long as he did not know about вђ i think you will be good for my mother mat choking mat sprayed tea into the passersby several glared at him angrily and one slender woman with a nice little bosom gave him a coy smile from beneath a blue mask he thought was meant to be a wren she stamped a foot and stalked off when he did not smile back luckily no one was angry enough to take it beyond glares before they too went on their way or maybe unluckily he would not have minded if six or eight piled on him right then what do you mean he said hoarsely beslanвђs head whipped around in wideeyed surprise why her choosing you for her pretty of course why is your face so red are you angry why вђ suddenly he slapped his forehead and laughed you think iwill be angry forgive me i forget youвђre an outlander mat sheвђs my mother not my wife father died ten years ago and she has always claimed to be too busy i am just glad she chose someone i like where are you going he did not realize he was on his feet until beslan spoke i just need to clear my head but youвђre drinking tea mat dodging around a green sedan chair he half saw the door of the house open and a woman with a bluefeathered cloak over her dress slip out unthinkingly вђ his head was spinning too much to think clearly вђ he fell in behind her beslan knew he approved his own mother and he mat nalesean shouted behind him where are you going if iвђm not back by tomorrow mat shouted back absently over his shoulder tell them theyвђll have to find it for themselves he walked on after the woman in a daze not hearing if nalesean or beslan shouted again the man knew he remembered once thinking that beslan and his mother were both mad they were worse all of ebou dar was mad he was hardly aware of the dice still spinning inside his skull from a window of the meeting room reanne watched solain disappear down the street toward the river some fellow in a bronze coat followed in her wake but if he tried to impede her he would find out soon enough that solain had no time for men and no patience with them reanne was not sure why the urge had grown so strong today for days it had come on almost with the morning and faded with the sun and for days she had fought вђ by the strict rules they did not quite dare call laws that order was given at the half moon still six nights off вђ but today she had spoken the order before she thought and been unable to make herself retract until the proper time it would be well no one had seen any sign of those two young fools calling themselves elayne and nynaeve anywhere in the city thank the light there had been no need to take dangerous chances sighing she turned to the others who waited until she took her chair before seating themselves it would be well as it always had been secrets would be kept as they always had been but still she had no touch of foretelling or anything of that sort yet perhaps that overwhelming urge had been telling her something twelve women watched her expectantly i think we should consider moving everyone who does not wear the belt to the farm for a little while there was little discussion they were the elders but she was the eldest in that at least there was no harm in behaving as aes sedai did chapter snakey square the first cup i do not understand this elayne protested she had not been offered a chair in fact when she started to sit she had been told curtly to remain standing five sets of eyes were focused on her five women with set grim faces you are behaving as if weвђve done something terriblewhen what we have doneis find the bowl of the winds at least they were on the brink of it she hoped the message nalesean had come running back with was none too clear mat had gone off shouting that he had found it or something very like nalesean allowed the longer he talked the more he bounced between absolute certainty and doubt birgitte had remained watching reanneвђs house she seemed to be sweaty and bored in any case matters were in motion elayne wondered how nynaeve was getting on better than herself she hoped she had certainly never expected this when she revealed their success you have endangered a secret kept close by every woman to wear the shawl for over two thousand years merilille sat stiffbacked serenity almost abandoned on the tightlipped brink of apoplexy you must have been insane only madness could excuse this what secret elayne demanded vandene flanking merilille with her sister adjusted pale green silk skirts irritably and said time enough for that when youвђve been properly raised child i thought you had some sense adeleas in a dark gray wool with deep brown trim nodded mirroring vandeneвђs disapproval the child cannot be faulted for revealing a secret she did not know careane fransi said from elayneвђs left shifting her bulk in her greenandgilt armchair she was not stout but almost with shoulders as wide and arms as thick as most men tower law does not allow for excuses sareitha put in quickly in somewhat selfimportant tones her normally inquisitive brown eyes stern once mere excuses are allowed inevitably lesser and lesser excuses will become acceptable until law itself is gone her highbacked chair stood to the right only she wore her shawl but merililleвђs sitting room had been arranged as a court though no one called it that so far no one had merilille adeleas and vandene confronted elayne like judges sareithaвђs chair was placed where the seat of rebuke would be and careaneвђs the seat of pardon but the domani green who would have been her defender nodded thoughtfully as the tairen brown who would have been her prosecutor continued she has admitted guilt from her own mouth i recommend that the child be confined to the palace until we leave with some good hard work to occupy her mind and her hands i also recommend a firm dose of the slipper at regular intervals to remind her not to go behind sistersвђ backs and the same for nynaeve as soon as she can be found elayne swallowed confined perhaps they did not need to name this a trial for it to be one sareitha might not yet have achieved the ageless face but the weight of the other womenвђs years pressed at elayne adeleas and vandene with their hair nearly all white even their ageless faces echoing years merililleвђs hair was glossy black yet elayne would not have been surprised to learn she had worn the shawl as long or longer than most women not aes sedai lived for that matter careane might have as well not one of them approached her own strength in the power but all that experience as aes sedai all that knowledge all that authority a heavy reminder that she was only eighteen and had been in novice white a year ago careane made no move to rebut sareithaвђs suggestions perhaps she best go on defending herself plainly this secret you speak of has something to do with the circle but вђ the kin are no concern of yours child merilille broke in sharply drawing a deep breath she smoothed goldslashed skirts of silvery gray i propose to pass sentence she said in a cold voice i concur and defer to your decision adeleas said she gave elayne a disappointed frown and shook her head vandene waved her hand dismissively i concur and defer but i agree with the seat of rebuke careaneвђs look might have contained a sliver of sympathy maybe a sliver merilille opened her mouth the timid knock at the door sounded quite loud in the momentary thunderous silence what under the light merilille muttered angrily i told pol not to let anyone disturb us careane not the youngest but the lowest in strength careane stood and glided to the door despite her heft she always moved like a swan it was pol herself merililleвђs maid who popped in curtsying left and right a slender grayhaired woman usually possessed of a dignity to rival that of her mistress she wore an anxious frown now as well she might barging in after merililleвђs instructions elayne had not been so glad to see anyone since since mat cauthon appeared in the stone of tear a horrendous thought if aviendha did not say she had met tohsufficiently soon she might just see if asking the man to beat her after all could end the agony the queen brought this herself pol announced breathily proffering a letter sealed with a large red lump of wax she said if i didnвђt give it to elayne right away sheвђd bring it in herself she said itвђs about the childвђs mother elayne almost ground her teeth the sistersвђ serving women had all picked up their mistressesвђ way of talking about nynaeve and her if seldom where they could hear furious she snatched the letter without waiting for merilille to say she could вђ if that was what she would have said вђ and broke the seal with her thumb my lady elayne i greet the daughterheir of andor with joyous news i have but just learned that your mother queen morgase lives and is at present the guest of pedron niall in amador and wishes above all to be reunited with you so that you may return to andor together in triumph i offer escort through the bandits now infesting altara so that you may reach your motherвђs side in safety and all speed forgive these few poor words scribbled in haste but i know you would wish to learn the wondrous news as soon as possible until i can leave you at your motherвђs side sealed in the light jaichim carridin the paper crumpled in her fist how darehe the pain of her motherвђs death without even a body to be buried was only beginning to fade and carridin daredmock her this way embracing the true source she hurled the foul lies away from her and channeled fire flared in midair so hot that only a dust of ash fell to the blueandgold floor tiles thatfor jaichim carridin and as for these women the pride of a thousand years of andoran queens put steel into her backbone merilille surged to her feet you were not given permission to channel you will release the вђ leave us pol elayne said now the serving woman stared but elayneвђs mother had taught her well the voice of command the voice of a queen from her throne pol bobbed a curtsy and was moving before she realized once under way she hesitated only an instant before hurrying out and closing the door behind her whatever was about to happen plainly was for aes sedai alone what has gotten into you child pure fury submerged the remnants of merililleвђs regathered calm release the source immediately or i vow iвђll fetch a slipper myself this minute i am aes sedai the words came out like winter stone and elayne meant them to carridinвђs lies and these women merilille threatened to slipperher they wouldacknowledge her rightful place as a sister she and nynaeve had found the bowl as good as anyway and the arrangements for its use were under way you propose to punish me for endangering a secret apparently known only to sisters but no one bothered to tell me this secret when i attained the shawl you suggest punishing me like a novice or accepted but i am aes sedai i was raised to the shawl by egwene alвђvere the amyrlin you claim to serve if you deny that nynaeve and i are aes sedai then you deny the amyrlin seat who sent me to find the bowl of the winds which we have done i will not have it i call you to account merilille ceandevin submit to the will of the amyrlin seat or iwill call judgment on youas a rebellious traitor merililleвђs eyes bulged and her mouth hung open but she appeared composed beside careane or sareitha who looked about to choke to death on incredulity vandene seemed mildly taken aback a thoughtful finger pressed to her lips beneath slightly widened eyes while adeleas sat forward studying elayne as if seeing her for the first time channeling elayne floated one of the tall armchairs to her and sat composing her skirts you may as well sit too merilille she still used the voice of command вђ apparently it was the only way to make them listen вђ but she was startled when merilille actually sank back down slowly staring at her popeyed outside she maintained a calm cool faгade but inside anger bubbled no it boiled secrets she had always thought aes sedai kept too many secrets even from each other especially from each other true she kept some herself but only at necessity and not from anyone who needed to know and these women had thought to punish her your authority comes from the hall of the tower merilille nynaeveвђs and mine from the amyrlin seat ours supersedes yours from now on you will take your instructions from nynaeve or me we will of course listen carefully to any advice you might offer she had thought merililleвђs eyes bulged before but now impossible the gray spluttered you are вђ merilille elayne said sharply leaning forward do you still deny the authority of your amyrlin do you still dare merililleвђs mouth worked soundlessly she wet her lips she shook her head jerkily elayne felt a thrill of exultation all that about merilille taking direction was stuff and nonsense of course but she wouldbe acknowledged thom and her mother both said you must begin by asking for ten to get one still that was not enough to damp her anger she had half a mind to fetch a slipper herself and see how far she could push this except that would shatter everything they would remember her age fast enough then and how short a time ago she had put off a novice dress they might even begin thinking of her as a foolish child again which thought stoked her fury anew but she contented herself with while you think quietly on what else i should be told as aes sedai merilille adeleas and vandene will instruct me in this secret i endangered do you mean to tell me the tower has known of the circle вђ these kin as you call them вђ all along poor reanne and her hopes to avoid aes sedai notice as near as they could make themselves come to sisters i suppose vandene replied carefully she studied elayne as intently as her sister did now though a green she had many of the same mannerisms as adeleas careane arid sareitha looked stunned disbelieving eyes swinging from a silent redcheeked merilille to elayne and back even during the trolloc wars women failed their tests or lacked the strength or were sent away from the tower for any of the usual reasons adeleas had adopted a lecturing tone but not offensively browns often did when expounding under the circumstances it is hardly surprising that a number feared to go off into the world alone nor that they might flee to barashta as the city that existed here then was called though the main part of barashta was of course where the rahad now stands not that a stone of barashta remains the trolloc wars did not truly envelope eharon until late but in the end barashta fell as completely as barsine or shaemal or the kin vandene broke in gently adeleas blinked at her then nodded the kin persisted even after barashta fell in the same way they had before taking in wilders and women put out of the tower elayne frowned mistress anan had said the kin took in wilders too but reanneвђs biggest anxiety had seemed to be making her and nynaeve prove they were not none ever remained long adeleas added five years perhaps ten then i suppose as now once they realize that their little group is no replacement for the white tower they go off and become village healers or wisdoms or the like or sometimes simply forget the power stop channeling and take up a craft or trade in any case they vanish so to speak elayne wondered how anyone could forget the one power that way the urge to channel the temptation of the source was always there once you learned how aes sedai did seem to believe some women could just put it behind them though once they found out they would not be aes sedai vandene took up the explanation again the sisters frequently spoke almost in alternating sentences each carrying on smoothly where the other left off the tower has known of the kin from nearly the beginning perhaps from the very beginning at first no doubt the wars took precedence and despite calling themselves the kin they have done just what we want such women to do they remain hidden even the fact that they can channel draw no attention whatsoever to themselves over the years they have even passed along word вђ secretly of course carefully вђ when one of them found a woman falsely claiming the shawl you said something elayne shook her head careane is there any tea in that pot careane gave a small start i think adeleas and vandene might like to wet their throats the domani woman did not quite look at a stillstaring merilille before going to the table where the silver teapot and cups were that doesnвђt explain why elayne went on why is knowledge of them such a deep secret why havenвђt they been scattered long ago why the runaways of course adeleas made it sound the most obvious thing in the world it is a fact that other gatherings have been broken up as soon as found вђ the last about two hundred years ago вђ but the kin do keep themselves small and quiet that last group called themselves the daughters of silence yet they were hardly silent only twentythree of them altogether wilders gathered and trained after a fashion by a pair of former accepted but they вђ runaways elayne prompted taking a cup from careane with a smile of thanks she had not asked one for herself but she realized absently that the woman had offered her the first vandene and her sister had talked quite a bit about runaways on the way to ebou dar adeleas blinked and pulled herself back to the topic the kin help runaways they always have two or three women in tar valon keeping watch for one thing they approach almost every woman put out in a very circumspect way and for another they manage to find every runaway whether novice or accepted at least none has made it off the island without their help since the trolloc wars oh yes vandene said as adeleas paused to take a cup from careane it had been offered to merilille first but merilille sat slumped and staring bleakly at nothing if anyone does manage to escape why we know right where to look and she nearly always ends up back in the tower wishing her feet had never itched as long as the kin donвђt know we know anyway once that happens it will be back to the days before the kin when a woman running from the tower might go in any direction the numbers were larger then вђ aes sedai accepted novices andrunaways вђ and some years two out of three escaped clean others three out of four using the kin we retake at least nine of ten you can see why the tower has preserved the kin and their secret like precious jewels elayne could a woman was not done with the white tower until it was done with her besides it could not hurt the towerвђs reputation for infallibility that it always caught runaways almost always well now she knew she stood and to her astonishment adeleas did also and vandene waving away careaneвђs offered tea and sareitha even merilille after a moment they all looked at her expectantly even merilille vandene noticed her surprise and smiled another thing you might not know we are a contentious lot in many ways we aes sedai each jealous of her place and prerogatives but when someone is placed above us or stands above us we tend to follow her fairly meekly for the most part however we might grumble about her decisions in private why so we do adeleas murmured happily as if she had just discovered something merilille took a deep breath absorbing herself for a moment in straightening her skirts vandene is right she said you stand above us in yourself and i must admit you apparently have been placed above us if our behavior calls for penance well you will tell us if it does where are we to follow you if i may ask there was no sarcasm in any of that if anything her tone was more polite than elayne had heard out of her before she thought any aes sedai who ever lived would have been proud to control her features as well as she did right then all she had wanted was for them to admit she really was aes sedai she fought a momentary urge to protest that she was too young too inexperienced you can never put honey back in the comb so lini used to say when she was a girl egwene was no older drawing breath she smiled warmly the first thing to recall is that we areall sisters in every meaning of the word we must work together the bowl of the winds is too important for anything less she hoped they would all nod so enthusiastically when she told them what egwene intended perhaps we should sit again they waited for her before folding themselves back into their seats she hoped nynaeve was getting on a tenth so well when she found out about this nynaeve was going to faint from shock i have something of my own to tell you about the kin fairly soon it was merilille who looked ready to faint from shock and even adeleas and vandene were not far from it but they went right on saying yes elayne and if you say so elayne perhaps it would all go smoothly from now on the sedan chair was rocking through the crowds of revelers along the quay when moghedien spotted the woman she was being handed down from a coach at one of the boat landings by a footman in green and white a wide feathered mask covered her face more completely than moghedienвђs did but she would have known that determined stride known that woman from any angle in any light the carved screens that served as windows in the closed chair were certainly no hindrance two fellows with swords on their hips scrambled from the coach roof to follow the masked woman moghedien thumped a fist against the side of the chair shouting stop the bearers halted so quickly she was almost flung forward the crowd jostled past some shouting curses at her bearers for blocking the way some shouting more good naturedly down here by the river the throng ran thin enough for her to watch through the gaps the boat that pulled away from the landing seemed quite distinctive the roof of the low cabin in the rear was painted red she did not see that affectation on any of the others waiting at the long stone dock she wet her lips shivering moridinвђs instructions had been explicit the price of disobedience made excruciatingly clear but a slight delay would not hurt not if he never learned of it anyway flinging open the door she climbed out into the street and looked about hastily there that inn right overlooking the docks and the river lifting her skirts she hurried away without the slightest fear anyone might take her chair until she untied the webs of compulsion on them the bearers would tell anyone who asked that they were engaged and stand there until they died of hunger a path opened ahead of her men and women in feathered masks leaping aside before she reached them leaping with squeals and cries as they clutched where they thought they had been stabbed as they had there was no time to spin subtle webs on so many minds but a flurry of needles woven of air did as well here the stout innkeeper at the oarsmanвђs pride nearly leaped too at the sight of moghedien striding into her common room in gloriously scarlet silk worked with threadofgold and black silk that glistened as richly as the gold her mask was a great spray of pitch black feathers with a sharp black beak a raven that was moridinвђs joke his command as was the dress in fact his colors were black and red he said and she would wear them while she served him she was in livery however elegant and she could have killed everyone who saw her instead she spun a hasty web on the roundcheeked innkeeper that jerked her up straight and made her eyes pop no time for subtlety at moghedienвђs command to show her the roof the woman ranup the railless stairs at the side of the room it was unlikely any of the featherdraped drinkers saw anything unusual in the innkeeperвђs behavior moghedien thought with a small laugh the oarsmanвђs pride probably had never seen a patron of her quality before on the flat roof she quickly weighed the dangers of letting the innkeeper live versus those of killing her corpses had a way of pointing a finger eventually if you wished to remain quietly hidden in the shadows you did not kill unless you absolutely had to hastily she adjusted the web of compulsion told the woman to go down to her room to go to sleep and forget ever having seen her with the haste it was possible the innkeeper might lose the whole day or wake somewhat slower of wits than she had been вђ so much in moghedienвђs life would have been so much easier had she possessed a better talent for compulsion вђ but in any case the woman scurried away eager to obey and left her alone as the door thumped down flat into the duty whitetiled roof moghedien gasped at the sudden feel of fingers stroking her mind palping her soul moridin did that sometimes a reminder he said as if she needed any more she almost looked around for him her skin pebbled as though at a sudden icy breeze the touch vanished and she shivered again coming or going it did remind her moridin himself could appear anywhere at any time haste speeding to the low wall that surrounded the roof she searched the river spread out below scores of boats of every size swept along on their oars between larger vessels anchored or under sail most of the cabins of the sort she sought were plain wood but there she saw a yellow roof and there a blue and there in midriver and heading southward fast red it had to be the right one she could not take any more time here she raised her hands but as balefire launched itself something flashed around her and she jerked moridin hadcome he wasthere and he would she stared at the pigeons fluttering away pigeons she nearly spewed the contents of her stomach across the roof a glance at the river made her snarl because she had jerked the balefire she meant to slice through cabin and passenger instead had sliced diagonally through the middle of the boat about where the oarsmen had stood and the bodyguards because the rowers had been burned out of the pattern beforethe balefire struck the two halves of the craft were now a good hundred paces back up the river then again perhaps it was not a complete disaster because that slice from the boatвђs center had gone at the same time the boatmen really died the river had had minutes to rush in the two parts of the boat sank out of sight in a great froth of bubbles even as her eyes shifted to them carrying their passenger to the depths suddenly what she had done struck her she had always moved in the dim places always kept herself hidden always any woman in the city who could channel would know someone had drawn a great deal of saidar if not for what and any eye watching had seen that bar of liquid white fire sear across the afternoon fear gave her wings not fear terror gathering her skirts she ran back down the stairs ran through the common room bumping into tables and careering off people trying to get out her way ran into the street too frightened to think battering a path through the crowd with her hands run she shrieked hurling herself into the sedan chair her skirts caught in the door she ripped them free run the bearers flung themselves into motion tossing her about but she did not care she braced herself with fingers laced through the carved window screens and shook uncontrollably he had not forbidden this he might forgive or even ignore her independent action here if she carried out his instructions swiftly efficiently that was her only hope she was going to make falion and ispan crawl chapter serpent and wheel mashiara as the boat swept away from the landing nynaeve tossed her mask down beside her on the cushioned bench and slumped back with arms folded and braid gripped firmly scowling at nothing scowling at everything listening to the wind still told her a fierce storm was on the way the kind that tore off roofs and flattened barns and she almost wished the river would begin to kick up in waves right that minute if it isnвђt the weather nynaeve she mimicked then you should be the one to go the mistress of the ships might be insulted if we didnвђt send the strongest of us they know aes sedai put great store in that bah that had been elayne except for the bah elayne just thought putting up with any amount of nonsense from merilille would be preferable to facing nesta again once you began badly with someone it was hard to recover вђ mat cauthon was proof enough of that вђ and if they had gotten off any worse with nesta din reas two moons she would be sending the lot of them to fetch and carry horrible woman she grumbled shifting around on the seat cushions aviendha had been no better when nynaeve suggested she go to the sea folk those people had been fascinated by her she pitched her voice high and finicky not at all like aviendhaвђs but the mood fit we will learn of this trouble when we learn nynaeve alвђmeara perhaps i will learn something watching jaichim carridin today if not for the fact that nothing whatsoever frightened the aiel woman she would have thought aviendha fearful from her eagerness to spy on carridin a day standing in a hot street jostled by crowds was not amusing and today would be worse with the festival nynaeve would have thought the woman would enjoy a nice refreshing boat ride the boat lurched a nice refreshing boat ride she told herself nice cool breezes on the bay moist breezes not dry the boat rolled oh blood and ashes she moaned appalled she clapped a hand over her mouth and drummed her heels against the front of the bench in righteous outrage if she had to endure those sea folk for long she would have as much filth coming off of her tongue as mat did she did not want to think about him one more day folding her hands for that that man and she would yank every hair out of her head not that he had demanded anything unreasonable so far but she kept waiting for him to and his manner no she said firmly i want to settle my stomach not rile it the boat had begun a slow rocking she tried to concentrate on her clothes she was not fixated on clothes the way elayne sometimes seemed to be but thinking about silks and laces was soothing everything had been chosen to impress the mistress of the ships to try regaining a little lost ground for all the good it might do green silk slashed with yellow in the skirts embroidered in gold down the sleeves and across the bodice with golden lace along the hem and at her wrists and just bordering the neckline perhaps that should have been higher to be taken seriously but she did not own anything higher considering sea folk customs it was more than modest nesta would have to take her as she was nynaeve alвђmeara did not go changing herself for anyone the yellow opal pins stuck in her braid were her own вђ a present from the panarch of tarabon no less вђ but tylin had provided the gold necklace that fanned emeralds and pearls down to her bosom a richer piece than she had ever dreamed of owning a gift for bringing mat tylin had called it which made no sense at all but maybe the queen thought she needed some excuse for such a valuable present both goldandivory bracelets came from aviendha who had a surprising little stock of jewelry for a woman who so seldom wore more than that one silver necklace nynaeve had asked to borrow that pretty rosesandthorns ivory bracelet that the aiel woman never wore surprisingly aviendha had snatched it to her bosom as if it was her most precious possession and of all things elayne began comforting her nynaeve would not have been surprised to see the pair fall weeping on one anotherвђs shoulder there was something odd going on there and if she had not known those two were too sensible for such nonsense she would have suspected a man at the root of it well aviendha was too sensible elayne did still yearn for rand though nynaeve could hardly fault her for вђ suddenly she felt weaves of saidaralmost atop her in huge amounts and she floundered in salty water over her head flailing upward to find air tangled in her skirts flailing her head broke surface and she gasped for breath amid floating cushions staring in astonishment after a moment she recognized the slanting shape above her as one of the cabin seats and a bit of the cabin wall she was inside a trapped pocket of air not large she could have touched both sides without stretching her arms out fully but how an audible thud announced the bottom of the river the upsidedown cabin lurched tilted she thought the air pocket shrank a little the first order of business before wondering about anything was getting out before she used up the air she knew how to swim вђ she had splashed in the waterwood ponds often enough back home вђ it was just when the water started rocking her about that she minded filling her lungs she doubled over and swam down toward where the door must be kicking awkwardly because of her skirts it might help to shed the dress but she was not about to bob to the surface of the river in nothing but shift and stockings and jewels she was not about to leave those behind either besides she could not get out of the dress without loosing her belt pouch and she would drown before losing what was in there the water was black lightless her outstretched fingers struck wood and she felt across the piercework carving until she found the door scrabbled down the edge of that вђ and found a hinge muttering imprecations in her head she cautiously felt her way to the other side yes the latch handle she lifted it pushed outward the door moved maybe two inches вђ and stopped lungs straining she swam back up to the pocket but only long enough to fill them again this time finding the door came faster she stuck her fingers through the crack to find what held the door shut they sank into mud maybe she could dig away a little hillock or she felt higher more mud increasingly frantic she worked her fingers from the bottom of the crack to the top and then refusing to believe from the top to the bottom mud solid gooey mud all the way this time when she swam back up to the pocket she grabbed hold of the edge of the seat above her and hung from it panting heart beating wildly the air felt thicker i will not die here she muttered i will not die here she hammered a fist against the seat until she felt it bruise fighting for the anger that would allow her to channel she would not die not here alone no one would know where she had died no grave just a corpse rotting at the bottom of the river her arm fell with a splash she labored for breath flecks of black and silver danced in her eyes she seemed to be looking down a tube no anger she realized dimly she kept trying to reach for saidar but without any belief that she would touch it now she was going to die here after all no hope no lan and with hope gone flickering on the edge of consciousness like a guttering candle flame she did something she had never done before in her life she surrendered completely saidarflowed into her filled her she was only halfaware of the wood above her suddenly bulging outward bursting in rushing bubbles of air she drifted up out through the hole in the hull into darkness vaguely she knew she should do something she could almost remember what yes her feet kicked weakly she tried to move her arms to swim they seemed to just float something seized her dress and panic roused her in thoughts of sharks and lionfish and the light alone knew what else that might inhabit these black depths a spark of consciousness spoke of the power but she flailed desperately with fists and feet felt her knuckles land solidly unfortunately she also screamed or tried to a great quantity of water rushing down her throat washed away scream saidar and very nearly her final scraps of awareness something tugged on her braid then again and she was being towed somewhere she was no longer conscious enough to struggle or even to be very much afraid of being eaten abruptly her head broke surface hands encircled her from behind вђ hands not a shark after all вђ squeezed hard against her ribs in a most familiar way she coughed вђ water spewed from her nose вђ coughed again painfully and drew a shuddering breath she had never tasted anything so sweet in her life a hand cupped her chin and suddenly she was being towed again lassitude washed though her all she could do was float on her back and breathe and stare up at the sky so blue so beautiful the stinging in her eyes was not all from the salty river and then she was being pushed upward against the side of a boat a rude hand beneath her bottom shoving her higher until two lanky fellows with brass rings in their ears could reach down and haul her aboard they helped her walk a step or two but as soon as they let go to help her rescuer her legs collapsed like towers of soggy mush on unsteady hands and knees she stared blankly at a sword and boots and green coat someone had thrown down on the deck she opened her mouth вђ and emptied herself of the river elbar the entire river it seemed plus her midday meal and her breakfast it would not have surprised her at all to see a few fish or her slippers she was wiping her lips with the back of her hand when she became aware of voices my lord is all right my lord was down for a very long time forget me man said a deep voice get something to wrap around the lady lanвђs voice that she dreamed every night of hearing wideeyed nynaeve barely bit back a wail the horror she had felt when she thought she was going to die was nothing alongside what flashed through her now nothing this was a nightmare not now not like this not when she was a drowned rat kneeling with the contents of her stomach spread out before her without thought she embraced saidarand channeled water fell away from her clothes her hair in a rush and washed all evidence of her little mishap out through a scupper hole scrambling to her feet she hurriedly pulled her necklace aright and did her best to straighten her dress and hair but the soaking in salt water and then the rapid drying had left several stains on the silk and a number of creases that would require a knowledgeable hand with a hot iron to remove wisps of hair wanted to fly away from her scalp and the opals in her braid seemed to dot the bristling tail of an angry cat it did not matter she was calmness itself cool as an early spring breeze selfpossessed as she spun around before he could come on her from behind and startle her into disgracing herself completely she only realized how quickly she had moved when she saw that lan was just then taking his second step from the railing he was the most beautiful man she had ever seen soaking wet in shirt and breeches and stockings he was gorgeous with his dripping hair clinging to the angles of his face and a split purple bruise was rising on his face as from a blow she clapped a hand to her mouth remembering her fist connecting oh no oh lan iвђm so sorry i didnвђt mean to she was not really aware of crossing the space between them she was just there stretching up on toetips to lay fingers gently on his injury a deft weave of all five powers and his tanned cheek was unblemished but he might have been hurt elsewhere she spun the weaves to delve him new scars made her wince inside and there was something odd but he seemed healthy as a prime bull he was also very wet from saving her she dried him as she had herself water splashed around his feet she could not stop touching him both hands traced his hard cheeks his wonderful blue eyes his strong nose his firm lips his ears she combed that silky black hair into place with her fingers adjusted the braided leather band that held it her tongue seemed to have a life of its own too oh lan she murmured you really are here somebody giggled not her вђ nynaeve alвђmeara did not giggle вђ but somebody did it isnвђt a dream oh light youвђre here how a servant at the tarasin palace told me youвђd gone to the river and a fellow at the landing said what boat you had taken if mandarb hadnвђt lost a shoe i would have been here yesterday i donвђt care youвђre here now youвђre here she did not giggle maybe she is aes sedai one of the boatmen murmured not quite low enough but i still say sheвђs one duckling who means to stuff herself in that wolfвђs jaws nynaeveвђs face flashed pure scarlet and she snatched her hands to her sides her heels thumping to the deck another time she would have given the fellow what for and no mistake another time when she could think lan crowded everything else out of her head she seized his arm we can talk more privately in the cabin had one of the oarsmen snickered my sword and вђ iвђll bring it she said snatching up his things from the deck on flows of air one of those louts hadsnickered another flow of air pulled open the cabin door and she hustled lan and his sword and the rest inside and slammed it behind them light she doubted if even calle coplin back home had ever been as bold as this and as many merchantsвђ guards knew calleвђs birthmark as knew her face but it was not the same at all not at all still no harm in being just a tad less eager her hands went back to his face вђ only to straighten his hair some more just that вђ and he caught her wrists gently in his big hands myrelle holds my bond now he said quietly she is lending me to you until you find a warder of your own calmly pulling her right hand free she slapped his face as hard as she could swing his head hardly moved so she freed the other hand and slapped him harder with that how could you for good measure she punctuated the question with another slap you knew i was waiting one more seemed called for just to drive the point home how could you do such a thing how could you let her another slap burn you lan mandragoran burn you burn you burn you to the pit of doom burn you the man вђ the bloodyman вђ did not say one word not that he could of course what defense could he offer he just stood there while she rained blows at him making no move unblinking eyes looking peculiar as well they might with the way she reddened his cheeks for him if her slaps made little impression on him though the palms of her hands began to sting like fury grimly she clenched a fist and punched him in the belly with all her might he grunted slightly we will talk this over calmly and rationally she said stepping back from him as adults lan just nodded and sat down and pulled his boots over to him pushing bits of hair out of her face with her left hand she stuck the right behind her so she could flex her sore fingers without him seeing he had no right being that hard not when she wanted to hit him too much to hope she had cracked a rib in him you should thank her nynaeve how could the man sound so calm stamping his foot firmly into one boot he bent to pick up the other not looking at her you wouldnвђt want me bonded to you the flow of air seized a handful of his hair arid bent his head up painfully if you dare вђ if you even dare вђ to spout that drivel about not wanting to give me a widowвђs weeds lan mandragoran iвђll iвђll she could not think of anything strong enough kicking him was not near enough myrelle myrelle and her warders burn him removing his hide in strips would not be enough he might as well not have been bent over with his neck craned he just rested his forearms across his knees and watched her with that odd look in his eyes and said i thought about not telling you but you have a right to know even so his tone became hesitant lan was never hesitant when moiraine died вђ when a warderвђs bond to his aes sedai is snapped вђ there are changes as he continued her arms snaked around herself hugging tightly to keep her from shivering her jaw ached for she kept it clamped shut she released the flow holding him as if a hand springing away released saidar but he only straightened and went on relating this horror without so much as a flinch went on watching her suddenly she understood his eyes colder than winterвђs heart the eyes of a man who knew he was dead and could not make himself care a man waiting almost eager for that long sleep her own eyes stung with not weeping so you see he concluded with a smile that touched only his mouth an accepting smile when itвђs done she will have a year or more of pain and i will still be dead you are spared that my last gift to you mashiara mashiara his lost love you are to be my warder until i find one her voice startled her with its levelness she could not break down in tears now she would not now more than ever before she had to gather all her strength yes he said cautiously tugging on his other boot he had always seemed something of a halftame wolf and his eyes made him seem much less than half tame now good adjusting her skirts she resisted the urge to cross the cabin to him she could not let him see her fear because i have found him you i waited and wished with moiraine i wonвђt with myrelle she is going to give me your bond myrelle would if she had to drag the woman to tar valon and back by her hair for that matter she might drag her just for the principle of it donвђt say anything she said sharply when he opened his mouth her fingers brushed her belt pouch where his heavy gold signet ring lay wrapped in a silk handkerchief with an effort she moderated her tone he was ill and harsh words never helped sickness it was an effort though she wanted to berate him up one side and down the other wanted to pull her braid out by the roots every time she thought of him and that woman fighting to keep her voice calm she went on in the two rivers lan when somebody gives another a ring they are betrothed that was a lie and she halfexpected him to jump to his feet in outrage but he only blinked warily besides she had read about the notion in a story we have been betrothed long enough we are going to be married today i used to pray for that he said softly then shook his head you know why it canвђt be nynaeve and even if it could myrelle вђ despite all her promises to keep her temper to be gentle she embraced saidarand stuffed a gag of air into his mouth before he could confess what she did not want to hear so long as he did not confess she could pretend nothing had happened when she got hold of myrelle though opals pressed hard into her palm and her hand leaped from her braid as if burned she occupied her fingers with brushing his hair again while he glared at her indignantly above his gaping mouth a small lesson for you in the difference between wives and other women she said lightly such a struggle i would appreciate it very much if you did not mention myrelleвђs name again in my presence do you understand he nodded and she released the flow but as soon as he had worked his jaw a moment he said naming no names nynaeve you know sheвђs aware of everything i feel through the bond if we were man and wife she thought her face might burst into flame she had never thought of that bloody myrelle is there any way to make sure she knows it is me she said finally and her cheeks nearly did flash to fire especially when he fell back against the cabin wall laughing in astonishment light nynaeve you are a hawk light i havenвђt laughed since his mirth faded the coldness that had dimmed in his eyes for an instant returning i do wish it could be nynaeve but вђ it can and will she broke in men always seemed to get the upper hand if you let them talk too long she plumped herself down on his knees they were not married yet true but he was softer than the unpadded benches on this boat she shifted a bit to make herself more comfortable well no harder than the benches anyway you might as well reconcile yourself lan mandragoran my heart belongs to you and youвђve admitted yours belongs to me youbelong to me and i will not let you go you will be my warder and my husband and for a very long time i will not let you die do you understand that i can be as stubborn as i have to be i hadnвђt noticed he said and her eyes narrowed his tone sounded awfully dry as long as you do now she said firmly twisting her neck she peered through the piercework in the hull behind him then craned around to peer through the carving at the front of the cabin long stone docks thrusting out from the stone quay passed by all she could see ahead were more docks and the city gleaming white in the afternoon sun where are we going she muttered i told them to put us ashore as soon as i had you aboard lan said it seemed best to get off the river as fast as possible you she clamped her teeth shut he had not known where she was headed or why he had done the best he could with what he did know and he hadsaved her life i canвђt go back to the city yet lan clearing her throat she changed her tone however gentle she had to be with him that much syrup would make her sick up all over again i have to go to the sea folk ships to windrunner much better light but not too light and firm nynaeve i was right behind your boat i saw what happened you were fifty paces ahead of me and then fifty paces behind sinking it had to be balefire he did not need to say more she said it for him and with more knowledge than he had moghedien she breathed oh it could have been another of the forsaken or one of the black ajah perhaps but she knew well she had beaten moghedien not once but twice she could do so a third time if necessary her face must not have shared her confidence donвђt be afraid lan said touching her cheek donвђt ever be afraid while iвђm near if you have to face moghedien iвђll make sure you are angry enough to channel i seem to have some talent in that direction youвђll never make me angry again she began and stopped staring at him wideeyed iвђm not angry she said slowly not now but when you need to be вђ iвђm not angry she laughed she kicked her feet in delight and pounded her fists on his chest laughing saidar filled her not just with life and joy but this time with awe with feathery flows of air she stroked his cheeks i am not angry lan she whispered your block is gone he grinned sharing her delight but the grin put no warmth into his eyes i will take care of you lan mandragoran she promised silently i will not let you die leaning on his chest she thought of kissing him and even you are not calle coplin she told herself firmly a sudden horrible thought struck her all the more horrible because it had not come earlier the boatmen she said quietly my bodyguards wordlessly he shook his head and she sighed bodyguards light they had needed her protection not the other way around four more deaths to lay at moghedienвђs feet four on top of thousands but these were personal as far she was concerned well she was not about to settle moghedien this moment getting to her feet she began seeing what she could do about her clothes lan will you turn the boatmen around tell them to row for all they have as it was she would not see the palace again before nightfall and find out if one of them has such a thing as a comb she could not face nesta like this he picked up his coat and sword and gave her a bow as you command aes sedai pursing her lips she watched the door close behind him laughing at her was he she would wager someone on windrunnercould perform a marriage and from what she had seen of the sea folk she would wager lan mandragoran would find himself promising to do as he was told they would see who laughed then lurching and rolling the boat began to swing around and her stomach lurched with it oh light she groaned sinking onto the bench why could she not have lost that along with her block holding saidar aware of every touch of the air on her skin only made it worse letting go did not help she was notgoing to sick up again she wasgoing to make lan hers once and for all this was going to be a wonderful day yet if only she could stop feeling that storm on the way the sun sat luridly just above the rooftops by the time elayne rapped on the door with her knuckles revelers danced and cavorted in the street behind her filling the air with laughter and song and the scent of perfume idly she wished she had had a chance really to enjoy the festival a costume like birgitteвђs might have been fun or even one like that she had seen on the lady riselle one of tylinвђs attendants first thing this morning as long as she could have kept her mask on she rapped again harder the grayhaired squarejawed maid opened the door fury suddenly painting her face when elayne lowered her green mask you what are you doing back вђ fury turned to ghastly paleness as merilille removed her mask and adeleas and the others did the same the woman jerked with each ageless face revealed and even with sareithaвђs by that time maybe she saw what she expected to see with a sudden cry the maid tried to push the door shut but birgitte darted past elayne her feathered shoulder knocking it back open the servant staggered a few steps then gathered herself but whether to run or shout birgitte was there before time gripping her arm just below the shoulder easy birgitte said firmly we donвђt want any fuss or shouting now do we it did seem she was only holding the womanвђs arm almost supporting her but the maid stood very straight indeed and very still staring wideeyed at her captorвђs plumecrested mask she shook her head slowly what is your name elayne asked as everyone crowded into the entry hall behind her the closing door muted the noise from outside the maidвђs eyes darted from one face to the next as if she could not bear to gaze at any one for long cccedora you will take us to reanne cedora this time cedora nodded she looked about to cry cedora stiffly led the way upstairs with birgitte still holding her arm elayne considered telling her to release the woman but the last thing she wanted was a shouted alarm and everyone in the house fleeing in all directions that was why birgitte used muscle instead of elayne herself channeling she thought cedora was more frightened than hurt and everybody was to be at least a little frightened this evening in ththere cedora said nodding to a red door the door to the room where nynaeve and she had had that unfortunate interview she opened it and went in reanne was there seated with the fireplace carved with the thirteen sins at her back and so were another dozen women elayne had never seen before occupying all of the chairs against the pale green walls sweating with the windows tight and curtains drawn most wore ebou dari dresses though only one possessed the olive skin most had lines on their faces and at least a touch of gray and every last woman of them could channel to one degree or another seven wore the red belt she sighed in spite of herself when nynaeve was right she let you know it until you wanted to scream reanne bounded to her feet in the same redfaced fury cedora had shown and her first words were almost identical as well you how dare you show your face words and fury drained away together for the same reason too as merilille and the others entered on elayneвђs heels a yellowhaired woman in red belt and plunging neckline made a faint sound as her eyes rolled up in her head and she slid bonelessly from her red chair no one moved to help her no one even glanced at birgitte as she escorted cedora to a corner and planted her there no one seemed to breathe elayne felt a great desire to shout boo just to see what would happen reanne swayed whitefaced and visibly tried to gather herself with slight success it took her only a moment to scan the five coolfaced aes sedai lined up before the door and decide who must be in charge she wobbled across the floortiles to merilille and sank to her knees head bowed forgive us aes sedai her voice was worshipful and only a little steadier than her knees had been she babbled in fact we are only a few friends we have done nothing certainly nothing to bring discredit to aes sedai i swear that whatever this girl has told you we would have told you of her but we were afraid we only meet to talk she has a friend aes sedai did you catch her too i can describe her for you aes sedai whatever you wish we will do i swear we вђ merilille cleared her throat loudly your name is reanne corly i believe reanne flinched and whispered that it was still peering at the floor at the gray sisterвђs feet i fear you must address yourself to elayne sedai reanne reanneвђs head jerked up in a mostsatisfactory way she stared at merilille then by slow increments turned eyes as big as her face to elayne she licked her lips she drew a deep long breath twisting around on her knees to face elayne she bowed her head once more i beg your forgiveness aes sedai she said leadenly i did not know i could not вђ another long hopeless breath whatever punishment you decree we accept humbly of course but please i beg you to believe that вђ oh stand up elayne broke in impatiently she had wanted to make this woman acknowledge her as much as she had merilille or any of the others but the groveling sickened her thatвђs right stand on your feet she waited until reanne complied then walked over and sat in the womanвђs chair there was no need for cringing but she wanted no doubts who was in charge do you still deny knowledge of the bowl of the winds reanne reanne spread her hands aes sedai she said guilelessly none of us would ever use a terвђangreal much less an angrealor saвђangreal guileless and wary as a fox in a city i assure you we make no pretense of being anything even near to aes sedai we are just these few friends you see tied together by once having been allowed to enter the white tower that is all just these few friends elayne said dryly over steepled fingers and garenia of course and berowin and derys and alise yes reanne said reluctantly and them elayne shook her head very slowly reanne the white tower knows about your kin the tower has alwaysknown a dark woman with a tairen look to her though wearing a blueandwhite silk vest with the sigil of the goldsmithвђs guild gave a strangled scream and pressed both plump hands to her mouth a lean graying saldaean wearing the red belt crumpled with a sigh to join the yellowhaired woman on the floor and two more swayed as if they might for her part reanne looked to the sisters in front of the door for confirmation and saw it as she thought merililleвђs face was more icy than serene and sareitha grimaced before she could stop herself vandene and careane were both tightlipped and even adeleas seemed included turning her head this way and that to study the women along the walls as she might have insects previously unknown to her of course what reanne saw and what was were not the same they had all accepted elayneвђs decision but no amount of yes elayne could make them like it they would have been here two hours ago if not for a great deal of but elayne tossed in sometimes leading meant herding reanne did not faint but fear filled her face and she raised pleading hands do you mean to destroy the kin why now after so long what have we done that you should come down on us now no one will destroy you elayne told her careane since nobody else is going to help those two would you please jumps and blushes ran around the room and before careane could move two women were crouching over each one who had fainted lifting her up and waving smelling salts under her nose the amyrlin seat desires every woman who can channel to be connected to the tower elayne went on the offer is open to any of the kin who wish to accept had she woven flows of air around every one of those women she could not have frozen them more still had she squeezed those flows tight she could not have produced more bulging eyes one of the women who had fainted suddenly gasped and coughed pushing away the tiny vial of salts that had been held still too long that broke everyone free in a deluge of voices we can become aes sedai after all the tairen in the goldsmithвђs vest asked excitedly at the same time that a roundfaced woman with a red belt at least twice as long as anyone elseвђs burst out with they will let us learn they will teach us again a deluge of painfully eager voices we can really and they will let us from every side reanne rounded on them fiercely ivara sumeko all of you you forget yourselves you speak in front of aes sedai you speak in вђ front of вђ aes sedai she passed a hand over her face trembling an embarrassed silence descended eyes fell and blushes rose with all those lined faces all that gray and white hair elayne still was minded of nothing so much as a group of novices having a pillowfight after last had tolled when the mistress of novices walked in hesitantly reanne looked at her across her fingertips we truly will be allowed to return to the tower she mumbled into her hand elayne nodded those who can learn to become aes sedai will have the chance and there will be a place for all for any woman who channels unshed tears shone in reanneвђs eyes elayne was not sure but she thought the woman whispered i can be green it was hard not to rush over and throw her arms around her none of the other aes sedai showed any signs of giving way to emotion and merilille certainly was of sterner stuff if i may ask a question elayne reanne how many of you will we be taking in doubtless that pause covered a change from how many wilders and failures if reanne noticed or suspected she ignored it or did not care i cannot believe there are any who would refuse the offer she said breathlessly it may take some time to send word to everyone we remain spread out you see so she laughed a touch nervously and still not far from tears so aes sedai would not notice us at present there are one thousand seven hundred and eightythree names on the roll most aes sedai learned to cover shock with an outward show of calm and only sareitha allowed her eyes to widen she also mouthed silent words but elayne knew her well enough to read her lips two thousand wilders light help uselayne made a great show of adjusting her skirts until she was sure her own face was under control light help them indeed reanne misunderstood the silence you expected more accidents do take some every year or natural deaths as with everyone else and i fear the kin have grown fewer in the last thousand years perhaps we have been too cautious in approaching women when they leave the white tower but there has always been the fear that one of them might report being questioned and and we are not disappointed in the least elayne assured her making soothing gestures disappointed she very nearly giggled hysterically there were nearly twice as many kinswomen as there were aes sedai egwene could never say she had not done her part to bring women who could channel to the tower but if the kin refused wilders she must stick to the point conscripting the kin had only been incidental reanne she said gently do you think perhaps you might happen to recall where the bowl of the winds is now reanne blushed a sunset weвђve never touched them elayne sedai i donвђt know why they were gathered iвђve never heard of this bowl of the winds but there is a storeroom such as you describe over вђ belowstairs a woman channeled briefly someone screamed in purest terror elayne was on her feet in a flash as were they all from somewhere in that feathered dress birgitte produced a dagger that must have been derys reanne said sheвђs the only other one here elayne darted forward and caught her arm as she started for the door you arenвђt green yet she murmured and was rewarded with a lovely dimpled smile surprised and pleased and diffident all at once we will handle this reanne merilille and the others arrayed themselves to either side ready to follow elayne out but birgitte was at the door before any of them grinning as she put hand to latch elayne swallowed and said nothing that was the warderвђs honor so the gaidin said first to go in last to come out but she still filled herself with saidar ready to crush anything that threatened her warder the door opened before birgitte could lift the latch mat sauntered in pushing the slender maid elayne remembered ahead of him i thought you might be here he grinned insolently ignoring derysвђ glares and went on when i found a bloody great lot of warders drinking at my least favorite tavern iвђve just come back from following a woman to the rahad to the top floor of a house with nobody living on it to be precise after she left the floor was so dusty i could see right away which room sheвђd gone to thereвђs a flaming big rusted lock on the door but iвђll bet a thousand crowns to a kick in the bottom your bowl is behind it derys aimed a kick at him and he pushed her away pulling a small knife from his belt to bounce on his palm will one of you tell this wildcat watchdog whose side iвђm on women with knives make me uneasy these days we already know all about that mat elayne said well they had been just about to learn all about it and the stunned look on his face was priceless she felt something from birgitte the other woman gazed at her without any particular expression but that little knot of emotion in the back of elayneвђs head radiated disapproval aviendha probably would not think much of it either opening her mouth was one of the most difficult things elayne had ever done i must thank you though mat it is entirely due to you that we have found what we were looking for his gaping astonishment was almost worth the agony he closed his mouth quickly though opening it again to say then letвђs hire a boat and fetch this bloody bowl with any luck we can leave ebou dar tonight that is ridiculous mat and donвђt tell me iвђm demeaning you we are not crawling about the rahad in the dark and we are not leaving ebou dar until we have used the bowl he tried to argue of course but derys took the opportunity of his attention being elsewhere to try kicking him again he dodged around birgitte yelping for somebody to help him while the slender woman darted after him he is your warder elayne sedai reanne asked doubtfully light no birgitte is reanneвђs mouth fell open having answered a question elayne asked one a question she could not have brought herself to ask another sister reanne if you donвђt mind telling me how old are you the woman hesitated glancing at mat but he was still dodging to keep a grinning birgitte between him and derys my next naming day reanne said as if it was the most ordinary thing in the world will be my four hundred and twelfth merilille fainted dead away chapter flame of tar valon sealed to the flame elaida do avriny aвђroihan sat regally in the amyrlin seat the tall vinecarved chair painted now in only six colors instead of seven a sixstriped stole on her shoulders and ran her gaze around the circular hall of the tower the sittersвђ painted chairs had been rearranged along the stairfronted dais that encircled the chamber beneath the great dome spaced out to account for only six ajahs instead of seven now and eighteen sitters stood obediently young alвђthor knelt quietly beside the amyrlin seat he would not speak unless given leave which he would not receive today today he was merely another symbol of her power and the twelve most favored sitters glowed with the link that she herself controlled to keep him safe the greater consensus is achieved mother alviarin said meekly at her shoulder bowing humbly against the flametopped staff down on the floor below the dais sheriam screamed wildly and had to be restrained by the tower guard at her side the red sister shielding her sneered in contempt romanda and lelaine clung to a cold outward dignity but most of the others shielded and guarded on the floor wept quietly perhaps in relief that only four women had been given the ultimate penalty perhaps in fear of what else was to come the most ashen faces belonged to the three who had dared sit in a rebel hall for the nowdissolved blue every rebel had been cast out from her ajah until elaida granted permission to request reacceptance but the onetime blues knew they confronted difficult years working their way into her good graces years before they would be allowed to enter any ajah at all until then they lay in the palm of her hand she stood and it seemed the one power flowing through her from the circle was a manifestation of her power the hall concurs with the will of the amyrlin seat let romanda be the first to be birched romanda вђs head jerked let her see how much dignity she could retain until her stilling elaida gestured curtly take the prisoners away and bring in the first of the poor deluded sisters who followed them i will accept their submission there was a cry among the prisoners and one tore free from the guard gripping her arm egwene alвђvere threw herself onto the steps at elaidaвђs feet hands outstretched tears streaming down her cheeks forgive me mother the girl wept i repent i will submit i do submit please do not still me brokenly she sagged facedown shoulders shaking with sobs please mother i repent i do the amyrlin seat can show mercy elaida said exultantly the white tower had to lose lelaine and romanda and sheriam as examples but she could keep this girlвђs strength shewas the white tower egwene alвђvere you have rebelled against your amyrlin but i will show mercy you will be dressed in novice white again until i myself judge you ready to be raised further but this very day you shall be the first to take a fourth oath on the oath rod of fealty and obedience to the amyrlin seat the prisoners began falling on their knees crying out to be allowed to take that oath to prove their true submission lelaine was one of the first and neither romanda nor sheriam the last egwene crawled up the steps to kiss the hem of elaidaвђs dress i yield myself to your will mother she murmured through her tears thank you oh thank you alviarin seized elaidaвђs shoulder shook her wake up you fool woman she growled elaidaвђs eyes popped open to the dim light of a single lamp held by alviarin bending over her bed with a hand on her shoulder still only halfawake she mumbled what did you say i said вђplease wake up motherвђ alviarin replied coolly covarla baldene has returned from cairhien elaida shook her head trying to clear away the tag end of the dream so soon i did not expect them for another week at least covarla you say where is galina foolish questions alviarin would not know what she meant but in that cool crystalline tone the woman said she believes galina dead or a prisoner i fear the news is not good what alviarin should or should not know rushed out of elaidaвђs head tell me she demanded throwing off the silk sheet but as she rose and belted a silk robe over her nightdress she heard only snatches a battle hordes of aiel women channeling alвђthor gone disaster distractedly she noticed that alviarin was neatly garbed in a silverembroidered white dress with the keeperвђs stole around her neck the woman had waited till she clothed herself to bring her this the case clock in her study softly chimed second low as she entered the sitting room the small hours of the morning the worst time to receive dire news covarla rose hastily from one of the redcushioned armchairs her implacable face sagging with weariness and worry and knelt to kiss elaidaвђs ring her dark riding dress still bore the dust of travel and her pale hair needed a brush but she had donned the shawl she had worn as long as elaida had been alive elaida barely waited for the womanвђs lips to touch the great serpent before pulling her hand away why were you sent she said curtly snatching up her knitting from where she had left it in a chair she sat and began to work the long ivory needles knitting served many of the same purposes as fondling her carved ivory miniatures and she surely needed soothing now knitting helped her think too she had to think where is katerine if galina was dead katerine should have taken charge ahead of coiren elaida had made it clear that once alвђthor was taken the red ajah was in charge covarla stood slowly as if uncertain she should her hands tightened on the redfringed shawl looped over her arms katerine is among the missing mother i stand highest among those who her words trailed off as elaida stared at her fingers frozen in the act of passing wool over one of the needles covarla swallowed and shifted her feet how many daughter elaida asked finally she could not believe her voice was so calm i cannot say how many escaped mother covarla said hesitantly we dared not wait to make a thorough search and вђ how many elaida shouted with a shudder she made herself concentrate on her knitting giving way to anger was weakness loop the yarn pull through and push down soothing motions i вђ i brought eleven other sisters with me mother the woman paused breathing hard and then when elaida said nothing rushed on others may be making their way back mother gawyn refused to wait longer and we dared not remain without him and his younglings not with so many aiel about and the elaida did not hear twelve returned had any more escaped they would have sped back to tar valon would have been here as soon as covarla surely even if one or two were injured traveling slowly twelve out of thirtynine the tower had not suffered a disaster of this magnitude even during the trolloc wars these aiel wilders must be taught a lesson she said trampling over whatever covarla was babbling galina had thought she could use aiel to divert aiel what a fool the woman had been we will rescue the sisters they hold prisoner and teach them what it means to defy aes sedai and we will take alвђthor again she would not let him get away not if she had to personally lead the entire white tower to take him the foretelling had been certain she wouldtriumph casting an uneasy glance at alviarin covarla shifted her feet again mother those men вђ i think вђ do not think elaida snapped her hands clasped the knitting needles convulsively and she leaned forward so fiercely that covarla actually raised a hand as though to fend off an attack alviarinвђs presence had slipped from elaidaвђs mind well the woman knew what she knew now that could be dealt with later you have maintained secrecy covarla aside from informing the keeper oh yes mother covarla said hastily her head bobbed with eagerness glad that she had done something right i entered the city alone and hid my face until i reached alviarin gawyn meant to accompany me but the bridge guards refused to let any member of the younglings pass forget gawyn trakand elaida ordered sourly that young man remained alive to trouble her plans it seemed if galina did turn out to be alive still she would pay for failing in that on top of letting alвђthor escape you will leave the city as circumspectly as you entered daughter and keep yourself and the others well hidden in one of the villages beyond the bridge towns until i send for you dorian will do nicely they would have to sleep in barns in that tiny hamlet which had no inn the least their bungling deserved go now and pray that someone above you does arrive soon the hall will demand amends for this unparalleled catastrophe and at the moment it seems you stand highest among those at fault go covarlaвђs face went white she tottered so making her curtsy to leave elaida thought she might fall bunglers she was surrounded by fools traitors and bunglers as soon as elaida heard the outer door close she hurled down her knitting and sprang to her feet rounding on alviarin why have i not heard of this before if alвђthor escaped вђ what was it you said seven days ago вђ if he escaped seven days ago someoneвђs eyesandears must have seen him why was i not informed i can only pass on to you what the ajahs pass to me mother alviarin adjusted her stole calmly not a whit ruffled do you really mean to court a third debacle by attempting to rescue the captives elaida sniffed dismissively do you really believe wilders can stand before aes sedai galina let herself be surprised she must have she frowned what do you mean a thirddebacle you didnвђt listen mother shockingly alviarin sat without being given permission crossing her knees and serenely arranging her skirts covarla thought they might have held out against the wilders вђ though i believe she is nowhere near as certain as she tried to pretend вђ but the men were another matter several hundred of them in black coats all channeling she was very certain of that and so are the others apparently living weapons she called them i think she nearly soiled herself just remembering elaida stood as if poleaxed several hundred impossible there canвђt be more than вђ she walked to a table that seemed all ivory and gilt and poured herself a goblet of wine punch the lip of the crystal pitcher rattled against the crystal goblet and almost as much punch went onto the golden tray since alвђthor can travel alviarin said suddenly it seems logical at least that some of these men can too covarla is quite sure that was how they arrived i suppose he is rather upset at his treatment covarla seemed somewhat uneasy about it she implied that a number of the sisters were he might feel he owes you something it would not be pleasant to have those men suddenly stepping out of thin air right here in the tower would it elaida practically tossed the punch down her throat galina had been instructed to begin making alвђthor supple if he came for revenge if there really were hundreds of men who could channel or even one hundred she had to think of course if they were coming i believe they would have by now they would not have wasted surprise perhaps even alвђthor doesnвђt wish to confront the full tower i suppose they have all returned to caemlyn to their black tower which means i fear that toveine has a most unpleasant shock awaiting her pen an order for her to return immediately elaida said hoarsely the punch did not seem to help she turned and gave a start to find alviarin right in front of her maybe there were not even one hundred вђ not even one hundred вђ at sunset tenwould have seemed madness вђ but she could not take the chance write it out yourself alviarin now right now and how is it to be gotten to her alviarin tilted her head icily curious for some reason she wore a faint smile none of uscan travel the ships will put toveine and her party ashore in andor any day now if they have not already you told her to divide into small groups and avoid villages so as to give no warning no elaida i am afraid toveine will regather her forces near caemlyn and attack the black tower without any word from us reaching her elaida gasped the woman had just called her by name and before she could begin to splutter with outrage worse came i think you are in great trouble elaida cold eyes stared into elaidaвђs and cold words slid smoothly from alviarinвђs smiling lips sooner or later the hall will learn of the disaster with alвђthor galina might have satisfied the hall possibly but i doubt covarla will they will want someone higher to pay and sooner or later we will all learn toveineвђs fate it will be difficult to keep this on your shoulders then casually she adjusted the amyrlinвђs stole around elaidaвђs neck in fact it will be impossible if they learn any time soon you will be stilled made an example the way you wanted to make siuan sanche but there might be time to recover if you listen to your keeper you must take good advice elaidaвђs tongue felt frozen the threat could not have been clearer what you have heard tonight is sealed to the flame she said thickly but she knew that the words were useless before they were out of her mouth if you mean to reject my advice alviarin paused then began to turn away wait elaida pulled down the hand she had stretched out unaware stripped of the stole stilled even after that they would make her howl what вђ she had to stop and swallow what advice does my keeper offer there had to be some way to stop this sighing alviarin came close again closer in fact much too near for anyone to stand to the amyrlin their skirts almost touching first i fear you must abandon toveine to whatever comes for the moment at least and also galina and whoever else was taken prisoner whether by the aiel or the ashaвђman any attempted rescue now must mean discovery elaida nodded slowly yes i can see that she could not take her horrified eyes away from the other womanвђs demanding gaze there had to be a way this could not be happening and i think it is time to reconsider your decision about the tower guard donвђt you really think the guard should be increased after all i вђ can see my way clear to do that light she had to think so good alviarin murmured and elaida flushed with helpless rage tomorrow you will personally search josaineвђs rooms and adelornaвђs why under the light would i вђ the woman tugged her striped stole again roughly this time almost as if to yank it off or saw through her neck with it it seems that josaine found an angrealsome years ago and never turned it in adelorna did worse i fear she removed an angrealfrom one of the storerooms without permission when you have found them you will announce their punishment immediately something quite stiff and at the same time you will hold up doraise kiyoshi and farellien as models of preserving the law you will give each a present a fine new horse will do elaida wondered whether her eyes were going to pop right out of her face why from time to time a sister kept an angrealto herself in defiance of the law but the penance was seldom more than a stern slap on the knuckles every sister knew the temptation and the rest the effect was obvious everyone would believe doraise and kiyoshi and farellien had exposed the other two josaine and adelorna were green the others brown gray and yellow respectively the green ajah would be furious they might even try to get back at the others which would incite those ajahs and why do you want to do this alviarin elaida it should be enough for you that it is my advice mocking honeyed ice suddenly turned to cold iron i want to hear you say that you will do as you are told thereвђs no point in me working to keep the stole on your neck otherwise say it i вђ elaida tried to look away oh light she had to think her belly was clenched in a knot i will вђ do вђ as i вђ am told alviarin smiled that chilly smile you see that did not hurt very much suddenly she stepped back spreading her skirts in a moderate curtsy with your permission i will withdraw and let you find some sleep in what remains of the night you have an early morning ahead with orders to issue for high captain chubain and apartments to search we have to decide when to let the tower know about the ashaвђman too her tone made it clear that she would decide and perhaps we should begin planning our next move against alвђthor it is about time the tower stood openly and called him to heel donвђt you think think well i give you good night elaida dazed wanting to sick up elaida watched her go stand openly that would inviteattack by these вђ what had the woman called them вђ these ashaвђman this could not be happening to her not to her before she realized what she was doing she hurled the goblet across the room to shatter against a tapestry of flowers seizing the pitcher with both hands she raised it overhead with a shriek of fury and flung that too in a spray of punch the foretelling had been so certain she would abruptly she stopped frowning at the tiny shards of crystals clinging to the tapestry the larger pieces scattered across the floor the foretelling surely that had spoken of her triumph hertriumph alviarin might have her minor victory but the future belonged to elaida as long as alviarin could be gotten rid of but it had to be done quietly in some way so that even the hall would want silence a way that would not point to elaida until it was too late should alviarinвђs sails gain wind and suddenly the why came to her alviarin would not believe if she was told no one would could alviarin have seen her smile then the womanвђs knees would have turned to jelly before she was done alviarin would envy galina alive or dead pausing in the hallway outside elaidaвђs apartments alviarin studied her hands by the light of the standlamps they did not shake which surprised her she had expected the woman to fight harder to resist longer but it was begun and she had nothing to fear unless elaida learned that no fewer than five ajahs had passed mention of alвђthor to her in the last few days the deposing of colavaere had sent every ajahвђs agent in cairhien flying for a pen no if elaida did learn she was safe enough with the hold she had on the woman now and with mesaana as patron elaida though was finished whether she realized or not even if the ashaвђman failed to trumpet their crushing of toveineвђs expedition вђ and she was sure they would crush it after what mesaana had told her of events of dumaiвђs wells вђ all the eyesandears in caemlyn truly would gain wings once they learned lacking a miracle such as the rebels appearing at the gates elaida would suffer siuan sancheвђs fate in a matter of weeks in any case it had begun and if she wished she knew what it was all she really had to do was obey and watch and learn perhaps she would wear the sevenstriped stole herself when all was done in the early morning sunlight streaming through her windows seaine dipped the pen but before she could write the next word the door to the hall opened and the amyrlin swept in seaineвђs thick black eyebrows rose she would have expected anyone else at all before elaida perhaps not excluding rand alвђthor himself still she set the pen down and rose smoothly pulling down the silverwhite sleeves she had pushed up to keep clear of the ink she made the degree of curtsy proper to the amyrlin seat from a sitter in her own apartments i do hope you havenвђt found any white sisters hiding away angreal mother she did hope it quite fervently elaidaвђs descent on the greens a few hours ago while most of them slept was probably still producing wails and gnashing of teeth in living memory no one had been ordered birched for keeping back an angreal and now there were to be two the amyrlin must have been in one of her infamous cold furies but if she had been then no sign of it remained now for a moment she regarded seaine silently cool as a winter pond in her redslashed silks then glided to the carved sideboard where painted ivory miniatures of seaineвђs family stood all years dead but she still loved every one you did not stand to raise me amyrlin elaida said picking up the picture of seaineвђs father she set it down hastily and took up her mother instead seaineвђs eyebrows almost rose again but she tried to make it a rule not to let herself be surprised more than once in a day i was not informed that the hall was sitting until afterward mother after all these years a touch of lugard still clung to her voice yes yes abandoning the paintings elaida glided to the fireplace seaine had always had a fondness for cats and carved wooden cats of every sort crowded the mantelpiece some in amusing poses the amyrlin frowned at the display then squeezed her eyes shut and gave her head a tiny shake but you remained she said turning quickly every sitter who was not informed fled the tower and joined the rebels except you why seaine spread her hands what else could i do but stay mother the tower must be whole whoever the amyrlin she added to herself and whatвђs wrong with my cats if i may asknot that she ever would aloud of course sereille bagand had been a fierce mistress of novices before being raised amyrlin seat the very year she herself earned the shawl and a fiercer amyrlin than elaida could be with a sore tooth seaine had had the proprieties driven into her too hard and deep for mere years to shift or any dislike for the woman who wore the stole one did not have to like an amyrlin the tower must be whole elaida agreed rubbing her hands together it must be whole now why was she nervous she had ninetynine kinds of temper all hard as a knife and twice as sharp but nervous the woman was not what i say to you now is sealed to the flame seaine her mouth twisted wryly and she shrugged giving her stole an irritable twitch if i knew how to make the seal stronger i would she said dry as yesterdayвђs dust i will hold your words in my heart mother i want you вђ i command you вђ to undertake an inquiry and you must indeed hold it in your heart the wrong ear hearing of it might mean death and disaster for the whole tower seaineвђs eyebrows twitched death and disaster for the whole tower in my heart she said again will you sit yourself mother that was proper in her own apartments may i pour you some mint tea or plum punch waving away the offer of refreshment elaida took the most comfortable chair carved by seaineвђs father as a gift when she received the shawl though of course the cushions had been replaced many times since the amyrlin made the country chair seem a throne all stiff back and iron countenance most ungraciously she did not give permission for seaine to sit too so seaine folded her hands and remained standing i have thought long and hard on treason seaine since my predecessor and her keeper were allowed to escape helped to escape treason must have been at the core of that and i fear only a sister or sisters could have effected it that would certainly be a possibility mother elaida frowned at the interruption we can never be sure who has the shadow of treason in her heart seaine why i suspect that someone arranged for an order of mine to be countermanded and i have reason to believe that someone has communicated privately with rand alвђthor to what end i cannot say but that surely is treason against me and against the tower seaine waited for more but the amyrlin only looked back at her slowly smoothing her redslashed skirts exactly what inquiry do you wish me to make mother she asked cautiously elaida bounded to her feet i charge you to follow the stench of treason no matter where it leads or how high even to the keeper herself yes even to her what you find whoever it leads to you will bring before the amyrlin seat alone seaine no one else must know do you understand me i understand your commands mother which she thought once elaida had departed even more swiftly than she had come was about all she did understand in order to think she took the chair the amyrlin had vacated fists pressed beneath her chin in just the way her father had always sat thinking everything fell to logic eventually she would not have stood against siuan sanche вђ she had proposed the girl as amyrlin in the first place вђ but once it was done and all the forms were followed however sparely aiding her escape certainly had been treason and deliberately countermanding an amyrlinвђs order just as much possibly communicating with alвђthor was too that depended on what was communicated with what intent finding who had changed the amyrlinвђs command would be difficult without knowing what command at this late date learning who might have helped siuan escape stood about as much chance of success as learning who might be writing to alвђthor so many pigeons flew into and out of the tower cotes every day that at times the sky seemed to be raining feathers if elaida knew more than she had said she had certainly gone around the barn this all made very little sense treason ought to make elaida boil with rage but she had not been angry she had been nervous and anxious to be gone and secretive as if she did not want to tell everything she knew or suspected almost as though she was afraid to what kind of treason would make elaida nervous or afraid death and disaster for the whole tower like the pieces of a blacksmithвђs puzzle all fell into place and seaineвђs eyebrows tried to climb onto her scalp it fit it all fit she felt the blood draining from her face her hands and feet were suddenly icy sealed to the flame she had said she would keep this in her heart but everything had changed since she spoke those words she only let herself be afraid when it was logical to be and right then she was terrified she could not face this alone but who under the circumstances who this answer came much more easily gathering herself took a little time but she hurried from her rooms and out of the white quarters walking a good deal faster than she usually did servants scurried through the corridors as always though she walked so quickly that she was past most before they could begin bow or curtsy but there seemed fewer sisters about than the early hour could account for many fewer yet if most were staying close to their quarters for some reason the few she saw made up for it in one way sisters swarmed along the tapestryhung hallways faces all serenity and their eyes seemed to have steam behind them here and there two or three women spoke together with sharp eyes darting to see who might be listening always two or three of the same ajah even yesterday she was sure she had still seen women sharing friendship between ajahs whites were supposed to put emotion away entirely but she had never seen the reason for blinding herself as some did suspicion made the air in the tower like hot jelly not a new thing unfortunately вђ the amyrlin had begun it with her harsh measures and the rumors about logain had only exacerbated the situation вђ but this morning seemed worse than ever talene minly came around a corner ahead of her her shawl not just across her shoulders but spread down her arms as though to display the green fringe for that matter she realized that every green she had seen this morning wore her shawl talene goldenbaked and statuesque and lovely had stood to depose siuan but she had come to the tower while seaine was accepted and that decision had not dented their long friendship talene had had reasons seaine accepted if not agreed with today her friend stopped watching her warily so many sisters seemed to watch one another that way of late another time she would have stopped but not with what made her head want to burst open like a spoiled melon talene was a friend and she thought she could be sure of her but thinking was not enough for this later if possible she would approach talene hoping it would be possible she hurried past with only a nod in the red quarters the mood was even worse the air thicker as with the other ajahs there were many more rooms than there were sisters to fill them now вђ that had been so long before the first rebel fled вђ but the red was the largest of the ajahs and sisters filled the levels still in use reds frequently wore their shawls when there was no need but now every last woman sported her red fringe like a banner conversations stopped as seaine approached and cold eyes followed her in a bubble of icy silence she felt an invader deep in enemy country as she crossed those peculiar floor tiles white with the teardrop flame of tar valon in red but then any part of the tower might be enemy country looking another way those scarlet flames might be taken for red dragonвђs fangs she had never believed those irrational tales about the reds and false dragons but why would none of them deny it she had to ask directions i will not disturb her if she is busy she said we were close friends once and i would like us to be again now more than ever the ajahs cannot afford to drift apart all true though the ajahs seemed to splitting apart rather than drifting but the domani woman listened with a face that could have been cast in copper there were not many domani reds and those few usually meaner than snakes caught in a fence i will show you sitter the woman said at last and not very respectfully she led the way then watched while seaine knocked on the door as though she could not be trusted here alone the door panels were carved with the flame too lacquered the color of fresh blood come a brisk voice called from within seaine opened the door hoping she was right seaine pevara exclaimed cheerfully what brings you here this morning come shut the door and sit it was as if all the years since they were novice and accepted together had melted away quite plump and not tall вђ in truth for a kandori she was short вђ pevara was also quite pretty with a merry twinkle in her dark eyes and a ready smile it was sad that she had chosen red no matter how good her reasons because she still liked men the red did attract women who were naturally suspicious of men of course but others chose it because the task of finding men who could channel was important whether they liked men or disliked them or did not care one way or the other in the beginning however not many women could belong to the red for long without taking a jaundiced view of all men seaine had reason to believe pevara had served a penance shortly after attaining the shawl for saying that she wished she had a warder since reaching the safer heights of the hall she had openly said warders would make the red ajahвђs work easier not that that had any part in seaine trusting her of all the sisters in the tower though pevara was the one she was sure she couldtrust with this i cannot tell you how happy i am to see you pevara said once they were ensconced in armchairs carved in the spirals popular in kandor a hundred years ago with delicate butterflypainted cups of blueberry tea in hand iвђve often thought how i should go to you but i admit to fearing what you would say after i gave you the cut direct so many years ago sworn on the blade seaine iвђd not have done it except tesien jorhald practically had me by the scruff of my neck and i was too new to the shawl to have much backbone yet can you forgive me of course i can seaine replied i understood the red firmly discouraged friendships outside the ajah quite firmly and quite efficiently we cannot go against our ajahs when we are young and later it seems impossible to retrace our steps a thousand times iвђve remembered us whispering together after last вђ oh and the pranks do you recall when we dusted seranchaвђs shift with powdered itchoak вђ but iвђm shamed to say it took being terrified out of my wits to stir my feet i do want us to be friends again but i need your help too you are the only one iвђm sure i can trust serancha was a prig then and still is pevara laughed the gray is a good place for her but i canвђt believe you terrified at anything why you never decided it was logical to be afraid until we were back in our beds short of a promise to stand in the hall without knowing what for whatever help i can give is yours seaine what do you need brought to the point seaine hesitated sipping her tea not that she had any doubts about pevara but pushing the words out of her mouth was difficult the amyrlin came to see me this morning she said finally she instructed me to make an inquiry sealed to the flame pevara frowned slightly but she did not say that in that case seaine should not be speaking of it seaine might have planned how to carry out most of their pranks as girls but pevara had been the one with the audacity to think most of them up and she had provided most of the nerve to go through with them she was very circumspect but after a little thought it was clear to me what she wanted i am to hunt out at the last courage failed her tongue darkfriends in the tower pevaraвђs eyes as dark as her own were blue became stone and swept to the mantel above her fireplace where miniatures of her own family made a precise line they had all died while she was a novice parents brothers and sisters aunts uncles and all murdered in a quickly suppressed uprising of darkfriends who had become convinced the dark one was about to break free that was why seaine had been sure she could trust her that was why pevara had chosen red вђ though seaine still thought she could have done as well and been happier as a green вђ because she believed a red hunting men who could channel had the best chance of finding darkfriends she had been very good at it that plump exterior covered a core of steel and she possessed the courage to say calmly what seaine had been unable to bring herself to utter the black ajah well no wonder elaida would be circumspect pevara i know sheвђs always denied its existence harder than any three other sisters combined but iвђm certain sure thatвђs what she meant and if she is convinced her friend waved her off you have no need to convince me seaine i have been sure the black ajah exists for strangely pevara became hesitant peering into her teacup like a fortuneteller at a fair what do you know of events right after the aiel war two amyrlins dying suddenly in the space of five years seaine said carefully she assumed the other woman meant events in the tower truth to tell until being raised a sitter nearly fifteen years ago just a year after pevara she had not given much attention to anything outside the tower and not that much inside really a great many sisters died in those years as i recall do you mean to say you think the the black ajah had a hand in that there she had said it and the name had not burned her tongue i donвђt know pevara said softly shaking her head youвђve done well to wrap yourself deep in philosophy there were things done then and sealed to the flame she drew a troubled breath seaine did not press her she herself had committed something akin to treason by breaking that same seal and pevara would have to decide on her own looking at reports will be safer than asking questions with no idea who weвђre really asking logically a black sister must be able to lie despite the oaths otherwise the black ajah would have been revealed long since that name seemed to be coming more easily with use if any sister wrote that she did one thing when we can prove she did another then we have found a darkfriend pevara nodded yes perhaps the black ajah has no hand in the rebellion but i cannot think they would let this turmoil pass without taking advantage we must look closely at this last year i think to that seaine agreed reluctantly there would be fewer pieces of paper to read and more questions to ask concerning recent months deciding who else to make part of the inquiry was even harder especially after pevara said you were very brave coming to me seaine iвђve known darkfriends to kill brothers sisters parents to try hiding who they are and what theyвђve done i love you for it but you were very brave indeed seaine shivered as if a goose had walked on her grave had she wanted to be brave she would have chosen green she almost wished elaida had gone to someone else there was no turning back now though chapter dragon a bath the days after sending perrin away seemed endless to rand and the nights longer he retreated to his rooms and stayed there telling the maidens to allow no one to enter only nandera was allowed past the doors with the gilded suns bringing his meals the sinewy maiden would set down a covered tray and list those who had asked to see him then give him a look of rebuke when he repeated that he would see no one often he heard disapproving comments from the maidens outside before she pulled the door shut behind her he was intended to hear else they would have used handtalk but if they thought to chivy him out by claiming that he was sulking the maidens did not understand and might not if he explained if he could have brought himself to he picked at the meals without appetite and tried to read but his favorite books could divert him for only a few pages even in the beginning at least once every day though he had promised himself he would not he lifted the massive wardrobe of polished blackwood and ivory in his bedchamber floated it aside on flows of air and carefully unraveled the traps he had set and the mask of mirrors that made the wall seem smooth all inverted so no other eyes but his could see there in a niche hollowed out with the power stood two small statues of white stone about a foot tall a woman and a man each in flowing robes and holding a clear crystal sphere overhead in one hand the night he set the army in motion toward illian he had gone to rhuidean alone to fetch these terвђangreal if he needed them he might not have much time that was what he had told himself his hand would stretch toward the bearded man the only one of the pair a man could use stretch out and stop shaking one finger touching and more of the one power than he could imagine could be his with that no one could defeat him no one stand against him with that lanfear had said once he could challenge the creator it is mine by right he muttered each time with his hand trembling just short of the figure mine i am the dragon reborn and each time he made himself draw back reweaving the mask of mirrors reweaving the invisible traps that would burn anyone to a cinder who tried to pass them without the key the huge wardrobe wafted back into place like a feather he was the dragon reborn but was that enough it would have to be i am the dragon reborn he whispered at the walls sometimes and sometimes shouted at them i am the dragon reborn silently and aloud he raged at those who opposed him the blind fools who could not see and those who refused to see for ambition or avarice or fear he was the dragon reborn the only hope of the world against the dark one and the light help the world for it but his rages and thoughts of using the terвђangrealwere only attempts to escape other things and he knew it alone he picked at his meals though less every day and tried to read though seldom and attempted to find sleep that he tried more often as the days passed not caring whether the sun was down or high sleep came in fitful snatches and what harrowed his waking thoughts also stalked his dreams and chased him awake too soon for any rest no amount of shielding could keep out what was already inside he had the forsaken to face and sooner or later the dark one himself he had fools who fought him or ran away when their only hope was to stand behind him why would his dreams not let him be from one dream he always sprang awake before it more than began to lie there filled with selfloathing and muddled with lack of sleep but the others he deserved them all he knew colavaere confronted him sleeping her face black and the scarf she had used to hang herself still buried in the swollen flesh of her neck colavaere silent and accusing with all the maidens who had died for him arrayed behind her in silent staring ranks all the women who died because of him he knew every face as well as his own and every name but one from those dreams he woke weeping a hundred times he hurled perrin across the grand hall of the sun and a hundred times he was overwhelmed by blazing fear and rage a hundred times he killed perrin in his dreams and woke to his own screams why had the man chosen the aes sedai prisoners to use for their argument rand tried not to think about them he had done his best to ignore their existence from the beginning they were too dangerous to keep long as captives and he had no idea what to do with them they frightened him sometimes he dreamed of being bound inside the box again of galina and erian and katerine and the rest taking him out to beat him dreamed and woke whimpering even after he convinced himself his eyes were open and he was outside they frightened him because he feared he might give way to the fear and the anger and then he tried not to think of what he might do then but sometimes he dreamed it and woke shaking in a cold sweat he would not do that whatever he had done he would not do that in dreams he gathered the ashaвђman to attack the white tower and punish elaida he leaped from a gateway filled with righteous anger and saidinвђ and learned that alviarinвђs letter had been a lie saw her stand alongside elaida saw egwene beside her too and nynaeve and even elayne all with aes sedai faces because he was too dangerous to let run free he watched the ashaвђman destroyed by women who had years of studying the one power behind them not just a few months of harsh tutoring and from those dreams he could never wake until every man in a black coat was dead and he stood alone to face the might of the aes sedai alone again and again cadsuane spoke those words about madmen hearing voices till he flinched at them as at blows of a whip flinched in his sleep when she appeared in dreams and waking he called to lews therin shouted at him screamed for him and only silence answered alone that small bundle of sensations and emotions in the back of his head the sense of alannaвђs almost touch slowly became a comfort in many ways that frightened him most of all on the fourth morning he woke groggily from a dream of the white tower flinging up a hand to shield grainy eyes from what he thought was a flare of saidarwrought fire dust motes sparkled in the sunlight streaming through the window to reach his bed with its great square blackwood bedposts inlaid with ivory wedges every piece of furnishing in the room was polished blackwood and ivory square and stark and heavy enough to suit his mood for a moment he lay there but if sleep returned it would only bring another dream are you there lews therinhe thought without any hope of answer and wearily pushed himself to his feet tugging his wrinkled coat straight he had not changed his clothes since first shutting himself away when he staggered into the anteroom at first he thought he was dreaming again the dream that always woke him straight off in shame and guilt and loathing but min looked up at him from one of the tall gilded chairs a leatherbound book on her knees and he did not wake dark ringlets framed her face big dark eyes so intent he almost felt her touch her breeches of brocaded green silk fit her like a second skin and her coat of matching silk hung open a creamcolored blouse rising and falling with her breath he prayed to wake it had not been fear or anger or guilt over colavaere or lews therinвђs disappearance that drove him to shut himself away thereвђs a feast of sorts in four days she said brightly at the half moon the day of repentance they call it for some reason but there will be dancing that night sedate dancing i hear but any dancing is better than none carefully tucking a thin strip of leather into the book she placed it on the floor beside her thatвђs just time to have a dress made if i set the seamstress to work today that is if you mean to dance with me he pulled his gaze away from her and it fell on a clothcovered tray beside the tall doors just the thought of food made him queasy nandera was not supposed to let anyone in burn her least of all min he had not mentioned her by name but he had said no one min i вђ i donвђt know what to say i вђ sheepherder you look like what the dogs fought over now i understand why alanna was so frantic even if i donвђt see how she knew she practically begged me to speak to you after the maidens turned her away for about the fifth time nandera wouldnвђt have let mein if she wasnвђt in a lather about you not eating and even so i had to do a little begging myself you owe me country boy rand flinched images of himself flashed in his head him tearing at her clothes forcing himself on her like a mindless beast he owed her more than he could ever pay raking a hand through his hair he made himself turn to face her she had tucked her feet up so she sat crosslegged in the chair leaning her fists on her knees how could she look at him so calmly min thereвђs no excuse for what i did if there was any justice iвђd go to the gallows if i could iвђd put the rope around my neck myself on oath i would the words tasted bitter he was the dragon reborn and she would have to wait on justice until the last battle what a fool he had been to want to live past tarmon gaiвђdon he did not deserve to what are you talking about sheepherder she said slowly iвђm talking about what i did to you he groaned how could he have done that to anyone but most of all to her min i know how hard it is for you to be in the same room with me how could he recall the soft feel of her so the silkiness of her skin after he had torn her clothes off i never thought i was an animal a monster but he was he loathed himself for what he had done and loathed himself worse because he wanted to do it again the only excuse i have is madness cadsuane was right i did hear voices lews therinвђs voice i thought can you вђ no no i have no right to ask you to forgive me but you have to know how sorry i am min he was sorry and his hands ached to run down her bare back over her hips he wasa monster bitterly sorry at least know that she sat there motionless staring at him as if she never before had seen his like now she could stop pretending now she could say what she really thought of him and however vile it was it would not be half vile enough so thatвђs why youвђve been keeping me away she said finally you listen to me you woodenheaded numbskull i was ready to cry myself to dust because iвђd seen one death too many and you you were about to do the same for the same reason what we did my innocent lamb was comfort one another friends comfort one another at times like that close your mouth you two rivers hayhair he did but only to swallow he thought his eyes were going to fall onto the floorstones he nearly spluttered getting words out comforted min if the womenвђs circle back home heard what we did called comforting theyвђd be lining up to peel our hides if we were fifty at least itвђs вђweвђ now instead of вђiвђ she said grimly rising smoothly she advanced toward him shaking a furious finger do you think iвђm a doll farmboy do you think i am too dimwitted to let you know if i didnвђt want your touch do you think i couldnвђt let you know in no uncertain terms her free hand produced a knife from under her coat gave it a flourish and tucked it back without slowing the torrent i remember ripping your shirt off your back because you couldnвђt pull it over your head fast enough to suit me thatвђs how little i wanted your arms around me i did with you what iвђve never done with any man вђ and donвђt you think i was never tempted вђ and you say it was all you as if i wasnвђt even there the back of his legs hit a chair and he realized he had been backing away from her frowning up at him she muttered i donвђt think i like you looking down at me right now abruptly she kicked him hard on the shin planted both hands on his chest and shoved he toppled into the chair so hard it nearly went over backward ringlets swayed as she gave her head a toss and adjusted her brocaded coat thatвђs as may be min but вђ thatвђs as is sheepherder she cut in firmly and if you say different again you had best shout for the maidens and channel for all youвђre worth because iвђll thump you around this room till you squeal for mercy you need a shave and a bath rand took a deep breath perrin had such a serene marriage with a smiling gentle wife why was it that he always seemed drawn to women who spun his head like a top if only he knew the tenth part of what mat did about women he would have known what to say to all that but as it was all he could do was blunder on in any case he said cautiously thereвђs only one thing i can do and what might that be she folded her arms tight beneath her breasts and her foot began tapping ominously but he knew this was the right thing to do send you away just as he had elayne and aviendha if i had any selfcontrol i wouldnвђt have вђ that foot started tapping faster maybe better to leave that alone comforted light min anyone close to me is in danger the forsaken arenвђt the only ones who would harm somebody near me just on the chance it might harm me too and now thereвђs me as well i canвђt control my temper anymore min i nearly killed perrin cadsuane was right iвђm going mad or there already i have to send you away so youвђll be safe who is this cadsuane she said so calmly that he gave a start at noticing that her foot was still tapping alanna mentioned that name as if she was the creatorвђs sister no donвђt tell me i donвђt care not that she gave him one hair of a gap to tell anything i donвђt care about perrin either you would hurt me as soon as him i think that great public fight of yours was a fake is what i think i donвђt care about your temper and i donвђt care whether youвђre mad you canвђt be very mad or youвђd not be worrying about it so what i do care about she bent until those very big very dark eyes were level with his not a great distance away and suddenly there was such a light glaring in them that he seized saidin ready to defend himself send me away to be safe she growled how dare you what right do you think you have to send me anywhere you need me rand alвђthor if i told you half the viewings iвђve had about you half your hair would curl and the rest fall out you dare you let the maidens face any risk they want and you want to send me away like a child i donвђt love the maidens floating deep in the emotionless void he heard those words spring from his tongue and shock shattered the emptiness and sent saidinflying well min said straightening a small smile added more curve to her lips thatвђs out of the way and she sat down on his lap she had said he would not hurt perrin any more than he would her but he had to hurt her now he had to for her own good i love elayne too he said brutally and aviendha you see what i am for some reason that did not seem to faze her at all rhuarc loves more than one woman she said her smile seemed almost of aes sedai serenity so does bael and i never noticed any trollocвђs horns on either no rand you love me and you canвђt back out of that i ought to string you up on tenterhooks for what youвђve put me through but just so youвђll know i love you too the smile faded in a frown of internal struggle and finally she sighed life would be a deal easier sometimes if my aunts hadnвђt brought me up to be fair she muttered and to be fair rand i have to tell you that elayne loves you too so does aviendha if both of mandelainвђs wives can love him i suppose three women can manage to love you but iвђm here and if you try to send me away iвђll tie myself to your leg her nose wrinkled once you start bathing again anyway but i wonвђt go no matter what just exactly like a top his head spun you вђ loveme he said incredulously how do you know what elayne feels how you know anything about aviendha light mandelain can do what he likes min iвђm not aiel he frowned what was that you said about telling me half of what you see i thought you told me everything and i am too sending you somewhere safe and stop doing your nose like that i donвђt smell he jerked the hand he had been scratching with from under his coat her arched eyebrow spoke volumes but of course her tongue had to have its bit too you dare take that tone like you donвђt believe it suddenly her voice began to rise by the word and she augured a finger against his chest as though she meant to drive it through him do you think iвђd go to bedwith a man i did not love do you or maybe you think you arenвђt worth loving is that it she made a sound like a steppedon cat so iвђm some little bit of fluff without a brain in her head falling in love with a worthless lout am i you sit there gaping like a sick ox and slander my wits my taste my вђ if you donвђt quiet down and talk sense he growled i swear iвђll smack your bottom that leaped out of nowhere out of sleepless nights and confusion but before he could begin to form an apology she smiled the woman smiled at least youвђre not sulking anymore she said donвђt ever whine rand you are no good at it now then you want sense i love you and i will not go if you try to send me away iвђll tell the maidens you ruined me and cast me aside iвђll tell everybody who will listen i will вђ he raised his right hand and studied the flat of his palm where the branded heron stood clear then looked at her she eyed his hand warily and shifted herself on his knees then conspicuously ignored everything except his face i wonвђt go rand she said quietly you need me how do you do it he sighed slumping back in the chair even when you stand me on my head you make all my troubles shrink min sniffed you need to be stood on your head more often tell me this aviendha i donвђt suppose there is any chance sheвђs bony and scarred like nandera he laughed in spite of himself light how long since he had laughed with pleasure min iвђd say she is as pretty as you but how can you compare two sunrises for a moment she stared at him with a small smile as if she could not decide whether to be surprised or delighted you are a very dangerous man rand alвђthor she murmured leaning toward him slowly he thought he might fall into her eyes and be lost all those times before when she sat on his lap and kissed him all those times he had thought she was only teasing a country boy he had nearly crawled out of his skin wanting to kiss her forever now if she kissed him again now taking her firmly by the arms he stood and set her on her feet he loved her and she loved him but he had to remember that he wanted to kiss elayne forever when he thought about her and aviendha whatever min said about rhuarc or any aielman she had made a poor bargain the day she fell in love with him you said half min he said quietly what viewings havenвђt you told me she looked up at him with what almost might have been frustration except of course that it could not have been youвђre in love with the dragon reborn min farshaw she grumbled and best you remember it best you did too rand she added pulling away he let her go reluctantly eagerly he did not know which youвђve been back in cairhien half a week and you still have done nothing about the sea folk berelain thought you might drag your feet again she left me a letter asking me to keep reminding you only you wouldnвђt let me вђ well never mind that berelain thinks theyвђre important to you somehow she says youвђre the fulfillment of some prophecy of theirs i know all about that min i вђ he had thought to leave the sea folk out of being tangled with him they were not mentioned in the prophecies of the dragon that he could find but if he was going to let min stay near him let her risk the dangers she had won he realized he had watched elayne walk away with his heart sinking watched aviendha go with his stomach in knots he could not do it again min stood there waiting iвђll go to their ship iвђll go today the sea folk can kneel to the dragon reborn in all his splendor i donвђt suppose there was ever any hope for anything else either theyвђre mine or theyвђre my enemies that is how it always seems to be will you tell me about those viewings now rand you should study what theyвђre like before you вђ the viewings she folded her arms and frowned up at him through her lashes she chewed her lip and frowned at the door she shook her head and muttered under her breath at last she said there is only one really i was exaggerating i saw you and another man i couldnвђt make out either face but i knew one was you you touched and seemed to merge into one another and her mouth tightened worriedly and she went on in a very small voice i donвђt know what it means rand except that one of you dies and one doesnвђt i вђ why are you grinning this isnвђt a joke rand i do not know which of you dies iвђm grinning because youвђve given me very good news he said touching her cheek the other man had to be lews therin iвђm not just insane and hearing voices he thought jubilant one lived and one died but he had known for a long time that he was going to die at least he was not mad or not as far mad as he had feared there was still the temper he could barely control you see i вђ suddenly he realized that he had gone from touching her cheek to cupping her face in both hands he pulled them away as if burned min pursed her lips and gave him a reproving look but he was not going to take advantage of her it would not be fair to her luckily his stomach rumbled loudly i need something to eat if iвђm going to see the sea folk i saw a tray min made a sound more snort than sniff as he turned away but the next moment she was sailing toward the tall doors you need a bath if weвђregoing to the sea folk nandera was delighted nodding enthusiastically and sending maidens running though she did lean close to min and say i should have let you in the first day i wanted to kick him but it is not done kicking the carвђaвђcarn by her tone it should have been done she spoke softly yet not so softly he could not hear he was sure that was deliberate she directed too sharp a glare at him for it not to be maidens lugged in the big copper tub themselves flashing handtalk once they set it down laughing and too excited to let the sun palace servants do the work or bring in the stream of buckets filled with hot water either rand had a hard time taking his own clothes off for that matter he had a hard time washing himself and he could not escape nandera lathering his hair flaxenhaired somara and fieryhaired enaila insisted on shaving him as he sat chestdeep in the tub concentrating so intently they seemed afraid they might cut his throat he was used to that from other times they had refused to let him handle brush and razor himself he was used to the maidens who stood around watching offering to scrub his back or his feet hands flickering in silent chatter and still more than halfscandalized at the sight of someone sittingin water besides he managed to get rid of some at least by sending them off carrying orders what he was not used to was min sitting crosslegged on the bed with her chin on her hands watching the whole thing in very evident fascination in all the crowd of maidens he had not realized she was there until he was naked and all there was to do then was sit down as fast as he could splashing water over the sides of the tub the woman would have done very well as a maiden herself she discussed him with the maidens quite openly with never a blush he was the one who blushed yes he is very modest she said agreeing with malindare a woman more rounded than most maidens with the darkest hair rand had seen on any aiel modesty is a manвђs crowning glory malindare nodded soberly but min wore a grin that nearly split her cheeks and oh no domeille it would be a shame to spoil such a pretty face with a scar domeille grayer than nandera leaner and with a thrusting chin insisted that he was not pretty enough to do without a scar to set off what beauty he had her words the rest was worse the maidens had always seemed to enjoy making his face red min certainly did you have to dry off sooner or later rand she said holding up a long piece of white toweling with both hands she stood a good three paces from the tub and the maidens had all backed into a watching ring minвђs smile was so innocent any magistrate would have found her guilty on that alone come and get dry rand he had never been so relieved to pull on clothes in his life by that time all his orders had been carried out and everything was in readiness rand alвђthor might have been routed in a bathtub but the dragon reborn was going to the sea folk in a style that would send them plummeting to their knees with awe chapter star and birds taвђveren all was ready as rand had ordered in the courtyard at the front of the sun palace or almost all the morning sun slanted shadows from the stepped towers so only ten paces in front of the tall bronze gates lay in full light dashiva and flinn and narishma the three ashaвђman he had retained waited beside their horses even dashiva resplendent with the silver sword and redandgold dragon on his black collar though he still touched the sword at his hip as if constantly surprised to find it there a hundred of dobraineвђs armsmen sat their mounts behind dobraine himself with two long banners that hung down in the still air their dark armor newly lacquered so it glistened in the sun and silk streamers of red and white and black tied below the heads of their lances they raised a cheer when rand appeared his sword belt with its gilded dragon buckle strapped over a red coat heavy with gold alвђthor alвђthor alвђthor filled the courtyard people crowding the archersвђ balconies joined in tairen and cairhienin in their silks and laces who just a week before had no doubt cheered colavaere as loudly men and women who would as soon he had never returned to cairhien some of them waving their arms and giving voice he raised the dragon scepter to acknowledge them and they roared louder a thunderous roll of drums and a blare of trumpets rose through the cheers produced by a dozen more of dobraineвђs men who wore crimson tabards with the blackandwhite disc on the chest half carrying long trumpets draped in identical cloths the other half with kettle drums also decorated slung on either side of the horses five aes sedai in their shawls came to meet him as he descended the broad stairs at least they glided toward him alanna gave him one searching look with those big dark penetrating eyes the tiny knot of emotions in his skull said she was calmer more relaxed than he ever remembered then she made a small motion and min touched his arm and went aside with her bera and the others made small curtsies inclining their heads slightly as aiel streamed out of the palace behind him nandera led two hundred maidens вђ they were not about to be outshone by the oathbreakers вђ and camar a rangy bent peak daryne grayer than nandera and half a head taller than rand led two hundred seia doonwho would not be outshone by far dareis mai let alone cairhienin they swung past on either side of him and the aes sedai to ring the courtyard bera like a proud farmwife and alanna like some darkly beautiful queen in their greenfringed shawls and plump rafela even darker wrapped in her blue watching him anxiously and cooleyed faeldrin yet another green her thin braids worked with colored beads and slim merana in her gray whose frown made rafela seem a picture of aes sedai serenity five where are kiruna and verin he demanded i called for all of you so you did my lord dragon bera answered smoothly she made another curtsy too only the slightest dip but it took him aback we could not find verin she is somewhere in the aiel tents questioning the her smooth tone faltered for one instant the prisoners i believe in an attempt to learn what was planned once they reached tar valon once he reached tar valon she knew enough not to blurt that where anyone could hear and kiruna is consulting with sorilea on a matter of protocol but iвђm quite certain she will be more than happy to join us if you send a personal summons to sorilea i could go myself if you вђ he waved that away five should be enough perhaps verin could learn something did he want to know and kiruna a matter of protocol iвђm glad you are getting on with the wise ones bera started to speak then closed her mouth firmly whatever alanna was saying to min scarlet spots had flared in minвђs cheeks and she had raised her chin though oddly she seemed to be replying calmly enough he wondered whether she would tell him one thing he was sure of about women was that every last one had secret places in her heart sometimes shared with another woman but never with a man the only thing he was sure of about women i didnвђt come out here to stand all day he said irritably the aes sedai had arranged themselves with bera in the lead the others half a step back if it had not been her it would have been kiruna their own arrangements not his he did not really care so long as they held to their oaths and he might have left it alone if not for min and alanna merana will speak for you from now on you will take your orders from her by the suddenly widened eyes you would have thought he had slapped every one of them including merana even alannaвђs head whipped around why should they be startled true bera or kiruna had done almost all the talking since dumaiвђs wells but merana had been the ambassador sent to him at caemlyn if you are ready min he said and without waiting for a reply strode out into the courtyard the big fieryeyed black gelding he had ridden back from dumaiвђs wells had been brought out for him with a highcantled saddle all worked in gold and a crimson saddlecloth embroidered with the disc of blackandwhite at each corner the trappings suited the animal and his name taiвђdaishar in the old tongue lord of glory horse and trappings both suited the dragon reborn as he mounted min led up the mousecolored mare she had ridden back snugging on her riding gloves before swinging into the saddle seieraвђs a fine animal she said patting the mareвђs arched neck i wish she was mine i like her name too we call the flower a blueeye around baerlon and they grow everywhere in the spring sheвђs yours rand said whichever aes sedai the mare belonged to would not refuse to sell to him he would give kiruna a thousand crowns for taiвђdaishar she could not complain then the finest stallion of tairen bloodstock never cost a tenth of that did you have an interesting conversation with alanna nothing that would interest you she said offhandedly but a faint touch of red stained her cheeks he snorted softly then raised his voice lord dobraine iвђve kept the sea folk waiting long enough i think the procession drew crowds along the broad avenues and filled the windows and rooftops as word raced ahead twenty of dobraineвђs lancers led to clear the way along with thirty maidens and as many black eyes then drummers booming away вђ droom droom droom droomdroomвђ and the trumpeters punctuating that with nourishes shouts from the onlookers nearly drowned drums and trumpets alike a wordless roar that could have been rage as easily as approbation the banners streamed out just ahead of dobraine and behind rand the white dragon banner and the scarlet banner of the light and veiled aiel trotted alongside the lancers whose streamers also floated in the air now and then a few flowers were hurled at him maybe they did not hate him maybe they only feared it had to do a train worthy of any king merana said loudly to be heard then itвђs enough for the dragon reborn he replied sharply will you stay back and you too min other rooftops had held assassins the arrow or crossbow bolt meant for him would not find its target in a woman today they did fall behind his big black for all of three paces and then they were right beside him again min telling him what berelain had written about the sea folk on the ships about the jendai prophecy and the coramoor and merana adding what she knew of the prophecy though she admitted that was not very much little more than min watching the rooftops he listened with half an ear he did not hold saidin but he could feel it in dashiva and the other two right behind him he did not feel the tingle that would announce the aes sedai embracing the source but he had told them not to without permission perhaps he should change that they did seem to be keeping their oath how could they not they were aes sedai a fine thing if he took an assassinвђs blade while one of the sisters tried to decide whether serving meant saving him or obeying meant not channeling why are you laughing min wanted to know seiera pranced closer and she smiled up at him this is no laughing matter my lord dragon merana said acidly on the other side the athaвђan miere can be very particular any people grow fastidious when it comes to their prophecies the world is a laughing matter he told her min laughed along with him but merana sniffed and went right back to the sea folk as soon as he stopped at the river the high city walls ran out into the water flanking long gray stone docks that stretched out from the quay riverships and boats and barges of every kind and size were tied everywhere the crews on deck to see the commotion but the vessel rand sought stood ready and waiting lashed endon to the end of a dock where all the laborers had already been cleared off a longboat it was called a low narrow splinter without any masts just one staff in the bow four paces tall topped by a lantern and another at the stern nearly thirty paces in length and lined with as many long oars it could not carry the cargo a sailing vessel the same size would but it had no need of the wind either and with a shallow draft it could travel day and night using rowers in shifts longboats ran the rivers with cargoes of importance and urgency it had seemed appropriate the captain bowed repeatedly as rand came down the boarding ramp with min on his arm and the aes sedai and ashaвђman at his heels elver shaene was even skinnier than his craft in a yellow coat of murandian cut that hung to his knees itвђs an honor to be carrying you my lord dragon he murmured mopping his bald head with a large handkerchief an honor it is an honor indeed an honor plainly the man would rather have had his ship brim full of live vipers he blinked at the aes sedaiвђs shawls and stared at their ageless faces and licked his lips eyes flickering back to rand uneasily the ashaвђman dropped his mouth open once he put their black coats together with rumor and thereafter he avoided so much as a glance in their direction shaene watched dobraine lead the men with the banners aboard and the trumpeters and the drummers lugging their drums then eyed the horsemen lining the dock as if he suspected they might want to board too nandera with twenty maidens and camar with twenty black eyes all with shoufawrapped around their heads though unveiled made the captain step hastily to put the aes sedai between him and them the aiel wore scowls for the heartbeat that needing to veil might slow them but the sea folk might well know what a veil meant and it would hardly do for them to think they were under attack rand thought shaeneвђs handkerchief might yet rub away what thin gray fringe of hair he had left the longboat swept away from the dock on its long oars the two banners rippling in the bows and the drums pounding and the trumpets blaring out in the river people appeared on the decks of ships to watch even climbed into the rigging on the sea folk ship they came out too many in bright colors unlike the drab clothing on crews of the other vessels the white spraywas a larger craft than most of the rest yet somehow sleeker as well with two tall masts raked back sharply and spars laid across them squarely where nearly all the other ships had slanting spars longer than the masts to hold most of their sails everything about it spoke of difference but in one thing rand knew the athaвђan miere had to be like everyone else they could either agree to follow him on their own or be forced to it the prophecies said he would bind together the people of every land вђ the north shall he tie to the east and the west shall be bound to the south it said вђ and no one could be allowed to stand aside he knew that now sending out orders from his bath he had not had an opportunity to give details of what he intended on reaching white spray so he announced them now the details produced grins among the ashaвђman as expected вђ well finn and narishma grinned dashiva blinked absently вђ and frowns among the aiel also as expected they did not like being left behind dobraine merely nodded he knew he was only here for show today what rand did not expect was the aes sedai reaction it shall be as you command my lord dragon merana said making one of those small curtsies the other four exchanged glances but they were curtsying and murmuring as you command right behind her not one protest not one frown not a single haughty stare or recital of why it should be done any way but what he wanted could he begin to trust them or would they find some aes sedai way to wriggle around their oath as soon as his back was turned they will keep their word min murmured abruptly just as if she had read his thoughts with an arm wrapped around his and both hands holding his sleeve she kept her voice for his ears alone i just saw these five in your hand she added in case he did not understand he was not sure he could fix his mind around that even if she had seen it in a viewing he did not have long to try the longboat flew through the water and in no time at all was backing oars some twenty paces from the much taller white spray drums and trumpets fell silent and rand channeled making a bridge of air laced with fire that connected the longboatвђs railing to that of the sea folk ship with min on his arm he started across to every eye but that of an ashaвђman walking upward on nothing he half expected min to falter at least at first but she simply walked at his side as though there were stone beneath her greenheeled boots i trust you she said quietly she smiled too partly a comforting smile and partly he thought because she was amused at reading his mind once more he wondered how much she would trust if she knew that this was as far as he could weave a bridge like this one pace farther one foot and the whole thing would have given way at the first step at that point it became like trying to lift yourself with the power an impossibility even the forsaken did not know why any more than they knew why a woman could make a longer bridge than a man even if she was not as strong it was not a matter of weight any amount of weight could cross any bridge just short of white sprayвђs railing he stopped standing in midair for all meranaвђs descriptions the people staring back at him were a shock dark women and barechested men with colorful sashes that dangled to the knee and gold or silver chains around their necks and rings in their ears in their noses of all places on some of the women who wore a rainbow of blouses above their dark baggy breeches none had any more expression than an aes sedai who was trying hard four of the women despite being barefoot like the rest wore bright silks two of them brocades and they had more necklaces and earrings than anyone else as well with a chain strung with gold medallions running from an earring to a ring in the side of the nose they said nothing only stood together watching him sniffing at small lacy golden boxes that hung from chains around their necks he addressed himself to them i am the dragon reborn i am the coramoor a collective sigh ran through the crew not among the four women though i am harine din togara two winds wavemistress to clan shodein announced the one with the most earrings a handsome fullmouthed woman in red brocade wearing five fat little gold rings in each ear there were white streaks through her straight black hair and fine lines at the corners of her eyes she had an impressive dignity i speak here for the mistress of the ships if it pleases the light the coramoor may come aboard for some reason she gave a start and so did the three with her but that sounded entirely too much like permission rand stepped onto the deck with min wishing he had not waited he let the bridge go and saidin but immediately felt another bridge replace it in short order the ashaвђman and the aes sedai were with him the sisters no more flustered than min had been though perhaps one or two did straighten her skirts a bit more than necessary they were still not so easy around the ashaвђman as they pretended the four sea folk women took one look at the aes sedai and immediately gathered in a close huddle whispering harine did a lot of the talking and so did a young pretty woman in green brocade with eight earrings altogether but the pair in plain silk put in occasional comments merana coughed delicately and spoke softly into the hand she used to cover it i heard her name you the coramoor the athaвђan miere are great bargainers iвђve heard but i think she gave away something then nodding rand glanced down at min she was squinting at the sea folk women but as soon as she noticed his look she shook her head ruefully she saw nothing yet that might help him harine turned so calmly there might never have been any hasty conference this is shalon din togara morning tide windfinder to clan shodein she said with a small bow toward the woman in green brocade and this is derah din selaan rising wave sailmistress of white spray each woman bowed slightly as she was named and touched fingers to her lips derah a handsome woman a little short of her middle years wore plain blue and also eight earrings though her earrings nose ring and the chain that ran between was finer than harineвђs or shalonвђs the welcome of my ship to you derah said and the grace of the light be upon you until you leave his decks she made a small bow toward the fourth woman in yellow this is taval din chanai nine gulls windfinder of white spray only three rings hung from each of tavalвђs ears fine like those of the sailmistress she looked younger than shalon no older than himself harine took it up again gesturing toward the raised stern of the ship we will speak in my cabin if it pleases you a soarer is not a large vessel rand alвђthor and the cabin is small if it pleases you to come alone all here stand surety for your safety so from the coramoor to plain rand alвђthor she would take back what she had given if she could he was about to open his mouth and agree вђ anything to get this done harine was already moving that way still gesturing for him to follow the other women with her вђ when merana gave another tiny cough the windfinders can channel she murmured hastily into her hand you should take two sisters with you or theyвђll feel theyвђve gained the upper hand rand frowned the upper hand he wasthe dragon reborn after all still i will be pleased to come wavemistress but min here goes everywhere with me he patted minвђs hand on his arm вђ she had not let go an instant вђ and harine nodded taval was already holding the door open derah made one of those small bows gesturing him toward it and dashiva of course the man gave a start at his name as if he had been asleep at least he was not staring wideeyed around the deck like flinn and narishma staring at the women stories spoke of the alluring beauty and grace of sea folk women and rand could certainly see that вђ they walked as if they would begin dancing on the next step swaying sinuously вђ but he had not brought the men here to ogle keep your eyes open he told them harshly narishma colored jerking himself stiffly erect and pressed fist to chest flinn simply saluted but both seemed more alert for some reason min looked up at him with the tiniest wry smile harine nodded a little more impatiently a man stepped out from the crew in baggy green silk breeches and with an ivoryhilted sword and dagger thrust behind his sash more whitehaired than she he also wore five fat little rings in each ear she waved him away even more impatiently as it please you rand alвђthor she said and of course rand added as though an afterthought i must have merana and rafela he was not certain why he chose the second name вђ perhaps because the plump tairen sister was the only one not green except merana вђ but to his surprise merana smiled in approval for that matter bera nodded and so did faeldrin and alanna harine did not approve her mouth tightened before she could control it as it pleases you she said not quite so pleasantly as before once he was inside the stern cabin where everything except a few brassbound chests seemed built into the walls rand was not so sure the woman had not gained whatever she wanted just bringing him there for one thing he was forced to stand hunched over even between the roof beams or whatever they were called on a ship he had read several books about ships but none mentioned that the chair he was offered at the foot of the narrow table would not pull out being fastened to the deck and once min showed him how to unlatch the chair arm and swing it out so he could sit his knees hit the bottom of the table there were only eight chairs harine sat at the far end her back to the sternвђs redshuttered windows with her windfinder to her left and the sailmistress to her right and taval below her merana and rafela took the chairs below shalon while min sat to randвђs left dashiva with no chair took a place beside the door standing upright quite easily though the roof beams almost brushed his head too a young woman in a bright blue blouse with one thin earring in each ear brought thick cups of tea brewed black and bitter letвђs be done with this rand said testily as soon as the woman left with her tray he left his cup on the table after one sip he could not stretch out his legs he hated being confined thoughts of being doubled inside the chest flashed in his head and it was all he could do to rein his temper the stone of tear has fallen the aiel have come over the dragonwall all the parts of your jendai prophecy have come to pass i am the coramoor harine smiled across her cup a cool smile with no amusement in it that may be so as it pleases the light but вђ it isso rand snapped despite a warning glance from merana she went so far to nudge his leg with her foot he ignored that too the cabin walls seemed closer somehow what is it that you donвђt believe wavemistress that aes sedai serve me rafela merana he gestured sharply all he wanted was for them to come to him and be seen to come but they set down their cups and rose gracefully glided to either side of him вђ and knelt each took one of his hands in both of hers and pressed her lips to the back of it right on the shining goldenmaned head of the dragon that wound around his forearm he just managed to conceal his shock not taking his eyes from harine her face went a little gray aes sedai serve me and so will the sea folk he motioned the sisters back to their seats oddly they looked a touch surprised that is what the jendai prophecy says the sea folk will serve the coramoor i amthe coramoor yes but there is the matter of the bargain that word was plainly capitalized in harineвђs tone the jendai prophecy says you will bring us to glory and all the seas of the world will be ours as we give to you you must give to us if i do not make the bargain well nesta will hang me naked in the rigging by my ankles and call the first twelve of clan shodein to name a new wavemistress a look of utter horror stole across her face as those words came out of her mouth and her black eyes went wider and wider by the word with disbelief her windfinder goggled at her and derah and taval tried so hard not to their eyes fastened to the table that it seemed their faces might break and suddenly rand understood taвђveren he had seen the effects the sudden moments when the least likely thing happened because he was near but he had never known what was going on before until it was finished easing his legs as best he could he leaned his arms on the table the athaвђan miere will serve me harine that is given yes we will serve you but вђ harine halfreared out her chair spilling her tea what are you doing to me aes sedai she cried trembling this is not fair bargaining we do nothing merana said calmly she actually managed to drink a swallow of that tea without wincing you are in the presence of the dragon reborn rafela added the coramoor your prophecy calls you to serve as i believe she laid a finger to one round cheek you said you speak for the mistress of the ships does that mean your word is binding on the athaвђan miere yes harine whispered hoarsely falling back in her seat what i say binds every ship and all to the mistress of the ships herself it was impossible for one of the sea folk to go white in the face yet staring at rand she came as near as she could he smiled at min to share the moment at last a people would come to him without fighting every step of the way or splitting apart like the aiel maybe min thought he wanted her help to clinch matters or maybe it was taвђveren she leaned toward the wavemistress you will be punished for what happens here today harine but not so much as you fear i think at least one day you will be the mistress of the ships harine frowned at her then glanced to her windfinder she is not aes sedai shalon said and harine seemed caught between relief and disappointment until rafela spoke several years ago i heard reports of a girl with a remarkable ability to see things are you she min min grimaced into her cup then nodded reluctantly she always said that the more people knew what she could do the less good came of it glancing across the table at the aes sedai she sighed rafela only nodded but merana was staring at her hazel eyes avid in a mask of serenity no doubt she expected to corner min as soon as possible and find out what this talent was and how it worked and no doubt min expected it too rand felt a prickle of irritation she should have known he would protect her from being bothered a prickle of irritation and a warmth that he could protect her from that at least you may trust what min says harine rafela said the reports i heard say that what she sees always seems to come true and even if she does not realize it she has seen something else her round face tilted to one side and a smile curved her mouth if you will be punished for what happens here then it must mean you will agree to whatever your coramoor wants unless i agree to nothing harine blustered if i make no bargain her fists clenched on the tabletop she had already admitted she had to make the bargain she had admitted the sea folk would serve what i require of you is not onerous rand said he had thought about this since deciding to come when i want ships to carry men or supplies the sea folk will give them i want to know what is happening in tarabon and arad doman and in the lands between your ships can learn вђ will learn вђ what i want to know they call in tanchico and bandar eban and a hundred fishing villages and towns between your ships can travel farther out to sea than anyone elseвђs the sea folk will keep watch as far west in the aryth ocean as they can sail there is a people the seanchan who live beyond the aryth ocean and one day they will come to try to conquer us the sea folk will let me know when they come you require much harine muttered bitterly we know of these seanchan who come from the islands of the dead it seems from which no ship returns some of our ships have encountered theirs they use the one power as a weapon you require more than you know coramoor for once she did not pause at the title some dark evil has descended upon the aryth ocean no ship of ours has come from there in many months ships that sail west vanish rand felt a chill he turned the dragon scepter made from part of a seanchan spear in his hands could they have returned already they had been driven back once at falme he carried the spearhead to remind him that there were more enemies in the world than those he could see but he had been sure it would take the seanchan years to recover from their defeat driven into the sea by the dragon reborn and the dead heroes called back by the horn of valere was the horn still in the white tower he knew it had been taken there suddenly he could not bear the confines of the cabin any longer he fumbled with the latch on the chair arm it would not open gripping the smooth wood he tore the arm off in splinters with one convulsive heave weвђve agreed the sea folk will serve me he said pushing himself up the low ceiling made him hunch over the table threateningly the cabin did feel smaller if there is any more to your bargain merana and rafela here will see to it with you without waiting for an answer he spun for the door where dashiva appeared to be muttering to himself again merana caught him there caught his sleeve and spoke swiftly and low my lord dragon it would be for the best if you remained you have seen what your being taвђverenhas done already with you here i believe she will continue to reveal what she wants to hide and give agreement before we give anything you are gray ajah he told her harshly negotiate dashiva come with me on deck he drew deep breaths the cloudless sky was open overhead open it took him a moment to notice bera and the other two sisters watching him expectantly flinn and narishma kept to what they were supposed to do a quarter of an eye on the ship and the rest on the riverbanks the city on one side and the halfrebuilt granaries on the other a ship in midriver was a vulnerable place to be if one of the forsaken decided to strike for that matter anywhere was a dangerous place then rand could not understand why one of them had not at least tried to destroy the sun palace around his ears min took his arm and he gave a start iвђm sorry he said i shouldnвђt have left you thatвђs all right she laughed merana is already setting to work i think she means to get you harineвђs best blouse and maybe her second best as well the wavemistress looked like a rabbit caught between two ferrets rand nodded the sea folk were his or as good as what matter whether the horn of valere was in the white tower he was taвђveren he was the dragon reborn and the coramoor the golden sun still burned well short of its noon peak the day is young yet min he could do anything would you like to see me settle the rebels a thousand crowns to a kiss theyвђre mine before sunset chapter dragons fang into the woods sitting crosslegged on randвђs bed min watched him in his shirtsleeves rooting through the coats in the huge ivoryinlaid wardrobe how could he sleep in this room with all its black heavy furniture a part of her thought absently about moving everything out replacing it with some carved pieces she had seen in caemlyn lightly touched with gilding and pale draperies and linens that he would find less oppressive odd she had never cared one way or another about furniture or linens but that one tapestry of a battle of a lone swordsman surrounded by enemies and about to be overwhelmed вђ that definitely had to go mostly though she just watched him there was such an intent look in his morningblue eyes and the snowy shirt tightened across the broad of his back when he turned to reach deep into the wardrobeвђs interior he had very good legs and marvelous calves shown off well in dark closefitting breeches with his boots turned down sometimes he frowned combing fingers through dark reddish hair no amount of brushing could make it ruly it always curled slightly around his ears and on the nape of his neck she was not one of those fool women who tossed their brains at a manвђs feet along with their hearts it was just that sometimes near him thinking clearly became a trifle difficult that was all coat after embroidered silk coat came out and was tossed to the floor atop the one he had worn to the sea folk ship could the negotiations still be going half so well without his taвђverenpresence if only she had a really useful viewing of the sea folk as always to her eyes images and colorful auras flickered around him most gone too quickly to make out all but one meaningless to her at the moment that one viewing came and went a hundred times a day and whenever mat or perrin were present it encompassed them too and sometimes others a vast shadow lurked over him swallowing up thousands upon thousands of tiny lights like fireflies that hurled themselves into it in an attempt to fill up the darkness today there seemed to be countless tens of thousands of fireflies but the shadow seemed larger too somehow that viewing represented his battle with the shadow but he almost never wanted to know how it stood not that she could really say except that the shadow always seemed to be winning to one degree or another she sighed with relief to see the image go a tiny stab of guilt made her shift her seat on the coverlet she had not really lied when he asked what viewings she had kept back not really what good to tell him he would almost certainly fail without a woman who was dead and gone he became bleak too easily as it was she had to keep his spirits up make him remember to laugh except i donвђt think this is a good idea rand saying that might be a mistake men were strange creatures in so many ways one minute they took reasonable advice and the next did just the opposite deliberately did the opposite it seemed for some reason though she felt protective toward this towering man who could probably lift her with either hand and that without his channeling it is a wonderful idea he said tossing down a blue coat with silver embroidery iвђm taвђveren and today it seems to be working in my favor for a change a green coat with gold embroidery went to the floor wouldnвђt you rather comfort me again he stopped dead staring at her with a silverworked red coat hanging forgotten in his hands she hoped she was not blushing comforting where did that idea ever come fromshe wondered silently the aunts who had raised her were gentle kind women but they had strong notions of proper behavior they had disapproved of her wearing breeches disapproved of her working in stables the job she loved best since it brought her into contact with horses there was no question what they would think of comforting with a man she was not married to if they ever found out they would ride all the way from baerlon just to skin her and him too of course i need to keep moving while iвђm sure it is still working he said slowly then turned quite quickly back to the wardrobe this will do he exclaimed pulling out a plain coat of green wool i didnвђt know this was in there it was the coat he had worn coming back from dumaiвђs wells and she could see his hands tremble as he remembered trying to be casual she got up and went to put her arms around him crushing the coat between them as she laid her head against his chest i love you was all she said through his shirt she could feel the round halfhealed scar on his left side she could recall when he got it as if it were yesterday that had been the first time she ever held him in her arms while he lay unconscious and near death his hands pressed against her back squeezing her tight squeezing the breath out of her but then disappointingly they fell away she thought he muttered something about not fair under his breath was he thinking about the sea folk while she hugged him he should be really merana was a gray yet it was said the sea folk could make a domani sweat he should be but she thought about kicking his ankle gently he moved her away and began pulling on the coat rand she said firmly you canвђt be sure it will have any effect just because it did on harine if you being taвђverenalways affected everything youвђd have every ruler kneeling at your feet by now and the whitecloaks too iвђm the dragon reborn he replied haughtily and today i can do anything scooping up his sword belt he fastened it around his waist it bore a plain brass buckle now the gilded dragon lay atop the coverlet on the bed gloves of thin black leather went on to cover the goldenmaned heads on the backs of his hands and the herons branded on his palms but i donвђt look like him do i he spread his arms smiling they wonвђt know until itвђs too late she almost threw up her hands you donвђt look much like a fool either and let him take that how he would the idiot eyed her askance as if he was not sure rand as soon as they see the aiel they will either run or start fighting if you wonвђt take any of the aes sedai at least take those ashaвђman one arrow and youвђre dead whether youвђre the dragon reborn or a goatherd but i amthe dragon reborn min he said seriously and taвђveren we are going alone just you and me that is if you still want to come youвђre not going anywhere without me rand alвђthor she stopped herself from saying he would trip over his own feet if he did this euphoria was almost as bad as the dark bleakness nandera wonвђt like this she did not know exactly what went on between him and the maidens вђ something very peculiar indeed by the things she had seen вђ but any hope that that might stop him guttered out when he grinned like a small boy evading his mother she wonвђt know min he even had a twinkle in his eye i do this all the time and they never know he held out a gloved hand expecting her to jump when he called there really was nothing to do but straighten her green coat glance into the standmirror to make sure of her hair вђ and take his hand the trouble was she wasready to leap if he crooked a finger she just wanted to make sure he never found out in the anteroom he made a gateway atop the golden rising sun set in the floor and she let him lead her through onto a hilly forest floor carpeted with dead leaves a bird flashed away flaring red wings a squirrel appeared on a branch and chittered at them lashing a furry whitetipped tail it was hardly the sort of woods she remembered from near baerlon there were not many real forests anywhere close to the city of cairhien most of the trees stood four or five or even ten paces apart tall leatherleafs and pines taller oaks and trees she did not know running across the flat she and rand stood on and up a slope that began only a few spans off even the undergrowth seemed thinner than back home the bushes and vines and briars spread out in patches though some of those were not small everything was brown and dry she plucked a laceedged handkerchief from her sleeve and dabbed at the sweat that suddenly seemed to pop out on her face which way do we go she asked by the sun north lay over the slope the direction she would choose the city should lie about seven or eight miles in that direction with luck they could walk all the way back without encountering anyone or better given her heeled boots and the terrain not to mention the heat rand could decide to give up and make another gateway back to the sun palace the palace rooms were cool compared to this before he could answer crackling brush and leaves announced someone coming the rider who appeared on a longlegged gray gelding with brightfringed bridle and reins was a cairhienin woman short and slender in a dark blue nearly black silk riding dress horizontal slashes of red and green and white running from her neck to below her knees the sweat on her face could not diminish her pale beauty or make her eyes less than large dark pools a small clear green stone hung on her forehead from a fine golden chain fastened in black hair that fell in waves to her shoulders min gasped and not for the hunting crossbow the woman carried casually raised in one greengloved hand for a moment she was sure it was moiraine but i do not recall seeing either of you in the camp the woman said in a throaty almost sultry voice moiraineвђs voice had been crystal the crossbow lowered still quite casually until it pointed rocksteady at randвђs chest he ignored it i thought i might like to take a look at your camp he said with a slight bow i believe you are the lady caraline damodred the slender woman inclined her head acknowledging the name min sighed regretfully but it was not as if she had really expected moiraine to turn up alive moiraine was the only viewing of hers that had ever failed but caraline damodred herself one of the leaders of the rebellion against rand here in cairhien and a claimant to the sun throne he really was pulling all the threads of the pattern around him to have her appear lady caraline slowly raised the crossbow to one side the cord made a loud snap launching the broadhead bolt into the air i doubt one would do any good against you she said walking her gelding slowly toward them and i would not like you to think i was threatening you she looked once at min вђ just a glance that ran head to toe though min was sure everything about her was filed away вђ but aside from that lady caraline kept her eyes on rand she drew rein three paces away just far enough so he could not reach her afoot before she could dig in her heels i can only think of one grayeyed man with your height who might suddenly appear out of nowhere unless perhaps you are an aiel in disguise but perhaps you will be so kind as to supply a name i am the dragon reborn rand said every bit as arrogant as he had been with the sea folk yet if any taвђverenswirling of the pattern was at work the woman on the horse gave no evidence rather than leaping down to fall to her knees she merely nodded pursing her lips i have heard so very much about you i have heard you went to the tower to submit to the amyrlin seat i have heard you mean to give the sun throne to elayne trakand i have also heard that you killed elayne and her mother i submit to no one rand replied sharply he stared up at her with eyes fierce enough to snatch her out of the saddle by themselves elayne is on her way to caemlyn as we speak to take the throne of andor after which she will have the throne of cairhien as well min winced did he have to sound like a pillow stuffed full of haughty she had hoped he had calmed down a bit after the sea folk lady caraline laid her crossbow across the saddle in front of her running a gloved hand along it perhaps regretting that loosed bolt i could accept my young cousin on the throne вђ better she than some at least вђ but those big dark eyes that had seemed so liquid suddenly became stone but i am not sure i can accept you in cairhien and i do not mean only your changes to laws and customs you change fate by your very presence every day since you came people die in accidents so bizarre no one can believe them so many husbands abandon their wives and wives their husbands that no one even comments upon it now you will tear cairhien apart just by remaining here balance min broke in hastily randвђs face was so dark he looked ready to burst maybe he had been right to come after all certainly there was no point letting him throw this meeting away in a tantrum she gave no one a chance to speak there is always a balance of good against bad thatвђs how the pattern works even he doesnвђt change that as night balances day good balances harm since he came there hasnвђt been a single stillbirth in the city not one child born deformed there are more marriages some days than used to be in a week and for every man who chokes to death on a feather a woman tumbles head over heels down three flights of stairs and instead of breaking her neck stands up without a bruise name the evil and you can point to the good the turning of the wheel requires balance and he only increases the chances of what might have happened anyway in nature suddenly she colored realizing they were both looking at her staring more like balance rand murmured eyebrows lifting iвђve been reading some of master felвђs books she said faintly she did not want anyone to think she was pretending to be a philosopher lady caraline smiled at her tall saddlebow and toyed with her reins the woman was laughingat her she would show this woman what she could laugh at abruptly a tall black gelding with the look of a warhorse came crashing through the undergrowth ridden by a man well into his middle years with closecropped hair and a pointed beard despite his yellow tairen coat the fat sleeves striped with green satin eyes of a startling pretty blue looked out of his damp dark face like pale polished sapphires not a particularly pretty man but those eyes made up for a toolong nose he carried a crossbow in one leathergauntleted hand and brandished a broadhead bolt in the other this came down inches from my face caraline and it has your markings just because thereвђs no game is no reason вђ he became aware of rand and min just then and his drawn crossbow lowered toward them are these strays caraline or did you find spies from the city iвђve never believed alвђthor would continue to let us sit here unhindered half a dozen more riders appeared behind him sweating men in fatsleeved coats with satin stripes and perspiring women in riding dresses with wide thick lace collars all carrying crossbows the last of those riders had not halted horses stamping and tossing heads before twice as many came struggling through the brush from another direction and pulled up near caraline slight pale men and women in dark clothes with stripes of color sometimes to below the waist all with crossbows servants afoot came after laboring and panting with the heat the men who would dress and carry any downed game it hardly seemed to matter that none had more than a skinning knife at his belt min swallowed and unconsciously began patting her cheeks with her handkerchief a little more vigorously if even one person recognized rand before he knew it lady caraline did not hesitate not spies darlin she said turning her horse to face the tairen newcomers the high lord darlin sisnera all that was needed now was lord toram riatin min wished randвђs taвђverentugging at the pattern could be just a little less complete a cousin and his wife caraline went on come from andor to see me may i present tomas trakand вђ from a minor branch of the house вђ and his wife jaisi min almost glared at her the only jaisi she had ever known had been a dusty prune before she was twenty and sour and badtempered to boot darlinвђs gaze swept over rand again lingered a moment on min he lowered his crossbow and bowed his head just a hair a high lord of tear to a minor noble you are welcome lord tomas it takes a brave man to join us in our present circumstances alвђthor may loose the savages on us any day the lady caraline gave him an exasperated look that he made a show of not seeing he noted that randвђs return bow was no more than his however noted and frowned a darkly handsome woman in his retinue muttered angrily under her breath вђ she had a long hard face wellpracticed in anger вђ and a stout fellow scowling and sweating in a redstriped coat of pale green heeled his horse forward a few steps as if thinking to ride rand down the wheel weaves as the wheel wills rand said coolly as though he noticed nothing the dragon reborn to the dragon reborn to just about anybody was what it was arrogance on a mountaintop not much happens as we expect for instance i heard you were in tear in haddon mirk min wished she dared speak up dared say something to soothe him she settled for stroking his arm casually a wife вђ now there was a word that suddenly sounded fine вђ a wife idly patting her husband another fine word light it was hard being fair it was hardly fair having to be fair the high lord darlin is but lately come by longboat with a few of his close friends tomas caralineвђs throaty tone never changed but her gelding suddenly pranced no doubt at a sharp heel and under cover of regaining control she turned her back to darlin and shot rand a brief warning frown do not trouble the high lord tomas i do not mind caraline darlin said slinging his crossbow from his saddle by a loop he rode a little closer and rested an arm on his tall saddlebow a man should know what he is stepping into you may have heard the tales about alвђthor going to the tower tomas i came because aes sedai approached me months ago with suggestions that might happen and your cousin informed me she had received the same we thought we might put her on the sun throne before colavaere could take it well alвђthor is no fool never believe he is myself i think he played the tower like a harp colavaere is hanged he sits secure behind cairhienвђs walls вђ without an aes sedai halter iвђll wager no matter what rumor says вђ and until we find some way to extricate ourselves we sit in his hand waiting for him to make a fist a ship brought you rand said simply a ship could take you away abruptly min realized he was gently patting her hand on his arm trying to soothe her startlingly darlin threw back his head and laughed a great many women would forget his nose for those eyes and that laugh so it would tomas but iвђve asked your cousin to marry me she will not say yes or no but a man cannot abandon even a possible wife to the mercies of the aiel and she will not leave caraline damodred drew herself up on her saddle face cold enough to shame an aes sedai but suddenly auras of red and white flashed around her and darlin and min knew the colors never seemed to matter but she knew that they would marry вђ after caraline had led him a merry chase more to her eyes a crown suddenly appeared on darlinвђs head a simple golden circlet with a slightly curved sword lying on its side above his brows the kingвђs crown he would wear one day though of what country she could not say tear had high lords instead of a king image and auras vanished as darlin pulled his horse around to face caraline thereвђs no game to be found today toram has already returned to camp i suggest we do the same those blue eyes scanned the surrounding trees quickly it seems your cousin and his wife have lost their horses they will wander in a careless moment he added to rand in a kindly tone he knew very well they had no horses but iвђm sure rovair and ines will give up their mounts a walk in the air will do them good the stout man in the redstriped coat swung down from his tall bay immediately with a toadying smile for darlin and one markedly less warm if just as greasy for rand the angryfaced woman was a moment later in climbing stiffly from her silvergray mare she did not look pleased neither was min you mean to go into their camp she whispered as rand led her to the horses are you mad she added before thinking not yet he said softly touching her nose with the tip of one finger thanks to you i know that and he boosted her onto the mare then climbed into the bayвђs saddle and heeled the animal up beside darlin heading north and a little toward the west across the slope they left rovair and ines standing beneath the trees frowning at one another sourly as they fell in behind with the cairhienin the other tairens shouted laughing wishes that the pair would enjoy the walk min would have ridden alongside rand but caraline put a hand on her arm drawing her in back of the two men i want to see what he does caraline said quietly which one min wondered you are his lover caraline asked yes min told her defiantly once she could catch a breath her cheeks felt like fire but the woman only nodded as if it were the most natural thing in the world maybe it was in cairhien sometimes she realized that all the sophistication she had picked up talking to worldly people was about as thick as her blouse rand and darlin rode knee to knee just ahead the younger man half a head taller than the older each wrapped in pride like a cloak but talking just the same listening was not easy they spoke quietly and the dead leaves rustling under the horsesвђ hooves fallen branches cracking often was enough to muffle their words the cry of a hawk overhead or the chattering of a squirrel in a tree drowned them still it was possible to overhear snatches if i may say so tomas darlin said at one point as they headed down after the first rise and under the light i offer no disrespect you are fortunate in having a beautiful wife the light willing i will have one as beautiful myself why do they not speak of something important caraline muttered min turned her head to hide a small smile the lady caraline did not look half as displeased as she sounded she herself had never cared whether anyone thought her pretty or not well until she met rand anyway maybe darlinвђs nose was not all that long i would have let him take callandorfrom the stone darlin said some time later as they climbed a sparsely treed slope but i could not stand aside when he brought aiel invaders into tear iвђve read the prophecies of the dragon rand said leaning forward on the bayвђs neck and urging the animal on a fine glossy appearance the horse had but no more bottom than his owner min suspected the stone had to fall before he could take callandor rand continued other tairen lords follow him so i hear darlin snorted they cringe and lick his boots i could have followed if that was what he wanted if with a sigh he shook his head too many ifs tomas there is a saying in tear вђany quarrel can be forgiven but kings never forgetвђ tear has not been under a king since artur hawkwing but i think the dragon reborn is very like a king no he has attainted me with treason as he calls it and i must go on as i began the light willing i may see tear sovereign on its own land once more before i die it had to be taвђverenwork min knew the man would never have spoken this way to someone casually met caraline damodredвђs supposed cousin or not but what did rand think she could hardly wait to tell him about the crown topping that hill they suddenly came on a knot of spearmen some with a dented breastplate or helmet most without either who bowed as soon they saw the party to left and right through the trees min could see other groups of sentries below the camp lay spread out in what seemed a permanent haze of dust down a nearly treeless slope and across the hillvalley and up the next hill each of the few tents was large with some nobleвђs banner hanging limply on a staff above the peak almost as many horses stood tied to picket lines as there were people and thousands of men and a handful of women wandered among the cookfires and wagons none raised a cheer as their leaders rode in min studied them over the handkerchief she pressed to her nose against the dust not caring whether caraline saw what she was doing dispirited faces watched them pass and grim faces people who knew they were in a trap here and there a houseвђs constood stiffly above some manвђs head yet most seemed to be wearing whatever they could find bits and pieces of armor that often neither matched nor fitted very well a good many though men too tall for cairhien wore red coats under their battered breastplates min eyed a nearly obscured white lion worked on a filthy red sleeve darlin could only have brought a few people with him on a longboat perhaps no more than his hunting party caraline looked to neither side as they rode through the camp but whenever they came near those men in red coats her mouth tightened darlin dismounted before a tremendous tent the largest min had ever seen larger than any she had ever imagined a great redstriped oval shining in the sunlight like silk with no fewer than four high conical peaks each with the rising sun of cairhien stirring above in a lazy breeze gold on blue the strumming of harps drifted out amid the murmur of voices like the sounds of geese as servants took away the horses darlin offered his arm to caraline after a very long pause she laid her fingers lightly on his wrist with no expression whatsoever letting him escort her inside my lady wife rand murmured with a smile extending his arm min sniffed and put her hand atop his she would rather have hit him he had no right to make a joke of that he had no right to bring her here taвђverenor no taвђveren he could be killed here burn him but did he care if she spent the rest of her life weeping she touched one of the striped doorflaps as they went in and shook her head in wonder it wassilk a silktent no sooner were they inside than she felt rand stiffen darlinвђs shrunken retinue and caralineвђs jostled around them with insincere murmurs of apology between the four main tentpoles long trestle tables groaning with food and drink stood about the colorful carpets that had been laid for a floor and there were people everywhere cairhienin nobles in their finery a few soldiers with the fronts of their heads shaved and powdered plainly men of high rank by the fine cut of their coats a handful of bards strolled playing through the crowd picked out as much by a loftier air than any noble as by the carved and gilded harps they carried yet minвђs eyes flew as if pulled to the sure source of randвђs worry three aes sedai talking together in shawls fringed green and brown and gray images and colors flashed around them but not a thing she could make sense of a swirl in the crowd revealed another a comfortably roundfaced woman more images more flaring colors but all min needed was the redfringed shawl looped over her plump arms rand tucked her hand under his arm and patted it donвђt worry he said softly everything is going well she would have asked him what they were doing there but she was afraid he would tell her darlin and caraline had vanished into the crowd along with their followers yet as a bowing serving man with stripes of red green and white on his dark cuffs offered a tray of silver goblets to rand and min she reappeared shaking off the importunings of a hatchetfaced fellow in one of those red coats he glared at her back as she took a goblet of punch and waved the servant away and minвђs breath caught at the aura that suddenly flashed around him bruised hues so dark they seemed nearly black donвђt trust that man lady caraline she could not stop herself he will murder anyone he thinks is in his way heвђll kill for a whim kill anybody she clamped her teeth shut before saying more caraline glanced over her shoulder as the hatchetfaced man turned away abruptly i could believe it easily of daved hanlon she said wryly his white lions fight for gold not cairhien and loot worse than the aiel andor became too hot for them it seems that with an arch glance at rand toram has promised him a great deal of gold i think and estates i know she tilted her eyes up to min do you know the man jaisi min could only shake her head how to explain what she did know about hanlon now that his hands would be red with more rapes and murders before he died if she had known when or who but all she knew was that he would anyway telling about a viewing never changed it what she saw happened no matter who she warned sometimes before she had learned better it had happened because she warned iвђve heard of the white lions rand said coldly look among them for darkfriends and you wonвђt be disappointed they had been some of gaebrilвђs soldiers min knew that much and little more except that lord gaebril had really been rahvin it stood to reason that soldiers serving one of the forsaken would include darkfriends what of him rand nodded toward a man across the tent whose long dark coat had as many stripes as caralineвђs dress very tall for a cairhienin perhaps less than a full head shorter than rand he was slender except for broad shoulders and strikingly goodlooking with a strong chin and just a touch of gray at his dark temples for some reason minвђs eyes were drawn to his companion a skinny little fellow with a large nose and wide ears in a red silk coat that did not fit him very well he kept fingering a curved dagger at his belt a fancy piece with a golden sheath and a large red stone capping the hilt that seemed to catch the light darkly she saw no auras around him he seemed vaguely familiar they were both looking at her and rand that caraline breathed in a tight voice is lord toram riatin himself and his constant companion these past days master jeraal mordeth odious little man his eyes make me want to take a bath they both make me feel unclean she blinked surprised at what she had said but recovered quickly min had the feeling little put caraline damodred off her stride for long in that she was very like moiraine i would be careful were i you cousin tomas she went on you may have wrought some miracle or taвђverenwork on me вђ and perhaps even on darlin вђ though i cannot say what it might come to вђ i make no promises вђ but toram hates you with a passion it was not so bad before mordeth joined him yet since toram would have us attack the city immediately in the night with you dead he says the aiel would go but i think it is you dead he seeks now even more than he does the throne mordeth rand said his eyes were locked to toram riatin and the skinny fellow his name is padan fain and there are one hundred thousand golden crowns on his head caraline nearly dropped her goblet queens have been ransomed for less what did he do he ravaged my home because it was my home randвђs face was frozen his voice ice he brought trollocs to kill my friends because they were my friends he is a darkfriend and a dead man those last words came through clenched teeth punch splashed to the carpet as the silver goblet bent in his gloved fist min felt sick for him for his pain вђ she had heard what fain had done in the two rivers вђ but she put a hand on randвђs chest in near panic if he gave way now channeled with who knew how many aes sedai around for the lightвђs sake take hold of yourself she began and a womanвђs voice spoke pleasantly behind her will you present me to your tall young friend caraline min looked over her shoulder right into an ageless face cooleyed beneath irongray hair pulled up into a bun from which dangled small golden ornaments swallowing a squeak min coughed she had thought caraline had taken her in in one glance but these cool eyes seemed to know things about her she herself had forgotten the aes sedaiвђs smile as she adjusted her greenfringed shawl was not nearly so pleasant as her voice of course cadsuane sedai caraline sounded shaken but she smoothed her tone well before she finished introducing her visiting cousin and his wife but i fear cairhien is no place for them at present she said all selfpossession once more smiling regret that she could not keep rand and min longer they have agreed to take my advice and return to andor have they cadsuane said dryly minвђs heart sank even if rand had not spoken of her it was clear from the way she looked at him that she knew him tiny golden birds and moons and stars swayed as she shook her head most boys learn not to stick their fingers into the pretty fire the first time they are burned tomas others need to be spanked to learn better a tender bottom than a seared hand you know iвђm no child rand told her sharply do i she eyed him from head to toe and made it seem no very great distance well it seems i shall soon see whether or not you need spanking those cool eyes drifted to min to caraline and with a final hitch to her shawl cadsuane herself drifted away into the crowd min swallowed the lump in her throat and was pleased to see caraline do the same selfpossession or no rand вђ the blind fool вђ stared after the aes sedai as though intending to go after her this time it was caraline who laid a hand on randвђs chest i take it you know cadsuane she said breathily be careful of her even the other sisters stand in awe of her her throaty tones took on a note of gravity i have no idea what will come of today but whatever it is i think it is time you were gone вђcousin tomasвђ past time i will have horses вђ this is your cousin caraline said a deep rich manвђs voice and min jumped in spite of herself toram riatin was even betterlooking close up than at a distance with the sort of strong male beauty and air of worldly knowledge that would have attracted min before she met rand well she still found them attractive just not as much as she did rand his firmlipped smile was quite appealing toramвђs gaze fell to caralineвђs hand still on randвђs chest the lady caraline is to be my wife he said lazily did you know that caralineвђs cheeks reddened angrily do not say that toram i have told you i will not and i will not toram smiled at rand i think women never know their minds until you show them what do you think jeraal jeraal he looked around scowling min stared at him in amazement and he was so pretty with just the right air of she wished she could call up viewings at will she very much wanted to know what the future held for this man i saw your friend scurry off that way toram mouth twisted with distaste caraline gave a vague wave of her hand you will find him near the drink i think or else bothering the serving girls later my precious he tried to touch her cheek and looked amused when she stepped back without a pause he transferred his amusement to rand and the sword at his side would you care for a little sport cousin i call you that because we will be cousins once caraline is my wife with practice swords of course certainly not caraline laughed he is a boy toram and scarce knows one end of that thing from the other his mother would never forgive me if i allowed вђ sport rand said abruptly i might as well see where this leads i agree chapter rubyhilted dagger blades min did not know whether to groan or shout or sit down and cry caraline staring wideeyed at rand seemed in the same quandary with a laugh toram began rubbing his hands together listen everyone he shouted you are going to see some sport clear a space clear a space he strode off waving people away from the center of the tent sheepherder min growled youвђre not woolbrained you donвђt have anybrains i would not put it quite so caraline said in a very dry voice but i suggest you leave now whatever tricks you think you might use there are seven aes sedai in this tent four of them red ajah lately arrived from the south on their way to tar valon should one of them so much as suspect i very much fear that whatever might have come of today never will leave i wonвђt use any tricks rand unbuckled his sword belt and handed it to min if iвђve touched you and darlin in one way maybe i can touch toram in another the crowd was pushing back opening up an area twenty paces across between two of the great centerpoles some looked to rand and there was a great deal of rib nudging and sly laughter the aes sedai were offered pride of place of course cadsuane and her two friends on one side four ageless women in red ajah shawls on the other cadsuane and her companions were eyeing rand with open disapproval and as close to irritation as any aes sedai ever let show but the red sisters looked more concerned with those three at least although they stood directly opposite they managed to seem oblivious of the presence of any other sisters no one could be that blind without trying listen to me cousin caralineвђs low voice almost crackled with urgency she stood very close her neck craned to look up at him barely reaching his chest she seemed ready to box his ears if you use none of your specialtricks caraline went on he can hurt you badly even with practice swords and he will he has never liked another touching what he thinks is his and he suspects every pretty young man who speaks to me of being my lover when we were children he pushed a friend вђ a friend вђ down the stairs and broke his back because derowin rode his pony without asking go cousin no one will think less no one expects a boy to face a blademaster jaisi whatever your real name is help me convince him min opened her mouth вђ and rand laid a finger across her lips i am who i am he smiled and i donвђt think i could run from him if i wasnвђt so heвђs a blademaster unbuttoning his coat he strode out into the cleared area why must they be so stubborn when you least wish it caraline whispered in tones of frustration min could only nod in agreement toram had stripped to shirt and breeches and carried two practice swords their blades bundles of thin lathes tied together he raised an eyebrow at the sight of rand with his coat simply hanging open you will be confined in that cousin rand shrugged without warning toram tossed one of the swords rand caught it out of the air by the long hilt those gloves will slip cousin you want a firm grip rand took the hilt in both hands and turned slightly sideways blade down and left foot forward toram spread his hands as if to say he had done all he could well at least he knows how to stand he laughed and on the last word darted forward practice sword streaking for randвђs head with all his might behind it with a loud clack bundled lathes met bundled lathes rand had moved nothing except his sword for a moment toram stared at him and rand looked back calmly then they began to dance that was all min could call it that gliding flowing movement wooden blades flickering and spinning she had watched rand practice the sword against the best he could find often against two or three or four at once but that had been nothing to this so beautiful and so easy to forget that had those lathes been steel blood could have flowed except that no blade steel or lathes touched flesh back and forth they danced circling one another swords now probing now slashing rand attacking now defending and every movement punctuated by those loud clacks caraline gripped minвђs arm hard without taking her eyes from the contest he is also a blademaster she breathed he must be look at him min was looking and hugging randвђs sword belt and scabbarded blade as if they were him back and forth in beauty and whatever rand thought toram clearly wished his blade was steel cold rage burned on his face and he pressed harder harder still no blade touched anything but another yet now rand backed away constantly sword darting to defend and toram moved forward attacking eyes glittering with icy fury outside someone screamed a wail of utter horror and suddenly the huge tent snapped up into the air vanishing into a thick grayness that hid the sky fog billowed on every side filled with distant shrieks and bellows thin tendrils wafted into the clear inverted bowl left by the tent everyone stared in amazement almost everyone toramвђs lathe blade smashed into randвђs side with a bonecrack sound doubling him over you are dead cousin toram sneered lifting his sword high to strike again вђ and froze staring as part of the heavy gray mist overhead solidified a tentacle of fog it might have been a thick threetoed arm reaching down closed around the stout red sister snatching her into the air before anyone had a chance to move cadsuane was the first to overcome shock her arms rose shaking back her shawl her hands made a twist and a ball of fire seemed to shoot upward from each palm streaking into the mist above something suddenly burst into flame one violent gout that vanished immediately and the red sister fell back into sight dropping with a thud facedown on the carpets near where rand knelt on one knee clutching his side at least she would have been facedown had her head not been twisted around so her dead eyes stared up into the fog whatever scraps of composure remained in the tent fled with that the shadow had been given flesh screaming people fled in every direction knocking over tables nobles clawing past servants and servants past nobles buffeted min fought her way to rand with fists and elbows and his sword as a club are you all right she asked pulling him to his feet she was surprised to see caraline on the other side helping him too for that matter caraline looked surprised he took his hand from beneath his coat fingers thankfully free of blood that halfhealed scar so tender had not broken open i think we best move he said taking his sword belt we have to get out of this the inverted bowl of clear air was noticeably smaller almost everyone else had fled out in the fog screams rose most cutting off abruptly but always replaced by new i agree tomas darlin said sword in hand he planted himself with his back to caraline between her and the fog the question is in which direction and also how far do we have to go this is his work toram spat alвђthorвђs hurling down his practice sword he stalked to his discarded coat and calmly donned it whatever else he was he was no coward jeraal he shouted at the fog as he fastened his sword belt jeraal the light burn you man where are you jeraal mordeth вђ fain вђ did not answer and he went on shouting the only others still there were cadsuane and her two companions faces calm but hands running nervously over their shawls cadsuane herself might have been setting out for a stroll i should think north she said the slope lies closer that way and climbing may take us above this stop that caterwauling toram either your manвђs dead or he canвђt hear toram glared at her but he did stop shouting cadsuane did not appear to notice or care so long as he was silent north then we three will take care of anything your steel canвђt handle she looked straight at rand when she said that and he gave a whisker of a nod before buckling his sword belt and drawing his blade trying not to goggle min exchanged glances with caraline the other womanвђs eyes looked as large as teacups the aes sedai knew who he was and she was going to keep anyone else from knowing i wish we had not left our warders back in the city the slim yellow sister said tiny silver bells in her dark hair chimed as she tossed her head she had almost as commanding an air as cadsuane enough that you did not realize how pretty she was at first except that that toss of her head seemed well a touch petulant i wish i had roshan here a circle cadsuane the gray asked head turning this way and that to peer at the fog she looked like a plump palehaired sparrow with her sharp nose and inquisitive eyes not a frightened sparrow but one definitely ready to take wing should we link no niande cadsuane sighed if you see something you must be able to strike at it without waiting to point it out for me samitsu stop worrying about roshan we have three fine swords here two of them heronmark i see they will do toram showed his teeth on seeing the heron engraved on the blade rand had unsheathed if it was a smile it held no mirth his own bared blade bore a heron too darlinвђs did not but he gave rand and his sword a weighing look then a respectful nod that was considerably deeper than he had offered plain tomas trakand of a minor branch of the house the grayhaired green had taken charge clearly and she kept it despite attempted protests from darlin who like many tairens seemed not to relish aes sedai a great deal and toram who just seemed to dislike anyone giving orders but himself for that matter so did caraline but cadsuane ignored her frowns as completely as she did the menвђs voiced complaints unlike them caraline appeared to realize complaints would do no good wonder of wonders rand meekly let himself be placed to cadsuaneвђs right as she quickly arranged everyone well not exactly meekly вђ he stared down his nose at her in a way that would have made min slap him if he did it to her cadsuane just shook her head and muttered something that reddened his face вђ but at least he kept his mouth shut right then min almost thought he would announce who he was and maybe expect the fog to vanish in fear of the dragon reborn he smiled at her as though fog in this weather was nothing even a fog that snatched tents and people they moved into the thick mist in a formation like a sixpointed star cadsuane herself in the lead an aes sedai at each of two other points a man with a sword at three toram of course protested loudly at bringing up the rear until cadsuane mentioned the honor of the rear guard or some such that quieted him down min had no objection whatsoever to her own position with caraline in the center of the star she carried a knife in either hand and wondered whether they would be any use it was something of a relief to see the dagger in caralineвђs fist tremble at least her own hands were steady then again she thought she might be too frightened to shake the fog was cold as winter grayness closed around them in swirls so heavy it was difficult to see the others clearly hearing was all too easy though shrieks drifted through the murk men and women crying out horses screaming the fog seemed to deaden sound make it hollow so that thankfully those awful sounds seemed distant the mist ahead began to thicken but fireballs immediately shot from cadsuaneвђs hands sizzling through the icy gray and the thickening erupted in one roaring flare of flame roars behind light flashing against the fog like lightning against clouds spoke of the other two sisters at work min had no desire to look back what she could see was more than enough past trampled tents half obscured by gray haze they moved past bodies and sometimes parts of bodies not nearly obscured enough a leg an arm a man who was not there from the waist down once a womanвђs head that seemed to grin from where it sat on the corner of an overturned wagon the land began to slope upward steeper min saw her first living soul besides them and wished she had not a man wearing one of the red coats staggered toward them waving his left arm feebly the other was gone and wet white bone showed where half his face had been something that might have been words bubbled though his teeth and he collapsed samitsu knelt briefly beside him putting her fingers against the bloody ruin of his forehead rising she shook her head and they moved on upslope and up until min began wondering whether they were climbing a mountain instead of a hill right in front of darlin the fog suddenly began to take on form a manhigh shape but all tentacles and gaping mouths full of sharp teeth the high lord might have been no blademaster but he was not slow either his blade sliced through the middle of the stillcoalescing shape looped and slashed it top to bottom four clouds of fog thicker than the surrounding mist settled to the ground well he said at least we know steel can cut these creatures the thicker chunks of fog oozed together began to rise once more cadsuane stretched out a hand droplets of fire falling from her fingertips one bright flash of flame seared the solidifying fog from existence but no more than cut so it seems she murmured ahead to their right a woman suddenly appeared in the swirling gray silk skirts held high as she half ran half fell down the slope toward them thank the light she screamed thank the light i thought i was alone right behind her the fog drew together a nightmare all teeth and claws looming above her had it been a man min was sure rand would have waited his hand rose before cadsuane could move and a bar of something liquid white fire brighter than the sun shot out over the running womanвђs head the creature simply vanished for a moment there was clear air where it had been and along the line that the bar had burned until the fog began closing in a moment while the woman froze where she stood then shrieking at the top of her lungs she turned and ran from them still downslope fleeing what she feared more than nightmares in these mists you toram roared so loudly that min spun to face him with her knives raised he stood pointing his sword at rand you are him i was right this is your work you will not trap me alвђthor suddenly he broke away at an angle scrambling wildly up the slope you will not trap me come back darlin shouted after him we must stick together we must he trailed off staring at rand you are him the light burn me you are he halfmoved as if to place himself between rand and caraline but at least he did not run calmly cadsuane picked her way across the slope to rand and slapped his face so hard his head jerked minвђs breath caught in shock you will not do that again cadsuane said there was no heat in her voice just iron do you hear me not balefire not ever surprisingly rand only rubbed his cheek you were wrong cadsuane heвђs real iвђm certain of it i know he is even more surprisingly he sounded as if he very much wanted her to believe minвђs heart went out to him he had mentioned hearing voices he must mean that she raised her right hand toward him forgetting for the moment that it held a knife and opened her mouth to say something comforting though she was not entirely sure she would ever be able to use that particular word innocuously again she opened her mouth вђ and padan fain seemed to leap out of the mists behind rand steel gleaming in his fist behind you min screamed pointing with the knife in her outstretched right hand as she threw the one in her left everything seemed to happen at once halfseen in wintery fog rand began to turn twisting aside and fain also twisted to lunge for him for that twist her knife missed but fainвђs dagger scored along randвђs left side it hardly seemed to more than slice his coat yet he screamed he screamed a sound to make minвђs heart clench and clutching his side he fell against cadsuane catching at her to hold himself up pulling both of them down move out of my way one of the other sisters shouted вђ samitsu min thought вђ and suddenly minвђs feet jerked out from under her she landed heavily grunting as she hit the slope together with caraline who snapped a breathless blood and fire everything at once move samitsu shouted again as darlin lunged for fain with his sword the bony man moved with shocking speed throwing himself down and rolling beyond darlinвђs reach strangely he cackled with laughter as he scampered to his feet and ran off swallowed in the murk almost immediately min pushed herself up shaking caraline was much more vigorous i will tell you now aes sedai she said in a cold voice brushing at her skirts violently i will not be treated so i am caraline damodred high seat of house min stopped listening cadsuane was sitting on the slope above holding randвђs head in her lap it had only been a cut painвђs dagger could not have more than touched with a cry min threw herself forward aes sedai or no she pushed the woman away from rand and cradled his head in her arms his eyes were closed his breathing ragged his face felt hot help him she screamed at cadsuane like an echo of the distant screams in the mist help him a part of her said that did not make much sense after pushing her away but his face seemed to burn her hands to burn sense samitsu quickly cadsuane said standing and rearranging her shawl heвђs beyond my talent for healing she laid a hand on the top of minвђs head girl i will hardly let the boy die when i havenвђt taught him manners yet stop crying now it was very strange min was fairly sure the woman had done nothing to her with the power yet she believed teach him manners a fine tussle that would be unfolding her arms from around his head not without reluctance min backed away on her knees very strange she had not even realized that she wascrying yet cadsuaneвђs reassurance was enough to stop the flow of tears sniffing she scrubbed at her cheeks with the heel of her hand as samitsu knelt beside him placing fingertips on his forehead min wondered why she did not take his head in both hands the way moiraine did abruptly rand convulsed gasping and thrashing so hard that a flailing arm knocked the yellow over on her back as soon as her fingers left him he subsided min crawled nearer he breathed more easily but his eyes were still closed she touched his cheek cooler than it had been but still too warm and pale something is amiss samitsu said peevishly as she sat up pulling randвђs coat aside she gripped the slice in his bloodstained shirt and ripped a wide gap in the linen the cut from fainвђs dagger no longer than her hand and not deep ran right across the old round scar even in the dim light min could see that the edges of the gash looked swollen and angry as if the wound had gone untended for days it was no longer bleeding but it should have been gone that was what healing did wounds knitted themselves up right before your eyes this samitsu said in a lecturing tone lightly touching the scar seems like a cyst but full of evil instead of pus and this she drew the finger down the gash seems full of a different evil suddenly she frowned at the green standing over her and her voice became sullen and defensive if i had the words cadsuane i would use them i have never seen the like never but i will tell you this i think if i had been one moment slower perhaps if you had not tried first he would be dead now as it is with a sigh the yellow sister seemed to deflate her face sagging as it is i believe he will die min shook her head trying to say no but she could not seem to make her tongue move she heard caraline murmuring a prayer the woman stood gripping one of darlinвђs coatsleeves with both hands darlin himself frowned down at rand as though trying to make sense of what he saw cadsuane bent to pat samitsuвђs shoulder you are the best living perhaps the best ever she said quietly no one has the healing to compare with you with a nod samitsu stood and before she was on her feet she was all aes sedai serenity once more cadsuane scowling down at rand with her hands on her hips was not phaw i will not allow you to die on me boy she growled sounding as though it were his fault this time instead of touching the top of minвђs head she rapped it with a knuckle get to your feet girl youвђre no milksop вђ any fool can see that вђ so stop pretending darlin you will carry him bandages must wait this fog is not leaving us so we had better leave it darlin hesitated maybe it was cadsuaneвђs peremptory frown and maybe the hand caraline halfraised to his face but abruptly he sheathed his sword muttering under his breath and hoisted rand across his shoulders with arms and legs dangling min took up the heronmark blade and carefully slid it into the scabbard hanging from randвђs waist he will need it she told darlin and after a moment he nodded a lucky thing for him he did she had bundled all her confidence into the green sister and she was not about to let anyone think differently now be careful darlin caraline said in that throaty voice once cadsuane made their marching order clear be sure to stay behind me and i will protect you darlin laughed till he wheezed and was still chuckling when they began climbing through the cold fog and the distant shrieks once more with him carrying rand in the center and the women in a circle around him min knew she was only another pair of eyes just like caraline on the other side of cadsuane and she knew the knife she carried unsheathed was no use against the mistshapes but padan fain might still be alive out there she would not miss again caraline carried her dagger too and by the looks she cast over her shoulder at darlin staggering uphill under randвђs weight maybe she also intended to protect the dragon reborn and then again maybe it was not him a woman could forgive any amount of nose for that laugh shapes still formed in the mist and died by fire and once a huge something tore a shrieking horse in two off to their right before any aes sedai could slay it min was quite noisily sick after that and not a bit ashamed people were dying but at least the people had come here by their own choice the meanest soldier could have run away yesterday had he chosen but not that horse shapes formed and died and people died screaming always in the distance it seemed though they still stumbled past torn carrion that had been human an hour gone min began to wonder whether they would ever see daylight again with shocking suddenness and no warning she stumbled into it one moment surrounded by gray the next with the sun burning golden high overhead in a blue sky all so bright she had to shade her eyes and there perhaps five miles across all but treeless hills cairhien rose solid and square on its own prominences somehow it did not look quite real anymore staring back at the edge of the fog she shivered it was an edge a billowing wall stretching though the trees on this hilltop and far too straight with no eddies or thinning just clear air here and there thick gray a little more of a tree right in front of her became visible and she realized the mist was creeping back perhaps being burned off by the sun but far too slowly to make the retreat natural the others stared at it just as hard as she even the aes sedai twenty paces off to their left a man suddenly scrambled into the clear air on all fours the front of his head was shaved and by the battered black breastplate he wore he was a common soldier staring about wildly he did not appear to see them and went scrambling on down the hillside still on hands and knees farther to the right two men and a woman appeared all running she had stripes of color across the front of her dress but how many was hard to say since she had gathered her skirts as high as she could to run faster and she matched the men stride for stride none of them looked to either side only launched themselves down the hill falling tumbling and coming back to their feet running again caraline studied the slim blade of her dagger for a moment then thrust it hard into it sheath so vanishes my army she sighed darlin with rand still unconscious across his shoulders looked at her there is an army in tear if you call she glanced at rand hanging like a sack perhaps she said darlin turned his head toward randвђs face with a troubled frown cadsuane was all practicality the road lies that way she said pointing west it will be faster than walking crosscountry an easy stroll easy was not what min would have called it the air seemed twice as hot after the fogвђs cold sweat rolled out of her and seemed to drain her strength her legs wobbled she tripped over exposed roots and fell flat on her face she tripped over rocks and fell she tripped over her own heeled boots and fell once her feet just went out from under and she slid a good forty paces down the hillside on the seat of her breeches arms flailing until she managed to snag a sapling caraline went sprawling as many times and maybe more dresses were not made for this sort of travel and before long вђ after a tumble head over heels ended with her skirts around her ears вђ she was asking min the name of the seamstress who made her coat and breeches darlin did not fall oh he stumbled and tripped and skidded every bit as much as they but whenever he started to fall something seemed to catch him to steady him on his feet in the beginning he glared at the aes sedai all proud tairen high lord who would carry rand out without any help cadsuane and the others affected not to see they never fell they simply walked along chatting quietly among themselves and caught darlin before he could by the time they reached the road he looked both grateful and hunted standing in the middle of the broad road of hardpacked earth in sight of the river cadsuane flung up a hand to stop the first conveyance that appeared a rickety wagon drawn by two motheaten mules and driven by a skinny farmer in a patched coat who hauled on his reins with alacrity what did the toothless fellow think he had run into three ageless aes sedai complete with shawls who might have stepped down from a coach a moment before a sweatsoaked cairhienin woman of high rank by the stripes on her dress or maybe a beggar who had clothed herself from a noblewomanвђs rag closet by the state of that dress an obvious tairen nobleman with sweat dripping from his nose and pointed beard and carrying another man across his shoulders like a sack of grain and herself both knees out of her breeches and another tear in the seat that her coat covered thank the light though one sleeve hung by a few threads more stains and dust than she wanted to think about not waiting for anyone else she drew a knife from her sleeve вђ popping most of those few threads вђ and gave it a flourish the way thom merrilin had taught her hilt snaking through her fingers so the blade flashed in the sun we require a ride to the sun palace she announced and rand himself could not have done better there were times when being peremptory saved argument child cadsuane said chidingly iвђm sure kiruna and her friends would do everything they could but there isnвђt a yellow among them samitsu and corele really are two of the best ever lady arilyn has very kindly lent us her palace in the city so we will take him вђ no min had no idea where she found the courage to say that word to this woman except it was rand they were talking about if he wakes she stopped to swallow he wouldwake if he wakes in a strange place surrounded by strange aes sedai again i canвђt imagine what he might do you donвђt want to imagine it for a long moment she met that cool gaze and then the aes sedai nodded the sun palace cadsuane told the farmer and as fast as you make these fleabags move of course it was not quite so simple even for aes sedai ander tol had a wagonload of scraggly turnips he intended to sell in the city and no intention of going anywhere near the sun palace where he told them the dragon reborn ate people who were cooked on spits by aiel women ten feet tall not for any number of aes sedai would he venture within a mile of the palace on the other hand cadsuane tossed him a purse that made his eyes pop when he looked inside then told him she had just bought his turnips and hired him and his wagon if he did not like the notion he could give the purse back that with her fists on her hips and a look of her face that said he might just eat his wagon on the spot if he tried giving the purse back ander tol was a reasonable man it turned out samitsu and niande unloaded the wagon turnips simply flying into the air to land in a tidy pile by the roadside by their icy expressions this was in no way a use to which they had ever expected to put the one power by darlinвђs expression standing there with rand still on his shoulders he was relieved they had not called on him to do it ander tol sat the wagon seat with his jaw trying to reach his knees fingering the purse as though wondering whether it was enough after all once they were settled in the wagon bed with the straw that had been beneath the turnips all gathered to make a bed for rand cadsuane faced min across him master tol was flapping his reins and finding a surprising turn of speed in those mules the wagon lurched and jounced horribly the wheels not only shaking but apparently out of round wishing she had kept just a little of the straw for herself min was amused to see samitsu and niande growing tighter in the face as they were bounced up and down caraline smiled at them quite openly the high seat of house damodred not bothering to hide her pleasure that the aes sedai were for once riding rough though in truth slight as she was she bounced higher and came down with harder thumps than they darlin holding on to the side of the wagon appeared unaffected however hard he was shaken he kept frowning and looking from caraline to rand cadsuane was another who apparently did not care whether her teeth rattled i expect to be there before nightfall master tol she called producing more flapping if no more speed now tell me she said turning to min exactly what happened the lasttime this boy woke surrounded by strange aes sedai her eyes caught minвђs and held them he wanted it kept secret if it could be for as long as it could be but he was dying and the only chance he had that min saw rested in these three women maybe knowing could not help maybe knowing could at least make them understand something of him they put him in a box she began she was not sure how she went on вђ except that she had to вђ or how she kept from bursting into tears вђ except that she was not going to break down again when rand needed her вђ but somehow she continued through the confinement and the beatings without a tremor in her voice right to kiruna and the rest kneeling to swear fealty darlin and caraline looked stunned samitsu and niande looked horrified though not for the reason she would have supposed it turned out he stilledthree sisters samitsu said shrilly suddenly she slapped a hand over her mouth and twisted around to lean over the side of the swaying wagon and retch loudly niande joined her almost before she began the pair of them hanging there emptying their bellies and cadsuane cadsuane touched randвђs pale face brushed strands of hair from his forehead do not be afraid boy she said softly they made my task harder and yours but i will not hurt you more than i must min turned to ice inside guards at the city gates shouted at the racing wagon but cadsuane told master tol not to stop and he flailed at his mules all the harder people in the streets leaped out of the way to avoid being run down and the wagonвђs progress left behind shouts and curses overturned sedan chairs and coaches run into street vendorsвђ stalls through the streets and up the broad ramp to the sun palace where guards in lord dobraineвђs colors spilled out as though preparing to fight off hordes while master tol was squealing at the top of lungs that aes sedai made him do it the soldiers saw min then they saw rand min had thought she was in a whirlwind before but she had been wrong two dozen men tried to reach into the wagon at once to lift rand out and those who managed to lay hands on him handled him as gently as a babe four to either side with their arms beneath cadsuane must have repeated a thousand times that he was not dead as they hurried into the palace and along corridors that seemed longer than min remembered with more cairhienin soldiers crowding along behind nobles began appearing from every doorway and crossing hall it seemed faces bloodless staring as rand passed she lost track of caraline and darlin realized she could not remember seeing them since the wagon and wishing them well forgot them rand was the only thing she cared about the only thing in the world nandera was with the far dareis maiguarding the doors to randвђs rooms with their gilded rising suns when the graying maiden saw rand stonefaced aiel composure shattered what has happened to him she wailed eyes going wide what has happened some of the other maidens began to moan a low hairraising sound like a dirge be quiet cadsuane roared slapping her hands together in a thundercrack you girl he needs his bed hop nandera hopped rand was stripped and in his bed in a twinkling with samitsu and niande both hovering over him the cairhienin chased out and nandera at the door repeating cadsuaneвђs instructions that he was not to be disturbed by anyone all so fast min felt dizzy she hoped one day to see the confrontation between cadsuane and the wise one sorilea it had to come and it would be memorable yet if cadsuane thought her instructions were really going to keep everyone out she was mistaken before she had more than moved a chair floating it on the power to sit beside randвђs bed kiruna and bera strode in like the two faces of pride ruler of a court and ruler of her farmhouse what is this i hear about вђ kiruna began furiously she saw cadsuane bera saw cadsuane to minвђs amazement they stopped there with their mouths hanging open he is in good hands cadsuane said unless one of you has suddenly found more talent for healing than i recall yes cadsuane they said meekly no cadsuane min closed her own mouth samitsu took an ivoryinlaid chair against the wall spreading her dark yellow skirts and sat with her hands folded watching randвђs chest rise and fall beneath the sheet niande went to randвђs bookshelf and selected a book before she sat near the windows readingkiruna and bera started to sit then actually looked to cadsuane and waited for her impatient nod before they sat down why arenвђt you doing something min shouted that is what i might ask amys said walking into the room the youthful whitehaired wise one stared at rand for a moment then shifted her deep brown shawl and turned to kiruna and bera you may go she said and kiruna sorilea wishes to see you again kirunaвђs dark face paled but the pair of them rose and curtsied murmuring yes amys even more meekly than for cadsuane before leaving with embarrassed glances at the green sister interesting cadsuane said when they were gone her dark eyes locked with amysвђ blue and cadsuane at least seemed to like what she saw at any rate she smiled i should like to meet this sorilea she is a strong woman she seemed to emphasize the word strong the strongest i have ever known amys said simply calmly you would never have thought rand lay senseless in front of her i do not know your healing aes sedai i trust that you have done what can be done her tone was flat min doubted how much amys did trust what can be done has been cadsuane sighed all we can do now is wait while he dies a manвђs harsh voice said and min jumped dashiva strode into the room his plain face contorted in a scowl flinn he snapped niandeвђs book thudded to the floor from apparently nerveless fingers she stared at the three men in black coats as she would have at the dark one himself palefaced samitsu muttered something that sounded like a prayer at dashivaвђs command the grizzled ashaвђman limped to the bed on the opposite side from cadsuane and began running his hands along the length of randвђs still body a foot above the sheet young narishma stood frowning by the door fingering the hilt of his sword those big dark eyes trying to watch all three aes sedai at once the aes sedai and amys he did not look afraid just a man confidently waiting for those women to show themselves his enemies unlike the aes sedai amys ignored the ashaвђman except for flinn her eyes followed him smooth face utterly expressionless but her thumb ran along the haft of her belt knife in a very expressive manner what are you doing samitsu demanded leaping up from her chair whatever her unease about ashaвђman concern for her unconscious patient had overcome it you flinn or whoever you are she started toward the bed and narishma flowed to block her frowning she tried to go around and he put a hand on her arm another boy with no manners cadsuane murmured of the three sisters only she displayed no alarm whatsoever at the ashaвђman instead she studied them over steepled fingers narishma flushed at her comment and removed his hand but when samitsu tried to go around him again he once more stepped in front of her she settled for glaring past his shoulder you flinn what are you doing i wonвђt have you killing him with your ignorance do you hear me min practically danced from foot to foot she did not think an ashaвђman would kill rand not on purpose but he trusted them but light even amys did not seem sure frowning from flinn to rand flinn stripped the sheet down to randвђs waist exposing the wound the gash looked neither better nor worse than she remembered a gaping angry bloodless wound slicing across the round scar he appeared to be sleeping he canвђt do any worse than rand already is min said nobody paid her any mind dashiva made a guttural sound and flinn looked at him you see something ashaвђman i have no talent for healing dashiva said twisting his mouth wryly youвђre the one who took my suggestion and learned what suggestion samitsu demanded i insist that you вђ be quiet samitsu cadsuane said she seemed to be the only one in the room who was calm aside from amys and from the way the wise one kept stroking her knife hilt min was not certain about her i think the last thing he wants to do is harm the boy but cadsuane niande began urgently that man is вђ i said be quiet the grayhaired aes sedai told her firmly i assure you dashiva said managing to sound oily and harsh at the same time flinn knows what he is about already he can do things you aes sedainever dreamed of samitsu sniffed loudly cadsuane merely nodded and sat back in her chair flinn traced his finger along the puffy gash in randвђs side and across the old scar that did seem more tender these are alike but different as if thereвђs two kinds of infection at work only it isnвђt infection itвђs darkness i canвђt think of a better word he shrugged eyeing samitsuвђs yellowfringed shawl as she frowned at him but it was a considering look she gave him now get on with it flinn dashiva muttered if he dies nose wrinkled as though at a bad smell he seemed unable to look away from rand his lips moved as he talked to himself and once he made a sound half sob half bitter laugh without his face changing one line drawing a deep breath flinn looked around the room at the aes sedai at amys when he caught sight of min he gave a start and his leathery face reddened hastily he rearranged the sheet to cover rand to his neck leaving only the old wound and the new exposed i hope nobody minds if i talk he said beginning to move callused hands above randвђs side talking seems to help a mite he squinted focusing on the injuries and his fingers writhed slowly very much as though he was weaving threads min realized his tone was almost absent only part of his mind on the words it was healing made me go to the black tower you might say i was a soldier till i took a lance in my thigh couldnвђt grip a saddle proper after that or even walk far that was the fifteenth wound i took in near forty years in the queenвђs guards fifteen that counted anyway it donвђt if you can walk or ride after i seen a lot of friends die in them forty years so i went and the mвђhael taught me healing and other things a rough sort of healing i was healed by an aes sedai once вђ oh nigh on thirty years back now вђ and this hurts compared to that works as well though then one day dashiva here вђ pardon ashaвђman dashiva вђ says he wonders why itвђs all the same no matter if a manвђs got a broke leg or a cold and we got to talking and well heвђs got no feel for it himself but me seems i got the knack you might say the talent so i started thinking what if i there best i can do dashiva grunted as flinn abruptly sat back on his heels and wiped the back of his hand across his forehead sweat beaded on his face the first time min had seen an ashaвђman perspire the slash in randвђs side was not gone yet it seemed a little smaller less red and angry he still slept but his face seemed less pale samitsu darted past narishma so quickly he had no chance to intervene what did you do she demanded laying fingers on randвђs forehead whatever she found with the power her eyebrows climbed halfway to her hair and her tone leaped from imperious to incredulous what did you do flinn shrugged his shoulders regretfully not much i couldnвђt really touch whatвђs wrong i sort of sealed them away from him for a time anyhow it wonвђt last theyвђre fighting each other now maybe theyвђll kill off each other while he heals himself the rest of the way sighing he shook his head on the other hand i canвђt say that they wonвђt kill him but i think he has a better chance than he did dashiva nodded selfimportantly yes he has a chance now you would have thought he had done the healing himself to flinnвђs evident surprise samitsu rounded the bed to help him rise you will tell me what you did she said regal tone at strong odds with the way her quick fingers straightened the old manвђs collar and smoothed his lapels if only there was some way you could showme but you will describe it you must i will give you all the gold i possess bear your child whatever you wish but you willtell me all that you can apparently not sure herself whether she was commanding or begging she led a very bemused flinn over by the windows he opened his mouth more than once but she was too busy trying to make him talk to see it not caring what anyone thought min climbed onto the bed and lay so she could tuck randвђs head under her chin and wrap her arms around him a chance furtively she studied the three people gathered around the bed cadsuane in her chair amys standing opposite dashiva leaning against one of the square bedposts at the foot all with unreadable auras and images dancing around them all with their eyes intent on rand no doubt amys saw some disaster for the aiel if rand died and dashiva the only one with any expression a dark yet worried scowl disaster for the ashaвђman and cadsuane cadsuane who was not only known to bera and kiruna but made them jump like girls for all their oaths to rand cadsuane who would not hurt rand any more than she had to cadsuaneвђs gaze met minвђs for a moment and min shivered somehow she would protect him while he could not protect himself from amys and dashiva and cadsuane somehow unconsciously she began to hum a lullaby rocking rand gently somehow chapter dice a note from the palace the day after the festival of birds dawned to strong winds off the sea of storms that actually cut the heat in ebou dar a sky without a cloud and the redgold dome of the sun on the horizon gave promises for once the wind died though mat hurried down through the tarasin palace with his green coat undone and his shirt only halflaced in anticipation he did not quite jump at every sound but he did give a start considerably more wideeyed than he liked whenever one of the serving women passed swishing her petticoats and smiling at him every last one of them smiled in a particularly knowing way it was all he could do not to run at the last he slowed easing onto the shaded walk bordering the stableyard almost on tiptoe between the fluted columns of the walk yellowish reedy plants in big red pottery bowls and vines with wide redstriped leaves dangling from metal baskets on chains formed a thin screen unconsciously he tugged his hat lower to obscure his face his hands ran along his spear вђ an ashandarei birgitte called it вђ unthinkingly fingering the haft as if he might need to defend himself the dice tumbled inside his head fiercely yet that had nothing to do with his uneasiness the source of that was tylin six closed coaches with the green anchor and sword of house mitsobar lacquered on the doors already waited in line before the tall arched outer gates with teams hitched and liveried drivers mounted he could see nalesean yawning in a yellowstriped coat on the far side of them and vanin sat slumped atop an upended barrel not far from the stable doors apparently asleep most of the other redarms were squatting patiently on the stableyard flagstones a few tossed dice in the shadow of the huge white stables elayne stood between mat and the coaches just the other side of the screen of plants reanne corly was with her and close by seven more of the women who were at that peculiar meeting he had burst into the evening before reanne was the only one not wearing the red belt of a wise woman he had halfexpected them not to appear this morning they had the features of women used to ordering their own lives and otherвђs and most had at least a bit of gray in their hair yet they watched freshfaced elayne with an air of expectation seemingly on their toes as though ready to jump at her command the whole lot caught less than half his attention though none of them was the woman who had him ready to jump out of his skin tylin made him feel well helpless was the only word that seemed to fit however ridiculous it seemed we do not need them mistress corly elayne said the daughterheir sounded like a woman patting a child on the head iвђve told them to remain here until we return we will attract less attention especially across the river without anyone recognizably aes sedai her notion of what to wear visiting the roughest part of the city without attracting attention was a wide green hat with greendyed plumes a light dustcloak of green linen worked in golden scrolls hanging down her back and a highnecked green silk riding dress with gold embroidery climbing the divided skirts and thickly emphasizing the oval that exposed half her bosom she even wore one of those necklaces for a marriage knife that broad band of woven gold would make every thiefвђs hand in the rahad itch she carried no weapon beyond a small belt knife but as to that what weapon did a woman who could channel need of course every one of those red belts had a curved dagger tucked behind it so did reaneвђs belt of plain worked leather reanne removed a large blue straw hat frowned at it then put it back on and retied the ribbons elayneвђs tone did not seem to be what was bothering her she put on a diffident smile with the hat and a timid tone but why does merilille sedai think we are lying elayne sedai they all do one of the redbelts said breathlessly all of them wore ebou dari dresses in sober colors with narrow plunging necklines and skirts sewn up on one side to expose layered petticoats but only this one bonelean and with more white than black in her long hair had the olive skin and dark eyes of an ebou dari sareitha sedai called me liar to my face about our numbers about вђ she cut off short at a frown and a be quiet tamarla from reanne mistress corly might be ready to curtsy and simper for a child if the child was aes sedai but she kept a tight rein on her companions mat frowned up at the windows overlooking the stableyard those he could see from where he stood elaborate white wroughtiron screens covered some white wooden screens of intricately carved piercework others not likely tylin was up there not likely she would appear in the stableyard he had been very careful not to wake her getting dressed besides she would not try anything here at least he did not think she would then again was anything past the woman who had had half a dozen serving women seize him in the halls last night and drag him into her apartments the bloody woman treated him like a toy he was not going to put up with it anymore he was not light who was he trying to fool if they did not grab this bowl of the winds and get out of ebou dar tylin would be pinching his bottom and calling him her little pigeon again tonight itвђs your ages reanne elayne did not exactly sound hesitant вђ she never did that вђ but her tone became very careful it is considered rude among aes sedai to speak of age but reanne apparently no aes sedai since the breaking has lived as long as any of you in the knitting circle claim that was the odd name these kin gave their ruling council in your own case not by over a hundred years the redbelts gasped going wideeyed a slender browneyed woman with pale honey hair gave a nervous giggle and instantly covered her mouth at reanneвђs whipquick famelle that canвђt be possible reanne said faintly to elayne surely aes sedai must вђ good morning mat said stepping past the screen of plants the whole discussion was idiotic everyone knew aes sedai lived longer than anybody else instead of wasting time they should be on their way to the rahad where are thom and juilin and nynaeve she had to have come back last night or elayne would have been in a swivet blood and ashes i donвђt see birgitte either we need to be on our way elayne not standing around is aviendha coming she frowned at him slightly with just a flicker of her eyes toward reanne and he knew she was deciding what performance to give him wideeyed innocence might damage her standing with these women as much as flashing her dimple at him would elayne always expected that dimple to work where all else failed her chin rose slightly thorn and juilin are helping aviendha and birgitte watch carridinвђs palace mat it was to be the daughterheir in near fullbloom not the whole flowering since she surely knew how he would react to that but a voice full of certainty cool blue eyes demanding and that pretty face chill if not exactly frozen with arrogance was there any woman in the world who was just one person nynaeve will be down shortly iвђm sure there is no reason for you to come you know mat nalesean and your soldiers are a more than adequate bodyguard you could enjoy yourself right here in the palace until we return carridin he cried elayne we arenвђt staying in ebou dar to settle jaichim carridin we are getting the bowl then you or nynaeve is going to make a gateway and we are leaving is that clear and iвђm going with you to the rahad enjoy himself the light only knew what tylin would get up to if he remained in the palace all day the very thought made him want to laugh hysterically icy stares stabbed at him from the wise women stout sumeko pursed her lips angrily and melore a plump domani in her middle years whose bosom he had enjoyed eyeing yesterday planted fists on hips with a face like a thunderhead they should have known from yesterday that he was not intimidated by aes sedai yet even reanne gave him such a scowl he half thought she might try to box his ears apparently if they were going to fall all over themselves around aes sedai then everybody else had to as well elayne struggled with herself visibly her lips compressed but one thing he had to give her she was too smart to go on with what obviously would not work on the other hand she was snooty to the bone however she tried and the other women were watching mat you know we cannot leave until we have used the bowl that haughty chin remained high and her tone was at best halfway between explaining and telling it might require days for us to be sure of how to use it perhaps even half a week or more and we might as well finish carridin if we can in that time such a crackle entered her voice on the whitecloakвђs name that you might have thought she bore the man a personal grudge but something else leaped out and clamped a fist on his thoughts half a week feeling strangled he put a finger behind the scarf knotted around his neck and tugged to ease it tylin had used that length of black silk to tie his hands last night before he knew what she was doing half a week or more despite his best efforts his voice became a touch frantic elayne surely you can use the bowl anywhere it doesnвђt have to be here egwene must want you back as soon as possible she can use a friend or two iвђll wager by the last he had seen she could use a few hundred maybe once he got these women back egwene would be ready to give up that nonsense about being amyrlin and let him take her to rand along with elayne and nynaeve and aviendha and what about rand elayne caemlyn the lion throne blood and ashes you know you want to reach caemlyn quick as you can so rand can give you the lion throne for some reason her face grew darker almost by the word and her eyes flashed he would have said she was indignant except of course that she had no cause she opened her mouth angrily to argue as soon as he finished and he set himself ready to list her promises and to the pit of doom with what that did to her in the eyes of reanne and the rest by their faces they would have snubbed him short already in her place before anyone could say anything though a round graying woman in house mitsobar livery was curtsying first to elayne then to the women wearing red belts and finally to him queen tylin sends this master cauthon laren said holding out a basket with a striped cloth over the contents and small red flowers woven around the handle you did not breakfast and you must maintain your strength matвђs cheeks warmed the woman merely looked at him but she had seen considerably more of him than when she first showed him into tylinвђs presence considerably more she had brought supper on a tray last night while he tried to hide under the silk bedsheet he did not understand it these women had him jumping about and blushing like a girl he just could not understand are you sure you wouldnвђt rather remain here elayne asked iвђm sure tylin would enjoy your company for breakfast the queen said she finds you wonderfully entertaining and courteously compliant she added in a doubtful tone mat fled for the coaches with the basket in one hand and his ashandareiin the other are all northern men so shy laren said he risked a glance over his shoulder without stopping and heaved a sigh of relief the serving woman was already gathering her skirts turning to walk though the screen of plants and elayne was motioning reanne and the wise women into a circle close around her even so he shivered women were going to be the death of him yet rounding the nearest coach he nearly dropped the basket at the sight of beslan seated on the coach step sunlight gleaming along the narrow blade of his sword as he examined the edge what are you doing here mat exclaimed beslan slid the sword into its sheath a grin splitting his face coming with you to the rahad i suspect youвђll find more fun for us there had better be some fun nalesean yawned into his hand i didnвђt get very much sleep last night and now you drag me off when there are sea folk women about vanin sat up on his barrel looked around found nothing moving and settled himself back again with his eyes shut thereвђll be no funif i can help it mat muttered naleseanhad not gotten much sleep hah the whole lot of them had been out enjoying themselves at the festival not that he had not enjoyed himself in patches but only when he could forget he was with a woman who thought he was some sort of bloody doll what sea folk women when nynaeve sedai returned last night she brought a dozen or more mat beslan blew out his breath and his hands made swaying motions the way they move mat mat shook his head he was not thinking clearly tylin was scrambling his brains nynaeve and elayne had told him about the windfinders reluctantly and in sworn secrecy after trying to hold back even where nynaeve wanted to go much less why and not a single blush at the effort either women keep promises in their own way so the saying went come to think of it lawtin and belvyn were not with the rest of the redarms maybe nynaeve thought to make up for the other by keeping them with her now in their own way but if she had the windfinders already in the palace surely it would not take half a week to use the bowl light please not as if thinking of her had been a summons nynaeve came strolling through the screen of plants into the stableyard matвђs jaw dropped the tall man in a dark green coat on her arm was lan or rather she was on his clinging to it with both hands smiling up at him with any other woman mat would have said she was mooneyed and dreaming but this was nynaeve she gave a start once she realized where she was and took a hasty step to one side though she still held on to lanвђs hand for a moment her choice of dresses was no better than elayneвђs all blue silk and green embroidery cut low enough to show a heavy gold ring that would have rattled on her two thumbs together dangling into her cleavage on a thin gold chain the wide hat she carried by its ribbons was trimmed with blue plumes her dustcloak green linen embroidered in blue she and elayne made the other women drab by comparison in their woolens in any case whether or not she had been calfeyes a moment before she was all herself now shifting her braid around join the other men now lan she said peremptorily and we can go the last four coaches are for the men as you say lan replied bowing with a hand on his sword hilt she watched him stride toward mat with an expression of wonder probably unable to believe he was obeying so meekly then gave herself a shake and recovered her bristly self again gathering up elayne and the other women she herded them toward the first two coaches like a woman shooing geese by the way she shouted for someone to open the stableyard gates no one would have known she had been the one delaying their departure she shouted at the drivers too setting them to snatching up their reins and flourishing their long whips it was a marvel they waited for anyone to climb aboard scrambling awkwardly after lan and nalesean and beslan into the third coach mat propped his spear across the door and sat down hard with the basket on his lap as the coach lurched forward where did you come from lan he burst out as soon as introductions were out of the way youвђre the last man i expected to see where have you been light i thought you were dead i know randвђs afraid you are and letting nynaeve order you around why in the light would you do that the stonefaced warder seemed to consider which question to answer nynaeve and i were married last night by the mistress of the ships he said finally the athaвђan miere have several unusual marriage customs there were surprises for both of us a small smile touched his mouth if nothing else he shrugged slightly seemingly that was all the answer he intended to give the blessing of the light be upon you and your bride beslan murmured politely with as much of a bow as the confines of the coach would allow and nalesean mumbled something though it was plain from his expression that he thought lan must be mad nalesean had had a good bit of nynaeveвђs company mat just sat there swaying with the coachвђs motion and staring nynaeve married lanmarried to nynaeve the man wasmad no wonder his eyes looked so bleak mat would as soon have stuffed a rabid fox down his own shirt only a fool married and only a madman would marry nynaeve if lan noticed that not everyone was overjoyed he gave no sign except for his eyes he looked no different than mat remembered maybe a little harder if that was possible there is something more important lan said nynaeve doesnвђt want you to know mat but you need to hear it your two men are dead killed by moghedien i am sorry but if it is any consolation they truly were dead before they knew nynaeve thinks moghedien must be gone or sheвђd have tried again but i am not so certain it seems she has a personal enmity toward nynaeve although nynaeve managed to avoid telling me why again the smile lan seemed unaware of it not all of it at least and it does not matter best you know what might be facing us beyond the river though moghedien beslan breathed eyes shining the man was probably seeing fun moghedien nalesean breathed but in his case it was more of a groan and he gave his pointed beard a fitful jerk those bloody flaming women mat muttered i hope you donвђt include my wife lan said coldly one hand gripping the hilt of his sword and mat quickly raised his own hands of course not just elayne and and the kin after a moment lan nodded and mat breathed a small sigh of relief it would be just like nynaeve to get him killed by her husband вђ her husband вђ when sure as bread was brown she would have hidden the fact that one of the forsaken might be in the city even moghedien did not really frighten him not so long as he had the foxhead around his neck but the medallion could not protect nalesean or any of the rest no doubt nynaeve thought she and elayne would do that they let him bring along the redarms all the while laughing up their sleeves at him while they вђ arenвђt you going to read my motherвђs note mat until beslan mentioned it he had not realized there was a sheet of paper folded small tucked in between the basket and the striped cloth just enough showed to reveal the green seal impressed with the anchor and sword he broke the wax with his thumb and unfolded the page holding it so beslan could not see what was written as well he did or then again considering how the other man saw things maybe it did not matter either way mat was just as glad no eyes but his saw those words his heart sank deeper by the line mat my sweet i am having your things moved to my apartments so much more convenient by the time you return riselle will be in your old rooms to look after young olver he seems to enjoy her company i have seamstresses coming to measure you i will enjoy watching that you must wear shorter coats and new breeches of course you have a delightful bottom duckling who is this daughter of the nine moons i made you think of i have thought of several delicious ways to make you tell me tylin the others were all looking at him expectantly well lan was simply looking but his gaze was more unnerving than the rest that stare seemed almost dead the queen thinks i need new clothes mat said stuffing the note into his coat pocket i think iвђll take a nap he pulled the brim of his hat down over his eyes but he did not close them staring out the window where the tiedback curtain let in occasional eddies of dust it also let in the wind though which was considerably better than the heat of a closed coach moghedien and tylin of the two he would rather confront moghedien he touched the foxhead hanging in the open neck of his shirt at least he had some protection against moghedien against tylin he had no more than he did against the daughter of the bloody nine moons whoever she was unless he could find some way to make nynaeve and elayne leave ebou dar before tonight everybody was going to know sullenly he tugged his hat lower these flaming women really were making him act like a girl in another minute he was afraid he might just start crying chapter female silhouettes six stories mat would have gotten out and pulled the coach himself if he could he thought they might have moved faster the streets were already full with the sun not all the way up wagons and carts wending their way nosily through the crowds and windblown dust to shouts and curses both from drivers and those forced to get out of the way so many barges slid along the canals on the bargemenвђs poles that a man almost could have walked the canals like streets stepping from one barge to the next a noisy hum hung over the gleaming white city ebou dar seemed to be trying to make up for time lost yesterday not to mention at high chasaline and the feast of lights and well it might considering that tomorrow night was the feast of embers with maddinвђs day celebrating the founder of altara two days after that and the feast of the half moon the following night southerners had a reputation for industry but he thought it was because they had to work so hard to make up for all the festivals and feastdays the wonder was that they had the strength for it eventually the coaches did reach the river drawing up at one of the long stone landings that jutted out into the water all lined with steps for boarding the boats tied alongside sticking a wedge of dark yellow cheese and a butt end of bread into his pocket he stuffed the basket well under the seat he was hungry but someone in the kitchens had been in too much of a hurry most of the basket was filled by a clay pot full of oysters but the kitchens had forgotten to cook them scrambling down behind lan he left nalesean and beslan to help vanin and the others down from the last coaches nearly a dozen men and not even the cairhienin really small they had been jammed in like apples in a barrel and clambered out stiffly mat strode ahead of the warder toward the lead coach the ashandareislanted across his shoulder nynaeve and elayne were both going to get a piece of his mind no matter who was listening trying to keep moghedien hidden not to mention two of his men dead he was going to вђ suddenly very conscious of lan towering behind him like a stone statue with that sword on his hip he amended his thoughts the daughterheir at least was going to hear about keeping that sort of secret nynaeve was standing on the landing tying on her blueplumed hat and talking back up into the coach when he reached it will work out of course but who would think the sea folk of all people would demand such a thing even just in private but nynaeve elayne said as she stepped down with her greenplumed hat in her hand if last night was as glorious as you say how can you complain about вђ that was when they became aware of him and lan of lan really nynaeveвђs eyes opened wider and wider filling her face as it reddened to shame two sunsets maybe three elayne froze with one foot still on the coach step giving the warder such a frown you would have thought he had sneaked up on them lan gazed down at nynaeve though with no more expression than a fence post and for all nynaeve appeared ready to crawl under the coach and hide she stared up at lan as if no one else existed in the world realizing her frown was wasted there elayne took her foot off the step and moved out of the way of reanne and the two wise women who had shared the coach tamarla and a graying saldaean woman named janira but the daughterheir did not give up oh no she transferred that scowl to mat cauthon and if it altered a whit it was to deepen he snorted and shook his head usually when a woman was in the wrong she could find so many things to blame on the nearest man that he wound up thinking maybe he really was at fault in his experience old memories or new there were only two times a woman admitted she was wrong when she wanted something and when it snowed at midsummer nynaeve seized at her braid but not as if her heart was in it her fingers fumbled and fell away and she started wringing her hands instead lan she began unsteadily you mustnвђt think i would talk about вђ the warder cut in smoothly bowing and offering her his arm we are in public nynaeve whatever you want to say in public you may may i escort you to the boat yes she said nodding so vigorously that her hat nearly fell off she straightened it hurriedly with both hands yes in public you will escort me taking his arm she regained some measure of composure at least insofar as her face went gathering her dustcloak in her free hand she practically dragged him across the quay toward the landing mat wondered whether she might be ill he rather enjoyed seeing nynaeve dropped a peg or six but she hardly ever let it last two breaths aes sedai could not heal themselves maybe he should suggest to elayne that she deal with whatever was wrong with nynaeve he avoided healing like death or marriage himself but it was different for other people as he saw it first though he had a few choice words to say about secrets opening his mouth he raised an admonitory finger and elayne poked him in the chest with hers her scowl beneath that plumed hat so cold it made his toes hurt mistress corly she said in the icy voice of a queen pronouncing judgment explained to nynaeve and me the significance of those red flowers on the basket which i see you at least have shame enough to have hidden his face went redder than nynaeveвђs had thought of a few paces away reanne corly and the other two were tying on hats and adjusting dresses the way women did every time they stood up sat down or moved three steps yet despite giving their attention to their clothes they had enough left over for glances in his direction and for once they were neither disapproving nor startled he had not known the bloody flowers meant anything tensunsets would not have done for his face so elayneвђs voice was low for his ears alone but it dripped disgust and contempt she gave her cloak a twitch to keep it from touching him itвђs true i could not believeit of you not even you iвђm surenynaeve couldnвђt any promise i made to you is abolished i will not keep any promise to a man who could forcehis attentions on a woman on anywoman but especiallyon a queen who has offered him вђ meforce myattentions on her he shouted or rather he tried to shout choking made it come out in a wheeze seizing elayneвђs shoulders he pulled her away from the carriages a little distance shirtless dockmen in stained green leather vests hurried by carrying sacks on their shoulders or rolling barrels along the quay some pushing low barrows loaded with crates all giving the coaches a wide berth the queen of altara might not have much power but her sigil on a coach door ensured that commoners would give it room nalesean and beslan were chatting as they led the redarms onto the landing vanin bringing up the rear and staring gloomily at the choppy river he claimed to have a tender belly when it came to boats the wise women from both coaches had gathered around reanne watching but they were not close enough to overhear he whispered hoarsely just the same you listen to me that woman wonвђt take no for an answer i say no and she laughsat me sheвђs starved me bullied me chased me down like a stag she has more hands than any six women i ever met she threatened to have the serving women undress me if i didnвђt let her вђ abruptly what he was saying hit him and who he was saying it to he managed to close his mouth before he swallowed a fly he became very interested in one of the dark metal ravens inlaid in the haft of the ashandarei so he would not have to meet her eyes what i mean to say is you donвђt understand he muttered you have it all backwards he risked a glance at her under the edge of his hatbrim a faint blush crept into her cheeks but her face became solemn as a marble bust it appears that i may have misunderstood she said soberly that is very badof tylin he thought her lips twitched have you considered practicing different smiles in a mirror mat startled he blinked what i have heard reliably that that is what young women do who attract the eyes of kings something cracked the sobriety of her voice and this time her lips definitely twitched you might try batting your eyelashes too catching her lower lip with her teeth she turned away shoulders shaking dustcloak streaming behind as she hurried toward the landing before she darted beyond hearing he heard her chortle something about a taste of his own medicine reanne and the wise women scurried in her wake a flock of hens following a chick instead of the other way around the few barechested boatmen up out of their boats stopped coiling lines or whatever they were doing and bowed their heads respectfully as the procession went by snatching off his hat mat considered throwing it down and jumping on it women he should have known better than to expect sympathy he would like to throttle the bloody daughterheir and nynaeve too on general principle except of course that he could not he had made promises and those dice were still using his skull for a dice cup and one of the forsaken might be around somewhere settling the hat squarely back on his head he marched down the landing brushed past the wise women and caught up to elayne she was still trying to fight down giggles but every time she cut her eyes his way the color in her cheeks renewed itself and so did the giggles he stared straight ahead bloody women bloody promises removing his hat long enough to pull the leather cord from around his neck he reluctantly shoved it in her direction the silver foxhead dangled beneath his fist you and nynaeve will have to decide which of you wears this but i want it back when we leave ebou dar you understand the moment we leave вђ suddenly he realized he was walking alone turning he found elayne standing stock still two paces back staring at him with reanne and the rest clustered behind her whatвђs the matter now he demanded oh yes i know all about moghedien a skinny fellow with red stones on his brasshoop earrings bending over a mooring line jerked around so fast at that name that he pitched over the side with a loud yell and a louder splash mat did not care who heard trying to keep her secret вђ and two of my men dead вђ after you promised well weвђll talk about that later i made a promise too i promised to keep the pair of you alive if moghedien shows up sheвђll go after you two now here he pushed the medallion at her again she shook her head slowly in puzzlement then turned to murmur to reanne only after the older women were on their way toward where nynaeve stood beckoning them at the head of a flight of boat stairs did elayne take the foxhead turning it over in her fingers do you have any notion what i would have done to have this for study she said quietly any notion at all she was tall for a woman but she still had to look up at him she might never have seen him before you are a troublesome man mat cauthon lini would say i was repeating myself but you expelling her breath elayne reached up to pull his hat off and slip the cord over his head she actually tucked the foxhead into his shirt and patted it before handing him his hat i wonвђt wear that while nynaeve doesnвђt have one or aviendha and i think they feel the same you wear it after all you can hardly keep your promise if moghedien kills you not that i think sheвђs still here i think she believes she killed nynaeve and i would not be surprised if that was all she came for you must be careful though nynaeve says thereвђs a storm coming and she doesnвђt mean this wind i that faint blush returned to her cheeks i am sorry i laughed at you she cleared her throat looking away sometimes i forget my duty to my subjects you are a worthy subject matrim cauthon i will see that nynaeve understands the right of of you and tylin perhaps we can help no he spluttered i mean yes i mean that is oh kiss a flaming goat if i know what i mean i almost wish you didnвђt know the truth nynaeve and elayne sitting down to discuss him with tylin over tea could he ever live that down could he ever again look any of them in the eye afterward but if they did not he was between the wolf and the bear with nowhere to run oh sheep swallop sheep swallop and bloody buttered onions he nearly wished she would call him down for his language the way nynaeve would just to change the subject her lips moved silently and for an instant he had the strange impression that she was repeating what he had just said of course not he was seeing things that was all aloud she said i understand sounding just as if she did come along now mat we canвђt waste time standing in one spot gaping he watched her lift skirts and cloak to make her way along the landing she understood she understood and not one acid little comment not one cutting remark and he was her subject her worthysubject fingering the medallion he followed he had been sure the fight would be to ever get it back if he lived as long as twoaes sedai he still would never understand women and noblewomen were purely the worst when he reached the steps elayne had gone down the boatвђs two brassearringed oarsmen were already using their long sweeps to push the vessel away elayne was herding reanne and the last of the wise women into the cabin and lan stood up in the bows with nynaeve a shout from beslan called him on to the next boat which held all of the men except the warder nynaeve said there wasnвђt room for any of us nalesean said as the boat rocked its way out into the eldar she said weвђd crowd them beslan laughed looking around their own boat vanin sat beside the cabin door with his eyes closed trying to pretend he was somewhere else harnan and tad kandel an andoran despite being as dark as either of the boatmen had climbed atop the cabin the rest of the redarms hunkered about the deck trying to keep out of the way of the rowers nobody went into the cabin all apparently waiting to see whether mat and nalesean and beslan wanted it mat put himself beside the tall bowpost peering after the other boat crawling on its sweeps just ahead the wind whipped the dark choppy waters and his scarf as well and he had to hold on to his hat what was nynaeve up to the other nine women on the second boat were all in the cabin leaving the deck to her and lan they stood up in the bows lan with his arms folded nynaeve gesturing as though explaining except that nynaeve seldom explained anything better say never than seldom whatever she was doing it did not last long there were whitecaps out in the bay where sea folk rakers and skimmers and soarers heaved at their anchors the river was not so bad but the boat still wallowed more than mat remembered from any previous trip before long nynaeve was draped over the railing losing her breakfast while lan held her that reminded mat of his own belly tucking his hat under his arm so it could not blow away he pulled out the wedge of cheese beslan is this storm likely to break before we can come back from the rahad he took a bite of the sharptasting cheese they had fifty different sorts in ebou dar all good nynaeve was still hanging over the side how much had the woman eaten this morning i donвђt know where weвђll shelter if weвђre caught he could not think of a single inn he had seen in the rahad that he would take the women into no storm beslan said seating himself on the railing these are the winter trade winds the trades come twice a year in late winter and late summer but they have to blow much harder before it comes to storm he directed a sour look out toward the bay every year those winds bring вђ brought вђ ships from tarabon and arad doman i wonder whether they ever will again the wheel weaves mat began and choked on a crumb of cheese blood and ashes he was starting to sound like some grayhair resting his aching joints in front of the fireplace worrying about taking the women into a rough inn a year ago half a year he would have taken them and laughed when their eyes popped laughed at every prim sniff well maybe weвђll find you some fun in the rahad anyway at the least somebody will try to cut a purse or pull elayneвђs necklace off maybe that was what he needed to clean the taste of sobriety from his tongue sobriety light what a word to apply to mat cauthon tylin must be scaring him more than he thought if he was shriveling up this way maybe he needed some of beslanвђs sort of fun that was crazy вђ he had never seen the fight he would not rather walk around вђ but maybe beslan shook his head if anyone can find it you can but weвђll be with seven wise women mat seven with just one at your side you could slap a man even in the rahad and he would swallow his tongue and walk away and the women whatвђs the fun of kissing a woman without the risk sheвђll decide to stick a knife in you burn my soul nalesean muttered into his beard it sounds as though iвђve dragged myself from bed for a dull morning beslan nodded in commiseration if weвђre lucky though the civil guard does send patrols to the rahad occasionally and if theyвђre after smugglers they always dress like anyone else they seem to think nobody will notice a dozen or so men together carrying swords whatever they wear and theyвђre always surprised when the smugglers ambush them which is what nearly always happens if matвђs taвђverenluck works for us we might be taken for the civil guard and some smugglers might attack us before they see the red belts nalesean brightened and began rubbing his hands together mat glared at them maybe beslanвђs sort of fun was not what he needed for one thing he had more than enough of women with knives nynaeve still hung over the side of the boat ahead that would teach her to gorge herself wolfing down the last of the cheese he began on the bread and tried to ignore the dice in his head an easy trip with no trouble did not sound bad at all a quick trip with a quick departure from ebou dar the rahad was everything he remembered and everything beslan feared the wind made climbing the cracked gray stone steps at the boat landing into a perilous feat and after that it grew worse canals ran everywhere just as across the river but here the bridges were plain the grimy stone parapets broken and crumbling half the canals were so silted that boys waded waistdeep in them and hardly a barge was to be seen tall buildings stood crowded together blocky structures with scabrous oncewhite plaster gone in huge patches to reveal rotting red brick bordering narrow streets with broken paving stones in those streets where even the fragments had not been ripped up morning did not really reach into the shadows of the buildings dingy laundry hung drying from every third window except where a structure stood empty some did and those windows gaped liked eye sockets in a skull a soursweet smell of decay permeated the air last monthвђs chamber pots and ancient refuse moldering wherever it had been flung and for every fly on the other side of the eldar a hundred buzzed here in clouds of green and blue he spotted the peeling blue door of the golden crown of heaven and shuddered at the thought of taking the women in there if the storm broke despite what beslan said then he shuddered again for having shuddered something was happening to him and he did not like it nynaeve and elayne insisted on taking the lead with reanne between them and the wise women close behind lan stayed at nynaeveвђs shoulder like a wolfhound hand on sword hilt eyes constantly searching radiating menace in truth he was probably enough protection for two dozen pretty sixteenyearold girls carrying sacks of gold even here but mat insisted that vanin and the rest keep their eyes open in fact the former horsethief and poacher kept so close to elayne that anyone could have been forgiven for thinking he was her warder if a rather fat and rumpled one beslan rolled his eyes expressively at matвђs instructions and nalesean irritably stroked his beard and muttered that he could still be in bed men strutted arrogantly along the streets with often ragged vests and no shirts wearing great brass hoops in their ears and brass finger rings set with colored glass one knife or sometimes two stuck behind their belts hands hovering near those knives they stared as though daring someone to give the wrong twist to a look others skulked from corner to corner doorway to doorway with hooded eyes imitating the slatribbed dogs that sometimes snarled from a dark alleyway barely wide enough for a man to squeeze into those men hunched over their knives and there was no way to tell which would run and which stab by and large the women made any of the men appear humble parading in worn dresses and twice as much brass jewelry as the men they carried knives too of course and their bold dark eyes sent ten sorts of challenge in every glance in short the rahad was the sort of place where anyone wearing silk could hardly hope to walk ten steps without being cracked over the head after which they had best hope to wake stripped to the skin and tossed onto a pile of rubbish in an alley since the alternative was not to wake at all but children darted from every second door with chipped pottery cups of water sent by their mothers in case the wise women wished a drink men with scarred faces and murder etched into their eyes stared openmouthed at seven wise women together then bobbed jerky bows and inquired politely if they could be of assistance was there anything that required carrying women sometimes with as many scars and always eyes to make tylin flinch curtsied awkwardly and breathlessly asked whether they might supply directions had anyone made a bother of themselves to bring so many wise women if so the strong implication was tamarla and the rest had no need of troubling themselves if they would just supply the name oh they glared at the soldiers as hotly as ever though even the hardest flinched away from lan after a single look and oddly enough from vanin a few of the men growled at beslan and nalesean whenever they gazed too long at a womanвђs deep neckline some growled at mat though he could not understand why unlike those two he was never in danger of his eyeballs falling down the front of a womanвђs dress he knew how to look discreetly nynaeve and elayne were ignored for all their finery and so was reanne in her red wool dress they did not have the red belt but they did have the protection of those belts mat realized that beslan had been right he could empty his purse on the ground and no one would pick up a copper at least so long as the wise women remained he could pinch the bottom of every woman in sight and even if she had apoplexy she would walk away what a pleasant walk nalesean said dryly with such interesting sights and smells did i tell you i didnвђt get much sleep last night mat do you want to die in bed mat grumbled they might as well all have stayed in bed they were bloody useless here that was for sure the tairen snorted indignantly beslan laughed but he probably thought mat meant something else across the rahad they marched until reanne finally stopped in front of a building exactly like every other all flaking plaster and crumbling brick the same mat had followed another woman to yesterday no laundry hung from these windows only rats lived in there in here she said elayneвђs eyes climbed slowly to the flat roof six she murmured in tones of great satisfaction six nynaeve sighed and elayne patted her arm as though sympathizing with her i wasnвђt really sure she said so nynaeve smiled and patted her mat did not understand a word of it so the building had six floors women behaved very strangely sometimes well most of the time inside a long hallway carpeted with dust ran dimly to the back the far end lost in shadows few of the doorways held doors and those were rough planks one opening almost a third of the way down the hall led to a narrow flight of steep stonefaced steps climbing upward that was the way he had gone the day before following footprints in the dust but he thought some of those other openings must be crossing corridors he had not taken time to look around then but the building was too deep and too wide for this floor to be served by only the one they saw it was too big for only one way in really mat nynaeve said when he told off harnan and half the redarms to find any back way in and guard it lan kept so close to her side he might have been glued there donвђt you see by now thereвђs no need her tone was so mild that elayne must have passed on the truth about tylin but if anything that only soured his mood further he did not want anyoneto know bloody useless but those dice were still rattling around in his head maybe moghedien likes back doors he said dryly something cluttered in the dark end of the hall and one of the men with harnan cursed loudly about rats you told him nynaeve breathed furiously at lan one hand snapping shut on her braid elayne made an exasperated sound this is no time to stop for an argument nynaeve the bowl is upstairs the bowl of the winds a small ball of light suddenly appeared floating in front of her and without waiting to see whether or not nynaeve was coming she gathered her skirts and darted up the stairs vanin dashed after her with a startling turn of speed for his bulk followed by reanne and most of the wise women roundfaced sumeko and ieine tall and dark and pretty despite the lines at the corners of her eyes hesitated then remained with nynaeve mat would have gone too if nynaeve and lan had not been in his way would you let me by nynaeve he asked he deserved to be there at least when this fabulous bloody bowl was uncovered nynaeve she was so focused on lan she seemed to have forgotten anyone else mat exchanged glances with beslan who grinned and squatted easily with corevin and the remaining redarms nalesean leaned against the wall and yawned ostentatiously which was a mistake with all that dust about the yawn turned into a coughing fit that darkened his face and doubled him over even that did not distract nynaeve carefully she took her hand away from her braid i am not angry lan she said yes you are he replied calmly but he had to be told nynaeve mat said lan neither one so much as flickered an eye his way i would have told him when i was ready lan mandragoran her mouth clamped shut but her lips writhed as though she were talking to herself i will not be angry with you she went on in a much milder tone and that sounded addressed to herself as well very deliberately she tossed her braid back over her shoulder jerked that blueplumed hat straight and clasped her hands at her waist if you say so lan said mildly nynaeve quivered donвђt you take that tone with me she shouted i tell you iвђm not angry do you hear me blood and ashes nynaeve mat growled he doesnвђt think youвђre angry i donвђt think youвђre angry a good thing women had taught him to lie with a straight face now could we go upstairs and fetch this bloody bowl of the winds a marvelous idea said a womanвђs voice from the door to the street shall we go up together and surprise elayne mat had never seen the two women who walked into the hall before but their faces were aes sedai faces the speakerвђs was long and cold as her voice her companionвђs framed by scores of thin dark braids worked with colored beads nearly two dozen men crowded in behind them bulky fellows with heavy shoulders clubs and knives in hand mat shifted his grip on the ashandarei he knew trouble when he saw it and the foxhead on his chest was cool almost cold against his skin somebody was holding the one power the two wise women nearly fell over dropping curtsies as soon as they saw those ageless features but nynaeve certainly knew trouble too her mouth worked soundlessly as the pair came down the hallway her face all consternation and selfrecrimination behind him mat heard a sword leaving its scabbard but he was not about to look back to see whose lan just stood there which meant of course that he looked like a leopard ready to pounce theyвђre black ajah nynaeve said at last her voice started faint and gained strength as she went on falion bhoda and ispan shefar they committed murder in the tower and worse since theyвђre darkfriends and her voice faltered for an instant they have me shielded the newcomers continued to advance serenely have you ever heard such nonsense ispan the longfaced aes sedai asked her companion who stopped grimacing at the dust long enough to smirk at nynaeve ispan and i come from the white tower while nynaeve and her friends are rebels against the amyrlin seat theyвђll be punished severely for that and so will anyone who helps them with a shock mat realized the woman did not know she thought that he and lan and the others were just hired strongarms falion directed a smile at nynaeve it made a blizzard warm by comparison thereвђs someone who will be overjoyed to see you when we take you back nynaeve she thinks you are dead better the rest of you go now you donвђt want to meddle in aes sedai affairs my men will see you to the river without taking her eyes from nynaeve falion motioned for the men behind her to come forward lan moved he did not draw his sword and against aes sedai he should have had no chance if he had no chance in any case but one moment he was standing still and the next he had thrown himself at the pair just before he struck he grunted as though hit hard but he crashed into them carrying both black sisters to the dusty floor that opened the sluicegates wide lan pushed himself to hands and knees shaking his head groggily and one of the bulky fellows raised an ironstrapped club to smash his skull mat stabbed the fellow in the belly with his spear as beslan and nalesean and the five redarms rushed to meet the darkfriendsвђ shouting charge lan staggered to his feet sword sweeping out to open a darkfriend from crotch to neck there was not much room to work sword or ashandareiin the corridor but the tight quarters were what allowed them to face odds of two to one or worse without being overcome in the first moment grunting men struggled with them facetoface elbowing each other for room to stab or swing a club at them small spaces remained clear around the black sisters and around nynaeve they saw to that themselves a wiry andoran redarm almost bumped into falion but at the last instant he jerked into the air and flew across the hallway knocking down two of the heavyshouldered darkfriends in his flight before smacking into the wall and sliding down the back of his head leaving a bloody smear on the cracked dusty plaster a bald headed darkfriend squeezed through the line of defenders and rushed at nynaeve with outstretched knife he yelled as his feet were suddenly jerked back from him a yell that cut off when his face hit the floor so hard that his head bounced obviously nynaeve was no longer shielded and if the chilly silver foxhead sliding around matвђs chest as he fought was not enough indication that she and the black sisters were in some sort of struggle the way they glared at her and she at them ignoring the battle around them shouted the fact the two wise women looked on in horror they had their curved knives in their fists but they huddled against the wall staring from nynaeve to the other two with eyes wide and mouths hanging open fight nynaeve snapped at them she turned her head just a fraction so she could see them as well as falion and ispan i cannot do it alone theyвђre linked if you donвђt fight them they will kill you you know about them now the wise women gaped at her as though she had suggested spitting in the queenвђs face in the midst of shouts and grants ispan laughed melodiously in the midst of shouts and grants a shrill scream echoed down the stairs nynaeveвђs head swung that way suddenly she staggered and her head swung back like a wounded badgerвђs with a scowl that should have made falion and ispan leave right then if they had any sense nynaeve spared an agonized glance for mat though there was channeling upstairs she said through her teeth thereвђs trouble mat hesitated more likely elayne had seen a rat more likely he managed to knock aside a dagger thrust at his ribs but there was no room to stab back with the ashandareior use the haft like a quarterstaff beslan stabbed past him and took his attacker through the heart please mat nynaeve said tightly she never begged she would cut her own throat first please with a curse mat pulled himself out of the fight and dashed up the steep narrow stairs taking all six flights in the dark stairwell at a dead ran there was not a single window to give light if it was just a rat he was going to shake elayne till her teeth he burst out onto the top floor not much brighter than the stairwell with only one window at the street end burst into a scene from nightmare women lay sprawled everywhere elayne was one half on her back against the wall eyes closed vanin crouched on his knees blood streaming from nose and ears feebly trying to pull himself up against the wall the last woman on her feet janira fled toward mat as soon as she saw him he had thought of her as a hawk with her hooked beak of a nose and sharp cheekbones but her face was pure terror now those dark eyes wide and stark help me she screamed at him and a man caught her from behind he was an ordinarylooking fellow maybe a little older than mat of the same height and slender in a plain gray coat smiling he took janiraвђs head between his hands and twisted sharply the sound of her neck breaking was like a dry branch snapping he let her drop in a boneless heap and gazed down at her for a moment his smile looked rapturous by the light of a pair of lanterns a small knot of men just beyond vanin were prying open a door to the squeal of rusted hinges but mat hardly noticed his eyes went from janiraвђs crumpled corpse to elayne he had promised to keep her safe for rand he had promised with a cry he launched himself at the killer ashandareiextended mat had seen myrddraal move but this fellow was quicker hard as that was to believe he just seemed to flow from in front of the spear and seizing the haft he pivoted flinging mat past him five paces down the hall breath left when he hit the floor in a small cloud of dust so did the ashandarei straggling for air he pushed himself up foxhead dangling from his open shirt dragging a knife from under his coat he flung himself at the man again just as nalesean appeared at the head of the stairs sword in hand now they had him however quick he the man made a myrddraal seem stiff he slid around naleseanвђs thrust as though there was not a bone in his body right hand shooting out to seize naleseanвђs throat his hand came away with a liquid ripping sound blood fountained past naleseanвђs beard his sword dropped ringing on the dusty stone floor and he clutched both hands to his ruined neck red running through his fingers as he fell mat crashed into the killerвђs back and they all three hit the floor together he had no compunctions against stabbing a man in the back when it was necessary especially a man who could tear somebodyвђs throat out he should have let nalesean stay in bed the thought came sadly as he drove the blade home hard then a second time a third the man twisted in his grip it should not have been possible but somehow the fellow rolled over beneath him pulling the knife hilt out of his hand naleseanвђs staring eyes and bloody throat were a reminder right before his eyes desperately he grabbed the manвђs wrists one hand slipping a little in the blood that ran down the fellowвђs hand the man smiled at him with a knife sticking out of his side he smiled he wants you dead as much as he wants her he said softly and as if mat was not holding him at all his hands moved toward matвђs head driving matвђs arms back mat pushed frantically threw all of his weight against the fellowвђs arms to no avail light he might as well have been a child fighting a grown man the fellow was making a game of it taking his bloody time hands touched his head where was his flaming luck he gave a heave with what seemed his last strength вђ and the medallion fell against the manвђs cheek the man screamed smoke rose around the edges of the foxhead and a sizzle like bacon frying convulsively he hurled mat away with hands and feet both this time mat flew ten paces and slid when he scrambled to his feet halfdazed the man was already up hands trembling at his face a raw red brand marked where the foxhead had fallen gingerly mat fingered the medallion it was cool not the cool of someone channeling nearby вђ maybe they were still at it below but that was too far off вђ just the cool of silver he had no notion what this fellow was except that he certainly was not human but between that burn and three stab wounds with the knife hilt still jutting out beneath his arm he had to be slowed enough for mat to get past him to the stairs avenging elayne was all very well and nalesean too but it was not going to happen today apparently and there was no call to supply a reason for avenging mat cauthon jerking the knife out of his side the man hurled it at him mat snagged it out of the air without thinking thom had taught him to juggle and thom said he had the quickest hands he had ever seen ripping the knife around so he held it properly pointed slanted up he noticed the gleaming blade and his heart sank no blood there should have been at least a smear of red but the steel shone bright and clean maybe even three stab wounds were not going to slow this вђ whatever he was he risked a glance over his shoulder the other men were streaming out of that door they had pried open the door those footprints had led him to yesterday but their arms seemed full of rubbish small halfrotted chests a cask with clothwrapped objects bulging through missing staves even a broken chair and a cracked mirror they must have had orders to take everything paying no attention whatever to mat they hurried toward the far end of the hall and vanished around a corner there had to be another set of stairs back there maybe he could follow them down at a distance maybe just before the doorway they had come out of vanin made another effort to stand and fell back mat bit back a curse lugging vanin was going to slow him but if his luck was in it had not saved elayne but maybe from the corner of his eye he saw her move lifting a hand to her head the man in the gray coat saw it too with a smile he turned toward her sighing mat tucked the useless knife into its scabbard you canвђt have her he said loudly promises one jerk broke the leather cord around his neck the silver foxhead dangled a foot below his fist it made a low hum as he whirled it in a double loop you canвђt bloody have her he started forward keeping the medallion spinning the first step was the hardest but he had a promise to keep the fellowвђs smile faded watching the flashing foxhead warily he backed away on his toes the same light that glittered on the whirling silver from the single window made a halo around him if mat could drive him that far maybe he could see whether a sixstory drop would do what a knife could not brand livid on his face the fellow backed away sometimes halfreaching as if to try grabbing past the medallion and suddenly he darted to one side into one of the rooms this one had a door that he pulled shut behind him mat heard the bar drop maybe he should have left it there but without thinking he raised a foot and slammed the heel of his boot against the center of the door dust leaped off the rough wood a second kick and rotten barcatches gave way along with a rusted hinge the door fell in hanging at a slanted angle the room was not entirely dark a little light reached it from the window at the end of the hall just one door away and a broken triangle of mirror leaning against the far wall spread a faint illumination that mirror let him see everything without going in aside from that and a piece of a chair there was nothing else to see the only openings were the doorway and a rathole beside the mirror but the man in the gray coat was gone mat elayne called faintly he hurried away from the room as much as toward her there was shouting somewhere below but nynaeve and the rest would have to take care of themselves for the moment elayne was sitting up working her jaw and wincing when he knelt beside her dust covered her dress her hat hung askew some of the plumes broken and her redgold hair looked as if she had been dragged by it he hit me so hard she said painfully i donвђt think anything is broken but her eyes latched on to his and if he had ever thought she looked at him as if he were a stranger he saw it for true now i saw what you did mat with him we might as well have been chickens in a box with a weasel channeling wouldnвђt touch him the flows melted the way they do with your glancing at the medallion still hanging from his fist she drew a breath that did interesting things to that oval cutout thank you mat i apologize for everything i ever did or thought she sounded as though she really meant it i keep building up tohtoward you she smiled ruefully but i am notgoing to let you beat me you are going to have to let me save you at least once to balance matters iвђll see what i can arrange he said dryly stuffing the medallion into a coat pocket toh beat her light the woman was definitely spending too much time with aviendha once he helped her to her feet she looked at the hallway at vanin with his bloodsmeared face and the women lying where they had fallen and she grimaced oh light she breathed oh blood and bloody flaming ashes despite the situation he gave a start it was not just that he had never expected to hear those words out of her mouth they seemed peculiar as if she knew the sounds but not the meanings somehow they made her sound younger than she looked shaking off his arm she discarded her hat just tossing it aside and hurried to kneel beside the nearest wise woman reanne and take her head in both hands the woman lay limp face down and arms stretched out as though she had been tripped up running toward the room everyone had been after toward her attacker not away this is beyond me elayne muttered where is nynaeve why didnвђt she come up with you mat nynaeve she shouted toward the stairs no need to shriek like a cat nynaeve growled appearing in the stairwell she was looking back over her shoulder down the stairs though you hold her tight you hear me she shrieked like a cat she carried her hat and shook it at whoever she was shouting at you let her get away too and iвђll box your ears till you hear bells next year she turned then and her eyes nearly bulged out of her head the light shine on us she breathed hurrying to bend over janira one touch and she straightened wincing painfully he could have told her the woman was dead nynaeve seemed to take death personally giving herself a shake she went on to the next tamarla and this time it appeared there was something she could heal it also appeared tamarlaвђs injuries were not simple because she knelt over her frowning what happened here mat she demanded without looking around at him her tone made him sigh he might have known she would decide it was his fault well mat what happened will you speak up man or do i have to вђ he never learned what threat she intended to offer lan had followed nynaeve out of the stairwell of course with sumeko right at his heels the stout wise woman took one look at the hall and immediately lifted her skirts and ran to reanne she did give elayne one worried glance before lowering herself to her knees and beginning to move her hands over reanne in an odd way that was what pulled nynaeve up short what are you doing she said sharply not halting what she was doing to tamarla she spared the roundfaced woman only short glances but they were as piercing as her voice where did you learn that sumeko gave a start but her hands did not stop forgive me aes sedai she said in a breathless disjointed rush i know iвђm not supposed to sheвђll die if i donвђt i know i wasnвђt supposed to keep trying to i just wanted to learn aes sedai please no no go on nynaeve said absently most of her attention was fixed on the woman under her hands but not all you seem to know a few things even i вђ that is to say you have a very interesting way with the flows i suspect youвђll find that a great many sisters want to learn from you half under her breath she added maybe now theyвђll leave me alone sumeko could not have heard that last but what she did hear dropped her chin to her considerable chest her hands barely paused though elayne nynaeve went on would you look for the bowl please i suspect that door is the one she nodded to the correct door standing open like half a dozen others that made mat blink until he saw two tiny clothwrapped bundles lying in front of it where the looters must have dropped them yes elayne muttered yes i can do that much at least halfraising a hand toward vanin still on his knees she let it fall with a sigh and strode through the doorway which almost immediately emitted a cloud of dust and the sound of coughing the morethanplump wise woman had not been the only one following nynaeve and lan ieine stalked out of the stairwell forcing the taraboner darkfriend in front of her by means of an arm twisted up into her back and a fist clutching the back of her neck ieineвђs jaw was set her mouth tight her face was half frightened certainty that she would be skinned alive for manhandling an aes sedai and half determination to hold on no matter what nynaeve had that effect on people sometimes the black sister was wideeyed with terror sagging so she surely would have fallen except for ieineвђs grip she must have been shielded certainly and with equal surety she probably would have chosen being skinned to whatever was going to happen to her tears began leaking from her eyes and her mouth sagged in silent sobs behind them came beslan who gave a sad sigh at the sight of nalesean and a sadder for the women and then harnan and three of the redarms fergin and gorderan and metwyn three who had been at the front of the building harnan and two of the others had bloody gashes in their coats but nynaeve must have healed them below they did not move as if they still had injuries they looked very subdued though what happened at the back mat asked quietly burn me if i know harnan replied we walked right into a knot of shoulder thumpers with knives in the dark there was one moved like a snake he shrugged touching the bloodstained hole in his coat absentmindedly one of them got a knife into me and the next i remember is opening my eyes with nynaeve sedai bending over me and mendair and the others dead as yesterdayвђs mutton mat nodded one who moved like a snake and got out of rooms like one too he looked around the hallway reanne and tamarla were on their feet вђ straightening their dresses of course вђ and vanin peering into the room where elayne was apparently trying out some more curses seemingly with no more success than earlier it was hard to tell because of the coughing nynaeve stood helping up sibella a scrawny yellowhaired woman and sumeko was still working on famelle with her palehoney hair and big brown eyes but he was never going to admire meloreвђs bosom again reanne knelt to straighten her limbs and close her eyes while tamarla performed the same service for janira two wise women dead and six of his redarms killed by a man the power would not touch iвђve found it elayne shouted excitedly she strode back out into the hall holding a wide round bundle of rotted cloth she would not let vanin take from her coated in gray from head to toe she looked as if she had lain down and rolled in the dust we have the bowl of the winds nynaeve in that case mat announced we are bloody well getting out of here now nobody argued oh nynaeve and elayne insisted on all the men making sacks out of their jackets for things they rooted out of the room вђ they even loaded the wise women down and themselves вђ and reanne had to go down and recruit men to carry their dead down the boat landing but nobody argued he doubted if the rahad had ever seen as odd a procession as made its way to the river or one that moved more quickly chapter dice promises to keep we are bloody well getting out of here now mat said again later and this time there was argument there had been argument for the past halfhour near enough outside the sun was past its noon peak the trade winds cut the heat a little stiff yellow curtains fastened over the tall windows bulged and snapped at gusts three hours back in the tarasin palace the dice still bouncing in his head and he wanted to kick something or somebody he tugged at the scarf tied around his neck it felt as though the rope that had given him the scar under that scarf was back and tightening slowly love of the light are you all blind or just deaf the room tylin had provided was large with green walls and high blue ceiling and no furnishings but gilded chairs and small tables set with pearlshell yet it was crowded even so it seemed so anyway tylin herself sat before one of the three marble fireplaces with her knees crossed watching him with those dark eagleвђs eyes and a small smile idly kicking her layered blue and yellow petticoats idly toying with the jeweled hilt of her curved knife he suspected elayne or nynaeve had spoken to her they were there too seated to either side of the queen somehow in clean dresses and apparently even bathed though they had only been out of his sight for minutes at a stretch since returning to the palace they almost matched tylin for regal dignity in their bright silks he was not sure who they wanted to impress with all that lace and elaborate embroidery they looked ready for a royal ball not a journey he himself was still in his muck with his dusty green coat hanging open and the silver foxhead caught in the neck of his half undone shirt knotting the leather cord had shortened it but he wanted the medallion touching his skin he was around women who could channel after all truth those three women could probably have crowded the room by themselves tylin could have done it by herself so far as he was concerned if nynaeve or elayne hadspoken to her it was a very good thing that he was going they three could have done it alone but this is preposterous merilille announced iвђve never heard of any shadowspawn called a gholam have any of you that was directed to adeleas and vandene sareitha and careane facing tylin the cooleyed aes sedai serenity of all five made a fair job of turning their highbacked armchairs into thrones he could not understand why nynaeve and elayne just sat like lumps coolly serene too but absolutely silent they knew they understood and for some reason merilille and that lot slathered their tongues with meekness for them now mat cauthon on the other hand was a hairyeared lout who needed to be kicked and from merilille on down they were all ready to do the kicking i saw the thing he snapped elayne saw the thing reanne and the wise women saw it ask any of them gathered at one end of the room reanne and the five surviving wise women shrank back like huddling hens afraid of actual questions all but sumeko anyway thumbs tucked behind her long red belt the round woman kept frowning at the aes sedai then shaking her head frowning then shaking her head nynaeve had had a considerable talk with her in the privacy of the cabin on the boat coming back and mat thought that had something to do with her newfound attitude he had caught mention of aes sedai more than once not that he had been trying to eavesdrop the rest seemed to be wondering whether they should offer to fetch tea only sumeko had even appeared to consider the offer of a chair sibella flapping bony arms in shock had nearly fainted no one denies the word of elayne aes sedai master cauthon said renaile din calon blue star in a cool deep voice even had the dignified woman in silks to match the redandyellow floor tiles not been named to him earlier the old memories meshed into his own would have identified her as windfinder to the mistress of the ships by the ten fat gold rings in her earlobes those in each ear connected by a golden chain and halfhidden by the narrow wings of white in her straight black hair the medallions clustered along the finer chain that ran to her nose ring would tell him what clan she came from among other things so would the tattoos on her slim dark hands what we question is the danger she continued we do not like leaving the water without good cause nearly twenty sea folk women stood gathered behind her chair a riot of colorful silks and earrings and medallions on chains for the most part the first odd thing he had noticed about them was their attitude toward the aes sedai they were perfectly respectful on the surface at any rate but he had never before seen anyone look at aes sedai smugly the second odd thing came from those other menвђs memories he did not know a great deal about the sea folk from them but enough every athaвђan miere man or woman began as the lowest deckhand whether they were destined one day to become the master of the blades or the mistress of the ships herself and every step of the way between the sea folk were sticklers for rank to make any king or aes sedai look a sloven the women behind renaile were a peculiar lot by any measure вђ windfinders to wavemistresses rubbing shoulders with windfinders from soarers by their medallions вђ but two wore bright blouses of plain wool above the dark oily breeches of deckhands each with a single thin ring in her left ear a second and third ring in the right indicated they were being trained as windfinders but with two more to earn not to mention the nose ring it would be a long while yet that either would find herself called to haul sail whenever the deckmaster needed her and find the deckmasterвђs flail across her rump if she did not move quickly enough those two did not belong in this gathering by any memory he had normally the windfinder to the mistress of the ships would not even have spoken to one of them very much as i said renaile merilille said icily condescending she had certainly noticed those smug glances that tone did not change as she shifted her attention to him do not grow petulant master cauthon we are willing to listen to reason if you have any mat gathered patience he hoped he could find enough maybe if he used both hands and both feet gholamwere created in the middle of the war of the power during the age of legends he began from the beginning almost from the beginning of what birgitte had told him he turned facing each group of women as he spoke burn him if he was going to let one bunch think they were more important or that he was bloody pleading with them especially since he was they were made to assassinate aes sedai no other reason to kill people who could channel the one power wonвђt help you the power wonвђt touch a gholam in fact they can sense the ability to channel if theyвђre within say fifty paces of you they can feel the power in you too you wonвђt know the gholamuntil itвђs too late they look just like anybody else on the outside inside gholamhave no bones they can squeeze themselves under a door and theyвђre strong enough to rip a door off steel hinges with one hand or rip out a throat light he should have let nalesean stay in bed suppressing a shiver he pressed on the women all of them watched him almost not appearing to blink he would not let them see him shiver there were only six gholammade вђ three male and three female at least thatвђs what they look like apparently even the forsaken were a little uneasy about them or maybe they just decided six was enough either way we know one is in ebou dar probably kept alive since the breaking in a stasisbox we donвђt know if any others were put into that box but one is more than enough whoever sent him вђ and it had to be one of the forsaken вђ knew to follow us across the river he had to have been sent after the bowl of the winds and by what he said to me to kill nynaeve or elayne maybe both he spared them a quick look soothing and sympathetic nobody could feel easy knowing that thing was after them in return he received a puzzled frown from elayne just the smallest wrinkling of her forehead and from nynaeve a slight wave of the hand an impatient wave to get on with it to continue he said shooting the pair of them a glare it was very hard not to sigh dealing with women whoever sent the gholamhas to know the bowl is here in the tarasin palace now if he or she sends the gholamhere some of you are going to die maybe a lot of you i canвђt protect all of you at once maybe heвђll get the bowl too and thatвђs on top of falion bhoda small chance sheвђs alone even with ispan a prisoner so that means we have the black ajah to worry about as well just in case the forsaken and gholamarenвђt enough for you reanne and the wise women drew themselves up even more indignantly than merilille and her friends at mention of the black ajah and the aes sedai stiffening and gathering skirts looked ready to stalk out in a huff press on that was all he could do now now do you see why you all have to leave the palace and take the bowl somewhere the gholamdoesnвђt know about somewhere the black ajah doesnвђt know do you see why it has to be done now renaileвђs sniff would have startled geese in the next room you merely repeat yourself master cauthon merilille sedai says she has never heard of this gholam elayne sedai says there was a strange man a creature but little else what is this stasisbox you have not explained that how do you know what you claim to know why should we go any further from the water than we are on the word of a man who creates fables from air mat looked to nynaeve and elayne though with little hope if they would only open their mouths this could been have been finished long since but they gazed back at him practicing expressionless aes sedai masks till their jaws must be creaking he could not understand their silence a barebones account of events in the rahad had been all they gave and he was willing to bet they would not have mentioned the black ajah at all had there been any other way to explain showing up in the palace with an aes sedai bound and shielded ispan was being held in another part of the palace her presence known only to a handful nynaeve had forced some concoction down her throat a foulsmelling mix of herbs that bulged the womanвђs eyes going down and had her giggling and stumbling in short order and the rest of the knitting circle occupied the room with her for guards unwilling guards but very assiduous nynaeve had made it extremely clear that should they let ispan get away they had best start running before she laid hands on them again he very carefully did not look toward birgitte standing beside the door with aviendha the aiel woman wore an ebou dari dress not the plain wool she had returned in but a silvergray silk riding dress that jarred with her plainsheathed hornhandled belt knife birgitte had been quick to shed her own dress for her usual short coat and wide trousers these dark blue and dark green a quiver already hung at her hip she was the source of everything he knew about gholamвђ and stasisboxes вђ except what his eyes had seen in the rahad and he would not have revealed that on a hot grill i read a book once that talked about вђ he began and renaile cut him off a book she sneered i will not abandon the salt for a book aes sedai do not know suddenly it struck mat that he was the only man present lan had gone off at nynaeveвђs command gone as tamely as beslan had at his motherвђs thom and juilin were packing to leave had probably finished packing by now if there was any use to it if they ever did leave the only man surrounded by a wall of women who apparently intended to let him beat his head against that wall till his brains were scrambled it made no sense none they looked at him waiting nynaeve in yellowslashed lacetrimmed blue had pulled her braid over her shoulder so it hung down between her breasts but that heavy gold ring вђ lanвђs ring he had learned вђ was carefully positioned to show anyway her face was smooth and her hands rested in her lap yet sometimes her fingers twitched elayne in green ebou dari silk that made nynaeve seem covered up despite the smoky lace collar under her chin gazed back at him with eyes like cool pools of deep blue water her hands lay in her lap too but now and again she would begin to trace the threadofgold embroidery that covered her skirts then immediately stop why did they not say something were they trying to get back at him was it just a case of mat wants to be in charge so much let him see how well he can do without us he might have believed it of nynaeve any time but this anyway but not of elayne not anymore so why reanne and the wise women did not huddle away from him as they did from the aes sedai but their manner toward him had changed tamarla gave him a decently respectful nod honeyhaired famelle went so far as a friendly smile strangely reanne blushed a pale stain but they did not count as opposition really the six women had not said a dozen unprompted words between them since entering this room every one would jump if nynaeve or elayne snapped her fingers and keep jumping until told to stop he turned to the rest of the aes sedai faces infinitely calm infinitely patient except merililleвђs eyes flickered past him toward nynaeve and elayne for one instant sareitha began slowly smoothing her skirts under his gaze seemingly unaware of doing so a dark suspicion bloomed in his mind hands moving on skirts reanneвђs blush birgitteвђs ready quiver a murky suspicion he did not really know of what just that he had been going about this the wrong way he gave nynaeve a stern look and elayne a sterner butter would not have melted on their bloody tongues slowly he walked toward the sea folk he just walked but he heard someone with merilille sniff and sareitha muttered such insolence well he was about to show them insolence if nynaeve and elayne did not like it they should have taken him into their confidence light but he hated being used especially when he did not know how or why stopping in front of renaileвђs chair he studied the dark faces of the athaвђan miere women behind it before looking down to her she frowned stroking a knife set with moonstones thrust behind her sash she was a handsome woman rather than pretty somewhere in her middle years and under different circumstances he might have enjoyed looking at her eyes they were large black pools a man could spend an evening just gazing into under different circumstances somehow the sea folk were the fly in the cream pitcher and he had not a clue how to pluck it out he managed to keep his irritation under control barely what to bloody do you can all channel i understand he said quietly but that doesnвђt mean much to me as well be straight from the start you can ask adeleas or vandene how much i care whether a woman can channel renaile looked past him toward tylin but it was not to the queen she spoke nynaeve sedaiвђ she said dryly i believe there was no mention in your bargain of my having to listen to this young oakum picker i вђ i donвђt bloody care about your bargains with anybody else you daughter of the sands mat snapped so his irritation was not that well under control a man could only take so much gasps rose among the women behind her something over a thousand years ago a sea folk woman had called an essenian soldier a son of the sands just before trying to plant a blade in his ribs the memory lay tucked inside mat cauthonвђs head now it was not the worst insult among the athaвђan miere but it came close renaileвђs face gorged with blood hissing eyes bulging in fury she leaped to her feet that moonstonestudded dagger flashing in her fist mat snatched it out of her hand before the blade could reach his chest and shoved her back into her chair he did have quick hands he could still hold on to his temper too no matter how many women thought they could dance him for a puppet he could вђ you listen to me you bilge stone all right maybe he could not hold it nynaeve and elayne need you or iвђd leave you for the gholamto crack your bones and the black ajah to pick over whatвђs left well as far as youвђre concerned iвђm the master of the blades and my blades are bare what that meant exactly he had no idea except for having once heard when the blades are bare even the mistress of the ships bows to the master of the blades this is the bargain between you and me you go where nynaeve and elayne want and in return i wonвђt tie the lot of you across horses like packsaddles and haul you there that was no way to go on not with the windfinder to the mistress of the ships not with a bilgeboy off a brokenbacked darter for that matter renaile quivered with the effort of not going for him with her bare hands and never mind her dagger in his hand it is agreed under the light she growled her eyes nearly started out of her head her mouth worked confusion and disbelief suddenly chasing one another across her face this time the gasps sounded as if the wind had ripped the curtains down it is agreed mat said quickly and touching fingers to his lips he pressed them to hers after a moment she did the same fingers trembling against his mouth he held out the dagger and she stared dully at it before taking it from him the blade went back into its jeweled sheath it was not polite to kill someone you had sealed a bargain with at least not until the terms were fulfilled murmurs began among the women behind her chair rising and renaile stirred herself to clap her hands once that silenced windfinders to wavemistresses as quickly as the two deckhands in training i think i have just made a bargain with a taвђveren she said in that cool deep voice the woman could teach aes sedai how to pull themselves together quickly but one day master cauthon if it pleases the light i think you will walk a rope for me he did not know what that meant except that she made it sound unpleasant he made his best leg all things are possible if it pleases the light he murmured courtesy paid after all but her smile was disturbingly hopeful when he turned back to the rest of the room you would have thought he had horns and wings for the stares is there any further argument he asked in a wry tone and did not wait for answers i thought not in that case i suggest you pick out some spot well away from here and we can be on our way as soon as you bundle up your belongings they made a show of discussion elayne mentioned caemlyn sounding at least halfserious and careane suggested several remote villages in the black hills all easily reached by gateway light anywhere was easily reached by gateway vandene spoke of arafel and aviendha suggested rhuidean in the aiel waste with the sea folk women growing glummer the farther from the sea were the places named all a show to mat at least that was clear by nynaeveвђs impatient fiddling with her braid despite the suggestions coming hot and fast if i may speak aes sedai reanne said timidly at last she even raised her hand the kin maintain a farm on the other side of the river a few miles north everyone knows it is a retreat for women who need contemplation and quiet but no one connects it to us the buildings are large and quite comfortable if thereвђs any need to stay long and вђ yes nynaeve broke in yes i think that sounds just the thing what do you say elayne i think it sounds wonderful nynaeve i know renaile will appreciate staying close to the sea the other five sisters practically piled on top of her saying how agreeable it sounded how superior to any other suggestion mat rolled his eyes to the heavens tylin was a study in not seeing what lay under her nose but renaile snapped at it like a trout taking a lacewing which was the point of course for some reason she was not to know that nynaeve and elayne had had everything arranged beforehand she led the rest of the sea folk women out to gather whatever belongings they had brought before nynaeve and elayne could change their minds those two would have followed merilille and the other aes sedai but he crooked a finger at them they exchanged glances вђ he would have had to talk an hour to say as much as passed in those looks вђ then somewhat to his surprise came to him aviendha and birgitte watched from the door tylin from her chair i am very sorry to have used you elayne said before he could get a word out her smile flashed that dimple at him we did have reasons mat you must believe that which you do not need to know nynaeve put in firmly flipping her braid back over her shoulder with a practiced toss of her head that made the gold ring bounce on her bosom lan must be insane i must say i never expected you to do what you did whatever in the world made you think of trying to bullythem you could have ruined everything whatвђs life if you donвђt take a chance now and then he said blithely as well by him if they thought it was planned instead of temper but they had used him again without telling him and he wanted a bit back for that next time you have to make a bargain with the sea folk let me make it for you maybe that way it wonвђt turn out as badly as the last one spots of color blooming in nynaeveвђs cheeks told him he had hit the mark squarely not bad shooting blindfolded elayne though just murmured a most observantsubject in tones of rueful amusement being in her good books might turn out less comfortable than being in her bad they swept toward the door without letting him say more well he had not really thought they would explain anything both were aes sedai to the bone a man learned to live with what he had to tylin had all but slipped from his mind but he had not from hers she caught him up before he took two steps nynaeve and elayne paused at the door with aviendha and birgitte watching so they saw when tylin pinched his bottom some things nobody could learn to live with elayne put on a face of commiseration nynaeve of glowering disapproval aviendha fought laughter none too successfully while birgitte wore her grin openly they allbloody knew nynaeve thinks you are a little boy needing protection tylin breathed up at him i know you are a grown man her smoky chuckle made that the dirtiest comment he had ever heard the four women by the door got to watch his face turn beet red i will miss you pigeon what you did with renaile was magnificent i do so admire masterful men iвђll miss you too he muttered to his shock that was simple truth he was leaving ebou dar just in time but if we meet again iвђll do the chasing she chortled at him and those dark eagleвђs eyes almost glowed i admire masterful men duckling but not when they try being masterful with me seizing his ears she pulled his head down where she could kiss him he never saw nynaeve and the others go and he walked out on unsteady legs tucking his shirt back in he had to return to fetch his spear from the corner and his hat the woman had no shame not a scrap of it he found thom and juilin coming out of tylinвђs apartments followed by nerim and lopin naleseanвђs stout man who each lugged a large wicker pannier made for a packsaddle loaded with his belongings he realized juilin carried matвђs unstrung bow and had his quiver slung on one shoulder well she had said she was moving him i found this on your pillow thom said tossing him the ring he had bought what seemed a year ago a parting gift it seems there were loversknots and some other flowers strewn over bothpillows mat jammed the ring onto his finger itвђs mine burn you i paid for it myself the old gleeman knuckled his mustaches and coughed in a failed effort to stifle a sudden wide grin juilin snatched off that ridiculous taraboner hat and became engrossed in studying the inside of it blood and flaming вђ mat drew a deep breath i hope you two spared a moment for your own belongings he said levelly because as soon as i grab olver weвђre on our way even if we happen to leave a moldy harp or a rusty swordbreaker behind juilin tugged at the corner of his eye with one finger whatever that was supposed to mean but thom actually frowned insults to thomвђs flute or his harp were insults to himself my lord lopin said mournfully he was a dark balding man rounder than sumeko and his black tairen commonerвђs coat tight to the waist then flaring like juilinвђs fit very tightly indeed normally almost as solemn as nerim now he had reddened eyes as though he had been weeping my lord is there any chance i might remain to see lord nalesean buried he was a good master mat hated saying no anybody left behind might be left for a long time lopin he said gently listen iвђll need someone to help look after olver nerim has his hands full with me for that matter nerim will go back to talmanes you know if youвђd like i will take you on myself he had grown used to having a manservant and these were hard times for a man hunting work i would like that very much my lord the fellow said lugubriously young olver reminds me much of my youngest sisterвђs son only when they entered matвђs former rooms the lady riselle was there much more decently clothed than when he had last seen her and quite alone why should i have kept him tied to me she said that truly marvelous bosom heaving with emotion as she planted her fists on her hips the queenвђs duckling it seemed was not supposed to take a snappish tone with the queenвђs attendants clip a boyвђs wings too far and he will never grow to a proper man he read his pages aloud sitting on my knee вђ he might have read all day had i allowed it вђ and did his numbers so i let him go why are you in such a bother he promised to return by sunset and he seems to set a great store by his promises propping the ashandareiin its old corner mat told the other men to drop their burdens and go find vanin and the remaining redarms then he left riselleвђs spectacular bosom and ran all the way to the rooms nynaeve and the other women shared they were all there in the sitting room and so was lan with his warderвђs cloak already draped down his back and saddlebags on his shoulders his saddlebags and nynaeveвђs it seemed a good many bundles of dresses and notsosmall chests stood about the floor mat wondered if they would make lan carry those too of course you have to go find him mat cauthon nynaeve said do you think we would just abandon the child to hear her you would have thought that was exactly what hehad intended suddenly he was deluged with offers of help not just nynaeve and elayne proposing to put off going to the farm but lan and birgitte and aviendha offering to join the search lan was stone cold about it grim as ever but birgitte and aviendha my heart would break if anything happened to that boy birgitte said and aviendha added just as warmly i have always said you do not care for him properly mat ground his teeth in the streets of the city olver might well elude eight men until he appeared back at the palace at sunset he did keep his promises but small chance he would give up one moment of freedom he did not have to more eyes would mean a quicker search especially if all of the wise women were brought into it for the space of three heartbeats he hesitated he had his own promises to keep though he was wise enough not to put it that way the bowl is too important he told them that gholamis still out there and maybe moghedien and the black ajah for sure the dice thundered in his head aviendha would not appreciate being lumped in with nynaeve and elayne but he did not care right then he addressed lan and birgitte keep them safe until i can reach you keep all of them safe startlingly aviendha said we will i promise she fingered the hilt of her knife apparently she did not understand she was one of those to be kept safe nynaeve and elayne did nynaeveвђs sudden glare tried to bore a hole through his skull he expected her to yank on her braid but strangely her hand only fluttered toward it before being put firmly to her side elayne contented herself with raising her chin those big blue eyes frosty no dimple here lan and birgitte understood too nynaeve is my life lan said simply putting a hand on her shoulder the odd thing was she suddenly looked very sad and then just as suddenly her jaw set as though she was preparing to walk through a stone wall and make a large hole birgitte gave elayne a fond look but it was to mat she spoke i will she said honorвђs truth mat tugged at his coat uncomfortably he still was not sure how much he had told her while drunk light but the woman could soak it up like dry sand even so he gave the proper response for a barashandan lord accepting her pledge the honor of blood the truth of blood birgitte nodded and from the startled looks he received from nynaeve and elayne she still kept his secrets close light if any aes sedai ever found out about those memories they might as well know he had blown the horn as well foxhead or no foxhead they would stretch him out till they dug out every last why and how as he was turning to go nynaeve caught his sleeve remember the storm mat itвђs going to break soon i know it you take care of yourself mat cauthon do you hear me tylin has directions for the farm when you get back with olver nodding he made his escape the dice in his head like echoes of his running boots was it during the search that he was supposed to take care of himself or while getting the directions from tylin nynaeve and her listening to the wind did she think a little rain was going to melt him come to think once they used the bowl of the winds it would rain again it seemed years since rain last fell something tugged at his thoughts something about the weather and elayne which made no sense but he shrugged it off one thing at a time and the one thing right now was olver the men were all waiting in the redarmsвђ long room near the stables everyone on their feet except vanin who lay sprawled on one of the beds with his fingers laced over his belly vanin said a man had to take rest when he could he swung his boots over and sat up when mat entered though he cared about olver as much as any of the others mat was just afraid the man was going to start teaching him how to steal horses and poach pheasants seven sets of eyes focused on mat intently riselle said olverвђs wearing his red coat he told them he gives them away sometimes but any urchin you see in a good red coat probably knows where olver last was everybody goes in a different direction make loops out from the mol hara and try to be back after about an hour wait till everybody is back before you go out again that way if somebody finds him the rest of us wonвђt still be looking tomorrow does everybody understand they nodded sometimes it amazed him lanky thom with his white hair and mustaches who had been a queenвђs lover once and more willingly than himself not to mention more than a lover if you believed half he said squarejawed harnan with that tattoo on his cheek and more elsewhere who had been a soldier all his life juilin with his bamboo staff and his swordbreaker on his hip who thought himself as good as any lord even if the idea of carrying a sword himself still made him uneasy and fat vanin who made juilin look a bootlicker by comparison skinny fergin and gorderan nearly as wide in the shoulders as perrin and metwyn whose pale cairhienin face still looked like a boyвђs despite being years older than mat some of them followed mat cauthon because they thought he was lucky because his luck might keep them alive when the swords were out and some for reasons he was not really sure of but they followed not even thom had ever more than protested an order of his maybe renaile had been more than luck maybe his being taвђverendid more than dump him in themiddle of trouble suddenly he felt responsible for these men it was an uncomfortable feeling mat cauthon and responsibility did not go together it was unnatural take care of yourselves and look sharp he said you know whatвђs out there thereвђs a storm coming now why had he said that move weвђre wasting light the wind still blew strongly sweeping dust across the mol hara square with its statue of a longdead queen posing above the fountain but there was no other sign of a storm nariene had been noted for her honesty but not enough to have been depicted completely barechested the afternoon sun burned high in a sky without a cloud but people rushed through the square as quickly as they had in the morning cool that was gone wind or no down here on the ground the paving stones seemed a griddle under his boots glaring across the square at the wandering woman mat headed toward the river olver had not gone off with the street urchins half as often while they were staying at the inn he had been too content ogling the serving girls and setalle ananвђs daughters so much for the dice telling him he had to move into the palace anything he had done since leaving вђ anything he wanted to do he amended thinking of tylin and her eyes and her hands вђ any of it could have been done just as well from there those dice spun now and he wished they would just go away he tried to move quickly dodging impatiently around trundling carts and wagons cursing at lacquered sedan chairs and coaches that nearly ran him down eyes darting in search of a red coat close to the ground but the bustle in the streets slowed him to a meander which was just as well in truth no point dashing by the boy without seeing him wishing he had brought pips out of the palace stables he frowned at the people streaming past a man on horseback could have moved no faster in the throng but up in the saddle he could have seen farther then again asking questions from a saddle would have been awkward not many folk actually rode inside the city and some people had a tendency to shy away from anyone on a horse always the same question the first time he asked was at a bridge just below the mol hara of a fellow selling honeybaked apples from a tray hanging from a strap around his neck have you seen a boy about so high in a red coat olver liked sweets boy my lord the fellow said sucking his few remaining teeth seen a thousand boys donвђt remember no coat though would my lord like one apple or two he scooped up two with bony fingers and pushed them at mat the way they gave under his fingers they were softer than any baking could account for did my lord hear about the riot no mat said sourly and pushed on at the other end of the bridge he stopped a plump woman with a tray of ribbons ribbons held no fascination for olver but her red petticoats flashed beneath a skirt sewn up nearly to her left hip and the cut of her bodice revealed rounded cleavage to equal riselleвђs have you seen a boy he heard about the riot from her too and from half the people he asked that rumor he suspected had begun with events at a certain house in the rahad that very morning a wagon driver with her long whip coiled around her neck even told him the riot had been across the river once she allowed as how she never noticed boys unless they ran under her mules a squarefaced man who sold honeycomb вђ incredibly drylooking honeycomb вђ said the riot had been down near the light tower at the end of the bay road on the eastern side of the mouth of the bay which was about as likely a place for rioting as the middle of the bay itself there were always a thousand rumors in any city if you listened and he was forced to listen to snatches of all of them it seemed one of the most remarkably pretty women he had ever seen standing outside a tavern вђ maylin was a serving girl at the old sheep but her only task seemed to be standing outside to attract customers which she certainly did вђ told him there had been a battle that morning in the cordese hills west of the city she thought or maybe in the rhannon hills across the bay or maybe remarkably pretty maylin but not very bright olver might have watched her for hours so long as she never opened her mouth but she could not remember seeing any boy in a what color coat had he said again he heard about riots and battles he heard about enough strange things seen in the sky or the hills to populate the blight he heard that the dragon reborn was about to descend on the city with thousands of men who could channel that the aiel were coming an army of aes sedai вђ no it was an army of whitecloaks pedron niall was dead and the children intended to avenge him though why in ebou dar was not exactly clear you might have thought the city would be hipdeep in panic with all the tales floating around but the fact was even those who told a tale usually only halfbelieved it so he heard all sorts of nonsense but not a word about any boy in a red coat a few streets from the river he began hearing thunder great hollow booms that seemed to roll in from the sea people looked up curiously at the cloudless sky scratched their heads and went on about their business so did he questioning every seller of sweets or fruit he saw and every pretty woman afoot all to no avail reaching the long stone quay that ran the whole length of the river side of the city he paused studying the gray docks stretching out into the river and the ships tied to them the wind blew strong heaving vessels at their mooring lines grinding them against the stone docks despite the bags stuffed with wool hung down between for fenders unlike horses ships did not interest olver except as a way to go from here to there and ships were menвђs business in ebou dar even if the lading they carried often was not women on these docks would either be merchants keeping an eye on their goods or hardarmed members of the cargoloaderвђs guild and there would be no sweetsellers here about to turn away he realized almost no one was moving the docks usually bustled yet on every ship he could see crewmen lined the rails and had climbed into the rigging to stare toward the bay barrels and crates stood abandoned while shirtless men and wiry women in green leather vests crowded together at the ends of the docks to peer between the ships south toward the thunder down that way black smoke rose in thick towering columns slanting sharply north on the wind hesitating only a moment he trotted out along the nearest dock at first ships tied to the long fingers of stone to the south blocked his view of anything except the smoke because of the way the shoreline lay though each dock stuck out farther than the next down once he pushed into the murmuring crowd at the end the broad river made an open path of choppy green water to the wavetossed bay at least two dozen ships were burning out on the wide expanse of the bay maybe more engulfed in flame from end to end a number of others had already settled only a bow or stern still above water and that sliding under even as he looked the bow of a broad twomasted ship flying a large banner of red and blue and gold the banner of altara suddenly flew apart with a roar a boom like thunder and fastthickening tendrils of smoke wafted away on the wind as the vessel began settling by the head hundreds of vessels were in motion every craft in the bay threemasted sea folk rakers and skimmers and twomasted soarers coastal ships with their triangular sails river ships under sail or sweep some fleeing upriver most trying to beat out to sea scores of other ships swanned into the bay before the wind great bluffbowed vessels as tall as any of the rakers crashing through the rolling waves throwing aside spray his breath caught as he suddenly made out square ribbed sails blood and bloody ashes he muttered in shock itвђs the flaming seanchan who demanded a sternfaced woman crowded next to him a dark blue woolen dress of fine cut marked her a merchant as much as did the leather folder she carried for her bills of lading or the guild pin over one breast a silver quill pen itвђs the aes sedai she announced in tones of conviction i know channeling when i see it the children of the light will do for them just as soon as they arrive youвђll see a lanky grayhaired woman in a grimy green vest twisted around to confront her fingering the wooden hilt of her dagger hold your tongue about aes sedai you flaming pennygrubber or iвђll peel you and stuff a whitecloak down your bleeding gullet mat left them waving their arms and shouting at one another and pushed clear of the crowd running for the quay already he could see three вђ no four вђ huge creatures circling over the city to the south on great pinions like those of a bat figures clung to the creaturesвђ backs apparently in some sort of saddles another flying creature appeared and more below them flame suddenly fountained above the rooftops with a roar people ran now buffeting mat as he struggled through the streets olver he shouted hoping to be heard above other shouts from every side and the screams olver abruptly everybody seemed to be heading the other way battering past him stubbornly he forced on against the tide and came to a street where what all those folk fled from was made plain a seanchan column rushed by a hundred or more men in helmets like insectsвђ heads and armor of overlapping plates all riding animals like cats the size of horses but covered in bronze scales rather than fur leaning forward in their saddles bluestreamered lances slanted they galloped toward the mol hara without looking to either side though gallop was not quite the word for the way those creatures moved the speed was right but they flowed it was time to be gone past time as soon as he found вђ as the end of column went by a flash of red waist high caught his eye among the crowd in the street beyond the intersection olver he darted across almost on the heels of the last scaled creature pushing into the crowd in time to see a wideeyed woman snatch up a little girl in a red dress and ran with the child clutched to her bosom wildly mat pressed ahead shouldering people aside when they bumped into him bumping into more than a few himself olver olver twice more he saw a column of fire rise briefly above the rooftops and smoke drifted to the sky in a dozen places several times he heard those booming roars much closer than the bay now inside the city he was sure more than once the ground quivered beneath his boots and then the street was clearing again people fleeing in every direction down alleys and into houses and shops for seanchan on horses were coming not all were armored men near the head of that small thicket of lances rode a dark woman in a blue dress mat knew the large red panels on her skirts and bosom were worked with silver lightning a silver leash gleaming in the sun ran from her left wrist to the neck of a woman in gray a damane who trotted beside the sulвђdamвђshorse like a pet dog he had seen more of seanchan at falme than he wanted to but unconsciously he paused at the mouth of an alleyway watching the roars and fires had showed that somebody in the city was trying to fight back at least and now he was going to see such an attempt the seanchan were not the only reason everyone else had gotten out of sight at the other end of the street a good hundred mounted men swung longpointed lances down they wore baggy white breeches and green coats and the gold cords on the officerвђs helmet glittered with a collective shout a hundred or more of tylinвђs soldiers hurled themselves toward the cityвђs attackers they outnumbered the seanchan in front of them by at least two to one bloody fools mat muttered not like that that sulвђdamwill вђ the only movement among the seanchan was the woman in the lightningmarked dress raising her hand to point as one might launch a hawk or send off a hound the goldenhaired woman at the other end of the silvery leash took a small step forward the foxhead medallion cooled against his chest underneath the head of the ebou dari charge the street suddenly erupted paving stones and men and horses flying into the air with a deafening roar the concussion knocked mat flat on his back or maybe it was the way the ground seemed to leap from under his feet he pulled himself up in time to see the front of an inn across the way suddenly collapse into the street in a cloud of dust exposing the rooms within men and horses lay everywhere pieces of men and horses those still alive thrashing around a hole in the ground half as wide as the street screams from the wounded filled the air fewer than half the ebou dari staggered to then feet dazed and stumbling some seized up the reins of horses as wobblylegged as they heaving themselves into saddles kicking the animals into some semblance of a run others just ran afoot all away from the seanchan steel they could face but not this running mat realized seemed a particularly fine idea right then a glance back down the alley showed dust and rubble piled at least a story high he darted down the street ahead of the fleeing ebou dari keeping as close to the walls as possible hoping none of the seanchan would think he was one of tylinвђs soldiers he should never have worn a green coat the sulвђdamapparently was not satisfied the foxhead went cool again and from behind another roar hammered him to the pavement pavement that jumped up to meet him through the ringing in his ears he heard masonry groan above him the whiteplastered brick wall began leaning outward what happened to my bloody luck he shouted he had time for that and just time to realize as brick and timbers crashed down on him that the dice in his head had just stopped dead chapter spears and shield spears mountains rose all around galina casban little more than large hills behind but snowcapped peaks ahead and higher peaks beyond those yet she really saw none of them the stones of the slope bruised her bare feet she panted lungs laboring already the sun baked overhead as it had for seemingly endless days burning the sweat out of her in rivers anything other than putting one foot in front of the other seemed beyond her strange that with all the sweat coming out of her she could not find any moisture in her mouth she had been aes sedai fewer than ninety years her long black hair untouched as yet by gray but for nearly twenty of those she had been head of the red ajah вђ called the highest by other red sisters in private considered by other reds equal to the amyrlin seat вђ and for all but five of the years she had worn the shawl she had been of the black ajah in truth not to the exclusion of her duties as a red but superior to them her place on the supreme council of the black ajah was next to that of alviarin herself and she was one of only three who knew the name of the woman who led their hooded meetings she could speak any name in those meetings вђ a kingвђs вђ and know that name belonged to the dead it had happened with a king and with a queen she had helped to break two amyrlins twice helped turn the most powerful woman in the world into a squealing wretch eager to tell all she knew had helped make it seem that one of those had died in her sleep and had seen the other deposed and stilled such things were a duty like the need to exterminate men with the ability to channel not actions she took pleasure in beyond that of tasks well done but she had enjoyed leading the circle that stilled siuan sanche surely all those things meant that galina casban was herself among the mightiest of the world among the most powerful surely they did they must her legs wavered like springs that had lost their tempering and she fell heavily unable to catch herself with arms and elbows tightly bound behind her the oncewhite silk shift the only garment left to her tore again as she slid on the loose rocks scraping her welts a tree stopped her face pressed against the ground she began to sob how she moaned in a thick voice how can this happen to me after a time she realized that she had not been pulled to her feet no matter how often she fell she had never before been allowed a momentвђs respite blinking away tears she raised her head aiel women covered the mountainside several hundred of them scattered among the barren trees with their spears the veils they could raise in an instant hanging down their chests galina wanted to laugh maidens they called these monstrous women maidens she wished she could laugh at least there were no men present a small mercy men made her skin crawl and if one could see her now less than halfclothed anxiously her eyes sought for therava but most of the seventy or so wise ones stood together looking at something farther up the slope blocking her view there seemed to be a murmur of voices from the front of them maybe the wise ones were conferring about something wise ones they had been brutally efficient in teaching her the correct names never just aiel woman and never wilder they could smell contempt however she hid it of course you did not have to try hiding what had been seared out of you most of the wise ones were looking away but not all the glow of saidarsurrounded a young pretty redhaired woman with a delicate mouth who watched galina with large intent blue eyes perhaps as a sign of their own disdain they had chosen the weakest of their number to shield her this morning micara was not truly weak in the power вђ none of them were that вђ but even smarting from shoulders to knees as she was galina could have broken micaraвђs shield with little effort a muscle in her cheek spasmed uncontrollably it always did when she thought of another escape attempt the first had been bad enough the second shuddering she fought not to sob again she would not make the attempt again until she was sure of complete success very sure absolutely sure the mass of wise ones parted turning to follow therava with their eyes as the hawkfaced woman strode toward galina suddenly panting once more with apprehension galina tried to struggle to her feet hands bound and muscles watery she had only reached her knees when therava bent over her necklaces of ivory and gold clattering softly seizing a handful of galinaвђs hair therava forced her head back sharply taller than most men the woman did that even when they were standing craning galinaвђs neck painfully to make her look up into the wise oneвђs face therava was somewhat stronger in the power than she which relatively few women were but that was not what made galina tremble cold deep blue eyes stabbed into her own held her more tightly than theravaвђs rough hand they seemed to strip her soul naked as easily as the wise one handled her she had not begged yet not when they made her walk all day with hardly a drop of water not when they forced her to keep up as they ran for hours not even when their switches made her howl theravaвђs cruel hard face staring down at her impassively made her want to beg sometimes she woke at night stretched out tight between the four stakes where they bound her woke whimpering from dreams that her whole life would be lived under theravaвђs hands she is collapsing already the wise one said in a voice like stone water her and bring her turning away she adjusted her shawl galina casban forgotten until there was need to recall her to therava galina casban was less important than a stray dog galina did not try to rise she had been watered often enough by now it was the only way they let her drink aching for moisture she did not resist when a blocky maiden took her by the hair as therava had and pulled her head back she just opened her mouth as far as she could another maiden with a puckered scar slanting across nose and cheek tilted a waterskin and slowly poured a trickle into galinaвђs waiting mouth the water was flat and warm it was delicious she swallowed convulsively awkwardly holding her jaws wide almost as much as water to drink she wanted to move her face under that thin stream to let it run over her cheeks and forehead instead she kept her head very steady so that every drop went down her throat spilling water was cause for another beating they had thrashed her in sight of a creek six paces wide for spilling a mouthful over her chin when the waterskin was finally taken away the blocky maiden hauled her to her feet by her bound elbows galina groaned the wise ones were gathering their skirts over their arms exposing their legs well above soft kneehigh boots they could not be going to run not again not in these mountains the wise ones loped forward as easily as if on level ground an unseen maiden cut galina across the back of her thighs with a switch and she stumbled to a semblance of a run halfdragged by the blocky maiden the switch slashed her legs whenever they faltered if this run continued the rest of the day they would take turns one maiden wielding the stick and another dragging laboring up slopes and nearly sliding down galina ran a tawny mountain cat striped in shades of brown and heavier than a man snarled at them from a rocky ledge above a female lacking the tufts on her ears and the wide cheeks galina wanted to shout at her to flee to run before therava caught her the aiel ran on by the snarling animal unconcerned and galina wept with jealousy for the catвђs freedom she would be rescued eventually of course she knew that the tower would not allow a sister to remain in captivity elaida would not allow a red to be held surely alviarin would send rescue someone would anyone to save her from these monsters especially from therava she would promise anything for that deliverance she would even keep those promises she had been broken free of the three oaths on joining the black ajah replacing them with a new trinity but at that moment she truly believed she would keep her word if it brought rescue any promise to anyone who would free her even a man by the time low tents appeared their dark colors fading into the forested mountainsides as well as the cat had galina had two maidens supporting her pulling her along shouts rose from every side glad cries of greeting but galina was dragged on behind the wise ones deeper into the camp still running stumbling without warning the hands left her arms she pitched forward on her face and lay there with her nose in the dirt and dead leaves sucking air through her gaping mouth she coughed on a piece of leaf but she was too weak to turn her head the blood pounded her ears but voices came to her and slowly began to make sense took your time therava a familiarsounding womanвђs voice said nine days we have been back long since nine days galina shook her head scrubbing her face on the ground since the aiel had shot her horse from under her memory blended all the days into a melange of thirst and running and being beaten but surely it had been longer ago than nine days weeks certainly a month or more bring her in the familiar voice said impatiently hands pulled her up shoved her forward bending her to go under the edge of a large tent with the sides raised all around she was thrown down on layered carpets the edge of a redandblue tairen maze overlapping gaudy flowers beneath her nose with difficulty she raised her head at first she saw nothing but sevanna seated on a large yellowtasseled cushion in front of her sevanna with her hair like finespun gold her clear emerald eyes treacherous sevanna who had given her word to distract attention by raiding into cairhien then broken her pledge by trying to free alвђthor sevanna who at the least might take her from theravaвђs clutches she struggled up onto her knees and for the first time realized there were others in the tent therava sat on a cushion to sevannaвђs right at the head of a curving line of wise ones fourteen women who could channel in all though micara who still held the shield on her stood at the foot of the line rather than sitting half of them had been among the wise ones who captured her with such scornful ease she would never again be so careless about wise ones never again short palefaced men and women in white robes moved behind the wise ones wordlessly offering trays of gold or silver with small cups and more did the same on the other side of the tent where a grayhaired woman in an aiel coat and breeches of brown and gray sat to sevannaвђs left at the head of a line of twelve stonefaced aielmen men and she wore nothing but her shift ripped and gaping in a number of places galina clamped her teeth shut to stifle a scream she forced her back stiff to keep from trying to burrow into the rugs arid hide from those cold male eyes it seems that aes sedai can lie sevanna said and the blood drained from galinaвђs face the woman could not know she could not you made pledges galina casban and broke them did you think you could murder a wise one and then run beyond the reach of our spears for a moment relief froze galinaвђs tongue sevanna did notknow about the black ajah had she not abandoned the light long ago she would have thanked the light relief stilled her tongue and a tiny spark of indignation they attackedaes sedai and were angry when some of them died a tiny spark was all she could manage after all what was sevannaвђs twisting facts alongside days of beatings and theravaвђs eyes a pained croaking laugh bubbled up at the absurdity of it her throat was so dry be thankful some of you still live she managed past her laughter even now it is not too late to rectify your mistakes sevanna with an effort she swallowed rueful mirth before it turned to tears just before when i return to the white tower i will remember those who assist me even now she would have added and those who do otherwise but theravaвђs unwavering stare set fear fluttering in her middle for all she knew therava still might be allowed to do whatever she wished there had to be some way to induce sevanna to take charge of her that tasted bitter yet anything was better than therava sevanna was ambitious and greedy in the midst of frowning at galina she had caught sight of her own hand and directed a brief admiring smile at rings set with large emeralds and firedrops she wore rings on half her fingers and necklaces of pearls and rubies and diamonds fit for any queen draped across the swell of her bosom sevanna could not be trusted but perhaps she could be bought therava was a force of nature as well try to buy a flood or an avalanche i trust that you will do what is right sevanna she finished the rewards of friendship with the white tower are great for a long moment there was silence except for the whisper of the white robes as the servants moved with their trays then you are daвђtsang sevanna said galina blinked she was a despisedone certainly they had displayed their contempt plainly but why вђ you are daвђtsang a roundfaced wise one she did not know intoned and a woman a hand taller than therava repeated you are daвђtsang theravaвђs hawklike face might have been carved from wood yet her eyes fixed on galina glittered accusingly galina felt nailed to the spot where she knelt unable to move a muscle a hypnotized bird watching a serpent slither nearer no one had ever made her feel that way no one three wise ones have spoken sevannaвђs satisfied smile was almost welcoming theravaвђs face was stark the woman did not like whatever had just happened something hadhappened even if galina did not know what except that it appeared to have delivered her from therava that was more than enough for the moment more than enough when maidens cut her bounds and stuffed her into a black wool robe she was so grateful she almost did not care that they tore off the remnants of her shift first in front of those iceeyed men the thick wool was hot and itchy and scratchy on her welts and she welcomed it as though it were silk despite micara still shielding her she could have laughed as the maidens led her out of the tent it did not take long for that desire to vanish entirely it did not take her long to begin wondering whether begging on her knees before sevanna would do any good she would have done it could she have gotten to the woman except that micara made it plain she was not going anywhere she was not told to go or speak a word unless spoken to arms folded sevanna watched the aes sedai the daвђtsang stagger down the mountainside and stop beside a maiden squatting on her heels with a switch to drop the headshaped stone she had been carrying in her hands the black hood turned in sevannaвђs direction for a moment but the daвђtsangquickly bent to pick up another large stone and turned to labor back up the fifty paces to where micara waited with another maiden there she dropped that stone picked up another and started back down daвђtsangwere always shamed with useless labor unless there was great need the woman would not be allowed to carry even a cup of water yet toil without purpose would fill her hours till she burst of shame the sun had a long way to climb yet and many more days lay ahead i did not think she would condemn herself out of her own mouth rhiale said at sevannaвђs shoulder efalin and the others are all but sure she openly admitted killing desaine she is mine sevanna theravaвђs jaw tightened she might have taken the woman but daвђtsangbelonged to no one i intended to dress her in gaiвђshainrobes of silk she muttered what is the purpose of this sevanna i expected to have to argue against cutting her throat not this rhiale tossed her head casting a sidelong glance at sevanna sevanna intends to break her we have had long talks of what to do should we capture any aes sedai sevanna wants a tame aes sedai to wear white and serve her an aes sedai in black will do well enough though sevanna shifted her shawl irritated by the womanвђs tone not quite mocking but all too aware that she wanted somehow to use the aes sedaiвђs channeling as though it were sevannaвђs own it would be possible two gaiвђshainpassed the three wise ones carrying a large brassstrapped chest between them short and palefaced husband and wife they had been lord and lady in the treekillersвђ lands the pair bowed their heads more meekly than any aiel in white ever could have managed their dark eyes were tight with fear of a harsh word much less a switch wetlanders could be tamed like horses the woman is tamed already therava grumbled i have looked into her eyes she is a bird fluttering in the hand and afraid to fly in nine days rhiale said incredulously and sevanna shook her head vigorously she is aes sedai therava you saw her face go pale with fury when i accused her you heard her laugh as she spoke of killing wise ones she made a vexed angry sound and you heard her threaten us the woman had been as slippery as the treekillers speaking of rewards and letting the threat if no rewards came shout silently but what else could be expected of aes sedai it will take long to break her but this aes sedai will beg to obey if it takes a year once she did that aes sedai could not lie of course she had expected galina to deny her accusation once she swore to obey if you want to make an aes sedai obey you a manвђs voice said behind her this might help incredulous sevanna spun about to find caddar standing there and beside him the woman вђ the aes sedai вђ maisia both dressed in dark silk and fine lace as they had been six days ago each with a bulging sack hanging incongruously from one shoulder by a strap caddar held out a smooth white rod about a foot long in one dark hand how did you come here she demanded then compressed her lips in anger plainly he had come as he had before she was just surprised at him appearing here in the middle of the camp she snatched the white rod he offered and as always he stepped back beyond armвђs reach why have you come she amended what is this a little slimmer than her wrist the rod was smooth except for a few odd flowing symbols incised on one flat end it felt not quite like ivory not quite like glass very cool to the touch you might call it an oath rod caddar said showing teeth in what was doubtless meant for a smile it only came into my hands yesterday and i immediately thought of you sevanna clamped her hands tight around the rod to keep from hurling it away everyone knew what the aes sedaiвђs oath rod did trying not even to think much less speak she thrust it behind her belt and took her hands away rhiale frowned at the rod at sevannaвђs waist and her eyes rose slowly coldly to sevannaвђs face therava adjusted her shawl in a clatter of bracelets and gave a hard thin smile there would never be any chance of one of them touching the rod and maybe no chance of any other wise one doing so either but there was still galina casban one day she would break raveneyed maisia a little behind caddar smiled almost as faintly as therava she had seen and understood she was observant for a wetlander come sevanna told caddar we will drink tea in my tent she certainly would not share water with him lifting her skirts she started up the slope to her surprise caddar was also observant all you need do is have your aes sedai вђ walking easily beside her on his long legs he grinned suddenly toothily at rhiale and therava вђ or any woman who can channel hold the rod and speak whatever promises you wish while someone channels a little spirit into the number the marks on the end of the rod he added raising his eyebrows insultingly you can use it to release her too but that is more painful or so i understand sevannaвђs fingers touched the rod lightly more glass than ivory and very cool it only works on women she ducked into the tent ahead of him the wise ones and the leaders of the warrior societies were gone but the dozen treekiller gaiвђshainremained kneeling patiently to one side no one person had ever kept a dozen gaiвђshainbefore and she possessed more there would have to be a new name for them though since they would never put off the white women who can channel sevanna caddar said following her in the manвђs tone was incredibly insolent his dark eyes shone with open amusement you will have to wait until you have alвђthor before i give you what will control him removing the sack from his shoulder he sat not on a cushion near hers of course maisia was not afraid of a blade in her ribs she lounged on an elbow almost at sevannaвђs side sevanna eyed her sideways then casually undid another lace of her own blouse she did not recall the womanвђs bosom being as round as that for that matter her face seemed even more beautiful as well sevanna tried not to grind her teeth of course caddar went on if you mean some other man вђ there is a thing called a binding chair binding people who cannot channel is more difficult than binding those who can perhaps a binding chair survived the breaking but you will have to wait while i find it sevanna touched the rod again then impatiently ordered one of the gaiвђshainto bring tea she could wait caddar was a fool sooner or later he would give her everything she wanted of him and now the rod could break maisia free of him surely then the woman would not protect him for his insults he would wear black sevanna took a small green porcelain cup from the tray the gaiвђshainheld and gave it to the aes sedai with her own hands it is flavored with mint maisia you will find it refreshing the woman smiled but those black eyes well what could be done to one aes sedai could be done to two or more what of the traveling boxes sevanna demanded curtly caddar waved the gaiвђshainaway and patted the sack beside him i brought as many narвђbahaвђ that is what they were called вђ as many as i could find enough to transport all of you by nightfall if you hurry and i would if i were you alвђthor means to finish you it seems two clans are coming up from the south and two more are moving to come down from the north with their wise ones all ready to channel their orders are to stay until every last one of you is dead or a prisoner therava sniffed a reason to move certainly wetlander but not to run even four clans cannot sweep kinslayerвђs dagger in a day didnвђt i say caddarвђs smile was not at all pleasant it seems alвђthor has bound some aes sedai to him too and they have taught the wise ones how to travel without a narвђbaha over short distances at least twenty or thirty miles a recent rediscovery it seems they could be here вђ well today all four clans maybe he lied yet the risk sevanna could imagine all too well being in sorileaвђs grip not allowing herself to shiver she sent rhiale to inform the other wise ones her voice betrayed nothing reaching into his bag caddar drew out a gray stone cube smaller than the callbox she had used to summon him and much plainer with no marking but a bright red disc set in one face this is a narвђbaha he said it uses saidin so none of you will see anything and it has limits if a woman touches it it wonвђt work for days afterward so i will have to hand them out myself and it has other limits once opened the gateway will remain for a fixed time sufficient for a few thousand to go through if they donвђt waste time and the narвђbahaneeds three days to recover afterward i have enough extra to carry us where we need to go today but therava leaned forward so intently she looked about to fall over but sevanna hardly listened she did not doubt caddar exactly he would not dare betray them not while he hungered for the gold the shaido would give him there were small things though maisia seemed to study him over her tea why and if there was such need for speed why was there no urgency in his voice he would not betray but she would take precautions anyway maeric frowned at the stone cube the wetlander had given him then at the hole that had appeared when he pressed the red spot a hole five paces wide and three high in midair beyond lay rolling hills not low covered with brown grass he did not like things to do with the one power especially with the male part of it sevanna stepped through another smaller hole with the wetlander and a dark woman following the wise ones sevanna and rhiale had chosen out only a handful of wise ones remained with the moshaine shaido through that second hole he could see sevanna talking with bendhuin the green salts sept would find themselves with few wise ones too maeric was sure of it dyrele touched his arm husband she murmured sevanna said it would only remain open a short while maeric nodded dyrele always saw straight to the point veiling himself he ran forward and leaped through the hole he had made whatever sevanna and the wetlander said he would send none of his moshaine through before he knew it was safe he landed heavily on a slope covered with dead grass and nearly pitched headoverheels down the hill before he caught himself for a moment he stared back up at the hole on this side it hung more than a foot above the ground wife he shouted there is a drop black eyes leaped through veiled and spears ready and maidens also as well try to drink sand as try to keep maidens from being among the first the rest of the moshaine followed at a run algaiвђdвђsiswaiand wives and children jumping down on the fly craftsfolk and traders and gaiвђshain most pulling heavily loaded packhorses and mules near to six thousand altogether his sept his people they still would be once he went to rhuidean sevanna could not keep him from becoming clan chief for much longer scouts began spreading out immediately while the sept still rushed out of the hole lowering his veil maeric shouted orders that sent a screen of algaiвђdвђsiswaitoward the crests of the surrounding hills while everyone else remained concealed below there was no telling who or what lay beyond those hills rich lands the wetlander claimed but this part did not look rich to him the rush of his sept became a flood of algaiвђdвђsiswaihe did not really trust men who had fled their own clans because they did not believe rand alвђthor was truly the carвђaвђcarn maeric was not sure what he himself believed but a man did not abandon sept and clan these men called themselves meraвђdin the brotherless a fitting name and he had two hundrвђ the hole suddenly snapped into a vertical slash of silver that sliced through ten of the brotherless pieces of them fell onto the slope arms legs the front half of a man slid almost to maericвђs feet staring at the place where the hole had been he stabbed at the red spot with his thumb useless he knew but darin his eldest son was one of the stone dogs waiting as a rear guard they would have been the last through suraile his eldest daughter had remained with the stone dog for whom she was thinking of giving up the spear his eyes met dyreleвђs as green and beautiful as the day she had laid the wreath at his feet and threatened to cut his throat if he did not pick it up we can wait he said softly the wetlander had said three days but maybe he was wrong his thumb stabbed the red spot again dyrele nodded calmly he hoped there would be no need to cry in one anotherвђs arms once they could be alone a maiden came skittering down the slope from above hurriedly lowering her veil and actually breathing hard maeric naeise said not even waiting for him to see her there are spears to the east only a few miles and running straight at us i think they are reyn at least seven or eight thousand of them he could see other algaiвђdвђsiswairunning toward him a young brother to the eagle cairdin slid to a stop speaking as soon as maeric saw him i see you maeric there are spears no more than five miles to the north and wetlanders on horses perhaps ten thousand of each i do not think any of us broke the crest but some of the spears have turned toward us maeric knew before the grizzled water seeker named laerad opened his mouth spears coming over a hill three or four miles to the south eight thousand or more some of them saw one of the boys laerad never wasted words and he would never say which boy who in truth could be anyone without gray hair to laerad there was no time for wasting words maeric knew hamal he shouted no time for proper courtesy to a blacksmith either the big man knew something was wrong he scrambled up the slope likely moving faster than he had since first picking up a hammer maeric handed him the stone cube you must press the red spot and keep pressing it no matter what happens no matter how long it takes for that hole to open that is the only way out for any of you hamal nodded but maeric did not even wait for him to say that he would hamal would understand maeric touched dyreleвђs cheek careless of how many eyes were on them shade of my heart you must prepare to put on white her hand strayed toward the hilt of her belt knife вђ she had been a maiden when she made his wreath вђ but he shook his headfirmly you must live wife roofmistress to hold together what remains nodding she pressed fingers to his cheek he was astonished she had always been very reserved in public raising his veil maeric shoved one spear high above his head moshaine he roared we dance up the slope they followed him men and maidens nearly a thousand strong counting the brotherless perhaps they could be counted among the sept up the slope and west that way lay the nearest and the fewest perhaps they might buy enough time though he did not really believe that he wondered whether sevanna had known of this ah the world had grown very strange since rand alвђthor came some things could not change though laughing he began to sing wash the spears while the sun climbs high wash the spears while the sun falls low wash the spears who fears to die wash the spears no one i know singing the moshaine shaido ran to dance their deaths frowning graendal watched the gateway close behind the last of the jumai shaido the jumai and a great many wise ones unlike with the others sammael had not simply knotted this web so it would fall apart eventually at least she assumed he held it to the last the closing right on the heels of the last brownandgrayclad men was too fortuitous otherwise laughing sammael tossed away the bag still holding a few of those useless bits of stone her own empty sack was long since discarded the sun sat low behind the mountains to the west half of a glowing red ball one of these days she said dryly you will be too smart for your own good a foolbox sammael suppose one of them had understood none did he said simply but he kept rubbing his hands together and staring at where the gateway had been or maybe at something beyond he still held the mask of mirrors giving him the illusion of added height she had dropped hers as soon as the gateway closed well you certainly managed to put a panic into them around them lay the evidence a few low tents still standing blankets a cookpot a rag doll all sorts of rubbish lying where it had fallen where did you send them somewhere ahead of alвђthorвђs army i suppose some he said absently enough his staring introspection vanished abruptly and his disguise as well the scar across his face seemed especially livid enough to cause trouble particularly with their wise ones channeling but not so many that anyone will suspect me the rest are scattered from illian to ghealdan as to how or why maybe alвђthor did it for his own reasons but i certainly wouldnвђt have wasted most of them if it was my work now would i he laughed again caught up in his own brilliance she adjusted the bodice of her dress to cover a start competing that way was remarkably silly вђ she had told herself that ten thousand times and never listened once вђ remarkably silly and now the dress felt as if it might fall off which had nothing to do with her start he did not know sevanna had taken every shaido woman who could channel with her was it finally time to abandon him if she threw herself on demandredвђs mercy as if reading her thoughts he said youвђre tied to me as tightly as my belt graendal a gateway opened revealing his private rooms in illian the truth doesnвђt matter anymore if it ever has you rise with me or fall with me the great lord rewards success and heвђs never cared how it was achieved as you say she told him demandred had no mercy and semirhage i rise or fall with you still something would have to be worked out the great lord rewarded success but she would not be pulled down if sammael failed she opened a gateway to her palace in arad doman to the long columned room where she could see her pets frolicking in the pool but what if alвђthor comes after you himself what then alвђthor isnвђt going after anyone sammael laughed all i have to do is wait still laughing he stepped into his gateway and let it close the myrddraal moved from the deeper shadows becoming visible in its eyes the gateways had left a residue вђ three patches of glowing mist it could not tell one flow from another but it could distinguish saidinfrom saidarby the smell saidinsmelled like the sharp edge of a knife the point of a thorn saidarsmelled soft but like something that would grow harder the harder it was pressed no other myrddraal could smell that difference shaidar haran was like no other myrddraal picking up a discarded spear shaidar haran used it to upend the bag sammael had discarded and then to stir the bits of stone that fell out much was happening outside the plan would these events churn chaos or angry black flames raced down the spear haft from shaidar haranвђs hand the hand of the hand of the shadow in an instant the wooden haft was charred and twisted the spearhead dropped off the myrddraal let the blackened stick fall and dusted soot from its palm if sammael served chaos then all was well if not a sudden ache climbed the back of its neck a faint weakness washed along its limbs too long away from shayol ghul that tie had to be severed somehow with a snarl it turned to find the edge of shadow that it needed the day was coming it would come chapter serpent and wheel a crown of swords tossing rand dreamed wild dreams where he argued with perrin and begged mat to find elayne where colors flashed just beyond sight and padan fain leaped at him with a flashing blade and sometimes he thought he heard a voice moaning for a dead woman in the heart of a fog dreams where he tried to explain himself to elayne to aviendha to min to all three at once and even min looked at him with scorn not to be disturbed cadsuaneвђs voice part of his dreams the voice frightened him in his dream he shouted for lews therin and the sound echoed through a thick mist where shapes moved and people and horses died screaming a fog where cadsuane followed him implacably while he ran panting alanna tried to soothe him but she was afraid of cadsuane too he could feel her fear as strongly as his own his head hurt and his side the old scar was fire he felt saidin someone held saidin was it him he did not know he struggled to wake youвђll kill him min shouted i wonвђt let you kill him his eyes opened staring up at her face not looking at him she had his head wrapped in her arms and was glaring at someone away from the bed her eyes were red she had been crying but no longer yes he was in his own bed in his rooms in the sun palace he could see a heavy square blackwood bedpost set with wedges of ivory coatless in a cream silk blouse min lay curled around him protectively atop the linen sheet that covered him to the neck alanna was afraid that lay shivering in the back of his head afraid for him for some reason he was sure of that i think he is awake min amys said gently min looked down and her face framed in dark ringlets beamed with a sudden smile carefully вђ because he felt weak вђ he removed her arms and sat up his head whirled dizzily but he forced himself not to lie back again his bed was ringed to one side stood amys flanked by bera and kiruna amysвђ tooyouthful features bore no expression at all but she brushed back her long white hair and shifted her dark shawl as though tidying herself after a struggle outwardly the two aes sedai were serene yet with determined serenity a queen ready to fight for her throne a country woman ready to fight for her farm oddly if he had ever seen three people stand together вђ and not just physically вђ it was those three shouldertoshoulder as one on the opposite side of the bed samitsu with those silver bells in her hair and a slender sister with thick black eyebrows and a wild look to her raven hair stood with cadsuane who had her fists planted on her hips samitsu and the ravenhaired aes sedai wore yellowfringed shawls and had jaws set every bit as firmly as bera or kiruna yet cadsuaneвђs stern stare made all four appear hesitant the two groups of women were not staring at one another but at the men at the foot of the bed were dashiva with the silver sword and redandgold dragon glittering his collar and flinn and narishma all grimfaced trying to watch the women on both sides of the bed at once jonan adley stood beside them his black coat looking singed on one sleeve saidinfilled all four men to overflowing it seemed dashiva held almost as much as rand could have rand looked to adley who nodded slightly abruptly rand realized that he was not wearing anything beneath the sheet that had fallen to his waist and nothing above except a bandage wound around his middle how long have i been asleep he asked how is it iвђm alive he touched the pale bandage gingerly fainвђs dagger came from shadar logoth once i saw it kill a man in moments with a scratch he died fast and he died hard dashiva muttered a curse with padan fainвђs name in it samitsu and the other yellow exchanged startled looks but cadsuane merely nodded the golden ornaments around her irongray bun swaying yes shadar logoth that would explain several matters you can thank samitsu that youвђre alive and master flinn she did not glance toward the grizzled man with his fringe of white hair but he grinned as though she had given him a bow in truth surprisingly the yellows did nod to him and corele here of course cadsuane went on each has done a part including some things i think have not been done since the breaking her voice turned grim without all three you would be dead by now you still may die unless you let yourself be guided you must rest without exertion his stomach rumbled suddenly loudly and she added weвђve only been able to get a little water and broth down you since you were hurt two days is a long time without food for a sick man two days only two he avoided looking at adley iвђm getting up he said i wonвђt let them kill you sheepherder min said with an obstinate glint in her eyes and i wonвђt let you kill you either she put her arms around his shoulders as if to hold him where he was if the carвђaвђcarnwishes to rise amys said flatly i will have nandera bring in the maidens from the corridor somara and enaila will be especially happy to give him just the assistance he needs the corners of her mouth twitched toward a smile once a maiden herself she knew close enough to everything of that situation neither kiruna nor bera smiled they frowned at him as at an absolute fool boy cadsuane said dryly iвђve already seen more of your hairless bottomcheeks than i wish to but if you want to flaunt them in front of all six of us perhaps someone will enjoy the show if you fall on your face though i may just spank you before i put you back to bed by samitsuвђs face and coreleвђs they would be happy to assist her narishma and adley stared at cadsuane in shock while flinn tugged at his coat as though arguing with himself dashiva though barked a rough laugh if you want us to clear the women out the plainfaced man began preparing flows not shields but complex weaves of spirit and fire that rand suspected would put anyone they were laid on in too much pain to think of channeling no he said quickly bera and kiruna would obey a simple order to go and if corele and samitsu had helped keep him alive he owed them more than pain but if cadsuane thought nakedness would hold him where he was she was in for a surprise he was not sure the maidens had left him any modesty at all with a smile for min he unwound her arms tossed back the sheet and climbed out of the bed on amysвђ side the wise oneвђs mouth tightened he could almost see her considering whether to call for the maidens bera gave amys an agonized uncertain look while kiruna hurriedly turned her back her cheeks darkening slowly he walked to the wardrobe slowly because he expected he might give cadsuane her chance if he tried to move quickly phaw she muttered behind him i vow i shouldsmack the stubborn boyвђs bottom someone grunted what might have been agreement or just disapproval of what he was doing ah but itвђs such a pretty bottom now isnвђt it that someone else said in a lilting murandian accent that must have been corele a good thing he had his head inside the wardrobe maybe the maidens had not peeled away as much modesty as he thought light his face felt hot as a furnace hoping the motions of dressing would cover any wobbles he climbed into his clothes hurriedly his sword stood propped in the back of the wardrobe sword belt wound around the dark boarhide scabbard he touched the long hilt then took his hand away barefoot he turned back to the others while still tying the laces of his shut min still sat crosslegged on the bed in her snug green silk breeches by her expression unable to decide between approval and frustration i need to talk with dashiva and the other ashaвђman he said alone min scrambled off the bed and ran to hug him not tightly she was very careful of his bandaged side iвђve waited too long to see you awake again she said sliding an arm around his waist i need to be with you she emphasized that just a tad she must have had a viewing or maybe she just wanted to help steady his legs that arm seemed to offer support either way he nodded he was not all that steady laying a hand on her shoulder he suddenly realized that he did not want the ashaвђman to know how weak he was any more than cadsuane or amys bera and kiruna made reluctant curtsies and started for the door then hesitated when amys did not move right away so long as you do not intend to leave these rooms the wise one said not in the slightest as though speaking to her carвђaвђcarn rand raised a naked foot do i look as though iвђm going anywhere amys sniffed but with a glance at adley she gathered up bera and kiruna and departed cadsuane and the other two were only a moment more in going the grayhaired green glanced at adley too it could not be much of secret that he had been gone from cairhien for days at the door she paused donвђt do anything foolish boy she sounded like a stern aunt cautioning a shiftless nephew without much expectation he would listen samitsu and corele followed her out dividing their frowns between him and the ashaвђman as they vanished dashiva laughed a sharp wheeze shaking his head he actually sounded amused rand stepped away from min to fetch his boots from beside the wardrobe and take a rolled pair of stockings from inside iвђll join you in the anteroom as soon as iвђm booted dashiva the plainfaced ashaвђman gave a start he had been frowning at adley as you command my lord dragon he said pressing fist to heart waiting until the four men were gone rand sat down in a chair with a feeling of relief and began pulling on his stockings he was sure his legs felt stronger just for being up and moving stronger but they still did not want to support him very well are you sure this is wise min said kneeling beside his chair and he gave her a startled look if he had talked in his sleep during those two days the aes sedai would have known amys would have had enaila and somara and fifty more maidens waiting when he woke he tugged the stocking the rest of the way up do you have a viewing min sat back on her heels folded her arms beneath her breasts and gave him a firm look after a moment she decided it was not working and sighed itвђs cadsuane she is going to teach you something you and the ashaвђman all the ashaвђman i mean itвђs something you have to learn but i donвђt know what it is except that none of you will like learning it from her you arenвђt going to like it at all rand paused with a boot in hand then stuffed his foot in what could cadsuane or any aes sedai teach the ashaвђman women could not teach men or men women that was as hard a fact as the one power itself we will see was all he said plainly that did not satisfy min she knew it would happen and so did he she was never wrong but what couldcadsuane possibly teach him what would he let her teach him the woman made him unsure of himself uneasy in a way he had not felt since before the stone of tear fell stamping his foot to settle it in the second boot he fetched his sword belt from the wardrobe and a red coat worked in gold the same he had worn to the sea folk what bargain did merana make for me he asked and she made an exasperated sound in her throat none as of this morning she said impatiently she and rafela havenвђt left the ship since we did but theyвђve sent half a dozen messages asking if youвђre well enough to return i donвђt think the bargaining has gone well for them without you i suppose itвђs too much to hope thatвђs where youвђre going not yet he told her min said nothing but she said it very loudly fists on her hips and one eyebrow raised high well she would know most of it soon enough in the anteroom all the ashaвђman except dashiva sprang out of their chairs when rand appeared with min staring at nothing and talking to himself dashiva did not notice until rand reached the rising sun set in the floor and then he blinked several times before rising rand addressed himself to adley while fastening the dragonshaped buckle of his sword belt the armyвђs reached the hillforts in illian already he wanted to take one of the gilded armchairs but would not let himself how it should have been several more days at the best at best flinn and narishma looked as startled as dashiva none of them had known where adley and hopwil had gone вђ or morr deciding who to trust was always the difficulty and trust a razorвђs edge adley drew himself up there was something about his eyes beneath those thick eyebrows he had seen the wolf as they said in cairhien the high lord weiramon left the foot behind and pressed forward with the horse he said reporting stiffly the aiel kept up of course he frowned we encountered aiel yesterday shaido i donвђt know how they got there there were maybe nine or ten thousand altogether but they didnвђt seem to have any wise ones who could channel with them and they didnвђt really slow us down we reached the hillforts at noon today rand wanted to snarl leaving the foot behind did weiramon think he was going to take palisaded forts on hilltops with horsemen probably the man probably would have left the aiel behind too if he could have outrun them fool nobles and their fool honor still it did not matter except to the men who died because the high lord weiramon was contemptuous of anyone who did not fight from horseback eben and i began destroying the first palisades soon as we arrived adley went on weiramon didnвђt much like that i think he would have stopped us but he was afraid to anyway we began setting fire to the logs and blowing holes in the walls but before we more than started sammael came a man channeling saidin at least and a lot stronger than eben or me as strong as you my lord dragon iвђd say he was there right away rand said incredulously but then he understood he had been sure sammael would stay safe in illian behind defenses woven of the power if he thought he had to face rand too many of the forsaken had tried and most were dead now in spite of himself rand laughed вђ and had to hug his side laughing hurt all that elaborate deception to convince sammael he would be anywhere but with the invading army to bring the man out of illian and all made unnecessary by a knife in padan fainвђs hand two days by this time everybody who had eyesandears in cairhien вђ which certainly included the forsaken вђ knew that the dragon reborn lay on the edge of death as well toss wet wood on the fire as think otherwise men scheme and women plot but the wheel weaves as it will that was how they said it in tear go on he said morr was with you last night yes my lord dragon fedwin comes every night just like heвђs supposed to last night it was plain as ebenвђs nose weвђd reach the forts today i donвђt understand any of this dashiva sounded upset a muscle in his cheek was twitching youвђve lured him out but to what purpose as soon as he feels a man channel with anything near your strength heвђll flee back to illian and whatever traps and alarms he has woven you wonвђt get at him there he will know as soon as a gateway opens within a mile of the city we can save the army adley burst out thatвђs what we can do weiramon was still sending charges against that fort when i left and sammael cuts every one to rags despite anything eben or i can do he shifted the arm with the singed sleeve we have to strike back and run immediately and even so he nearly burned us where we stood more than once the aiel are taking casualties too theyвђre only fighting the illianers who come out вђ the other hillforts must be emptying so many were coming when i left вђ but any time sammael sees fifty of us together aiel or anybody he rips them apart if there were three of him or even two iвђm not sure iвђd find anybody alive when i go back dashiva stared at him as if at a madman and adley shrugged suddenly as though feeling the lightness of his bare black collar compared with the sword and dragon on the older manвђs forgive me ashaвђman he muttered abashed then added in a still lower voice but we can at least save them we will rand assured him just not the way adley expected youвђre all going to help me kill sammael today only dashiva looked startled the other men just nodded not even the forsaken frightened them anymore rand expected argument out of min maybe a demand to come along but she surprised him i expect you would as soon no one found out youвђre gone before they have to sheepherder he nodded and she sighed perhaps the forsaken had to depend on pigeons and eyesandears just like anyone else but being too sure could be fatal the maidens will want to come if they know min they would want to and he would be hardpressed to refuse if he could refuse yet the disappearance even of nandera and whoever she had on guard might be too much min sighed again i suppose i could go talk to nandera i might be able to keep them out in the hallway for an hour but they wonвђt be pleased with me when they find out he almost laughed again before he remembered his side they definitely would not be pleased with her or with him more to the point farmboy amys wonвђt be pleased or sorilea the things i let you get me into he opened his mouth to tell her he had not asked her to do anything yet before he could utter a word she moved very close looking up at him through long lashes she put a hand on his chest tapping her fingers she smiled warmly and kept her voice soft but the fingers were a giveaway if you let anything happen to you rand alвђthor iвђll give cadsuane a hand whether she needs one or not her smile brightened for a moment almost cheerily before she turned for the doors he watched her go she might make his head spin sometimes вђ nearly every woman he had ever met had done that at least a time or two вђ but she did have a way of walking that made him want to watch abruptly he realized dashiva was watching as well and licking his lips rand cleared his throat loudly enough to be heard over the sound of the door closing behind her for some reason the plainfaced man raised his hands defensively it was not as though rand glared at him he could not go around glaring at men just because min wore tight breeches surrounding himself with the emptiness of the void he seized saidinand forced frozen fire and molten filth into the weaves for a gateway dashiva leaped back as it opened maybe having a hand sliced off would teach the man not to lick his lips like a goat something crooked and red spiderwebbed across the outside of the void he stepped through onto bare dirt with dashiva and the others right behind releasing the source as soon as the last stepped clear a sense of loss rushed in as saidinleft as awareness of alanna dwindled the loss had not seemed so great while lews therin was there not so huge overhead the golden sun was more than halfway down to the horizon a gust of wind swept dust from under his boots without leaving any coolness behind the gateway had opened in a cleared area marked off by a rope strung between four wooden posts at each corner stood a pair of guards in short coats and baggy trousers stuffed into their boots swords that appeared slightly serpentine hanging at their sides some had heavy mustaches that hung to their chins or thick beards and all had bold noses and dark eyes that seemed tilted as soon as rand appeared one of them went running what are we doing here dashiva said looking about incredulously around them stretched hundreds of sharppeaked tents gray and dusty white tents and picket lines of already saddled horses caemlyn lay not many miles away hidden behind the trees and the black tower not much farther but taim would not know of this unless he had a spy watching one of fedwin morrвђs tasks had been to listen вђ to feel вђ for anyone trying to spy in a ripple of murmurs spreading outward from the ropes men with bold noses and serpentine swords rose from their heels and turned to stare expectantly toward rand here and there women stood as well saldaean women often rode to the wars with their husbands at least among the nobles and officers there would be none of that today though ducking under the rope rand strode directly to a tent no different from any other except for the banner on the staff in front three simple red blossoms on a field of blue the kingspenny did not die back even in saldaean winters and when fires blackened the forests those red flowers were always the first to reappear a blossom nothing could kill the sign of house bashere inside the tent bashere himself was already booted and spurred and his sword on his hip ominously deira was with him in a riding dress the same shade as her husbandвђs gray coat and if she wore no sword the long dagger at her belt of heavy silver roundels would do to go on with the leather gauntlets tucked behind that belt spoke of someone meaning to ride hard i hadnвђt expected this for days yet bashere said rising from a folding camp chair weeks i hoped in truth i had hoped to have most of taimвђs leavings armed the way young mat and i planned вђ iвђve gathered every maker of crossbows i could find into a manufactory and theyвђre starting to produce them like a sow dropping piglets вђ but as it is no more than fifteen thousand have crossbows and know what to do with them with a questioning look he lifted a silver pitcher from atop the maps spread out on his folding table do we have time for punch no punch rand said impatiently bashere had spoken before about the men taim found who could not learn to channel but he had scarcely listened if bashere thought he had trained them well enough that was all that mattered dashiva and three more ashaвђman are waiting outside as soon as morr joins them weвђll be ready he eyed deira ni ghaline tвђbashere towering over her diminutive husband with her hawkвђs beak of a nose and her eyes that made a hawkвђs look mild no punch lord bashere and no wives not today deira opened her mouth her dark eyes all but glowing suddenly no wives bashere said knuckling his heavy graystreaked mustaches i will pass the order turning to deira he held out his hand wife he said mildly rand winced mild tone or no and waited for the eruption deiraвђs mouth thinned she scowled down at her husband a hawk ready to stoop on a mouse not that bashere looked anything like a mouse of course just a much smaller hawk she drew a deep breath deira could make drawing a deep breath seem a thing that should cause the earth to tremble and unhooking her sheathed dagger from her belt she laid it in her husbandвђs hand we will talk of this later davram she said at length one day when he had time rand decided he was going to make bashere explain how he did that if there ever was time at length bashere agreed grinning through his mustaches as he stuffed the dagger behind his own belt maybe the man was simply suicidal the rope had been taken down outside and rand stood waiting with dashiva and the other ashaвђman while nine thousand saldaean light horse arrayed themselves behind bashere in a column of threes somewhere behind them fifteen thousand men who called themselves the legion of the dragon would be gathering afoot rand had glimpsed them every one in a blue coat made to button up the side so the redandgold dragon across the chest would not be broken most carried steelarmed crossbows some bore heavy unwieldy shields instead but not one carried a pike whatever odd notion mat and bashere had cooked up rand hoped it would not lead a lot of this legion to death morr grinned eagerly while he waited all but bouncing on his toes perhaps he was simply glad to be back in his black coat with the silver sword on his collar yet adley and narishma wore almost identical grins and for that matter flinnвђs was not far off they knew where they were going now and what to do there dashiva scowled at nothing as usual his lips moving silently as usual also silent scowling were the saldaean women gathered behind deira watching from one side eagles and falcons feathers ruffled and furious rand did not care how they grimaced and frowned if he could face nandera and the rest of the maidens after keeping them back from this then the saldaean men could put up with any number of lengthy discussions today the light willing no women would die because of him so many men could not be lined up in a minute even when they had been awaiting the order but in a remarkably short time bashere raised his sword and called my lord dragon a shout rippled down the great column behind him the lord dragon seizing the source rand made a gateway between the posts four paces by four and ran through as he tied off the weave filled with saidinand the ashaвђman on his heels into a great open square surrounded by huge white columns each topped with a marble wreath of olive branches at the two ends of the square stood nearly identical purpleroofed palaces of columned walks and high balconies and slender spires those were the kingвђs palace and the slightly smaller great hall of the council and this was the square of tammuz in the heart of illian a skinny man in a blue coat with a beard that left his upper lip bare stood gaping at the sight of rand and the black coated ashaвђman leaping out of a hole in midair and a stout woman in a green dress cut high enough to show green slippers and her ankles in green stockings pressed both hands to her face and stood rooted right in front of them her dark eyes popping all the people were stopping to stare hawkers with their trays carters halting their oxen men and women and children with their mouths hanging open rand thrust his hands high and channeled i am the dragon reborn the words boomed across the square amplified by air and fire and flames shot up from his hands a hundred feet behind him the ashaвђman filled the sky with balls of fire streaking in every direction all save dashiva who made blue lightnings crackle in a jagged web above the square no more was needed a shrieking flood of humanity fled in all directions away from the square of tammuz they fled just in time rand and the ashaвђman darted aside from the gateway and davram bashere led his wildly screaming saldaeans into illian a flood of horsemen waving their swords as they poured out straight ahead bashere led the center line of the column just as they had planned what seemed so long ago while the other two lines peeled off to either side they streamed away from the gateway breaking apart into smaller groups galloping into the streets leading out of the square rand did not wait to see the last of the horsemen exit with well under a third out of the gateway he immediately wove another smaller opening you did not need to know a place at all to travel if you only intended to go a very short distance around him he felt dashiva and the rest weaving their gateways but he was already stepping through his own letting it close behind him atop one of the slender towers of the kingвђs palace absently he wondered whether mattin stepaneos den balgar the king of illian was somewhere below him at that moment the top of the spire stretched no more than five paces across surrounded by a wall of red stone not quite chesthigh on him at fifty paces it was the highest point in all of the city from there he could see across rooftops glittering beneath the afternoon sun red and green and every color to the long earthen causeways that cut through the vast tallgrass marsh surrounding city and harbor a sharp tang of salt hung in the air illian had no need of walls with that allenveloping marsh to stop an attacker any attacker who could not make holes in the air but then walls would have done no good either it was a pretty city the buildings mainly of pale dressed stone a city crisscrossed by as many canals as streets like traceries of bluegreen from this height but he did not stop to admire it low across the roofs of taverns and shops and spired palaces he directed flows of air and water fire and earth and spirit turning as he did so he did not try to weave the flows simply swept them out over the city and a good mile out over the marsh from five other towers came flows sweeping low and where they touched one another uncontrolled light flashed and sparks flared and clouds of colored steam burst a display any illuminator might have envied a better way to frighten people under their beds and out of the way of bashereвђs soldiers he could not imagine though that was not the reason for it long ago he had decided that sammael must have wards woven throughout the city set to give an alarm should anyone channel saidin wards inverted so no one except sammael himself could find them wards that would tell sammael exactly where that man was channeling so he could be destroyed on the instant with luck every one of those wards was being triggered now lews therin had been sure sammael would sense them wherever he was even at a distance that was why the wardings should be useless now that sort had to be remade once triggered sammael would come never in his life had he relinquished anything he considered his however shaky his claim not without a fight all that from lews therin if he was real he had to be those memories had too much detail but could not a madman dream his fancies in detail too lews therinhe called silently the wind blowing across illian answered below the square of tammuz stood deserted and silent empty except for a few abandoned carts edgeon the gateway was invisible except for the weaves reaching down to those weaves rand untied the knot and as the gateway winked from existence reluctantly released saidin all the flows vanished from the sky maybe some of the ashaвђman still held on to the source but he had told them not to he had told them that any man he felt channeling in illian once he himself stopped he intended to kill without warning he did not want to find out afterward that the channeler had been one of them he leaned on the wall waiting wishing he could sit his legs ached and his side burned however he stood yet he might need to see as well as feel a weave the city was not entirely quiet from several directions he could hear distant shouts the faint clash of metal even moving so many men to the border sammael had not left illian entirely unprotected rand turned trying to watch in every direction he thought sammael would come to the kingвђs palace or that other at the far end of the square but he could not be certain down one street he saw a band of saldaeans clashing with an equal number of mounted men in shining breastplates more saldaeans suddenly galloped in from one side and the fight vanished from his sight behind buildings in another direction he spotted some of the legion of the dragon marching across a canalвђs low bridge an officer marked by a tall red plume on his helmet strode ahead of some twenty men carrying wide shields as tall as their shoulders followed by perhaps two hundred more with heavy crossbows how would they fight shouts and steel ringing on steel in the distance the faint screams of dying men the sun slid downward and shadows lengthened across the city twilight and the sun a low crimson dome in the west a few stars appeared had he been wrong would sammael simply go elsewhere find another land to master had he been listening to anything other than his own mad ramblings a man channeled for a moment rand froze staring at the great hall of the council that had been enough of saidinfor a gateway he might not have felt a much smaller channeling the length of the square it had to be sammael in an instant he had seized the source woven a gateway and leaped through with lightning ready to fly from his hands it was a large room lit by huge mirrored golden standlamps and others hanging on chains from the ceiling with snowy marble walls carved in friezes showing battles and ships crowding the marshbordered harbor of illian itself at the far end of the room nine heavily carved and gilded armchairs stood like thrones atop a high stairfronted white dais the center chair with a back higher than any other before he could release the gateway behind him the tower top where he had stood exploded he felt the wash of fire and earth even as a storm of stone fragments and dust struck through the gateway knocking him down on his face pain stabbed his side as he landed a sharp red lance digging into the void where he floated and that as much as anything else made him release the gateway someone elseвђs pain someone elseвђs weakness he could ignore them in the void he moved forcing another manвђs muscles to work pushed himself up and scrambled away in a lurching run toward the dais just as hundreds of red filaments burned down through the ceiling burned through the seablue marble floor in a wide circle all around where the residue of his gateway was still fading one stabbed through the heel of his boot through his heel and he heard himself cry out as he fell not his pain in side or foot not his rolling onto his back he could see the remnants of those burning red wires still fresh enough to make out fire and air woven in a way he had not known enough to make out exactly the direction they had come from black holes in the floor and ornately worked white plaster ceiling high overhead hissed and crackled loudly at the touch of the air his hands rose and he wove balefire began to weave it someone elseвђs cheek stung from a remembered slap and cadsuaneвђs voice hissed and crackled in his head like the holes the red filaments had made never again boy you will never do that again it seemed that he heard lews therin whimpering in distant fear of what he was about to loose what had almost destroyed the world once every flow but fire and air fell away and he wove as he had seen a thousand fine hairs of red blossomed between his hands fanning out slightly they shot upward a circle of the ceiling two feet across fell in stone chips and plaster dust only after he had done it did he think that there might be someone between him and sammael he intended to see sammael dead this day but if he could do it without killing anyone else the weaves vanished as he pulled himself to his feet once more and limped hurriedly to the doors in the side of the hall tall things with every panel set with nine golden bees the size of his fist a small flow of air pushed one door open before he reached it too small to be detected at any distance hobbling into the corridor he sank to one knee that other manвђs side was fire his heel agony rand pulled his sword up and leaned on it waiting a cleanshaven fellow with plump pink cheeks peered around a corner down the way enough of his coat showed to name him a servant at least a coat green on one side and yellow on the other looked like livery the fellow saw rand and very slowly as though he might not be noticed if he moved slowly enough slid back out of sight sooner or later sammael would have to illian belongs to me the voice boomed in the air from every direction and rand cursed that had to be the same weave he himself had used in the square or something very like it required so little of the power he might not have felt the actual flows had he been within ten paces of the man illian is mine i wonвђt destroy what belongs to me killing you and i wonвђt let you destroy it either you had the nerve to come after me here do you have the courage to follow me again a sly mocking tone entering that thundering voice do you have the courage somewhere above a gateway opened and closed rand had no doubt that was what it was the courage did he have the courage iвђm the dragon reborn he muttered and iвђm going to kill you weaving a gateway he stepped through to a place floors above it was another hallway lined with wall hangings showing ships at sea at the far end the last crimson sliver of the sun shone through a colonnaded walk the residue of sammaelвђs gateway hung in the air the dissipating flows like faintly glowing ghosts not so faint rand could not make them out though he began to weave then stopped he had leaped up here without a thought of a trap if he copied what he saw exactly he would step out wherever sammael had or so close as made no difference but with just a slight alteration no way to be sure whether the change was fifty feet or five hundred yet either was close enough the vertical silver slash began to rotate open revealing the shadowcloaked ruins of greatness not quite as dark as the hallway seen through the gateway the sun was a slightly thicker slice of red halfhidden by a shattered dome he knew that place the last time he had gone there he had added a name to that list of maidens in his head the first time padan fain had followed and become more than a darkfriend worse than a darkfriend that sammael had fled to shadar logoth seemed like coming full circle in more ways that one there was no time to waste now that he was opening the way before the gateway stopped widening he ran through into the ravaged city that once had been called aridhol ran limping letting the weave go as he ran boots crunching on broken paving stones and dead weeds the first corner he came to he ducked around the ground shook under his feet as roars sounded back the way he had come light flashing atop flash in the twilight darkness he felt the wash of earth and fire and air shrieks and bellows rose through the thunderous crashes saidinpulsing inside him he hobbled away without looking back he ran and with the power filling him even in the dark shadows he could see clearly all around the great city lay huge marble palaces each with four and five domes of different shapes painted crimson by the setting sun bronze fountains and statues at every intersection great stretches of columns running to towers that soared across the sun they soared when intact at least more ended in abrupt jaggedness than not for every dome that stood whole ten were broken eggshells with the top hacked off or one side gone statues lay toppled in fragments or stood with missing arms or heads swiftly deepening darkness raced across sprawling hills of rubble the few stunted trees clinging to their slopes twisted shapes like broken fingers against the sky a fan of bricks and stone spread across the way from what might have been a small palace half its front missing the rest of the columned faгade leaned drunkenly toward the street he stopped in the middle of the street just short of the fan waiting feeling for another to use saidin clinging to the sides of the street was not a good idea and not simply because any building might fall at any time a thousand unseen eyes seemed to watch from windows like gouged eye sockets to watch with a nearly palpable sense of anticipation distantly he felt the new wound in his side throbbing a slash of flame echoing the evil that clung to the very dust of shadar logoth the old scar clenched like a fist the pain of his foot seemed very distant indeed closer the void itself pulsated around him the dark oneвђs taint on saidinbeating in time with the knife slash across his ribs a dangerous place by daylight shadar logoth by night down the street beyond a spired monument miraculously standing straight something moved a shadowed shape darting across the way in the darkness rand almost channeled but he could not believe sammael would go scuddling that way when he first stepped into the city when sammael tried to destroy everything around his gateway he had heard horrible screams they had barely registered then nothing lived in shadar logoth not even rats sammael must have brought henchmen fellows he did not mind killing in an attempt to reach rand maybe one of them could lead rand to sammael he hurried forward as fast as he could as soundlessly as he could shattered pavement crunched under his boots with a sound like bones snapping he hoped it was loud only to his saidinenhanced ears stopping at the base of the spire a thick stone needle covered with flowing script he peered ahead whoever had moved was gone only fools or the madly brave went inside in shadar logoth at night the evil that stained shadar logoth the evil that had murdered aridhol had not died with aridhol farther along the street a tendril of silvergray fog wavered out of a window creeping toward another that came to meet it from a wide gap in a high stone wall the depths of that gap shone as though a full moon lay inside with the night mashadar roamed its city prison a vast presence that could appear in a dozen places at once a hundred mashadarвђs touch was not a pleasant way to die inside rand the taint on saidinbeat harder the distant fire in his side flickered like ten thousand lightnings one on top of the last even the ground seemed to pound beneath his boots he turned halfthinking to leave now very likely sammael had gone now that mashadar was out very likely the man had lured him here in the hope he would search the ruins until mashadar killed him he turned and stopped crouching against the spire two trollocs were creeping down that street bulky shapes in black mail half again as tall as he or more spikes stood out on the shoulders and elbows of their armor and they carried spears with long black points and wicked hooks to his saidinfilled eyes their faces stood out clearly one distorted by an eagleвђs beak where mouth and nose should have been the other by a boarвђs tusked snout every line of their creeping shouted fear trollocs loved killing loved blood but shadar logoth terrified them there would be myrddraal about no trolloc would have entered this city without myrddraal to drive it no myrddraal would have entered without sammael driving all of which meant sammael must still be here or these trollocs would be running for the gates not hunting and they were hunting that boarвђs snout was snuffling the air for a scent abruptly a figure in rags leaped from a window above the trollocs falling on them with spear already stabbing an aiel a woman shoufawrapped around her head but veil hanging the eaglebeaked trolloc shrieked as her spearpoint stabbed deep into its side stabbed again as its companion fell kicking boarsnout spun with snarl thrusting viciously but she ducked low under the black hooked point and stabbed up into the creatureвђs stomach and it went down in a thrashing heap with the other rand was on his feet and running before he thought liah he shouted he had thought her dead abandoned here by him dead for him liah of the cosaida chareen that name blazed on the list in his head she whirled to confront him spear ready in one hand round bullhide buckler in the other the face he remembered as pretty despite scars on both cheeks was contorted with rage mine she hissed threateningly through her teeth mine no one may come here no one he stopped in his tracks that spear waited eager to seek his ribs too liah you know me he said softly you know me iвђll take you back to the maidens back to your spearsisters he held out his hand her rage melted into a twisted frown she tilted her head to one side rand alвђthor she said slowly her eyes widened falling to the dead trollocs and a look of horror spread across her face rand alвђthor she whispered fumbling the black veil into place across her face with the hand that held her spear the carвђaвђcarn she wailed and fled he hobbled after her scrambling over piles of rubble spread across the street falling ripping his coat falling again and nearly ripping it off rolling and picking himself up on the run the weakness of his body was distant and the pain of it but even floating deep in the void he could only push that body so hard liah vanished into the night around the next blackshadowed corner he thought he limped around that as fast as he could and nearly ran into four black mailed trollocs and a myrddraal inky cloak hanging unnaturally still down its back as the fade moved the trollocs snarled in surprise yet shock lasted less than a heartbeat hooked spears and scythecurved swords rose the myrddraalвђs deadblack blade was in its fist a blade that gave wounds almost as deadly as fainвђs dagger rand did not even try to draw the heronmark sword at his side death in a tattered red coat he channeled and a sword of fire was in his hands pulsing darkly with the throb of saidin sweeping an eyeless head from its shoulders simpler to have destroyed them all the way he had seen the ashaвђman kill at dumaiвђs wells but changing the weaves now trying to change might take a fatal moment those swords could kill even him he danced the forms in a darkness lit by the flame in his hands shadows flying across faces above him faces with wolvesвђ muzzles and goatsвђ faces contorted in screams as his fiery blade sliced through black mail and the flesh beneath as if they were water trollocs depended on numbers and overwhelming ferocity facing him and that sword of the power they might as well have stood stockstill unarmed the sword vanished from his hands still poised at the end of the form called twisting the wind he stood among death the last trolloc to fall still thrashed goat horns scraping on the fragmented pavement the headless myrddraal yet flung its arms about of course booted feet scrabbling wildly halfmen did not die quickly even headless no sooner did the sword disappear than silver lightning lanced down from the cloudless starry sky the first bolt struck with a deafening roar not four paces away the world turned white and the void collapsed the ground bounced under him as another bolt struck and another he had not realized he was on his face until then the air crackled dazed he pushed himself up half falling as he ran from a hail of lightning that ripped the street apart to a thunder of collapsing buildings straight ahead he staggered not caring where so long as it was away suddenly his head cleared enough for him to see where he was reeling across a vast stone floor covered with tumbled chunks of stone some as big as he here and there dark uneven holes gaped in the floorstones all around rose high walls and tier upon tier of deep balconies that ran all the way around only a small portion of what had once been a vast roof remained at one corner stars shone bright overhead he lurched another step and the floor gave way beneath him desperately he flung out his hands with a jolt the right hand caught hold of a rough edge he dangled into pitchblackness the fall beneath his boots might be a few spans into a basement or a mile for all he could tell he could latch bands of air to the jagged rim of the hole above his head to help pull himself out except somehow sammael had sensed the relatively small amount of saidinused in the sword there had been a delay before the lightnings struck but he could not say how long he had taken killing the trollocs a minute seconds with a heave he swung his left arm up trying to catch the edge of the hole pain no longer buffered by the void stabbed through his side like a dagger going in spots danced in his vision worse his right hand slipped on crumbling stone and he could feel his fingers weakening he was going to have to a hand grabbed his right wrist you are a fool a manвђs deep voice said count yourself lucky i donвђt care to see you die today the hand began drawing him up are you going to help the voice demanded i donвђt intend to carry you on my shoulders or kill sammael for you shaking off his shock rand reached up and grabbed the rim of the hole pulling despite the agony of his side despite the agony he managed to acquire the void again too and seize saidin he did not channel but he wanted to be ready his head and shoulders came above the floor and he could see the other man a big fellow little older than he with hair black as the night and a coat black as an ashaвђmanвђs rand had never seen him before at least he was not one of the forsaken those faces he knew he thought he did anyway who are you he demanded still heaving the man barked a laugh just say iвђm a wanderer passing through do you really want to talk now saving his breath rand struggled upward getting his chest over the lip his waist abruptly he realized that a glow bathed the floor around them like the glow of a full moon twisting to look over his shoulder he saw mashadar not a tendril but a shining silvergray wave rolling out of one of the balconies arching over their heads descending without a thought his free hand rose and balefire shot upward a bar of liquid white fire slicing across the wave sinking toward them dimly he was aware of another bar of pale solid fire rising from the other manвђs hand that was not clasping his a bar slashing the opposite way from his the two touched head ringing like a struck gong rand convulsed saidinand the void shattering everything was doubled in his eyes the balconies the chunks of stone lying about the floor there seemed to be a pair of the other man overlapping one another each clutching his head between two hands blinking rand searched for mashadar the wave of shining mist was gone a glow remained in the balconies above but dimming receding as randвђs eyes began to clear even mindless mashadar fled balefire it seemed unsteadily he got to his feet and offered a hand i think we best move quickly what happened there the other man pushed himself up with a grimace at randвђs proffered hand he was easily as tall as rand rare except among the aiel i donвђt know what happened he snarled run if you want to live he suited his own words immediately dashing toward a row of open arches not in the nearest wall mashadar had come from that one fumbling for the void rand limped after him as fast as he could but before they were completely across the floor the lightnings fell again a storm of silver arrows the two of them darted through the archways pursued by the thunder of walls and floor collapsing behind them by clouds of dust and a hail of stones shoulders hunched and an arm across his face rand ran coughing through a broad room where trembling arches supported the ceiling and bits of stone rained down he burst out into a street before he knew it stumbling three steps before stopping the pain in his side made him want to bend over but he thought his legs might give way if he did his wounded foot throbbed it seemed a year ago that that red wire of fire and air had stabbed his heel his rescuer stood watching him covered with dust head to toe the fellow managed to look a king who are you rand asked again one of taimвђs men or did you teach yourself you can go to caemlyn you know to the black tower you donвђt have to live afraid of aes sedai for some reason saying that made him frown he could not understand why i have never been afraid of aes sedai the man snapped then drew a deep breath you probably should leave here now but if you intend to stay and kill sammael you had better try thinking like him you have shown you can he always liked destroying a man in sight of one of that manвђs triumphs if he could lacking that somewhere the man had marked as his would do the waygate rand said slowly if he could be said to have marked anything in shadar logoth it had to be the waygate heвђs waiting near the waygate and he has traps set wards as well it seemed like those in illian to detect a man channeling sammael had planned this well the man laughed wryly you can find the way it seems if youвђre led by the hand try not to stumble a great many plans will have to be relaid if you let yourself be killed now turning he started across the street for an alleyway just ahead of them wait rand called the fellow kept on not looking back who are you what plans the man vanished into the alley rand teetered after him but when he reached the mouth of the narrow alley it was empty unbroken walls ran a good hundred paces to another street where a glow told of yet another part of mashadar abroad but the man was gone which was purely impossible the fellow had had time to make a gateway of course if he knew how but the residue would have been visible and besides that much of saidinbeing woven so near would have shouted at him suddenly he realized that he had not felt saidinwhen the man made balefire either just thinking of that of the two streams touching made his vision double again just for an instant he could see the manвђs face again sharp where everything else blurred he shook his head until it cleared who in the light are you he whispered and after a moment what in the light are you whoever or whatever the man was gone though sammael was still in shadar logoth with an effort he managed to regain the void once more the taint on saidinvibrated now humming its way deep into him the void itself vibrated but the weakness of watery muscles and the pain of injuries faded he wasgoing to kill one of the forsaken before this night was done limping he ghosted through the dark streets placing his feet with great care he still made noise but the night was full of noise now shrieks and guttural cries sounded in the distance mindless mashadar killed whatever it found and trollocs were dying in shadar logoth tonight as they had once long long ago sometimes down a crossing street he saw trollocs two or five or a dozen occasionally with a halfman but most often not none saw him and he did not bother them not simply because sammael would detect any channeling those trollocs and myrddraal that mashadar did not kill were still dead sammael had almost certainly brought them by the ways but apparently he did not realize just how rand had marked the waygate here well short of the square where the waygate lay rand stopped and looked around nearby a tower stood seemingly whole not nearly as tall as some its top still rose more than fifty paces above the ground the dark doorway at its base was empty the wood long rotted away and the hinges gone to dust through blackness relieved only by faint starlight through the windows he climbed the winding stairs slowly small clouds puffing up beneath his boots every second step a stab of pain up his leg distant pain on the tower top he leaned against the smooth parapet to catch his breath the idle thought came that he would never hear the end if min learned of this min or amys or cadsuane for that matter across missing rooftops he could see the great square that had been one of the most important in aridhol once an ogier grove had covered this part of the land but within thirty years after the ogier who had built the oldest parts of the city departed the residents had cut down the trees to make room for expanding aridhol palaces and the remains of palaces surrounded the huge square the glow of mashadar shining deep inside a few windows and a huge mound of rubble covered one end but in the center stood the waygate apparently a tall broad piece of stone he was not close enough to see the delicately carved leaves and vines that covered it but he could make out the toppled pieces of high fence that had once surrounded it powerwrought metal lying in a heap they gleamed untarnished in the night he could also see the trap he had woven around the waygate inverted so no eye but his could see it no way to tell by looking whether the trollocs and halfmen really had passed through it yet if they had they would die before long a nasty thing whatever traps sammael had made down there were invisible to him but that was expected likely they were not very pleasant either at first he could not see sammael but then someone moved among the fluted flaring columns of a palace rand waited he wanted to be sure he had only one chance the figure stepped forward out of the columns and a pace into the square head swinging this way and that sammael with snowy lace shining at his throat waiting to see rand walk into the square into the traps behind him the glow in the windows of the palace brightened sammael peered into the darkness lying across the square and mashadar oozed out of the windows thick billows of silvergray fog sliding together merging as they loomed above his head sammael walked a little to one side and the wave began to descend slowly picking up speed as it fell rand shook his head sammael was his the flows needed for balefire seemed to gather themselves despite the far echo of cadsuaneвђs voice he raised his hand a scream tore the darkness a woman shrieking in agony beyond knowing rand saw sammael turn to stare toward the great mound of rubble even as his own eyes flashed that way atop the mound a shape stood outlined against the night sky in coat and breeches a single thin tendril of mashadar touching her leg arms outstretched she thrashed about unable to move from the spot and her wordless wail seemed to call randвђs name liah he whispered unconsciously he reached out as though he could stretch his arm across the intervening distance and pull her away nothing could save what mashadar touched though no more than anything could have saved him had fainвђs dagger plunged into his heart liah he whispered and balefire leaped from his hand for less than a heartbeat the shape of her still seemed to be there all in stark blacks and snowy whites and then she was gone dead before her agony began screaming rand swept the balefire down toward the square the rubble collapsing on itself swept down death out of time вђ and let saidingo before the bar of white touched the lake of mashadar that now rolled across the square billowing past the waygate toward rivers of glowing gray that flowed out from another palace on the other side sammael had to be dead he had to be there had not been time for him to run no time to weave a gateway and if he had rand would have felt saidinbeing worked sammael was dead killed by an evil almost as great as himself emotion raced across the outside of the void rand wanted to laugh or perhaps cry he had come here to kill one of the forsaken but instead he had killed a woman he had abandoned here to her fate for a long time he stood on the tower top while the waning moon crossed the sky almost at its half stood watching mashadar fill the square completely till only the very top of the waygate rose above the surface of the fog slowly it began to ebb away hunting elsewhere if sammael had been alive he could have killed the dragon reborn easily then rand was not sure that he would have cared finally he opened a gateway for skimming and made a platform a railless disc half white and half black skimming was slower than traveling it took him at least half an hour to reach illian and the whole way he burned liahвђs name into his mind again and again flailing himself with it he wished he could cry he thought he had forgotten how they were waiting for him in the kingвђs palace in the throne room bashere and dashiva and the ashaвђman it was exactly like the room he had seen at the other end of the square down to the standlamps and the scenes carved into the marble walls and the long white dais exactly the same except for being slightly larger in every dimension and instead of nine chairs on the dais there was only a great gilded throne with leopards for its arms and nine fistsized golden bees that would stand above the head of whoever sat in it wearily rand sat himself down on the steps at the front of the dais i take it sammael is dead bashere said looking him up and down in his ragged coat and dust heвђs dead rand said dashiva sighed loudly with relief the city is ours bashere went on or i should say yours he laughed suddenly the fighting stopped quick enough once the right people found out it was you not much to it in the end dried blood made a black stain down one torn sleeve of his coat the council has been waiting eagerly for you to come back anxiously you might say he added with a wry grin eight sweating men had been standing at the far end of the throne room since rand came in they wore dark silk coats with gold or silver embroidery on the lapels and sleeves and falls of lace at their throats and wrists some wore a beard that left the upper lip shaved clean but every one had a broad sash of green silk slanted across his chest with nine golden bees marching up it at bashereвђs gesture they came forward bowing to rand at about every third step for all the world as though he wore the finest garments sewn a tall man seemed to be the leader a roundfaced fellow with one of those beards with a natural dignity that appeared strained by worry my lord dragon he said bowing again and pressing both hands to his heart forgive me but lord brend do be nowhere to be found and вђ he wonвђt be rand said flatly a muscle in the manвђs face jumped at randвђs tone and he swallowed as you do say my lord dragon he murmured i do be lord gregorin den lushenos my lord dragon in lord brendвђs absence i do speak for the council of nine we do offer you a hand at his side waved vigorously at a shorter beardless man who stepped forward bearing a cushion draped with a length of green silk we do offer you illian the shorter man whipped the cloth away revealing a heavy gold circlet two inches wide of laurel leaves the city do be yours of course gregorin went on anxiously we did put an end to all resistance we do offer you the crown and the throne and all of illian rand stared at the crown on its cushion not moving a muscle people had thought he meant to make himself a king in tear feared he would in cairhien and andor but no one had offeredhim a crown before why is mattin stepaneos so willing to give up his throne king mattin did disappear two days ago gregorin said some of us do fear we do fear lord brend may have something to with it brend does have he stopped to swallow brend did have a great deal of influence with the king some might say too much but he did be distracted in recent months and mattin had begun to reassert himself strips of grimy coatsleeve and pieces of shirtsleeve dangled as rand reached to pick up the laurel crown the dragon wound around his forearm glittered in the lamplight as brightly as the golden crown he turned it in his hands you still havenвђt said why because i conquered you he had conquered tear and cairhien too but some turned on him in both lands still yet it seemed to be the only way that do be part gregorin said dryly even so we might have chosen one of our own kings have come from the council before but the grain you did order sent from tear has your name on every lip with the light without that many would be dead of starvation brend did see every stick of bread go to the army rand blinked and snatched one hand from the crown to suck on a pricked finger almost buried among the laurel leaves of the crown were the sharp points of swords how long ago had he commanded the tairens to sell grain to their ancient enemy sell it or die for refusing he had not realized they kept on after he began preparations to invade illian maybe they feared to bring it up but they had feared to stop too maybe he had earned some right to this crown gingerly he set the circle of laurel leaves on his head half those swords pointed up half down no head would wear this crown casually or easily gregorin bowed smoothly the light illumine rand alвђthor king of illian he intoned and the seven other lords bowed with him murmuring the light illumine rand alвђthor king of illian bashere contented himself with a bow of his head вђ he was uncle to a queen after all вђ but dashiva cried out all hail rand alвђthor king of the world flinn and the other ashaвђman took it up all hail rand alвђthor king of the world all hail the king of the world that had a good sound to it the story spread as stories will and changed as stories change with time and distance spreading out from illian by coasting ships and merchant trains of wagons and pigeons sent in secret spreading in ripples that danced with other ripples and made new an army had come to illian the stories said an army of aiel of aes sedai appearing from thin air of men who could channel riding winged beasts even an army of saldaeans though not many believed that one some tales said the dragon reborn had been presented the laurel crown of illian by the council of nine and others by martin stepaneos himself on bended knee some said the dragon reborn had wrenched the crown from martinвђs head then stuck that head on a spike no the dragon reborn had razed illian to the ground and buried the old king in the rubble no he and his army of ashaвђman had burned illian out of the earth no it was ebou dar he had destroyed after illian one fact though turned up again and again in those tales the laurel crown of illian had been given a new name the crown of swords and for some reason men and women who told the tales often found a need to add almost identical words the storm is coming they said staring southward in worry the storm is coming master of the lightnings rider on the storm wearer of a crown of swords spinnerout of fate who thinks he turns the wheel of time may learn the truth too late from a fragmentary translation of the prophecies of the dragon attributed to lord mangore kiramin swordbard of ramaelle and warder to caraighan maconar into what was then called the vulgar tongue circa ab the end of the seventh book of the wheel of time
