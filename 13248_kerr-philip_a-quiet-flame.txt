philip kerr a quiet flame para los desaparecidos buenos aires the boat was the ss giovanni which seemed only appropriate given the fact that at least three of its passengers including myself had been in the ss it was a mediumsized boat with two funnels a view of the sea a wellstocked bar and an italian restaurant this was fine if you liked italian food but after four weeks at sea at eight knots all the way from genoa i didnt like it and i wasnt sad to get off either im not much of a sailor or there was something else wrong with me other than the company i was keeping these days we steamed into the port of buenos aires along the gray river plate and this gave me and my two fellow travelers a chance to reflect upon the proud history of our invincible german navy somewhere at the bottom of the river near montevideo lay the wreck of the graf spee a pocket battleship that had been invincibly scuttled by its commander in december to prevent it from falling into the hands of the british as far as i knew this was as near as the war ever came to argentina in the north basin we docked alongside the customs house a modern city of tall concrete buildings lay spread out to the west of us beyond the miles of rail track and the warehouses and the stockyards where buenos aires got startedas a place where cattle from the argentine pampas arrived by train and were slaughtered on an industrial scale so far so german but then the carcasses were frozen and shipped all over the world exports of argentine beef had made the country rich and transformed buenos aires into the thirdlargest city in the americas after new york and chicago the three million population called themselves portenospeople of the portwhich sounds pleasantly romantic my two friends and i called ourselves refugees which sounds better than fugitives but thats what we were rightly or wrongly there was a kind of justice awaiting all of us back in europe and our red cross passports concealed our true identities i was no more dr carlos hausner than adolf eichmann was ricardo klement or herbert kuhlmann was pedro geller this was fine with the argentines they didnt care who we were or what wed done during the war even so on that cool and damp winter morning in july it seemed there were still certain official proprieties to be observed an immigration clerk and a customs officer came aboard the ship and as each passenger presented documents they asked questions if these two didnt care who we were or what wed done they did a good job giving us the opposite impression the mahoganyfaced immigration clerk regarded eichmanns flimsylooking passport and then eichmann himself as if both had arrived from the center of a cholera epidemic this wasnt so far from the truth europe was only just recovering from an illness called nazism that had killed more than fifty million people profession the clerk asked eichmann eichmanns meat cleaver of a face twitched nervously technician he said and mopped his brow with a handkerchief it wasnt hot but eichmann seemed to feel a different kind of heat from that felt by anyone else i ever met meanwhile the customs official who smelled like a cigar factory turned to me his nostrils flared as if he could smell the money i was carrying in my bag and then he lifted his cracked lip off his bamboo teeth in what passed for a smile in that line of work i had about thirty thousand austrian schillings in that bag which was a lot of money in austria but not so much money when it was converted into real money i didnt expect him to know that in my experience customs officials can do almost anything they want except be generous or forgiving when they catch sight of large quantities of currency whats in the bag he asked clothes toiletries some money would you mind showing me no i said minding very much i dont mind at all i heaved the bag onto a trestle table and was just about to unbuckle it when a man hurried up the ships gangway shouting something in spanish and then in german its all right im sorry im late theres no need for all this formality theres been a misunderstanding your papers are quite in order i know because i prepared them myself he said something else in spanish about the three of us being important visitors from germany and immediately the attitude of the two officials changed both men came to attention the immigration clerk facing eichmann handed him back his passport clicked his heels and then gave europes most wanted man the hitler salute with a loud heil hitler that everyone on deck must have heard eichmann turned several shades of red and like a giant tortoise shrank a little into the collar of his coat as if he wished he might disappear kuhlmann and i laughed out loud enjoying eichmanns embarrassment and discomfort as he snatched back his passport and stormed down the gangway and onto the quay we were still laughing as we joined eichmann in the back of a big black american car with a sign vianord displayed in the windshield i dont think that was in the least bit funny said eichmann sure you dont i said thats what makes it so funny you should have seen your face ricardo said kuhlmann what on earth possessed him to say that of all things and to you of all people kuhlmann started to laugh again heil hitler indeed i thought he made a pretty good job of it i said for an amateur our host who had jumped into the drivers seat now turned around to shake our hands im sorry about that he told eichmann some of these officials are just pigignorant in fact the words we have for pig and public official are the same chanchos we call them both chanchos i wouldnt be at all surprised if that idiot believes hitler is still the german leader god i wish he was murmured eichmann rolling his eyes into the roof of the car how i wish he was my name is horst fuldner said our host but my friends in argentina call me carlos small world i said thats what my friends in argentina call me both of them some people came down the gangway and peered inquisitively through the passenger window at eichmann can we get away from here he asked please better do as he says carlos i said before someone recognizes ricardo here and telephones david bengurion you wouldnt joke about that if you were in my shoes said eichmann the soaps would stop at nothing to kill me fuldner started the car and eichmann relaxed visibly as we drove smoothly away since you mentioned the soaps said fuldner its worth discussing what to do if any of you is recognized nobodys going to recognize me kuhlmann said besides its the canadians who want me not the jews all the same said fuldner ill say it anyway after the spanish and the italians the soaps are the countrys largest ethnic group only we call them los rusos on account of the fact that most of the ones who are here came to get away from the russian czars pogrom which one eichmann asked how do you mean there were three pogroms said eichmann one in one between and and a third that got started the kishinev pogrom ricardo knows everything about jews i said except how to be nice to them oh i should think the most recent pogrom said fuldner it figures said eichmann ignoring me the kishinev was the worst thats when most of them came to argentina i think there are as many as a quarter of a million jews here in buenos aires they live in three main neighborhoods which i advise you to steer clear of villa crespo along corrientes belgrano and once if you think you are recognized dont lose your head dont make a scene keep calm cops here are heavyhanded and none too bright like that chancho on the boat if theres any kind of trouble theyre liable to arrest you and the jew who thinks hes recognized you so theres not much chance of a pogrom here then observed eichmann lord no said fuldner thank goodness said kuhlmann ive had enough of all that nonsense we havent had anything like that since whats called tragic week and even that was mostly political anarchists you know back in anarchists bolsheviks jews theyre all the same animal said eichmann who had become unusually talkative of course during the last war the government issued an order forbidding all jewish immigration to argentina but more recently things have changed the americans have put pressure on peron to soften our jewish policy to let them come and settle here i wouldnt be surprised if there were more jews on that boat than anyone else thats a comforting thought said eichmann its all right insisted fuldner youre quite safe here portenos dont give a damn about what happened in europe least of all to the jews besides nobody believes half of whats been in the englishlanguage papers and on the newsreels half would be quite bad enough i murmured it was enough to push a stick through the spokes of a conversation i was starting to dislike but mostly it was just eichmann i disliked i much preferred the other eichmann the one who had spent the last four weeks saying almost nothing and keeping his loathsome opinions to himself it was too soon to have much of an opinion about carlos fuldner from the back of his welloiled head i judged fuldner to be around forty his german was fluent but with a little soft color on the edges of the tones to speak the language of goethe and schiller you have to stick your vowels in a pencil sharpener he liked to talk that much was evident he wasnt tall and he wasnt goodlooking but then he wasnt short or ugly either just ordinary in a good suit with good manners and a nice manicure i got another look at him when he pulled up at a level crossing and turned around to offer us some cigarettes his mouth was wide and sensuous his eyes were lazy but intelligent and his forehead was as high as a church cupola if youd been casting a movie youd have picked him to play a priest or a lawyer or maybe a hotel manager he snapped his thumb on a dunhill lit his cigarette then began telling us about himself that was fine by me now that we were no longer talking about jews eichmann stared out of the window and looked bored but im the kind who listens politely to stories about my redeemer after all thats why my mother sent me to sunday school i was born here in buenos aires to german immigrants said fuldner but for a while we went back to live in germany in kassel where i went to school after school i worked in hamburg then in i joined the ss and was a captain before being seconded to the sd to run an intelligence operation back here in argentina since the war i and a few others have been running vianorda travel agency dedicated to helping our old comrades to escape from europe of course none of it would be possible without the help of the president and his wife eva it was during evitas trip to rome in to meet the pope that she began to see the necessity of giving men such as you a fresh start in life so theres still some antisemitism in the country after all i remarked kuhlmann laughed and so did fuldner but eichmann remained silent its good to be with germans again said fuldner humor is not a national characteristic of the argentines theyre much too concerned with their dignity to laugh at very much least of all themselves they sound a lot like fascists i said thats another thing fascism here is only skindeep the argentines dont have the will or the inclination to be proper fascists maybe im going to like it here more than i thought i said really exclaimed eichmann dont mind me herr fuldner i said im not quite as rabid as our friend here wearing the bow tie and glasses thats all hes still in denial to do with all kinds of things for all i know he still holds fast to the idea that the third reich is going to last for a thousand years you mean it isnt kuhlmann chuckled must you make a joke about everything hausner eichmanns tone was testy and impatient i only make jokes about the things that strike me as funny i said i wouldnt dream of making a joke about something really important not and risk upsetting you ricardo i felt eichmanns eyes burning into my cheek and when i turned to face him his mouth went thin and puritanical for a moment he continued staring at me with the air of one who wished it was down the sights of a rifle what are you doing here herr doktor hausner the same thing as you ricardo im getting away from it all yes but why why you dont seem like much of a nazi im the beefsteak kind brown on the outside only inside im really quite red eichmann stared out the window as if he couldnt bear to look at me for a minute longer i could use a good steak murmured kuhlmann then youve come to the right place said fuldner in germany a steak is a steak but here its a patriotic duty we were still driving through the dockyards most of the names on the bonded warehouses and oil tanks were british or american oakley watling glasgow wire wainwright brothers ingham clark english electric crompton parkinson and western telegraph in front of a big open warehouse a dozen rolls of newsprint the size of hayricks were turning to pulp in the earlymorning rain laughing fuldner pointed them out there he said almost triumphantly thats peronism in action peron doesnt close down opposition newspapers or arrest their editors he doesnt even stop them from having newsprint he just makes sure that by the time it reaches them the newsprint isnt fit to use you see peron has all the major labor unions in his pocket thats your argentine brand of fascism right there buenos aires buenos aires looked and smelled like any european capital city before the war as we drove through the busy streets i wound down the window and took a deep euphoric breath of exhaust fumes cigar smoke coffee expensive cologne cooked meat fresh fruit flowers and money it was like returning to earth after a journey into space germany with its rationing and war damage and guilt and allied tribunals seemed a million miles away in buenos aires there was lots of traffic because there was lots of petrol the carefree people were well dressed and well fed because the shops were full of clothes and food far from being a remote backwater buenos aires was almost a belle epoque throwback almost the safe house was at calle monasterio in the florida district fuldner said florida was the smartest part of buenos aires but you wouldnt have known it from the inside of the safe house the outside was shielded by a carapace of overgrown pine trees and it was called a safe house probably because from the street you wouldnt have known it was there at all inside you knew it was there but wished it werent the kitchen was rustic the ceiling fans were just rusty the wallpaper in all the rooms was yellow although not by design and the furniture looked as if it was trying to return to nature poisonous half decayed vaguely fungal it was the kind of house that belonged in a bottle of formaldehyde i was shown to a bedroom with a broken shutter a threadbare rug and a brass bed with a mattress as thin as a slice of rye bread and about as comfortable through the grimy cobwebbed window i looked out onto a little garden overgrown with jasmine ferns and vines there was a small fountain that hadnt worked in a while a cat had littered several kittens in it right underneath a copper waterspout that was as green as the cats eyes but it wasnt all bad news at least i had my own bathroom the bathtub was full of old books but that didnt mean i couldnt take a bath in it i like to read when im in the bath another german was already staying there his face was red and puffy and there were bags under his eyes like a naval cooks hammock his hair was the color of straw and about as tidy and his body was thin and scarred with what looked like bullet holes these were easy to see because he wore his malodorous remnant of a dressing gown off one shoulder like a toga on his legs were varicose veins as big as fossilized lizards he seemed a stoic sort who probably slept in a barrel but for the pint of liquor in his dressinggown pocket and the monocle in his eye which added a jaunty polished touch it looked like a sprig of parsley on a cowpat fuldner introduced him as fernando eifler but i didnt suppose that was his real name the three of us smiled politely but we were all possessed of the same thought that if we stayed in the safe house long enough we would end up like fernando eifler i say do any of you chaps have a cigarette asked eifler i seem to have run out kuhlmann handed one over and helped him get it alight meanwhile fuldner apologized for the poor quarters saying it was only for a few days and explained that the only reason eifler was still there was that he had turned down every job offered to him by the daie the organization that had brought us to argentina he said this quite matteroffactly but our new housemate bristled noticeably i didnt come halfway around the world to work eifler said sourly what do you take me for im a german officer and a gentleman not a bloody bank clerk really fuldner its too much to expect there was no talk of working for a living when we were back in genoa id never have come if id known you people expected me to earn my bread and butter i mean its bad enough that one has to leave ones family home in germany without obliging one to accept the added humiliation of reporting regularly to an employer perhaps youd have preferred it if the allies had hanged you herr eifler said eichmann an american noose or an argentinean halter said eifler its not much of a choice for a man of my background frankly i should prefer to have been shot by the popovs than face a clerks desk at nine oclock every morning its uncivilized he smiled thinly at kuhlmann thank you for the cigarette and by the way welcome to argentina now if youll excuse me gentlemen he bowed stiffly limped into his room and closed the door behind him fuldner shrugged and said some find it harder to adjust than others especially aristocrats like eifler i might have known sniffed eichmann ill leave you and herr geller to settle in fuldner told eichmann then he looked at me herr hausner you have an appointment this morning me yes were going to the police station at moreno he said to the registry of foreign persons all new arrivals have to report there in order to obtain a cedula de identidad i can assure you its only a matter of routine herr doktor hausner photographs and fingerprints that kind of thing youll all need to have one to work of course but for appearances sake its best you dont all go at the same time but outside the safe house fuldner confessed that while it was true that all of us would require a cedula from the local police station this was not in fact where we were now going only i had to tell them something he said i could hardly tell them where were really going without hurting their feelings we certainly wouldnt want that to happen no i said climbing into the car and please when we come back dont for christs sake say where youve been thanks to eifler theres already enough resentment in that house without you adding to the store of it of course itll be our little secret youre making a joke he said starting the engine and driving us away but im the one whos going to be laughing when you find out where youre going dont tell me im being deported already no nothing like that were going to see the president juan peron wants to see me fuldner laughed just like hed said he would i guess my face did look kind of silly at that what did i do win an important award most promising nazi newcomer to argentina believe it or not peron likes to greet a lot of german officers who arrive here in argentina personally hes very fond of germany and the germans its not everyone you can say that about he is a military man after all i imagine thats why they made him a general he likes to meet medical men most of all perons grandfather was a doctor he himself wanted to be a doctor but instead he went to the national military academy its an easy mistake to make i said killing people instead of healing them dropping a couple of ice cubes into my voice i said dont think im not well aware of the great honor carlos but you know its been quite a few years since i plugged my ears with a stethoscope i hope hes not looking to me to come up with a cure for cancer or to give him the gossip from the latest german medical journal after all ive been hiding out in the coal shed for the last five years relax said fuldner youre not the first nazi doctor ive had to introduce to the president and i dont suppose youll be the last your being a medical man is merely a confirmation of the fact that you are an educated man and a gentleman when the occasion demands i can pass for a gentleman i said i buttoned my shirt collar straightened my tie and checked my watch does he always receive visitors with his boiled eggs and his newspaper peron is usually in his office by seven said fuldner in there the casa rosada fuldner nodded at a pinkcolored building at the far side of a plaza lined with palm trees and statuary it looked like an indian maharajahs palace id once seen in a magazine pink i said my favorite color for a government building who knows maybe hitler might still have been in power if hed had the reich chancellery painted a nicer color than gray theres a story why its pink said fuldner dont tell me itll help me to relax if i can think of peron as the kind of president who prefers pink believe me carlos this is all very reassuring that reminds me you were joking about being a red werent you i was in a soviet prison camp for almost two years carlos what do you think he drove around to a side entrance and waved a security pass at the guard on the barrier before carrying on through to a central courtyard in front of an ornate marble stairway stood two grenadiers with tall hats and drawn sabers they looked like an illustration from an old fairy tale i glanced up at the loggiastyle upper gallery that overlooked the courtyard half expecting to see zorro show up for a fencing lesson instead i caught sight of a neat little blonde eyeing us with interest she was wearing more diamonds than seemed decent at breakfast time and an elaborate bakers loaf of a hairstyle i thought i might borrow a saber and cut myself a slice of it if i got a bit peckish thats her said fuldner evita the presidents wife somehow i didnt think she was the cleaning lady not with all the mints shes wearing we walked up the stairway into a richly furnished hall where several women were milling about despite the fact perons was a military dictatorship nobody up here was wearing a uniform when i remarked on this fuldner told me that peron didnt care for uniforms preferring a degree of informality that people sometimes found surprising i might also have remarked that the women in the hall were very beautiful and that perhaps he preferred them to uglier ones in which case he was a dictator after my own heart the kind of dictator i would have been myself if a highly developed sense of social justice and democracy had not hindered my own will to power and autocracy contrary to what fuldner had told me it seemed that the president had not yet arrived at his desk and while we awaited his much anticipated arrival one of the secretaries fetched us coffee on a little silver tray then we smoked the secretaries smoked too everyone in buenos aires smoked for all i knew even the cats and dogs had a twentyaday habit then outside the high windows i heard a noise like a lawn mower i put down my coffee cup and went to take a look i was just in time to see a tall man climbing off a motor scooter it was the president although i would hardly have known that from his modest means of transport or his casual appearance i kept comparing peron with hitler and trying to imagine the fuhrer dressed for golf and riding a limegreen scooter down the wilhelmstrasse the president parked the scooter and came up the stairs two at a time his thick english brogues hitting the marble steps like the sound of someone working the heavy bag in the gym he may have looked more like a golfer in his flat cap tancolored zipup cardigan brown plusfours and thick woolen socks but he had a boxers grace and build not quite six feet tall with dark hair brushed back on his head and a nose more roman than the colosseum he reminded me of primo carnera the italian heavyweight they would have been about the same age too i figured peron to be in his early fifties the dark hair looked as if it got blacked and polished every day when the grenadiers cleaned their riding boots one of the secretaries handed him some papers while another threw open the double doors of his office in there the look was more conventionally autocratic there were lots of equestrian bronzes oak paneling portraits that were still wet expensive rugs and corinthian columns he waved us to a couple of leather armchairs tossed the papers onto a desk the size of a trebuchet and flung his cap and jacket to another secretary who hugged them to her notinsubstantial bosom in a way that made me think she wished he was still wearing them someone else brought him a little demitasse of coffee a glass of water a gold pen and a gold holder with a cigarette already lit he took a loud sip of coffee put the holder in his mouth picked up the pen and started to add his signature to the documents presented earlier i was close enough to pay attention to his signature style the flourishing egoistic capital j the aggressive showy final downward stroke of the n of peron on the basis of his handwriting i made a quick psychological evaluation of the man and concluded that he was the neurotic analretentive type who preferred people to be able to read what he had actually written not like a doctor at all i told myself with relief apologizing in almost fluent german for keeping us waiting peron carried a silver cigarette box to our fingers then we shook hands and i felt the heavy knob of bone at the base of his thumb that made me think yet again of him as a boxer that and the broken veins under the thin skin that covered his high cheekbones and the dental plate that was revealed by his easy smile in a country where no one has a sense of humor the smiling man is king i smiled back thanked him for his hospitality and then complimented the president on his german in spanish no please peron answered in german i very much enjoy speaking german its good practice for me when i was a young cadet at our military school all of our instructors were germans this was before the great war in we had to learn german because our weapons were german and all of our technical manuals were in german we even learned to goosestep every day at six pm my grenadiers goosestep onto the plaza de mayo to take the flag down from the pole the next time you visit you must make sure its at that time so that you can see for yourself i will sir i let him light my cigarette but i think my own goosestepping days are over these days its as much as i can do to climb a set of stairs without running out of breath me too peron grinned but i try to keep fit i like to ride and to ski when i have the chance in i went skiing in the alps in austria and germany germany was wonderful then a welloiled machine it was like being inside one of those great big mercedesbenz motorcars smooth and powerful and exciting yes it was an important time in my life yes sir i kept on smiling at him as though i agreed with every word he said the fact was i hated the sight of goosestepping soldiers to me it was one of the most unpleasant sights in the world something both terrifying and ridiculous that defied you to laugh at it and as for it had been an important time in everyones life especially if you happened to be polish or french or british or even german who in europe would ever forget how are things in germany right now he asked for the ordinary fellow theyre pretty tough i said but it really depends on whose zone youre in worst of all is the soviet zone of occupation things are hardest of all where the ivans are in charge even for the ivans most people just want to put the war behind them and get on with the reconstruction its amazing what has been achieved in such a short period of time said peron oh i dont just mean reconstruction of our cities sir although of course that is important no i mean the reconstruction of our most fundamental beliefs and institutions freedom justice democracy a parliament a fairminded police force an independent judiciary eventually when all of that has been recovered we might regain some selfrespect perons eyes narrowed i must say you dont sound very much like a nazi he said it has been five years sir i said since we lost the war theres no point in thinking about whats gone germany needs to look to the future thats what we need in argentina said peron some forward thinking a bit of the german cando eh fuldner absolutely sir if you dont mind me saying so sir i said but from what ive seen so far theres nothing germany can teach argentina this is a very catholic country dr hausner he told me its very set in its ways we need modern thinking we need scientists good managers technicians doctors like yourself he clapped me on the shoulder two little poodles ambled in accompanied by a strong smell of expensive perfume and out of the corner of my eye i saw that the blonde with the kudamm hairdo and the diamonds had entered the room with her were two men one was of medium height with fair hair and a mustache and a quiet unassuming way about him the other looked older about forty and was taller and physically more powerful he was grayhaired and wore thickframed tinted glasses and a small beard and mustache something about him made me think he might be a cop will you practice medicine again peron asked me im sure we can make that possible rodolfo the younger man by the door unfolded his arms and pushed himself off the wall he glanced at the man with the beard for a moment if the police have no objection his german was every bit as fluent as his masters the man with the beard shook his head ill ask ramon carrillo to look into it shall i sir said rodolfo from the pocket of his beautifully tailored pinstripe suit he took out a small leather notebook and made a note with a silver propelling pencil peron nodded please do he said clapping me on the shoulder a second time in spite of his declared admiration for goosestepping i found myself liking the president i liked him for his motor scooter and his ridiculous plusfours i liked him for his sluggers paw and his stupid little dogs i liked him for his warm welcome and the easy way he had about him andwho knowsmaybe i liked him because i badly needed to like someone maybe thats why he was president i dont know but there was something about juan peron that made me want to take a gamble on him which is why after months of pretending to be someone else who was pretending to be dr carlos hausner i decided to level with him about who and what i really was buenos aires i put out my cigarette in an ashtray as big as a wheel hub which lay on the presidents uncluttered desk next to the ashtray was a van cleef arpels jewelry boxthe leather kind that looks like it would make a swell gift on its own i figured the contents of that box were pinned to the little blondes lapel she was fussing with the dogs as i started my noblesounding monologue it took only a minute to get her attention i flatter myself that when the spirit moves me i can make myself more interesting than any small dog besides i guessed it wasnt every day that someone in the presidents office tells him hed made a mistake mr president sir i said i think theres something i should tell you since this is a catholic country maybe you can call it confession seeing all their faces blanch i smiled its all right im not about to tell you about all the terrible things i did during the war there were some things im not happy about sure but i dont have the lives of innocent men and women on my conscience no my confession is something much more ordinary you see im not a doctor at all sir there was a doctor back in germany a fellow named gruen he wanted to go and live in america only he worried what might happen to him if they ever found out what hed done during the war so to take the heat off himself he decided to make it look like i was him then he told the israelis and the allied warcrimes people where to come and look for me anyway he did such a good job of convincing everyone i was him that i was obliged to go on the run eventually i turned for help to the old comrades and the delegation for argentine emigration in europe carlos here dont get me wrong sir im very grateful to be here i had a hard job convincing an israeli death squad that i wasnt gruen and was obliged to leave a couple of them dead in the snow near garmischpartenkirchen so you see i really am a fugitive im just not the fugitive you might think i am and in particular i am not and never have been a doctor so who the hell are you really it was carlos fuldner and he sounded annoyed my real name is bernhard gunther i was in the sd working for intelligence i was captured by the russians and was interned in a camp before escaping but before the war i was a policeman a detective with the berlin police force did you say a detective this was the man with the small beard and the tinted glasses the one id marked down as a cop what kind of a detective i worked in homicide mostly what was your rank asked the cop when war was declared in i was a kok a kriminal oberkommissar a chief inspector then youll remember ernst gennat of course he was my mentor taught me everything i know what was it that the newspapers used to call him the full ernst on account of his bulk and fondness for cakes what happened to him do you know he was deputy chief of the criminal police until his death in he had a heart attack too bad too many cakes gunther gunther he said as though trying to shake a thought like an apple from a tree growing in the back of his head yes of course i know you you do i was in berlin before the collapse of the weimar republic studying jurisprudence at the university the cop came closer close enough for me to smell the coffee and the cigarettes on his breath and took off his glasses i guessed he smoked a lot for one thing there was a cigarette in his mouth and for another his voice sounded like a smoked herring there were laugh lines around the gray iron filings that constituted his mustache and his beard but the walnut of a frown knotted between his bloodshot blue eyes told me that maybe hed got out of the habit of smiling his eyes narrowed as he searched my face for more answers you know you were a hero of mine believe it or not youre one of the reasons i gave up the idea of being a lawyer and became a policeman instead he looked at peron sir this man was a famous berlin detective when i first went there in there was a notorious strangler his name was gormann this is the man who caught him at the time it was quite a cause celebre he looked back at me im right arent i you are that gunther yes sir his name was in all the newspapers i used to follow all your cases as closely as i was able yes indeed you were a hero of mine herr gunther by now he was shaking my hand and now youre here amazing peron glanced at his gold wristwatch i was beginning to bore him the cop saw it too not much escaped him we might have lost the presidents attention altogether if evita hadnt walked up to me and given me a onceover like i was a spavined horse eva perons was a good figure if you liked women who were interesting to draw i never yet have seen a painting that convinces me those old masters preferred women who were skinny evitas figure was interesting in all the right places between the knees and the shoulders which is not to say that i found her attractive she was too cool too businesslike too efficient too composed for my taste i like a little vulnerability in my women especially at breakfast time in her navyblue suit evita already looked dressed to launch a ship somewhere more important than here talking to me anyway on the back of her bottleblond hair was a little navyblue velvet beret while over her arm was a russian winters worth of sables not that any of that caught my eye very much mostly my eyes were on the mint candies she was wearingthe little chandeliers of diamonds in her ears the floral bouquet of diamonds on her lapel and the dazzling golfball on her finger it looked like it had been an excellent year for van cleef arpels so we have a famous detective here in buenos aires she said how very fascinating i dont know about famous i said famous is a word for a boxer or a movie star not a detective sure the police leaders of weimar encouraged the newspapers to believe that some of us were more successful than others but that was just public relations to give the public confidence in our ability to solve crimes im afraid you couldnt write more than a couple of very dull paragraphs in todays newspapers about the kind of detective i was maam eva peron tried a smile but it didnt stay long her lipstick was flawless and her teeth were perfect but her eyes werent in it it was like being smiled at by a temperate glacier your modesty is shall we say typical of all your fellow countrymen she said it seems none of you was ever very important always it is someone else who deserves the credit or more usually the blame isnt that right herr gunther there were a lot of things i might have said to that but when the presidents wife takes a swing at you its best to take it on the chin as though youve got a boilerplated jaw even if it does hurt only ten years ago germans thought they should rule the world now all they want to do is live quietly and be left alone is that what you want herr gunther to live quietly to be left alone it was the cop who came to my aid please maam he said he is just being modest take my word for it herr gunther was a great detective well see she said take the compliment herr gunther if i can remember your name after all these years then surely you would have to agree that in this case at least modesty is misplaced i shrugged perhaps i allowed well said evita i must be going ill leave herr gunther and colonel montalban to their mutual admiration i watched her go i was glad to see the back of her more important i was glad to see her behind even under the presidents eye it demanded attention i didnt know any argentine tango tunes but watching her closely sheathed tail as she stalked gracefully out of her husbands office i felt like humming one in a different room and wearing a clean shirt i might have tried slapping it some men liked slapping a guitar or a set of dominoes with me it was a womans ass it wasnt exactly a hobby but i was good at it a man ought to be good at something when she was gone the president climbed back into the front seat and took over the steering wheel i wondered how much he would let her get away with before he slapped her himself quite a bit probably its a common failing with older dictators when they have younger wives in german peron said dont mind my wife herr gunther she doesnt understand that you spoke fromhe slapped his stomach with the flat of his handdown here you spoke as you felt you had to speak and im flattered that you did so we see something in each other perhaps something important obeying other people is one thing any fool can do that but obeying oneself submitting oneself to the most rigid and implacable of disciplines that is what is important is it not yes sir peron nodded so you are not a doctor therefore we cannot help you practice medicine is there anything else we can do for you there is one thing sir i said maybe im not much of a sailor or maybe im just getting old but lately ive not been feeling myself sir id like to see a doctor if i could a real one find out if theres anything actually wrong with me or if im just homesick although right now that does seem a little unlikely buenos aires several weeks passed i got my cedula and moved out of the safe house on calle monasterio into a nice little hotel called the san martin in the florida district the place was owned and managed by an english couple the lloyds who treated me with such courtesy that it was hard to believe our two countries had ever been at war its only after a war that you actually find out how much you have in common with your enemies i discovered the english were just like us germans with one major advantage they were not german the san martin was full of old world charm with glass cupolas and comfortable furniture and good home cooking if you enjoyed steak and chips it was just around the corner from the more expensive richmond hotel which had a cafe i liked enough to make it a regular port of call the richmond was a clubby sort of place there was a long room with wood panels and pillars and mirrored ceilings and english hunting prints and leather armchairs a small orchestra played tangos and mozart and for all i knew a few mozart tangos the smokefilled basement was a home to men playing billiards men playing dominoes and most important of all men playing chess women were not welcome in the basement at the richmond argentine men took women very seriously too seriously to have them around while they were playing billiards or chess either that or argentine women were just very good at billiards and chess back in berlin during the dog days of the weimar republic id been a regular chess player at the romanisches cafe once or twice i had even had a lesson from the great lasker who was a regular there too it hadnt made me a better player just better able to appreciate being beaten by someone as good as lasker it was in the richmond basement that colonel montalban found me locked in an end game with a diminutive ratfaced scotsman called melville i might have forced a draw if id had the patience of a philidor but then philidor never had to play chess under the eye of the secret police although he almost did luckily for philidor he was in england when the french revolution took place wisely he never went back there are more important things to lose than a game of chess like your head colonel montalban didnt have the cold eye of a robespierre but i felt it on me all the same and instead of asking myself how i was going to exploit my extra pawn to best advantage i started asking myself what the colonel could want with me after that it was just a matter of time before i lost i didnt mind losing to the ratfaced scotsman hed beaten me before what i minded was the free tip that accompanied the clammy handshake you should always put the rook behind the pawn he said in his lisping european spanish which sounds and smells very different from latin american spanish except of course when it is the incorrect thing to do if melville had been lasker i would have welcomed the advice but he was melville a barbedwire sales agent from glasgow with bad breath and an unhealthy interest in young girls montalban followed me upstairs you play a good game he said i do all right at least i do until the cops turn up it takes the edge off my concentration sorry about that dont be i like you being sorry its a load off my mind were not like that in argentina he said its all right to criticize the government thats not the way i heard it and if you ask from whom youll just prove me right colonel montalban shrugged and lit a cigarette theres criticism and theres criticism he said its my job to know the subtle difference i should think thats easy enough when you have your oyentes the oyentes were the people portenos called perons spiespeople who eavesdropped on conversations in bars on buses and even on the telephone the colonel raised his eyebrows so you already know about the oyentes im impressed not that i should be i suppose not from a famous berlin detective like yourself im an exile colonel it pays to keep your mouth shut and your ears open and what is it that you hear i did hear the one about the two river rats one from argentina and the other from uruguay the rat from uruguay was starving so it swam across the river plate in the hope that it might find something to eat halfway across it met an argentine rat swimming in the opposite direction the uruguayan rat was surprised and asked why such a wellfedlooking rat was going to uruguay when there was so much to eat in argentina and the argentine rat told him i just want to squeak now and then colonel montalban smiled wearily its an old joke i pointed at an empty table but the colonel shook his head and then nodded at the door i followed him outside onto florida the street was closed to traffic between the hours of eleven am and four pm so that pedestrians could inspect the attractively dressed windows of big shops like gath chaves in comfort but it could just as easily have been so that men could inspect the attractively dressed women of these there were plenty after munich and vienna buenos aires felt like a paris catwalk the colonel had parked off florida on tucuman outside the claridge hotel his car was a limecolored chevrolet convertible with polished wooden doors whitewall tires red leather seats and on the hood an enormous spotlight in case he needed to interrogate a parking attendant when you sat in it you felt like you should have been towing a waterskier so this is what the polenta drives in ba i remarked running my hand over the door it had the height and feel of a bar top in a deluxe hotel i suppose it made sense a nice pink house for the president a limecolored convertible for his deputy head of security and intelligence fascism never looked so pretty the firing squads probably wore tutus we drove west on moreno with the top up what was probably a cold winters day to the colonel felt pleasantly springlike to me the temperature was in the midteens but most portenos were walking around wearing hats and coats as if it were munich in january where are we going police headquarters my favorite relax he said chuckling theres something i want you to see i hope its your new summer uniforms if so i can save you a journey i think they should be the same color as the casa rosada to help make policemen in argentina more popular its hard not to like a cop when hes wearing pink do you always talk so much what ever happened to keeping your mouth shut and your ears open after twelve years of nazism its nice to squeak a little now and again we drove through the entrance of a handsome nineteenthcentury building that didnt look much like a police station i was beginning to understand a little of argentine culture from a keen appreciation of its architecture it was a very catholic country even the police station looked like there was a basilica inside one that was dedicated probably to saint michael the patron of cops it might not have looked like a police station but it certainly smelled like one all police stations smell of shit and fear colonel montalban led the way through a warren of marblefloored corridors cops carrying files climbed out of our way as we went along im beginning to think you might be someone important i said we stopped outside a door where the air seemed more fetid it made me think of visiting the aquarium at the berlin zoo when i was a child or perhaps the reptile house something wet and slimy and uncomfortable anyway the colonel took out a packet of capstan navy cut offered me one and then lit us both deodorants he said in here is the judicial mortuary do you bring all your first dates here just you my friend i feel i should warn you that im the squeamish sort i dont like mortuaries especially when there are dead bodies in them come now you worked in homicide didnt you that was years ago its the living i want to be with as i get older colonel ill have plenty of opportunity to spend time with the dead when im dead myself the colonel pushed open the door and waited it seemed i didnt have much choice but to go inside the smell got worse like a dead alligator something wet and slimy and definitely dead a man wearing white scrubs and bright green rubber gloves came to meet us he was vaguely indianlooking darkskinned with even darker rings under his eyes one of which was milky like an oyster i had the idea hed just crawled out of one of his body drawers he and the colonel exchanged a silent mime of nods and head jerks and then the green gloves went to work less than a minute later i was looking at the naked body of an adolescent girl at least i think it was a girl what usually passed for clues in this department appeared to be missing and not just the exterior parts but quite a few of the internal ones too id seen more obviously fatal injuries but only on the western front in everything south of her navel appeared to have been mislaid the colonel let me take a good look at her and then said i was wondering if she reminded you of anyone i dont know someone dead her name is grete wohlauf a germanargentine girl she was found in the barrio norte about two weeks ago we think she was strangled more obviously her womb and other reproductive organs had been removed probably by someone who knew what he was doing this was not a frenzied attack as you can see there is a certain clinical efficiency about what has been done here i kept the cigarette in my mouth so that the smoke acted as a screen between my sense of smell and the gutted cadaver that was laid out in front of us like something on an abattoir floor actually the smell was mostly formaldehyde but whenever i caught it in my nostrils it dislodged memories of the many unpleasant things id seen in my time as a berlin homicide detective there were two things i remembered in particular but i saw no reason to mention these to colonel montalban whatever it was he wanted from me i wanted no part of it after a while i turned away and i said i just wondered if this might jog any memories nothing that ought to be in my photograph album she was fifteen years old its too bad yes he said i have a daughter myself a little older than her i dont know what id do if something like this happened he shrugged everything anything i said nothing i imagined he was coming to the point he walked me back to the mortuary door i told you before that i studied jurisprudence in berlin he said fichte von savigny ehrlich my father wanted me to be a lawyer and my mother who is german she wanted me to become a philosopher i myself wanted to travel to europe and after my law degree i was offered the opportunity to study in germany everyone was happy me most of all i loved berlin he pushed open the door and we went back into the corridor outside i had an apartment on the kudamm near the memorial church and that club with the doorman who dressed up as the devil and where the waiters dressed as angels the heaven and hell i said i remember it very well thats right the colonel grinned me a good roman catholic boy id never seen so many naked women before there was one show twentyfive scenes from the life of the marquis de sade it was called and another called the naked frenchwoman her life mirrored in art what a place what a city is it really all gone yes berlin itself is a ruin little more than a building site you wouldnt recognize it too bad he unlocked the door to a little room opposite the judicial mortuary there was a cheap table a few cheap chairs and some cheap ashtrays the colonel drew up a blind and opened a dirty window to let in some fresh air across the street i could see a church and there were people going in the door who knew nothing about forensics and murder and whose nostrils were filled with something better than the smell of cigarettes and formaldehyde i sighed and looked at my watch hardly caring to conceal my impatience now i hadnt asked to see the body of a dead girl i was irritated with him for that and for what i knew was surely coming forgive me he said im just getting to it now what i wanted to talk to you about herr gunther you see ive always been interested in the darker side of human behavior that is why i became interested in you herr gunther you are one of the reasons i became a policeman rather than a lawyer in a sense you helped to save me from a very dull life the colonel drew up a chair for me and we sat down back in there were two sensational murders in the german newspapers there were a lot more than two i said sourly not like these two i remember reading about them in some lurid detail these were lust murders were they not two girls similarly mutilated just like poor grete wohlauf one in berlin and one in munich and you herr gunther you were the investigating detective your picture was in the paper yes i was only i dont see what that has to do with anything the murderer was never caught herr gunther he was never caught thats why were talking i shook my head thats true but look it was almost twenty years ago and several thousand miles away youre surely not suggesting that these three murders might be connected why not the colonel shrugged i have to consider every possibility with the benefit of hindsight it seems to me that these were peculiarly german crimes who was that other fellow who murdered and sexually mutilated all those boys and girls haarmann wasnt it he bit out their throats and cut off their genitals and kurten peter kurten the vampire of dusseldorf lets not forget him shall we haarmann and kurten were executed colonel as im sure you must remember so it can hardly be them now can it of course not but there were other lust murders too as im sure you remember some of them involving mutilation and cannibalism the colonel leaned forward on his chair all right heres where im going with this many germans have come to live here in buenos aires before the war and after the war and not all of them are civilized people like you and me naturally ive been paying close attention to the trials of your socalled war criminals and its quite clear to me that some of your countrymen have done some terrible things unimaginable things so heres my theory if you can call it that not everyone who has come to argentina in the last five years is an angel some might be devils just like in that old berlin club the heaven and hell you will admit that much surely freely you heard what i said to the president yes i did it made me think that you might be a man i could use herr gunther an angel if you like ive never been called that before oh i think you have but ill get to that let me finish this particular train of thought you will also admit i hope that many of your colleagues in the ss enjoyed killing yes i mean it stands to reason doesnt it that some of these men in the ss were psychopaths yes i nodded i can see where youre going with this i think exactly take the case of rudolf hoss the commander of the auschwitz concentration camp hed murdered before in as had martin bormann a man does not become a psychopath because he puts on a uniform therefore it must be the case that there were many psychopaths who found a congenial home in the ss and the gestapo as licensed murderers and torturers i always thought so i said you can imagine my pleasure when i was inducted into the ss in it comes as quite a shock to spend your whole life investigating murder then to be sent to russia and expected to start committing it yourself oh i wasnt suggesting you were a psychopath herr gunther look lets say that in this murderer is not caught in the nazis come to power and he joins the ss where he finds a new socially acceptable means of achieving his lust for cruelty during the war he works in a death camp killing as many as he wants with total impunity and then you invite him to come and live in argentina i grinned i take your point but i dont see how i can help i should have thought it was obvious a chance to reopen an old case im not the neat type colonel and believe me there were plenty of other unsolved cases on our books none of them costs me any sleep the colonel was nodding but i could see that he still had cards to play another girl has gone missing he said here in ba girls go missing all the time darwin called it natural selection a girl selects a young man and naturally her father doesnt like him very much so she runs off with him so i cant appeal to your social conscience i hardly know my way around this city i barely speak the language im a fish out of water not exactly the girl who is missing is of germanargentine origin like grete wohlauf i was thinking you might confine your inquiries to our german community didnt i just explain that i have a hunch were looking for a german you dont need to speak good spanish to do that you dont need to know the city you do need to be a german and to hunt among the people i want you to hunt among you need to be one of them when i said you could be my angel i meant my black angel isnt that what germans called men who were in the ss black angels set a thief to catch a thief is that it something like that yes theyre not going to like that my old comrades they have new names new faces some of them new names new faces and amnesia i could find myself becoming very unpopular with some of the most ruthless men in south america present company excepted i already thought of a way of handling things so that you dont wind up dead i smiled he was persistent i had to give him that much and i was beginning to have a feeling he had already secondguessed all of my objections i bet you have colonel ive even considered your financial situation he said after having converted your money at the bank of london and south americathe branch on calle bartolome mitre wasnt it so much for banking secrecy in this country i said you will have learned that twentyfive thousand austrian schillings is not such a lot by my calculations you have about a thousand dollars which is not going to last you very long in buenos aires a year maybe less if there are unforeseen expenses and its my experience that there are always unforeseen circumstances especially for a man in your position on the other hand im offering you a job unlike the kind of a job carlos fuldner will probably offer you this is a job you would actually be good at working for you in the secret police why not theres a salary a desk in the casa rosada a car theres even a passport a proper one not that piece of shit the red cross gave you with a proper passport you could go back to germany perhaps without having to answer all sorts of awkward questions when you got there after all you would be an argentine citizen think about it perhaps if i had the original case files it might have been possible i shook my head but it was almost twenty years ago probably the files were lost during the war on the contrary theyre here in ba i had them sent from berlin alexanderplatz you did that how the colonel shrugged modestly but still managed to look quite pleased with himself as well he might have done i was impressed with him actually it really wasnt very difficult its the americans who dislike peron and the generals not the russians besides the delegation for argentine immigration in europe has many friends in germany you should know that better than anyone if the daie can get eichmann out of germany a few old files are not going to present much of a problem my compliments colonel you seem to have thought of everything in buenos aires it is better to know everything than it is to know too much said the colonel he crossed his legs and picked some fluff off his knee and waited patiently for my answer i felt certain i was about to trump him but he looked so cool i couldnt help but think he still had something up his sleeve please dont think that im not flattered by your offer i said but right now i have other things on my mind youve thought of everything its true except the one reason why im not going to work for you you see colonel im not well i had heart palpitations on the boat i thought i was having a heart attack anyway i went to see dr espejo the one peron recommended and he says i dont have a heart condition at all the heart palpitations are the result of thyrotoxicosis i have cancer of the thyroid colonel montalban thats why im not going to work for you buenos aires colonel montalban took off his glasses and began to clean their tinted lenses with the end of his woolen tie he was trying not to smile so as not to hurt my feelings but i could see that he really didnt care if he did as if he was trying only a little not to give the game away i guessed what this was but you knew that already didnt you the colonel shrugged and went on polishing what kind of a country is this no banking secrecy and no medical ethics i suppose dr espejo is a friend of yours actually no quite the reverse espejo is what we call a resentido it means he has a chip on his shoulder espejo is a man who dislikes peron intensely i wondered why he seemed to be the only person ive met in this city who doesnt have a picture of the president on his wall i shook my head i dont get it peron recommended a doctor who hates him earlier on you mentioned the oyentes i smiled you have a listening device planted in his surgery several i guess thats one way of making sure you get an honest diagnosis did you perhaps think you didnt it sure didnt feel like espejo was keeping anything back the mans got quite a left hook on him its been a while since anyone caught me one on the chin like that i paused dont tell me he was pulling his punches not at all said the colonel espejos a good doctor but there are better ones if i were you herr gunther i should want to have someone treating me whos more of an expert in these matters than espejo a specialist sounds expensive too expensive for my thousand dollars all the more reason to work for me we have a saying here in argentina we say i cant trust you until i tell you a secret so thats what im going to do im going to trust you with one of the biggest secrets in the country then you will have to help me and i will have to help you it will be a sign of good faith between us what if i prefer not to know what you know i cant tell you b if i dont also tell you a i will tell you b first and then perhaps you will guess a dr george pack is one of the leading cancer specialists in the world he is a consultant at sloankettering in new york he treats patients like the rockefellers and the astors but quite often he also comes here to buenos aires to treat someone equally important no doubt i said the general the colonel shook his head the generals wife he nodded but even she does not know is that possible it is if the general wishes it evita thinks she has a womans problem but its something else i have already spoken to dr pack and as a favor to the general he has agreed to treat you the next time he is in the country at our expense of course the colonel threw his hands up so you see you have no choice no excuse to refuse there isnt one objection you can make that hasnt already been thought of all right i said i can tell when im beaten but you seem to have a lot of faith in my abilities colonel still how can i resist how indeed but is it so hard to accept my admiration for your forensic abilities it would be the same for you and ernst gennat would it not or that other great berlin detective bernard weiss these were your mentors your own heroes for a while yes they were i said all the same it does seem like youve been to a hell of a lot of trouble to have me investigate one murder and one missing girl it might seem that way to you herr gunther but to be brutal with you its really no trouble at all we have some old papers sent from berlin we give you a job we pay you some money we employ a doctor to treat your illness these are easy things to fix when youre a man in my position what could be simpler when you put it like that i said as it happens though he added smoothly the missing girl is no ordinary girl fabienne von bader is what we call a paquete one of the elegant people her father kurt von bader is a close friend of the perons as well as a director of the banco germanico here in ba naturally the police are sparing no effort in looking for her you will be merely a part of that effort perhaps she is already dead perhaps as you suggested she has only run away from home although frankly she is a little young to have a boyfriend shes only fourteen years old grete wohlauf you should leave her to the regular police but fabienne is a different story she should be your main focus from what i hear missing persons were once something of a specialty for you after you left the berlin police in when you were a private detective you seem to know everything about me colonel i said too much for comfort not too much just everything that is important for the purpose of your inquiry you should assume that our potential murderer is a german and confine yourself to the community of recent immigrants and those who are of germanargentine origin you are looking for a psychopath yes but always you are looking for some clue as to the whereabouts of young fabienne von bader it wont be easy asking questions of my old comrades which is why you must choose your questions carefully you must make your questions seem innocent you dont know them i said theres no such thing as an innocent question where theyre concerned the red cross is an admirable institution said the colonel but to go anywhere else outside of this country againgermany for exampleyou will need an argentine passport to get a passport you will have to prove that you have been an argentine resident of good conduct once you have proved this a goodconduct pass will be issued with a conduct pass you can apply to a court of first instance for a passport i thought it would be a good cover story for your inquiry if we said that you are carrying out background checks for the security and intelligence directorate to see whether someone is a suitable candidate for this goodconduct pass that way you can pry into the backgrounds of your old comrades with impunity i daresay most of them will be only too willing to answer all your questions herr gunther no matter how impertinent such a role allows you complete license after all who among your old comrades doesnt want a passport in a new name it might work i said of course it will work a desk will be provided for you at the casa rosada thats where the side is headquartered a car will be yours to use you will receive expenses a salary full side identification and you will report directly to me anything at all no matter how small dr pack will be here in a couple of weeks you can see him then for obvious reasons however id like you to start your inquiry immediately a list of the names and addresses of your old comrades will be given to you at the casa rosada naturally fuldner and the daie have given us some idea of who these people were back in germany what they did and when but of course i should like to know a lot more about them in order to assess what diplomatic and security risk they might pose for us in the future you can update the files as you go clear yes i think so i assume youll want to meet the parents of the missing girl as a matter of priority if i could the colonel nodded he drew open a little drawer in the table from which he removed a leather briefcase from one of the pockets in the briefcase he took out a pistol before emptying the rest of the contents onto the table one smith and wesson semiautomatic pistol one box of ammunition one shoulder holster one drivers license in the name of carlos hausner one side identity warrant in the name of carlos hausner one security pass for the casa rosada in the name of carlos hausner one side manualmake sure you read it carefully one hundred thousand pesos in cash there will be more when you need it naturally receipts are required where possible the manual will tell you exactly how to fill out an expense form youll find everything elsedaie files on german immigrants kripo and gestapo files from alexanderplatzin your filing cabinet at the casa rosada i nodded silently there didnt seem to be any point in mentioning the fact that all of this had been ready before i walked into the police station hed been so sure id agree that i almost told him to go and screw himself i hated him taking me for granted like that but i hated being ill even more so how could i say no we both knew i had no choice not if i wanted to receive the best medical treatment he fiddled in his pocket and handed over some car keys its the one outside the limecolored chevrolet we came in my favorite flavor i said he stood up you can drive cant you i can drive good then you can drive us to retiro he glanced at his watch theyre expecting us so we had better be getting along before we go id like to take another look at that dead body the colonel shrugged if you like was there anything that you noticed nothing apart from the obvious i shook my head i wasnt really paying attention before thats all berlin in a manual of forensic medicine that ernst gennat gave all the bulls that joined department iv there was a photograph that always caused a certain amount of mirth the first time you saw it in the photograph a naked girl was lying on a bed with her hands tied behind her back around her neck was a ligature pulled tight and half of her head had been blown off with a shotgun oh yes and there was a dildo up her ass nothing funny about any of that of course it was the caption underneath the picture that was the funny part it read circumstances arousing suspicion that used to kill us whenever any of us who were assigned to d saw an atrocious and obvious case of homicide we used to repeat the words of that caption it helped lighten things up the body was found in friedrichshain park close to the hospital in the eastern part of berlin the area was popular with children because of the fairytale fountain that was there water flowed down a series of shallow steps that were flanked by ten groups of characters from stories each of us had heard at his mothers knee when the call came into the police praesidium on alexanderplatz it was hoped that the dead girl might have drowned accidentally but one look at the body and i knew different she looked like the victim of the wolf from one of those old fairy tales the kind of big bad wolf who might have tried to eat any one of those little limestone heroes and heroines bloody hell sir said my sergeant kbs heinrich grund as we shone our flashlights over the body circumstances arousing suspicion or what sure looks that way doesnt it only a bit yeah shit wait till the boys at the alex hear about this one there was not a permanent staff of detectives for homicide investigations at the alex d was supposed to be only a supervisory body with three rotating teams of cops from other berlin inspectorates but in practice it didnt work like that by there were three teams on active duty with nothing left in reserve that night i had already driven over to wedding to take a look at the body of a fifteenyearold boy who had been found stabbed to death in a bus shelter the other two teams were still out on cases kok muller was looking into the death of a man found hanging on a lamppost in lichtenrade and kok lipik was in neukolln investigating the fatal shooting of a woman if this sounds like a crime wave it wasnt most of the murders that took place in berlin that spring and early summer were political and but for the titfortat violence carried out by nazi storm troopers and communist cadres the citys crime figures would have shown a declining murder rate during the last months of the weimar republic friedrichshain park was a leafy mile north west of the alex after the call came in we were there in less than twenty minutes me district secretary grund an ordinary criminal secretary an assistant criminal secretary and half a dozen uniformed polenta from the protection policethe schutzpolizei a lust murder do you think asked grund could be theres not much blood around though whatever lust might have been involved must have happened elsewhere i looked up and around the road junction at konigsthor was only a few yards to the west of us whoever it was could have stopped his car on friedenstrasse or am friedrichshain lifted her out of the trunk and carried her here just after it got dark tonight with the park on one side of the road and a couple of cemeteries on the other its a good spot said grund lots of trees and bushes to keep him covered nice and quiet then somewhere to the west of us in the heart of the scheunenviertel we heard two shots fired although not so as youd notice i said hearing a third shot and then a fourth i added sounds like your friends are busy tonight nothing to do with me said grund more likely the always true id have thought this is their patch the always true was one of berlins most powerful criminal gangs but if it was a red who just got shot then presumably that would be to your lots advantage heinrich grund was or had been just about my best friend on the force we had been in the army together there was a picture of him on the wall in my corner of the detectives room in the picture no less a figure than paul von hindenburg the president of the republic was presenting heinrich with the victors plaque for winning the prussian police boxing championships but the previous week i had discovered that my old friend had joined the nsbagthe national socialist fellowship of civil servants as he was a boxer with a reputation for using the head i had to admit that being a nazi suited him all the same it felt like a betrayal what makes you think it was a nazi shooting a red and not a red shooting a nazi i can tell the difference how its a full moon isnt it thats usually the time when werewolves and nazis creep out of their holes to commit murder very funny grund smiled patiently and lit a cigarette he blew out the match and careful not to contaminate the crime scene put it in his vest pocket he might have been a nazi but he was still a good detective and your lot theyre so different are they my lot what lot is that come on bernie everyone knows the official supports the reds the official was the union of prussian police officers to which i belonged it wasnt the biggest union that was the general but the important names in the generals leadershippolicemen like dillenburger and borckwere openly rightwing and antisemitic which was why id left the general and joined the official the official isnt communist i said we support the social democrats and the republic oh yeah then why the iron front against fascism why not an iron front against bolshevism too because as you well know heinrich most of the violence on the streets is committed or provoked by the nazis how do you work that out exactly that woman in neukolln that lipiks investigating even before he left the alex he reckoned she had been shot dead by a storm trooper who was aiming at a commie so it was an accident i dont see how that proves the nazis organize most of the violence no well you want to come round our way and take a look out of my apartment window on dragonerstrasse the central offices of the german communist party are just around the corner on bulowplatz so thats where the nazis choose to exercise their democratic right to hold a parade does that seem reasonable does that sound lawabiding proves my point doesnt it you living in a red area like that all it proves is that the nazis are always spoiling for a fight i bent down and flicked my flashlight up and down the dead girls body her upper half looked more or less normal she was about thirteen or fourteen blond with pale blue eyes and a small galaxy of freckles around her pixie nose it was a tomboyish sort of face and you could easily have mistaken her for a boy the matter of her sex was only confirmed by her small adolescent breasts the rest of her sexual organs having been removed along with her lower intestines her womb and whatever else gets packed in down there when a girl gets born but it wasnt her evisceration that caught my eye in truth both heinrich and i had seen this kind of thing many times in the trenches there was also the caliper on her left leg i hadnt noticed it before no walking stick i said tapping it with my pencil youd think shed have had one maybe she didnt need one its not every cripple that needs a stick youre right goebbels manages very well without one doesnt he for a cripple then again theres a big stick inside almost everything he says i lit a cigarette and let out a big smoky sigh why do people do this kind of thing i said to myself you mean kill children i meant why kill them like this its monstrous isnt it depraved i should have thought it was obvious said grund oh hows that youre the one who said he must be depraved i couldnt agree more but is it any wonder i say is it any wonder we have depraved people doing things like this when you consider the filth and depravity thats tolerated by this fag end of a government look around you bernie berlin is like a big slimy rock lift it up and you can see everything that crawls the oilers stripe men wallsliders boot girls sugarlickers munzis tgirls the women who are men and the men who are women sick venal corrupt depraved and all of it tolerated by your beloved weimar republic i suppose everything will be different if adolf hitler gets into power i was laughing as i said it the nazis had done well in the most recent elections but nobody sensible really believed they could run the country nobody thought for a minute that president hindenburg was ever going to ask the man he detested most in the worlda guttersnipe nco from austriato become the next chancellor of germany why not were going to need someone to restore order in this country as he spoke we heard another shot travel through the warm night air and who better than the man who causes all the trouble to put an end to it eh i can sort of see the logic behind that yes one of the uniforms came over we stood up it was sergeant gollner better known as tankerbecause of his size and shape while you two were arguing he said i put a cordon around this part of the park so as to keep the potwatchers away last thing we want is any details of how she was killed getting into the newspapers giving stupid people stupid ideas confessing to things they havent done well have a closer look in the morning eh when its light thanks tanker i said i should have skip it he took a deep breath of a night air made moist by water a light breeze had carried from the fountain nice here isnt it i always liked this place used to come here a lot i did on account of the fact that my brother is buried over there he nodded south in the direction of the state hospital with the revolutionaries of i didnt know you were that old i said tanker grinned no he got shot by the freikorps in december proper lefty so he was a real troublemaker but he didnt deserve that not after what he went through in the trenches reds or not none of them deserved to be shot for what happened dont tell me i said nodding at heinrich grund tell him he knows what i think said tanker he looked down at the girls body what was wrong with her leg then hardly matters now observed grund she might have had polio i said or else she was a spastic you wouldnt have thought theyd have let her out on her own would you said grund she was crippled i bent down and went through the pockets of her coat i came up with a roll of cash wrapped in a rubber band it was as thick as the handle of a tennis racket i tossed it to grund plenty of disabled people manage perfectly well on their own even the kids must be several hundred marks here he muttered where does a kid like this get money like that i dont know had to manage tanker was saying the number of maimed and injured we had after the war i used to have the beat next to the charite hospital got quite friendly with some of the lads who were there a lot of them managed with no legs or no arms its one thing being crippled for something that happened fighting for the fatherland said grund tossing the roll of cash in his hand its something else when youre born with it meaning what exactly i asked meaning that lifes difficult enough when youre a parent without having to look after a disabled child maybe they didnt mind looking after her not if they loved her if you ask me if she was a spastic shes better off out of it said grund germanys better off in general with fewer cripples around he caught the look in my eye no really its a simple matter of racial purity we have to protect our stock i can think of one cripple wed all be better off without i said tanker laughed and walked away anyway its only a caliper i said lots of kids have calipers maybe said grund he threw the money back but its not every kid thats carrying several hundred marks right wed better have a look around before the site gets trampled over see what we can find on our hands and knees with the flashlights i dropped onto all fours and slowly crawled away from the body in the direction of konigsthor heinrich grund did the same a yard or two to my left the night was warm and the grass felt dry and smelled sweet under my hands it was something we had done before something ernst gennat was keen on something that was in the manual hed given us how it was small things that solved murders bullet casings blood spots collar buttons cigarette ends matchbooks earrings hanks of hair party badges things that were large and easy to see were usually carried away from a crime scene but the small stuff that was different it was the small stuff that could send a man to the guillotine nobody called them clues gennat hated that word clues are for the clueless was what the full ernst would tell us thats not what i want from my detectives give me little spots of color on a canvas like that frenchie who used to paint in little dots georges seurat each dot means shit on its own but when you take a few steps back and look at all of the dots together you see a picture thats what i want you bastards to do learn how to paint me a picture like georges seurat so there we were me and heinrich grund crawling along the grass in friedrichshain park like a couple of dogs the berlin polenta trying to paint a picture if i had blinked i might have missed it as spots of color go this one was as small as anything you might have seen on an impressionists canvas but just as colorful at first glance i mistook it for a cornflower because it was light blue like the dead girls eyes it was a pill lying on top of a few blades of grass i picked it up and held it up to my eyes and saw that it was as immaculate as a diamond which meant it couldnt have been there that long there had been a brief shower of rain just after lunch so it had to have fallen on the ground some time after that a man hurrying back to the road from the fountains where he had dumped a body might easily have taken out a box of pills fumbled it in his nervous state and dropped one now all i had to do was find out what kind of pill it was what have you got there boss a pill i said laying it on his palm kind of pill im not a chemist want me to check it out at the hospital no ill get hans illmann to do it illmann was professor of forensic medicine at the institute for police science in charlottenburg and senior pathologist at the alex he was also a prominent member of the social democratic party the sdp for this and other alleged character failings he had been frequently denounced by goebbels in the pages of der angriff berlins nazi newspaper illmann wasnt jewish but as far as the nazis were concerned he was the next worst thing a liberalminded intellectual illmann professor illmann any objections grund looked up at the moon as if trying to learn patience the white light had turned his pale blond head a steely shade of silver and his blue eyes became almost electric he looked like some kind of machineman something hard metallic and cruel the head turned and he stared at me as he might have stared at some poor opponent in the ringan inadequate subspecies of man who was not fit to enter a contest with one such as him youre the boss he said and dropped the pill back in my hand but for how much longer i asked myself we drove back to the alex which with its cupolas and arched entranceways was as big as a railway station and behind the fourstory brick facade in the doubleheight entrance hall very nearly as busy all human life was in there and quite a bit of pond life too there was a drunk with a black eye who was unsteadily awaiting being locked up for the night a taxi driver making a complaint about a passenger who had run off without paying an androgynouslooking young man wearing tight white shorts who was sitting quietly in a corner checking his makeup in a hand mirror and a bespectacled man with a briefcase in his hands and a livid red mark across his mouth at the bunkersized front desk we checked through a file containing a list of missing persons the desk sergeant who was supposed to be assisting us had a big handlebar mustache and an eleven oclock shadow that was so blue it made his face look like a houseflys this effect was enhanced because his eyes were bulging out of his head at the sight of two tall boot girls a cop had shooed in off the street they were wearing thighhigh black leather boots and red leather coats which thoughtfully they had left undone revealing to anyone who cared to look that they were wearing nothing underneath one of them was carrying a riding crop that the arresting officer a man with an eye patcha man i knew named bruno stahleckerwas having a hard job persuading her to give up clearly the girls had had a drink or two and probably quite a bit else besides and as i flicked through the missingpersons reports half of me was listening to what stahlecker and the girls were saying it would have been hard not to hear it i like a man in uniform said the taller of the leatherbooted amazons she snapped her riding crop against her boot and then fingered the hair at the base of her belly provocatively which one of berlins bulls wants to be my slave tonight boot girls were the citys outdoor dominatrices mostly they worked west of wittenbergplatz near the zoological gardens but stahlecker had picked up this pair of whores in friedrichstrasse after a man had complained of being beaten and robbed by two women in leather behave yourself brigit said stahlecker or ill throw the rules of the medical profession at you as well he turned to the man with the red mark on his face are these the two women who robbed you yes said the man one of them hit me across the face with a whip and demanded money or shed hit me again the girls loudly protested their innocence innocence never looked quite so venereal and corrupt finally i found what id been looking for anita schwarz i said showing heinrich grund the missingpersons report aged fifteen behrenstrasse flat report filed by her father otto disappeared yesterday one meter sixty centimeters tall blond hair blue eyes caliper on left leg carries a walking stick thats our girl all right but grund was hardly paying attention i thought he was looking at the free nude show and leaving him to it i went to one of the other filing cabinets and found a more detailed report there was a star on the file and next to it a letter w it would seem that the deputy police president is taking an interest in our case i said inside the file was a photograph quite an old one i thought but there could be no doubt it was the girl in the park perhaps he knows the girls father i know that man murmured grund who schwarz no that man there leaning back on the front desk he flicked his snout at the man with the whip mark on his face hes an alphonse alphonse was berlin criminal underworld slang for a pimp one of many slang words for a pimp like louie oiler stripe man ludwig and garterhandler runs one of those bogus clinics off the kudamm i think his racket is that he poses as a physician and then prescribes an underage girl for his socalled patient grund called out to stahlecker hey bruno whats the citizens name the one wearing the spectacles and the extra smile him dr geise dr geise my eggs his real name is koch hans theodor koch and hes no more a doctor than i am hes an alphonse a medicine man who fixes old perverts up with little girls the man stood up thats a damn lie he said indignantly open his briefcase said grund see if im wrong stahlecker looked at the man who held the briefcase tightly to his chest as if he really did have something to hide well sir how about it reluctantly the man allowed stahlecker to take the briefcase and then to open it a few seconds later a pile of pornographic magazines was lying on the desk sergeants blotter the magazine was called figaro and on the cover of each copy was a picture of seven naked boys and girls about ten or eleven years old sitting in the branches of a dead tree like a pride of small white lions you old pervert snarled one of the boot girls this puts rather a different complexion on things sir stahlecker told koch that is a nakedculture magazine insisted koch dedicated to the cause of free life reform it doesnt prove anything of what this vile man has alleged it proves one thing said the boot girl with the whip it proves you like looking at dirty pictures of little boys and girls we left them all in a heated argument what did i tell you said grund as we went back to the car this city is a whore and your beloved republic is her pimp when are you going to wake up to that fact bernie on behrenstrasse i parked the car in front of a glasscovered arcade that led to unter den linden the arcade was nicknamed the back passage because it was a popular pickup spot for berlins male prostitutes these were easily identifiable thanks to the short white trousers sailor shirts and peaked caps many of them wore to appear younger to the tree stumpstheir middleaged clients who until they had made their selection would walk up and down the passage pretending to look in the windows of the arcades antique shops it was a warm night by my reckoning there were at least eighty or ninety of the citys sultriest boys milling around underneath the famous reemtsma signone of the few left unbroken by the nazi sa storm troopers were supposed to smoke a trommler brand called story so being nazis and therefore very brandloyal they often took exception to other brands of tobacco of which reemtsma was perhaps the best known if the sa did show up all of the sultry boys would take to their heels or risk a beatingperhaps worse the sa seemed to hate queers almost as much as they hated communists and jews we found the apartment above a cafe in a smartlooking romanesque building i pulled the polished brass bell and we waited a minute later we heard a mans voice above our heads and we stepped back on the sidewalk to get a better look at him yes herr schwarz yes police sir may we come up yes wait there ill come down and let you in while we waited heinrich grund fulminated against all the sultries wed seen russian fairies he said immediately after the bolshevik revolution many of berlins prostitutes male and female had been russians but this was no longer true and i did my best to ignore him it wasnt that i liked queers i just didnt dislike them as much as he did otto schwarz came to the door to let us in we showed him our kripo warrant discs and introduced ourselves and he nodded as if he had been expecting us he was a big man with a belly that looked as if a lot of money had been poured into it his fair hair was cut very short at the sides and wavy on top underneath a swinish nose that was almost divided in two by a thick scar was a nearly invisible toothbrush mustache that he reminded me strongly of ernst rohm the sa leader was a first impressionreinforced by the uniform he was wearing illegally there had been a ban on nazi uniforms since june and as recently as april in a campaign to reduce nazi terrorism in berlin reich president hindenburg had dissolved the sa and the ss i wasnt much good at recognizing the shoulder and collar insignia on their uniforms but grund was the two of them made polite conversation as we tramped upstairs that was how i came to learn not just that schwarz was an oberfuhrer in the sa but also that this was the equivalent of a brigadier general there was a small part of me that wanted to join in this polite conversation i wanted to say i was surprised to find an sa oberfuhrer at home when there were communists to lynch and jewish windows to smash but since i was about to tell schwarz that his daughter was dead i had to make do with an observation about his wearing the uniform of a proscribed organization half of the polenta in berlin would have looked the other way ignored it but then half of the cops in berlin were nazis many of my colleagues seemed quite happy to be sleepwalking their way to a dictatorship i wasnt one of them you know that since april of this year its illegal to wear that uniform dont you sir i said surely that hardly matters now the ban on uniforms is about to be revoked until then its still illegal sir however under the circumstances ill overlook it schwarz colored a little and then squeezed his fists one after the other these made a noise like a noose tightening i imagine he was wishing there was one around my neck he bit his lip it was easier to reach than my face he pushed open the apartment door stiffly he said please come in gentlemen the apartment was a shrine to adolf hitler there was a portrait of him in an oval frame in the hall and another different portrait of him inside a square frame in the sitting room a copy of mein kampf lay open on a book stand that was on the sideboard next to a family bible and behind these was a framed photograph of otto schwarz and adolf hitler they were wearing leather flying helmets and sitting in the front seat of an enormous opentop mercedes with cheesy grins on their faces as if they had just won the adac eifelrennen and in record time by one of the armchairs on the floor lay a dozen or so copies of der sturmer the vehemently antisemitic newspaper id seen election posters for adolf hitler that were less obviously nazi than the schwarz family home in her own sweet bigbreasted blond and blueeyed way frau schwarz looked no less of a nazi than her storm trooper of a husband when she put her arm through her husbands arm i half expected them both to shout germany awake and death to the jews before breaking up the furniture and then singing the horst wessel song sometimes it was only these daydreaming little fantasies that made my job at all bearable it certainly wasnt two hundred fifty marks a month frau schwarz wore a full gathered dirndl skirt with traditional embroidery a tightlacedup blouse an apron and an expression that was a combination of fear and hostility schwarz put his hand on top of the hand his wife had threaded through his ham hock of an arm and then she put her other hand on his but for their grim and resolute faces they reminded me of a couple getting married at last they looked like they were ready to hear what they knew i was going to tell them id like to say i admired their courage and that i felt sorry for them the truth is i didnt very much the sight of schwarzs illegal uniform and the battalion number on his collar patch made me almost indifferent to their feelings assuming they had any a very good friend of mine powm emil kuhfeld a first sergeant with the schupo had been shot dead at the head of the detachment of riot police trying to disperse a large group of communists in frankfurter allee a nazi commissar at police station who had investigated the case had managed to pin the murder on a communist but nearly everyone at the alex knew he had suppressed the evidence of a witness who had seen kuhfeld shot by an sa man with a rifle the day after kuhfelds murder this sa man one walter grabsch was discovered dead in his kadinerstrasse flat having conveniently committed suicide kuhfelds funeral had been the biggest ever given to a berlin policeman i had helped carry the coffin which was how i knew that the battalion number on schwarzs blue collar patch was the same battalion to which walter grabsch had belonged i gave herr and frau schwarz all of the hard words of grief straight from the holster i didnt even try to rub them in the snow first we think weve found the body of your daughter anita we believe she was murdered obviously ill have to ask you to come down to the station to identify her shall we say tomorrow morning ten oclock at the police praesidium on alexanderplatz otto schwarz nodded silently i had retailed bad news before of course just the previous week id had to tell a mother in moabit that her seventeenyearold son a schoolboy at the local gymnasium had been murdered by communists whod mistaken him for a brown shirt are you sure its him commissar she asked me more than once during the course of my lachrymose time with her are you sure there hasnt been a mistake couldnt it be someone else herr and frau schwarz seemed to be taking it on the chin however i glanced around the apartment again there was a little embroidery sampler in a frame above the door it read willingness for selfsacrifice and was stitched in red with an exclamation point id seen one before and i knew the quotation was from mein kampf i wasnt surprised to see it of course but i was surprised that i could see no photographs of their daughter anita most people who are parents have one or two of their children around the place we have the photograph you gave us on file i said so were quite sure its her im afraid but it would save time if you could spare us some others save time otto schwarz frowned i dont understand shes dead isnt she save time trying to catch her murderer i said coldly someone may have seen her with him ill see what i can find frau schwarz said and left the room quite composed and less upset than if id told her that hitler wouldnt be coming to tea your wife seems to be taking it very well i said my wife is a nurse at the charite he said i suppose shes used to dealing with bad news besides we were sort of expecting the worst really sir i glanced at grund who stared balefully at me and then looked away were very sorry for your loss sir he told schwarz very sorry indeed incidentally theres no need for both of you to come to the praesidium tomorrow and if tomorrows not convenient we can always do it another time thank you sergeant but tomorrow will be fine grund nodded best to get it over with sir he said nodding youre probably right and then you can get on with your grieving yes thank you sergeant what was the nature of your daughters disability i asked she was a spastic it affected only the left side of her body she had trouble walking of course there were also occasional seizures spasms and other involuntary movements she couldnt hear very well either schwarz went over to the sideboard and ignoring the bible laid his hand fondly on the open copy of hitlers book as if his fuhrers warm words about the national socialist movement might afford him some spiritual and philosophical solace what about her capacity for understanding i asked he shook his head there was nothing wrong with her mind if thats what you mean it was i paused and i just wondered if you might be able to explain how she came to have five hundred marks on her five hundred marks in her coat pocket he shook his head there must be some mistake no sir theres no mistake where would anita get five hundred marks someone must have put it there i nodded i suppose thats possible sir no really do you have any other children herr schwarz he looked astonished even to be asked such a thing good god no do you think we would have risked having another child like anita he sighed loudly and suddenly there was a strong smell of something foul in the air no we had quite enough to do just looking after her it wasnt easy i can tell you it wasnt easy at all finally frau schwarz returned with several photographs they were old and rather faded one was folded down at the edge as if someone had handled it carelessly these are all that i could find she announced still quite dryeyed all of them did you say yes thats all of them thank you frau schwarz thank you very much i nodded curtly well then we had better be getting back to the station until tomorrow schwarz started to move toward the door its all right sir well see ourselves out we went out of the apartment and down the stairs to the street the cafe kerkau beneath the apartment was still open but i was in the mood for something stronger than coffee i cranked up the cars twocylinder engine and we drove east along unter den linden i need a drink after that i said after a few minutes i suppose its lucky you didnt have a drink before observed grund meaning meaning you were a bit hard on them sir he shook his head christ you didnt even rub it with snow you just gave it to them grit and all right between the eyes lets go to the resi i said somewhere with lots of people and we all know how good you are with people grund said bitterly was it because he was a storm trooper that you treated him and his wife like they had no feelings didnt you see that collar patch twentyfirst battalion that was the same sa battalion walter grabsch belonged to you remember walter grabsch he murdered emil kuhfeld thats not what the local police said and what about all the polenta the commies have murdered those two police captains anlauf and lenck not forgetting paul zankert what about those fellows i didnt know them but i did know emil kuhfeld he was a good cop so were anlauf and lenck and i hate the bastards who murdered them every bit as much as i hate the man who killed emil the only difference between the reds and the nazis as far as im concerned is that the reds dont wear uniforms if they did itd be a lot easier for me to hate them on sight too the same way i hated schwarz back there well at least you admit it you uncaring bastard all right i admit it i was a bit out of line but it could have been a lot worse its only out of sympathy for that nazi sods feelings that i didnt pinch him for wearing the sa uniform that was big of you sir assuming either of them had any feelings which i very much doubt did you see her how do you work that out come on heinrich you know the play as well as i do your daughters dead someone murdered her cue handkerchief are you sure yes were sure shes a nurse they can take it my eggs did you see her her tits didnt even wobble when i told her that her daughter was dead they were good tits i liked looking at them but they didnt so much as tremble when i gave it to them tell me im wrong heinrich and tell me im wrong that there werent any photographs of anita schwarz on the sideboard tell me im wrong that she spent at least ten minutes trying to find one and tell me im wrong that she said shed given me all the photographs of her daughter whats wrong with that wouldnt you want to keep at least one photograph to remember your dead daughter just in case some dumb cop like you lost them she knows shell get them back thats all no no people arent like that heinrich shed have kept one back at least one but she gave me all of them thats what she said i asked her about it and she confirmed it you heard her not only that but these pictures arent in the best of condition like theyve been kept in an old shoe box a commie kills you tonight and someone asks me for a picture of you for the police newspaper i can give them a nice one in a frame in twenty seconds and im not even related to you thank god so what are you saying i pulled up close to the residenz casino it was well past midnight but there were still plenty of people going into the place one or two of them cops probably the resi was popular with kripo from the alex and not just because of its proximity im saying what you were saying back in the park what did i say back in the park that maybe theyre both of them glad the kids dead that maybe they think shes better off more important that theyre better off how do you work that out its nazi policy isnt it that cripples are a waste of all our tax marks thats where i assumed youd got all this racialpurity shit from hell heinrich you saw that photograph of schwarz with hitler i lit a cigarette ill bet you anything hitler would probably like otto schwarz a whole lot better if it wasnt for his gimp daughter we went inside the resi the spanner on the door knew our faces and waved us past the ticket booth none of the clubs made cops pay to get in they needed us more than we needed them especially when as with the resi there were more than a thousand people in the place we found ourselves a little loge in the balcony and ordered a couple of beers the club was full of alcoves and booths and private cellars all of them equipped with telephones that encouraged patrons to flirt at a safe distance these telephones were also one of the reasons the place was popular with detectives from the alex informers liked them the whores liked the telephones too everyone liked the telephones at the resi the minute we sat down the phone on our table started to ring i picked it up gunther said a mans voice its bruno down here by the bar in front of the shooting gallery i glanced over the edge of the balcony and saw stahlecker waving up at me i waved back for a man with one eye you do all right we booked that alphonse say thanks to heinrich bruno says thanks heinrich they booked the alphonse good said grund on my way out of the alex i saw isidor bruno said if i saw you he told me to tell you he wants to see you first thing in the morning isidor was the name by which everyone called the dpp dr bernard weiss it was also the name by which der angriff called him der angriff didnt mean the name to sound affectionate just antisemitic it didnt bother izzy did he say what about i asked although i was pretty sure i knew the answer no what time is first thing for izzy these days eight oclock i looked at my watch and groaned there goes my evening he was a small man with a small mustache a longish nose and little round glasses his hair was dark and combed back across a head full of brains he wore a wellcut threepiece suit spats and in winter a coat with a fur collar easily caricatured his jewishness exaggerated by his enemies dr bernard weiss cut an odd figure among the rest of berlins policemen heimannsberg who towered over him was everyones idea of what a senior policeman should look like izzys appearance was more that of a lawyer and indeed he had once been a judge in the berlin courts but he was no stranger to uniforms and returned from the great war with an iron cross first class izzy did his best to seem like a hardbitten detective but it didnt work for one thing he never carried a gun not even after he was beaten up by a rightwing uniformed cop who claimed hed mistaken the deputy police president for a communist izzy preferred to do his fighting with his tongue which was a formidable weapon when deployed his sarcasm was as caustic as battery acid and as he was surrounded by men of much lesser intellectual abilities than himself it was frequently splashed around this did not make him loved that would hardly have mattered for most men in his elevated position but since there were no men in his elevated position who were also jewish it ought to have mattered more to izzy his lack of popularity made him vulnerable but i liked him and he liked me more than any other man in germany it was izzy who had been responsible for the modernization of the police force but much of the impetus for this had come from the assassination of the foreign minister walther rathenau it was said that everyone in germany could remember exactly where they were on june when they heard the news that rathenau a jew had been shot by rightwingers i had been in the romanisches cafe staring into a drink and still feeling sorry for myself after my wifes death three months before rathenaus murder had persuaded me to join the berlin police izzy knew that it was one of the reasons he liked me i think his office at the alex resembled that of a university professors he sat in front of a large bookcase full of legal and forensic tomes one of which he himself had written on the wall was a map of berlin with red and brown pins indicating outbreaks of political violence the map looked like it had the measles there were so many pins on his desk were two telephones several piles of papers and an ashtray where he tipped the ash from the black wisdom havanas that were his one apparent luxury he was i knew under enormous pressure because the republic itself was under enormous pressure in the march elections the nazis had doubled their strength in the reichstag and were now the secondlargest party with eleven and a half million votes the chancellor heinrich bruning was trying to turn the economy around but with unemployment at nearly six million and rising this was proving almost impossible bruning looked unlikely to survive now that the reichstag had reconvened hindenburg remained president of the weimar republic and leader of the largest party but the aristocratic old man had little liking for bruning and if bruning went what then schleicher papen groner hitler germany was running out of strong men who were fit to lead the country izzy waved me to a chair without looking up from what he was writing with his black pelikan from time to time he put down the pen and lifted the cigar to his mouth and i amused myself with the vague hope that he might put the pen in his mouth and try to write with the cigar we must continue to do our duty as policemen even though others may make it difficult for us he said in a voice that was deep and fullbodied like a lager darkened by colored maltsa dunkel or a bock he put down the pen and sitting back on the creaking swivel chair fixed me with an eye as pointed as the spike on a cuirassiers pickelhaube dont you agree bernie yes sir berliners still havent forgotten or forgiven their police force for what happened in when the alex surrendered to anarchy and revolution without a shot no sir but what else could they do they could have upheld the law bernie instead they saved their own skins always we uphold the law and if the nazis take over what then theyll use the law and the police for their own ends which is exactly what the independent socialists did in he said under emil eichhorn we survived that we shall survive the nazis too maybe we must have a little faith bernie he said if the nazis do get in we shall have to have faith that eventually the parliamentary process will restore germany to its senses i hope youre right sir then just as i was beginning to think izzy had summoned me for a lesson in political science he came to the point an english philosopher named jeremy bentham once wrote that publicity is the very soul of justice thats especially true in the case of anita schwarz to bowdlerize a phrase from another english jurist the investigation into her murder must not merely proceed it must be seen to proceed vigorously now let me tell you why helga schwarz the murdered girls mother is kurt dalueges cousin that makes this a highprofile case bernie and i just wanted to let you know that the last thing we want right now is dr goebbels arguing in the pages of his tawdry but nonetheless influential newspaper that the investigation is being handled incompetently or that were dragging our feet because we have some antinazi ax to grind all personal prejudices must be put aside do i make myself clear bernie very clear sir i might not have had a doctorate in jurisprudence like bernard weiss but i didnt need to have it spelled out with umlauts and ablauts kurt daluege was a decorated war hero currently in the ss he was an exsa leader in berlin not to mention goebbelss deputy more important for us he was an nsdap member of the prussian state parliament to which the berlin police owed its first loyalty daluege could make political trouble for us with friends like his he could make trouble in a hospice for retired benedictine monks the smart money in berlin said that if they ever got into power the nazis were planning to put daluege in charge of the berlin police force it wasnt that he had any experience of policing he wasnt even a lawyer what he did have experience of was doing exactly what hitler and goebbels told him to do and i presumed the same was true of his relation by marriage otto schwarz thats why im organizing a press conference this afternoon said izzy so you can tell the newspapers just how seriously were taking this case that were pursuing all possible leads that we wont rest until the murderer is caught well you know the kind of thing youve handled a press conference many times before on occasion youve even handled them quite well thank you sir however you have a natural wit that sometimes you would do well to restrain especially in a political case like this one is that what this is sir oh id say so wouldnt you yes sir ernst gennat and i will attend the conference of course but its your investigation and your conference if questioned ernst and i will confine ourselves to statements regarding your competence commissar gunthers impressive reputation his extraordinary perseverance his keen psychological insights his cleanup record the usual crap thank you for your confidence sir izzys lips puckered as if savoring the taste of his own intelligence like a freshly made matzoh ball well what have you come up with so far not much she wasnt killed in the park thats for sure well know more about the cause of death later on today hard to say if it was a lust murder or not maybe that was the point of removing all her sexual organs and everything that was attached to them on the face of it you might say thats the most remarkable feature of the case but you might just as easily point to the reaction of herr and frau schwarz themselves last night neither of them seemed particularly upset when i told them that their daughter was dead god i hope youre not suggesting you think they did it i thought for a moment maybe im misjudging them sir but the girl was disabled somehow i got the feeling that they were glad to be rid of her thats all maybe i trust you wont be mentioning any of this at the press conference you know me better than that its true some nazis do have a few ruthless ideas concerning the treatment of societys unfortunates people who are physically and mentally handicapped however even the nazis arent stupid enough to think thats a vote winner nobodys going to vote for a political party that advocates the extermination of the sick and the infirm not after a war that left thousands of men disabled no i suppose not sir i lit a cigarette theres one other thing the murdered girl had five hundred marks on her thats a lot more pocket money than i used to get when i was her age yes youre right did you ask the parents about it they suggested there must have been some mistake ive heard of money disappearing from a dead mans pockets but ive never heard of money being planted on one no sir ask the neighbors bernie speak to her school friends find out what kind of girl anita schwarz was yes sir and bernie get yourself a new tie that one looks like its been in your soup yes sir before the press conference i went and had my hair cut at the kadewe henry ford himself couldnt have arranged the business of cutting german hair more efficiently there were ten chairs and i was in and out in less than twenty minutes the kade we wasnt exactly around the corner from the alex but it was a good place to have a haircut and buy a new tie as always the conference itself took place in the police museum at the alex this was gennats idea following the police exhibition of so that kripo might present itself to the world among the photographs knives test tubes fingerprints poison bottles revolvers rope and buttons that were the exhibits of our many proud investigative successes the modern face of policing we were keen to display to the world might have looked a bit more efficient had the glass cases containing this assortment of forensic trash and the heavy curtains that shrouded the tall windows of the exhibition hall not been so dusty even the most recent photograph of ernst gennat looked like it had been there for a hundred years there were about twenty reporters and photographers gathered among our previous triumphs behind a table that had been cleared of a selection of curious murder weapons i sat between weiss and gennat as if we had been arranged in ascending order of size the men of berlins press heard me appeal for any witnesses who might have seen a man behaving suspiciously in friedrichshain park on the night of the murder and then go on to assure the berlin public that we were doing all in our power to catch the killer of anita schwarzwhich of course was something i was determined to do things seemed to be going quite well until i uttered the usual bromides about interviewing known sex offenders at this fritz allgeier the reporter for der angriff a bosseyed specimen with a gray beard and arms that seemed longer than his legshardly masterrace materialsaid that the german people demanded to be told why known sex offenders were allowed to walk our streets in the first place later on i agreed with weiss that my next comments could have been a little more diplomatic the last time i looked herr allgeier germany still has a system of criminal justice in which people are brought before the courts tried and if found guilty serve a prison sentence after theyve paid their debt to society we let them go maybe we shouldnt let them go at all he said it might be best for the german people if these socalled known offenders were put back in prison as quickly as possible then this kind of lust murder might never happen maybe thats not for me to say but where do you get off thinking that someone like you can speak for the german people allgeier you used to be a jack in moabit a backstreet turk working the threecard trick the german people might equally demand to know how you turned into a journalist several of the nonnazi newspaper reporters thought this was very funny i might have got away with it too if id left it there but i didnt i was warming to my subject germany had always had the death penalty for murder but for several years the newspapersthe nonnazi newspapershad waged a vigorous campaign against the guillotine lately however these same papers had bowed to nazi influence and refrained from writing editorials urging the commutation of a murderers sentence with the result that the state executioner johann reichhart was working once again his most recent victim had been the mass murderer and cannibal georg haarmann a lot of cops myself included didnt much like the guillotine more so since the senior investigating officer was called upon to attend the executions of murderers he had arrested the plain fact of the matter is that weve always relied on known offenders to give us information i said there were even murderers serving sentences in prison who were once prepared to help us of course that was before we started executing them again its hard to persuade a man to talk to you when youve chopped his head off weiss stood up and smiling patiently announced that the conference was over on our way out he said nothing just smiled sadly at me which was worse than a lashing from his tongue gennat said nice work bernie theyll eat your eggs son just the fascist newspapers surely all newspapers are fundamentally fascist bernie in every country all editors are dictators all journalism is authoritarian thats why people line birdcages with it gennat was right of course he usually was only berlins evening newspaper tempo gave me a good press it used a picture of me that looked like luis trenker in the holy mountain manfred george tempos editor wrote a piece in which he described me as one of berlins finest detectives maybe they liked my new tie the rest of the republican papers were like a cat creeping around the milk they didnt dare say what they really thought for fear that their readers might not agree with them i didnt read der angriff what was the point but hans joachim brandt in the nazi volkischer beobachter referred to me as a liberal leftwing stooge probably the truth lay halfway between the two buenos aires the von baders lived in the residential part of the barrio norte which is castellano for people with money the calle florida the commercial heart of the barrio norte seemed to have come into being in order to make sure that people with money would not have to go too far out of their way to spend it the house on arenales was built in the best eighteenthcentury french style it looked more like a grand hotel than somewhere anyone could have called home the facade was all relief ionic columns and tall windows even the airconditioning units seemed elegant and in keeping with the urban bourbon look inside things were no less formally french with high ceilings and pilasters marble fireplaces gilt mirrors lots of eighteenthcentury furniture and expensivelooking art the von baders and their small dog received the colonel and me sitting on an overstuffed red sofa she was sitting in one corner of the sofa and he was sitting in the other they were wearing their best clothes but in a way that left me thinking that they might wear the same clothes to do some gardening always supposing they knew where the secateurs and the trowels were kept the way they sat there i wanted to take hold of the baronesss chin and move her head slightly toward her husband before picking up my brushes and getting started on their portrait she was statuesque and beautiful with good skin and perfect teeth and hair like spun gold and a neck like queen nefertitis taller sister he was just thin with glasses and unlike me the dog seemed to prefer him to her she was holding a handkerchief and looked as though she had been crying the way anxious mothers are supposed to look he was holding a cigarillo and looked like hed been making money rather a lot of it colonel montalban introduced me to them we all spoke in german as if our meeting were taking place in some handsome villa in dahlem i uttered a few sympathetic noises fabienne had disappeared somewhere between arenales and the cemetery at recoleta less than half a mile away she often went there by herself to lay flowers on the steps of the von bader family vault it was where they kept their bodies not their money it seemed that fabienne had been very close to her grandfather who was buried there they gave me some photographs to borrow fabienne looked like any other fourteenyearold girl who was blond beautiful and rich in one of the photographs she was sitting on a white pony the ponys bridle was held by a gaucho and behind this bucolic little trio was a ranch house against a backdrop of eucalyptus trees thats our weekend house explained the baron in pilar to the north of buenos aires nice i said and wondered where they went when they wanted a proper holiday from the demands of being very rich yes fabienne loved it there said her mother i take it youve already looked for her at this and any other homes you might own yes he said of course we have he let out a sigh that was part patience and part anxiety theres only the weekend house herr gunther i dont own any other houses in argentina he shook his head and took a puff on the cigarillo you make me sound like some stinking plutocratic jew isnt that right colonel there are no yids in this part of buenos aires said montalban von baders wife winced she didnt seem to like that remark which was another reason why i liked her more than i liked her husband she crossed her long legs and looked away for a moment i liked her legs too its really not like her at all she said she blew her nose delicately on the small handkerchief tucked it into the sleeve of her dress and smiled bravely i admired her for that shes never done this kind of thing before what about her friends i asked fabienne wasnt like most girls of her age herr gunther said von bader she was more mature than her peers very much more sophisticated i doubt that she would have shared a confidence with any of them but naturally weve questioned them added the colonel i dont think it would help to question them again they said nothing that might help did she know the other girl i asked grete wohlauf no said von bader id like to see her room if i may i was looking at the baroness she was easier on the eye than her husband easier on the ear too of course she said then she looked at her husband would you mind showing him fabiennes room dear it upsets me to go in there at the moment von bader walked me to a little wooden elevator that was set in an open wroughtiron shaft and surrounded by a steep curving marble staircase its not every home that has its own elevator and catching sight of my eloquently raised eyebrows the baron felt obliged to offer an explanation during the last years of her life my mother was in a wheelchair he said as if building an elevator was a solution available to everyone with an elderly parent it was just the two of us and the dog in the elevator car i was close enough to smell the cologne on von baders face and the oil in his gray hair and yet he avoided my eye each time he spoke to me he was looking somewhere else i told myself he was preoccupied with his daughters possible fate but all the same id handled enough cases involving missing persons to know when i wasnt getting the whole story montalban says that back in berlin before the war you were a top detective with kripo and in private practice he made being a private detective sound like being a top dentist maybe it was kind of similar to being a dentist at that sometimes getting a client to tell you everything relevant was like pulling teeth ive had my archimedes moments i said with kripo and on my own archimedes eureka ive found it i shrugged these days im more the travelingsalesman type selling what in particular nothing nothing at all not even now ill do my best to find your daughter sir but i never was one for working miracles generally i do a lot better when people believe in me enough to give me all the facts von bader colored a little maybe that was because he was trying to wrestle the elevator car door open or maybe it wasnt but he still wasnt looking at me what makes you think you havent had them call it a hunch he nodded as if considering some kind of offer which was odd given that i hadnt actually made him one we stepped out of the car and into the thickly carpeted corridor at the end of it he pushed a door open and ushered me into the bedroom of a neat and tidy girl the wallpaper was red roses the bed had little flowers painted on the enameled iron frame above the bed were several chinese fans in a picture frame on a tall table was a large and empty oriental birdcage on a shorter table was a chessboard set out in a game that seemed to be still in progress i gave the pieces the onceover black or white she was a clever little girl there were some books and some teddy bears and a chest of drawers i tugged one open do you mind i asked go right ahead he said i suppose youre just doing your job well im certainly not looking for her underwear i was hoping to goad something from him after all he hadnt exactly denied that he was keeping something back i turned over some socks and looked underneath what exactly are you looking for a diary a commonplace book some letters some money you didnt know about a photograph of someone you dont recognize im not sure exactly but ill know it when i see it i closed the drawer or maybe theres something you want to tell me now while colonel montalban isnt here he picked up one of the teddy bears and lifted it to his nose like a hound trying to raise a scent its curious he said the way you can smell them on their toys its so evocative of them kind of like proust really i nodded id heard a lot about proust one day i was going to have to find an excuse not to read him i know what montalban thinks he said he thinks fabienne is already dead von bader shook his head i just dont believe that what makes you think not baron you would call it a hunch i suppose easier to spell than intuition but thats how it is if she was dead im quite sure we would have heard something by now someone would have found her im certain of it he shook his head since you were once a famous detective with the homicide police in berlin i imagine montalbans asking you to work on the assumption that shes dead well im asking you to assume the opposite to assume that perhaps someonesomeone german yes i think that must be trueis hiding her or keeping her against her will i opened another drawer why would someone want to do that do you have enemies herr baron im a banker herr hausner and as it happens a damned important one it might surprise you but bankers do make enemies yes money or the getting of money always brings enemies theres that and then theres what i did during the war to consider during the war i worked for the abwehr german military intelligence myself and a group of other germanargentine bankers helped to bankroll the war effort on this side of the atlantic we funded a number of german agents in the united states without success im sorry to say several of our most prominent agents were caught by the fbi and executed they were betrayed but im not sure by whom could someone blame you for that i dont see how i had no operational involvement i was just a money man von bader was making eye contact with me now plenty of it im not sure how relevant any of this is to my daughters disappearance herr hausner but there were five of us bankers funding the nazis in argentina ludwig freude richard staudt heinrich dorge richard von leute and me and i only mention this because late last year dr dorge was found dead on a street here in buenos aires hed been murdered heinrich was formerly an aide to dr hjalmar schacht i take it youve heard of him ive heard of him i said schacht had been the minister of economics and then president of the reichsbank in he had been tried for war crimes at nuremberg and acquitted im telling you all this so youll know two things in particular one is that its perfectly possible my previous life has caught up with me in somesome unfathomable way ive received no threats nothing the other thing is that im a very rich man herr hausner and i want you to take me seriously when i say that if you find my daughter alive and bring about her safe return ill give you a reward of two million pesos payable in whatever currency and whatever country you choose thats about fifty thousand dollars herr hausner thats a lot of money herr baron my daughters life is worth at least that much to me more much more but thats my business your business is to try to collect that two million pesos i nodded thoughtfully i guess it must have looked like i was weighing things up thats the trouble with me im coinoperated i start thinking when people offer me money i start thinking a lot more when its a lot of money do you have any children herr hausner no sir if you did you would know that moneys not that important next to the life of someone you love im obliged to take your word for that sir youre not obliged to take my word for it at all ill have my lawyers draw up a letter of agreement regarding the reward it wasnt what id meant but i didnt contradict him instead i took a last look around the room what happened to the bird in the cage the bird in the cage i pointed at the pagodasized cage on the tall table von bader looked at the cage almost as if he had never looked at it before oh that it died was she upset about it yes of course she was but i dont see how her disappearance could have anything to do with a bird i shrugged i have a fourteenyearold daughter herr hausner you dont as a result and with all due respect i think i can honestly say i know more about fourteenyearold girls than you do did she bury it in the garden i really dont know perhaps your wife does id really rather you didnt ask her about it shes upset enough about things as it is my wife holds herself responsible for the death of the bird and shes already looking around for reasons to blame herself for our daughters disappearance any implied suggestion that these two events might be connected would only add to the sense of guilt shes feeling about fabienne im sure you understand that might just have been true and maybe it wasnt but out of respect for his two million pesos i was prepared to let the bird go sometimes to take hold of the money you have to let go of the bird thats what they call politics we returned to the sitting room where the baroness had started crying again ive made a close study of women crying in my line of work it comes with the truncheon and the handcuffs on the eastern front in i saw women who could have won olympic gold medals for crying sherlock holmes used to study cigar ash and wrote a monograph on the subject i knew about crying i knew that when a woman is crying it doesnt pay to let her get too close to your shoulder it can cost you a clean shirt tears are however sacred and you violate their sanctity at your peril we left her to get on with it after we left the von bader house i insisted the colonel and i go to recoleta cemetery we were after all very close i wanted to see the place fabienne had been visiting when she disappeared like the viennese rich portenos take death very seriously enough to spend large sums of money on expensive tombs and mausolea but recoleta was the only cemetery id ever been where there werent any graves we went through a greekstyle entrance into what was a little city of marble many of the mausolea were classically designed and looked almost habitable walking around the neat and parallel stone streets was like touring some ancient roman town swept clean of its human inhabitants by a cataclysmic natural disaster looking up at the bright blue sky i half expected to see the smoking crater of a volcano it was hard to imagine a fourteenyearold girl coming to such a place the few living people we saw were old and gray i expect they had the same thought about me and the colonel we got back in the car and headed for the casa rosada it was a while since id driven a car not that anyone would have noticed i had seen worse drivers than portenos but only in benhur ramon novarro and francis x bushman would have felt quite at home on the streets of buenos aires nice and handy for the president to have his secret police headquartered in the casa rosada i said catching sight of the distinctive pink building again it has some advantages incidentally youve already seen the boss the youngish man in the pinstripe suit who was with us when you met peron thats him rodolfo freude hes never very far away from the president freude von bader mentioned a banker called ludwig freude any relation rodolfos father is that how he got the job its a long story but yes in effect was he in the abwehr too who rodolfo no but rodolfos deputy was werner koennecke werner is married to rodolfos sister lily it all sounds very cozy thats buenos aires for you its just like the cemetery at recoleta you have to know someone to get in who do you know colonel rodolfo knows some important people its true but i know people who are really important i know an italian woman who is the best whore in the city i know a chef who makes the best pasta in south america and i know a man who can kill someone and make it look like a suicide with no questions asked these are the important things to know in our strange profession herr hausner dont you agree i dont often awake and feel the need to have someone murdered colonel if i did id probably do it myself but i guess im just a little bit strange that way besides im too old to be impressed by anything very much except perhaps an italian woman i always did like italian women berlin department iv the ordinary criminal police was supposed to stand apart from department ia the political police dia was charged with the investigation of all political crime but it did not operate secretly the political police was supposed to work discreetly to forestall political violence of whatever hue given the situation in germany it was easy to understand why the weimar government had thought it necessary to bring such a police force into being in practice however neither the regular police force nor the german public liked the politicals and dia had proved to be spectacularly unsuccessful at preventing political violence what was more the point of having two separate police departments became all but meaningless as the majority of the murders we investigated turned out to be political a storm trooper murdering a communist or vice versa as a result dia struggled to establish its proper jurisdiction and to justify its continued existence true republicans considered its functions undemocratic and potentially ripe for exploitation by any unscrupulous government that might wish to establish a police state it was for this reason that professor hans illmann the pathologist handling the schwarz case preferred to meet away from the alex in his laboratory and office at the institute for police science in charlottenburg department iv and department ia might have existed on different floors of the alex but that was still too close for the politically sensitive nostrils of kripos leading forensic scientist i found illmann staring out of a deep bay window at a garden that had nothing to do with the police or pathology it and the villa it surrounded came from a gentler time when scientists had more hair on their cheeks than a mandrill baboon it was easy to see why he preferred being here instead of at the alex even with a couple of bodies in the basement the place felt more like an expensive retirement home than a forensic science institute he was as lean as a scalpel with rimless glasses and a little dutch chinbeard that made him everyones idea of what an artist ought to look like toulouselautrec in his much taller period as we shook hands i jutted my chin at a copy of der angriff lying on his desk what are you turning nazi on me reading shit like that if more people read this garbage then perhaps they wouldnt vote for these intellectual pygmies or at least they would know what germany can expect if they ever come to power no no bernie everyone should read this you especially should read it your card has been well and truly stamped my young republican friend and in public too welcome to the club he picked up the newspaper and started to read aloud the symbol of the iron front which was designed by a russian jew is three arrows pointing southeast inside a circle the meaning of the arrows has been interpreted differently some say that the three arrows stand for the opponents of the iron front communism monarchism and national socialism others say that these arrows stand for the three columns of the german workers movement party trade union and reichsbanner but we say it stands for one thing only the iron front is a political alliance that is full of pricks chief among the iron front pricks that pollute the berlin police force are police president grzesinski his yid deputy bernard weiss and their kripo lackey bernhard gunther these are the policemen who are supposed to be investigating the murder of anita schwarz you would think that they would be sparing no effort to catch this monster far from it commissar gunther astonished those attending yesterdays press conference when he informed this stunned reporter that he hopes the murderer will be spared the death penalty let me tell commissar gunther this that if he and his liberalminded mates somehow scrape together the competence to apprehend the murderer of anita schwarz there is only one sentence that will satisfy the german people death the fact is only brutality can now be respected in this country the german people demand that criminals feel good wholesome fear why get so worked up about the execution and torture of a few lawbreakers the masses want it they are shouting for something that will give criminals a proper respect for the law that is why we need the strong governance of national socialism as opposed to this bleedingheart sdp government that is afraid of its own corrupt shadow if commissar gunther spent more time worrying about catching killers and less time worrying about their rights then perhaps this city would not be the sink of iniquity it is now illmann tossed the paper across the desk at me and started rolling a perfect cigarette with the fingers of one hand to hell with those bastards i said im not worried no you should be if this july election doesnt prove conclusive one way or the other there might be another putsch and you and i could find ourselves floating in the landwehr canal just like poor rosa luxemburg be careful my young friend be careful it wont come to that i said the army wont stand for it im afraid i dont share your touching faith in our armed forces i think theyre just as likely to fall in behind the nazis as they are to stand up for the republic he shook his head and grinned no if the republic is to be saved im afraid theres just one thing for it youll just have to solve this murder before july fair enough doc so what have you got death was from asphyxia caused by chloroform anita schwarz swallowed her tongue i found traces of chloroform in her hair and in her mouth its a common enough death in hospitals heavyhanded anesthesiologists have killed many a patient in this way thats a comforting thought any sign that she was interfered with sexually impossible to tell given her lack of plumbing that could be why he did it of course to conceal evidence of intercourse he knew what he was about too a very sharp curette was used calmly and confidently this was no frenzied attack bernie the killer took his time perhaps thats why he used the chloroform in which case her fear was not a factor in his motivation she was probably unconscious and almost certainly dead when he butchered her you remember the haarmann case of course well this is something very different someone with medical experience perhaps i said thinking aloud in which case the proximity of the state hospital might be relevant very likely it is said illmann but not for the reason weve just been discussing no id say its the pill you found near the body that makes it relevant oh how what is it its nothing ive seen before in chemical terms its a sulfone group connected to an amine group but the synthesis is new i dont even know what to call it bernie sulfanamine i dont know it certainly doesnt exist in the current pharmacopoeia not here not anywhere which means its new and experimental have you any idea what it might be for the active sulfa molecule was first synthesized in and has been widely used in the dyemaking industry dyemaking my guess is that theres a smaller active compound thats contained inside the dyemaking molecule about fifteen years ago the pasteur institute in paris was using the sulfa molecule as the basis for some kind of antibacterial agent sadly the work came to nothing however this pill would seem to indicate that someone possibly here in berlin has successfully synthesized a sulfabased drug yes but what could you use it for you could use it against any kind of bacterial infection any streptococci however you would have to test the drug on some volunteers before publishing any results especially given the pasteurs previous failures using dyebased drugs an experimental drug being tested at the state hospital perhaps could be illmann finished his cigarette stubbing it out in a little porcelain ashtray made for the police exhibition of he seemed about to say something and then checked himself no go on i said i was only trying to think what might make berlin interesting to someone conducting a drug trial he shook his head because there are no drug companies based here in berlin and its not like we suffer from anything more than anywhere else in germany ah well now thats where youre wrong doc i said you want to read your police gazette instead of worrying about the shit thats in der angriff there are more than one hundred thousand prostitutes working in berlin today more than anywhere else in europe and thats just the straight ones god knows how many warm boys there are in this city my sergeant heinrich grund is always going on about it of course said illmann venereal disease since the war the figures have gone through the roof i said not that id know never having had a dose of jelly myself but the current treatment is neosalvarsan isnt it thats right it contains organic arsenic which makes its use somewhat hazardous even so in its time it was such an important discovery and efficacious remedyno proper remedy had existed beforethat neosalvarsan was called the magic bullet that was a german discovery too paul ehrlich won the nobel prize for it in an exceptionally gifted man could he no no hes dead alas interestingly salvarsan and neosalvarsan are dyebased compounds too which is where the problem with them lies in the color and that must be where this new compound scores someone must have worked out how to remove the color without compromising the antibacterial activity he nodded as if imagining the chemistry appearing on an invisible blackboard in front of his eyes ingenious so lets say we have a drug trial here in berlin i said for patients suffering from big jelly and little jelly syphilis and gonorrhea if it was effective against one it might well be effective against the other too how many patients would we be talking about for a trial in the beginning a few dozen a hundred at the most and all highly confidential mind you no doctors going to tell you which of his patients is suffering from a venereal disease not only that but if it works a drug like this could be worth millions the clinical trials are very likely top secret how would you recruit your volunteers illmann shrugged neosalvarsan treatment is no ice cream treat bernie its reputation precedes it and most of the horror stories youve heard are true so id have thought there would be no shortage of volunteers for a new drug all right suppose some tgirl gives our man a dose of jelly which makes him hate women enough to want to kill one meanwhile he volunteers for a drug trial to get his meat and two veg sorted but if a tgirl gives him a dose said illmann then why not kill a tgirl why kill a child tgirls are too savvy i saw one the other night built like a wrestler she was some fritz came in and wanted her charged with assault shed hit the bastard with her riding crop some men would pay good money for that kind of thing my point is this he kills anita schwarz because shes easier prey shes crippled makes it hard for her to get away could be he didnt even notice it after all it was dark all right allowed illmann thats just about possible just well then heres another thing something i havent told you yet on account of the fact that ive only just remembered i can trust you and this is hot stuff mind so keep it under your hat anita schwarz may have been disabled and she may have been just fifteen but she wasnt above earning herself some pocket money on the side youre joking one of her neighbors told me the girl had a major morals problem the parents wont talk about it and i didnt dare mention it at the press conference after the lecture izzy gave me about trying to keep the nazis sweet but we found quite a bankroll in her coat pocket five hundred marks she didnt get that from running errands to the local shop but the girl was crippled she wore a caliper and theres a market for that too believe me doc my god there are some evil bastards in this city now you sound like my sergeant grund then maybe you are right you know i never thought to test her for syphilis and gonorrhea ill do it immediately one more thing doc what kind of dyes are we talking about here food dyes cloth dyes hair dyes what organic dyes direct or substantive dyeing direct dyes are used on a whole host of materials cotton paper leather wool silk nylon why do you ask i dont know but somewhere at the bottom of the sock drawer i called my mind there was something important i rummaged around for a moment and then shook my head no its probably nothing my route back from charlottenburg took me in a straight line all the way from kaiserdamm to the tiergarten there were wild boars in the tiergarten you could hear them grunting as they wallowed in their enclosure or sometimes squealing like the brakes on my old dkw as they fought with one another whenever i heard that sound i thought of the reichstag and german party politics the tiergarten was full of animal lifenot just boars there were buzzards and woodpeckers and pied wagtails and siskins and batsthere were lots of bats the smell of cut grass and blossom that came through the open window of my car was wonderful it was the clean uncorrupted smell of early summer at this time of year the tiergarten was open until early dusk which also made it popular with grasshoppersthe amateur prostitutes with no room money who did it with their fritzes lying down on the grass or in the shrubbery nature is wonderful i looked at my watch as i came through the brandenburg gate and onto pariser platz there was time for lunch as long as lunch came in a brown bottle i could have stopped almost anywhere south of unter den linden there were lots of standups around gendarmen market where i might easily have got myself a sausage and a beer but anywhere wasnt where i wanted to go not when i was right outside the adlon hotel it was true id been there only a day or two before and a day or two before that the fact was i liked the adlon not for its ambience and its gardens and its whispering fountain and its palm court and its fabulous restaurant which i couldnt have afforded anyway i liked it because i liked one of the house detectives she was called frieda bamberger i liked frieda a lot frieda was tall and dark with a full mouth and an even fuller figure and a voluptuous sort of fertility about her that i put down to the fact that she was jewish but was actually something rather more indefinable she was glamorous too had to be her job involved hanging around the hotel posing as a guest and keeping an eye out for prostitutes con artists and thieves who liked the adlon for the rich pickings that were to be had from the even richer guests i had got to know her in the summer of when i helped her to arrest a female jewel thief who was armed with a knife i stopped frieda getting stuck with it by the simple means of getting stuck myself clever gunther for that i got a nice letter from hedda adlon the proprietors daughterinlaw and after i came out of the hospital a very personal kind of thankyou from frieda herself we werent sharing an envelope exactly frieda had a semidetached husband who lived in hamburg but just now and then wed search an empty bedroom for a lost maharajah or a stolen movie star sometimes it could take us a while as soon as i walked through the door frieda was on my arm like a hawk am i glad to see you she said and i thought you werent the type who cares im serious bernie and so am i i keep telling you only you dont listen id have brought flowers if id known you felt this way i want you to go into the bar she said urgently thats good thats where i was going anyway i want you to take a look at the guy in the corner and i mean the fritz in the corner not the redhead hes with hes wearing a dovegray suit with a doublebreasted waistcoat and a flower in his lapel i dont like the look of him if thats so then i hate him already no i think he might be dangerous i went into the bar picked up a matchbook lit a cigarette and gave the fritz the quick upanddown the girl he was with looked me up and down back this was bad because the fritz she was with was worse than bad he was ricci kamm the boss of the always true one of berlins most powerful criminal rings normally ricci stayed put in friedrichshain where his gang was based which was fine since he tended not to give us any trouble there but the girl he was with looked like she had an opinion of herself that was as high as the zugspitze probably she figured she was too good for joints like the zum nussbaum which was where the always true boys usually went for their kicks very likely she was right too ive seen betterlooking redheads but only on rita hayworth she was wearing good curves too i doubt she could have cut a better figure if shed been wearing sonja henies favorite ice skates riccis eyes were on mine but my eyes were on her and there was a bottle of bismarck in front of them both that said this might spell trouble ricci was a quiet sort with a small soft voice and nice mannersuntil he had one drink too many and then it was like watching dr jekyll turn into mr hyde from the level in the bottle ricci was about ready to grow an extra set of eyebrows i turned on my heel and went back into the lobby you were right not to like him i told frieda hes a dangerous man and i think his timers about to go off what are we going to do i waved max the hall porter toward me i didnt do it lightly max paid louis adlon three thousand marks a month to have that job because he got a kickback on everything he did for the hotels guests which made him about thirty thousand marks a month he was holding a dog leash which was attached to a miniature dachshund i figured max was looking for a bellboy to walk the thing max i said call the alex and tell them to send the kiddy car youd better order up a couple of uniforms as well theres going to be some trouble in the bar max hesitated as if he was expecting a tip unless youd rather handle it yourself max turned and walked quickly to the house phones and while youre at it go and check the easy chairs in the library and see if you cant rustle up one of those overpaid excops who call themselves house bulls frieda had never been a cop so she didnt take offense at my remark about excops but i knew she could look after herself adlon had hired her on the strength of her having been in the german womens olympic fencing team in paris in when shed narrowly missed a medal i took her by the arm and walked her to the bar when we sit down i said i want you all over me like ivy that way im not a threat to him we sat down at the table right beside ricci the bismarck had kicked in and he was sneering a series of swear words at a terrified bar waiter the redhead looked like shed seen it before most of the bars other customers were wondering if they could make it as far as the door without crossing riccis line of sight but one of them was made of sterner stuff a businessman wearing a frock coat and a meat slicer of a shirt collar and a look of indignation at the kind of low german that was spilling out of riccis mouth stood up and seemed inclined to take on the gangster i caught his eye and shook my head and for a moment he seemed to heed my warning the moment he sat down frieda let me have it on the ears and the neck and the back of my head and on my cheek and finally on my mouth which was where i liked it best of all youre cute she said with some understatement ricci looked at her and then at the redhead beside him why cant you be more like that he asked her jerking a thumb friedas way friendly like because youre drunk the redhead took out a powder compact and started to touch up her makeup a futile effort in my estimation like trying to touch up the mona lisa and when youre drunk youre a pig she had a point but ricci didnt care for it he stood up but the table stayed on his lap the bottle and the glasses and the ashtray went to the floor ricci swore and the redhead started to laugh a clumsy drunken pig she added for good measure and started to laugh again i liked the effect it had on the redheads mantrap of a mouth i liked the way her sharp white teeth shucked off her red lips like cherry skins but ricci didnt like it at all and let her have it hard with the flat of his hand in the adlons plush bar the slap went off like new years eve this was too much for the man wearing the meatslicer shirt collar he looked like a real prussian gentlemanthe kind who cares what happens to a lady even a lady who was probably a hundredmark whore uhoh frieda murmured in my ear the man from i g farben is about to play sir lancelot did you say i g farben i g farben was europes largest dyestuff syndicate the companys headquarters were in frankfurt but they had an office in berlin that was opposite the adlon on the other side of unter den linden that was what id been trying to remember in illmanns office im sorry said the man from i g farben his tone was as stiff as a washboard and just as square but i really must protest at your loutish behavior and your treatment of that lady the redhead picked herself off the floor and uttered a few short words that were common enough in the engine rooms of german naval vessels she was probably wondering if the fritz with the high collar was referring to her collecting the now empty bismarck bottle in her hand she swung it at riccis head the always true leader caught it neatly in his palm wrested it from her tossed it in the air like a jugglers club grabbed it by the neck and then swung it down hard against the edge of the upturned tableall in one easy practiced and delinquent gesture the bottle came up again glistening meaningfully triangular like a shard of razorsharp ice ricci took hold of the igf mans frock coat fisted him a foot closer and seemed on the point of acquainting him with a more fundamental rebuttal when i interrupted their conversation the barman at the adlon made the best cocktails in berlin he was fond of cucumbers too he put pickled cucumbers on the tables and slices of fresh cucumber in some of the drinks favored by americans a large uncut cucumber lay on the bartop looking for a knife id had my eye on it for a while i dont care for anything in my drink except ice but i liked the look of that cucumber besides my gun was in the glove box of my car i dislike hitting a man when his back is turned even with a cucumber it goes against my inherent sense of fair play but since ricci kamm didnt have a sense of fair play i hit him hard on the back of the hand holding the broken bottle he yelped and dropped it then i struck him with the cucumber on the side of his head twice if id had some ice and a slice of lemon id probably have hit him with those as well an exclamation tiptoed around the room as if id made a rabbit disappear from inside a top hat the only trouble was the rabbit was still there ricci sat down heavily holding his ear teeth bared nose twitching he reached inside his coat i didnt think he was looking for his wallet i saw a little black hippos head peeking out from a holster and then a colt automatic appeared in riccis hand it was a good firm cucumber hardly ripe at all springy with plenty of heft like a good blackjack i put a lot of weight into it i had to ricci didnt move his head more than an inch he didnt try to block the cucumber he was hoping to fire the gun before that happened he took it across the nose jerked back on the chair dropped the gun and lifted both hands to the bloodspattered center of his face figuring i might never get a better chance to do it i cuffed both of his wrists before he even knew what was happening i let ricci groan for a while before handing him a bar towel to press against his nose and hauling him by the cuffs to his feet acknowledging a round of applause from some of the other guests in the hotel bar i pushed ricci in the direction of two uniforms and then tossed the gun after him frieda moved in on the redhead time to go lovely she said taking hold of a bony elbow take your hands off me said the redhead trying to wrest her arm away but the elbow stayed held in friedas strong fist then she laughed and gave me a languorous northtosouth look that was really something what you did just now comrade like a christmas gift from the kaiser wait until people hear about this ricci kamm got himself arrested by a johann armed with just a cucumber hes never going to live it down leastways i hope he doesnt that bastards hit me once too often frieda steered her firmly toward the door leaving me with the man from igf he was tall thin and gray as full of prussian good manners as berlins herrenklub he bowed gravely that was admirable he said quite admirable im very grateful to you sir i dont doubt that thug would have seriously injured me perhaps worse the igf man had his wallet out and was pressing his business card on me it was as thick and white as his shirt collar his name was dr carl duisberg and he was one of the i g farbens directors from frankfurt may i know your name sir i told him i see the international reputation of berlins police force is well deserved sir i shrugged its amazing what you can do with a cucumber i said if theres anything i can do for you in return he said to show my gratitude name it sir name it i could use some information dr duisberg he frowned slightly puzzled he hadnt been expecting this of course if its in my power to give it does the dyestuff syndicate have anything to do with drug companies he smiled and looked slightly reassured as if the information i was seeking was common knowledge i can tell you that very easily the dyestuff syndicate has owned bayer since you mean the company that makes aspirin no sir he said proudly i mean the company that invented it i see i did my best to look impressed i guess i ought to be grateful considering the number of hangovers your company has helped me cope with so whats next in line doc whats the new wonder drug your people are working on now its not my field sir not my field at all im a chemical engineer whose field is it you mean one person i nodded my dear commissar we have dozens of research scientists working for us all over germany but mainly in leverkusen bayer is based in leverkusen leverkusen never heard of it thats because its a new town commissar gunther its made up of several small villages on the rhine and a number of chemical factories it sounds perfectly charming no commissar leverkusen is not at all charming but it is making money it is making money the doctor laughed but why do you ask sir here in berlin we have an institute for police science in charlottenburg i said and were always on the lookout for new experts we can call upon to help us with our inquiries im sure you understand of course of course i met this doctor whos handling some very sensitive clinical trials at the state hospital in friedrichshain here in berlin i think he said he was working for bayer and i was wondering if he might be the kind of discreet and reliable fellow who might help us out once in a while from all accounts hes a very gifted man i heard him described as the next paul ehrlich you know the magic bullet oh you must mean gerhard domagk said duisberg thats him i said i just wondered if you might be able to vouch for him as simple as that really well i havent actually met him myself but from what i hear hes very brilliant very brilliant indeed and very discreet he has to be much of our work is highly confidential im sure he would be delighted to help the berlin police if it was within his power to do so was there something specific you wanted to ask him no not yet perhaps in the future i pocketed the igf mans card and let him get back to the rest of his lunch party that let frieda get back to me she looked flushed and very grateful which is the way i like my women you handled that cucumber like a professional she said didnt you know before i joined the berlin polenta i was a greengrocer in leverkusen where the hell is leverkusen didnt you know its a new town on the rhine the center of the german chemical industry what do you say we go there for the weekend and you can show me how grateful you are frieda smiled we dont have to go that far to go that far she said we only have to go upstairs to room thats one of our vip suites empty right now but charlie chaplin once slept in room so did emil jannings she smiled again but then neither of them had me around to help keep them awake it was around fourthirty when i got back to the alex on my desk was a box of cucumbers i waved one in the air as several of the kripo men in the detective room cheered and clapped otto trettin one of the best cops in the department and a specialist in criminal rings like the always true came over to my desk there was a halfcucumber in his shoulder holster he took it out pointed it at me and made a noise like a pistol shot very funny i grinned and removed my jacket then hung it on the back of my chair wheres yours he asked your gun i mean in the car well that explains the cucumber i suppose come on otto you know how it is when you wear a gun you have to keep your jacket buttoned and in this warm weather weve been having you thought you could get away with it something like that seriously bernie now that youve gone up against ricci kamm youre going to have to watch your back your front too most likely you think so a man who puts ricci kamm in the charite with a broken nose and a concussion had better start carrying a firearm or hell be wearing a knife between his shoulder blades even a cop maybe youre right i admitted course im right you live on dragonerstrasse dont you bernie thats right on the doorstep of the always trues territory a guns no good in the glove box old man not unless youre planning to hold up a garage and still shooting the cucumber in my direction otto walked away you should listen to him said a voice he knows what hes talking about when words fail a gun can come in very handy it was arthur nebe one of the slipperiest detectives in kripo a former rightwing freikorps man he had been made a commissar in dia within just two years of joining the force and had a formidable record of solving crimes nebe was a founding member of the nsbagthe national socialist fellowship of civil servantsand was rumored to be a close friend of such leading nazis as goebbels count von helldorf and kurt daluege strangely nebe was also a friend of bernard weiss there were other influential friends in the sdp and around the alex it was generally held that arthur nebe had more options covered than the berlin stock exchange hello arthur i said what are you doing here is there not enough work in political that you have to come and poach down here ignoring my remark nebe said since he arrested the sass brothers ottos had to watch himself like he was painting his own portrait well we all know about otto and the sass brothers i said in otto trettin had almost been dismissed from the force after it became known that he had beaten a confession out of these two criminals what i did was in no way similar to that pulling ricci kamm was a proper collar i hope he sees it that way said nebe for your sake look here going without a barker is no good for a cop see last april after i put franz spernau in the cement i got so many death threats they were offering even money at the hoppegarten that someone would stall my motor before the end of the summer it was a bet that was almost collected too nebe grinned his wolfish grin and swept back his jacket to reveal a big broomhandled mauser only i stalled them first if you know what i mean he tapped the side of his not inconsiderable nose with clear meaning by the way hows the schwarz case coming along whats it to you arthur i know kurt daluege a little we were in the army together hes sure to ask the next time i see him actually i think im beginning to make real progress im more or less certain my suspect is a patient at the jelly clinic in the state hospital in friedrichshain is that so so you can tell your chum daluege that its nothing personal id be working just as hard to catch this kids murderer even if her father wasnt a lousy nazi bastard im sure hell be pleased to know it but speaking personally i cant see the point of bringing a kid like that into the world in the first place as a society i think we should follow the example of the romans you know romulus and remus we should leave them out on a hillside to die of exposure something like that anyway maybe only those two werent left on a hillside because they were sick but because their mother was a vestal virgin who had violated her vow of celibacy well i wouldnt even know how to spell that said nebe besides romulus and remus survived havent you heard thats how rome was founded im talking about the general principle thats all im talking about wasting money on useless members of society did you realize that it costs the government sixty thousand marks more to keep a cripple alive in this country than the average healthy citizen tell me arthur when we talk about healthy citizens are we including joey goebbels nebe smiled youre a good cop bernie he said everyone says so be a shame to stall a promising career because of a few thoughtless remarks like that who would say such a thing that these are just thoughtless remarks well arent they youre no red i know that i put a lot of effort into my detestation of the nazis arthur you of all people should know that nevertheless the nazis are going to win the next election then what will you do i shall do what everyone else will do arthur ill go home and stick my head in the gas oven and hope to wake up from a very bad dream it was another fine unusually warm evening i threw heinrich grunds jacket at him come on i said lets go and do some detective work we went downstairs and into the central courtyard of the alex where id parked my car i turned the key and pressed the button to operate the starter motor the car rumbled into life where are we going he asked oranienburger strasse why were looking for suspects remember thats the great thing about this city heinrich you dont have to visit the nuthouse to seek out twisted disordered minds theyre everywhere you look in the reichstag in the wilhelmstrasse in the prussian parliament i wouldnt be at all surprised if there were even one or two in oranienburger strasse makes the job a lot easier dont you think if you say so boss but why oranienburger strasse because its popular with a certain kind of whore gravel precisely it was a friday night but i couldnt help that every night was a busy one on oranienburger strasse cars stopped outside the central telegraph office which was open day and night and until the previous year oranienburger strasse had been the location of one of berlins more notorious cabarets the storks nest which was part of the reason the street had come to be popular with the citys prostitutes it was rumored that quite a few of the girls on oranienburger had previously worked at the stork before the clubs manager had brought in some younger cheaper nude dancers from poland on friday nights there was even more traffic than usual because of all the jews attending shul at the new synagogue which was berlins biggest the news size and magnificent onion dome were a reflection of the confidence the citys jews had once felt about their presence in berlin but not anymore according to my friend lasker some of the citys jews were already preparing to leave germany should the unthinkable happen and the nazis be elected as we arrived hundreds of them were streaming through the buildings multicolored brickwork arches men with large fur hats and long black coats men with shawls and ringlets boys with velvet skullcaps women with silk headscarvesand all under the watchful slightly contemptuous scrutiny of the several uniformed policemen who were positioned in twos at intervals along the length of the street just in case a group of nazi agitators decided to show up and cause trouble jesus christ exclaimed grund as we got out of the car look at this its like the bloody exodus ive never seen so many damn jews its friday night i said its when they go to pray like rats so they are he said with obvious distaste as for this he stared up at the huge synagogue with its central dome and the two smaller pavilionlike domes flanking it and shook his head sadly i mean whose stupid idea was it to let them build this ugly thing here whats wrong with it it doesnt belong here thats whats wrong with it this is germany were a christian country if they want this kind of thing they should go and live somewhere else like where palestine goshen somewhere with a hell of a lot of sand i dunno and i dont care just not here in germany thats all this is a christian country he stared malevolently at the many jews entering the new with their long beards and white shirts and black coats and big widebrimmed hats and glasses they looked more like nearsighted pioneers from americas nineteenth century we walked toward the friedrichstrasse end of oranienburger where the more specialized whores i was looking for were given to waiting you know what i think said grund surprise me these friedrichstrasse types should dress more like the rest of us like germans not like freaks they should try to blend in that way people would be less inclined to pick on them its human nature isnt it anyone who looks a bit different who looks like theyre setting themselves apart well theyre just asking for trouble arent they he nodded they should try to look like normal germans you mean brown shirt jackboots shoulder belt and swastika armband or how about leather shorts and flowery shirts i laughed yeah i understand normal sure you know what i mean boss german i used to know what that meant when i was in the trenches for instance now im not so sure thats just the point im making bastards like these have blurred things made it less obvious what being german is all about i suppose thats why the nazis are doing so well because they give us a clear idea of ourselves i might have said that this was a clear idea of ourselves i didnt much like but i wasnt in the mood to argue politics with him not again not now in berlin all special tastes were catered for the city was one big eroticand sometimes not so eroticmenu provided you knew where to look and what to ask for the chances were you could satisfy even the most peculiar taste you wanted an old womanand i mean an old woman of the kind that lives in a shoeyou went to mehnerstrasse which for obvious reasons was also known as old maid street you wanted a fat womanand i mean a fat woman of the kind that has a twin brother whos a sumo wrestler in japanyou got yourself along to landwehrstrasse also known as fat street now if mothers and daughters were your thing then you went to gollnowstrasse that was known as incest street racehorses girls you could use the whip on were most often found in the beauty shops and massage parlors that surrounded hallesches tor pregnant womenand i do mean pregnant women not girls with cushions stuffed up the front of their dirndlswere found on munzstrasse munzstrasse was also called coin street because there was a general sense that it was a place where people were prepared to sell absolutely anything unlike grund i usually tried to avoid sounding righteous about berlins famous sex scene what did we expect might happen to women in a country with almost two million german men dead in the war and perhaps as many people dead againmy own wife includedfrom the influenza what did we expect might happen after the bolshevik revolutionwith the country full of russian immigrantsand the inflation and the depression and the unemployment what did convention and morality matter when everything elsemoney work life itselfturned out to be so utterly unreliable but it was hard not to feel a little outraged at the trade going on around the north end of oranienburger strasse it was difficult not to wish fire from the air to purge berlin of this illicit trade in human flesh when you contemplated the life of the washedup stonefaced outcast prostitutes collectively known as gravel you wanted a woman with one leg one eye or a hunchback or hideous scars you went to the north end of oranienburger strasse and raked through the gravel you found them in the shadowsstanding in the doorway of the defunct storks nest or in the old kaufhaus arcade or sometimes inside a club called the blue stocking on the corner of linenstrasse there were plenty of women we could have spoken to but i was looking for one woman in particulara whore named gerdaand not finding her on the street i decided we should try inside the blue stocking the spanner on the door sat on a tall stool in front of the cash office his name was neumann and occasionally i used him as an informer hed once been a runner for the dragonfly ring that operated out of charlottenburg only now he wouldnt go anywhere near the area having doublecrossed them somehow for a spanner neumann wasnt all that tough but he had the kind of beaten criminal face that made people think he might not care what happened to him which sometimes amounts to a simulacrum of toughness plus i happened to know he kept an american baseball bat behind his stool and wasnt slow to use it commissar gunther he said nervously what brings you to the blue stocking im looking for a gartersnapper neumann grinned a grin so carious his teeth looked more like the discarded butts of twenty cigarettes arent they all sir he said the fritzes who waltz in here this one is gravel i said i wouldnt have thought you was the type for that kind of trade his grin widened horribly as he enjoyed what he hoped might be my embarrassment stop thinking i feel awkward asking about her because i dont i said the only thing i feel awkward about is your dentists feelings neumann her name is gerda the teeth disappeared behind thin cracked lips that were all twitchy like an angler with a hook in his mouth you mean like the little girl what rescues her brother kay in the snow queen thats right only this ones not so little not anymore plus shes short of an arm and a leg not to mention a few teeth and half her liver now is she here or am i going to have to give the lads in e a call e was inspectorate e the part of department iv that dealt with all matters relating to moralsor more usually the lack of them no need to be like that herr gunther just having a bit of fun thats all he lifted a dogtrainers clicker off a chain on his belt and clicked it loudly three times what happened to that sense of humor of yours commissar with each plebiscite it seems to get smaller at the sound of the dog clicker the door that led down into the club opened from the inside at the top of a steep flight of stairs stood another spanner only this one was wearing muscle neumann chuckled bloody nazis he said i know just what you mean commissar everyone says theyll close us all down the minute they get in i sincerely hope so remarked grund neumann shot him a look of quiet distaste gerdas downstairs he said stiffly how does she get downstairs with one leg and one arm asked grund neumann looked at me and then at grund with a smile dancing on the cracked playground of his lips slowly he said and let out a roar of laughter that i enjoyed as much as he did grund wasnt laughing think youre a comedian do you he said forget about it i told grund pushing him through the door and into the club you walked right into that one gerda wasnt yet thirty although you wouldnt have known it she could easily have passed for about fifty we found her sitting in a wheelchair within spitting distance of a small stage where a zitherplayer and a striptease dancer were having a competition to see which of them could look more bored by my reckoning the striptease dancer had it won by a couple of droopy tits on the table in front of gerda stood a bottle of cheap schnapps doubtless paid for by the man seated beside her who on closer inspection turned out to be a woman go and plaster it i told the bubi yeah grund flashed his warrant disc for good measure try the eldorado gerda thought that was funny the eldorado was a club for transvestite men the bubi sullen and predatorylooking like someones outcast uncle got up and went away we sat down on chairs as wobbly as gerdas remaining teeth i know you she told me youre that cop arent you i put a ten under her bottle whats the idea putting a shine on my table i dont know nothing sure you do gerda i told her everyone knows something maybe i do and maybe i dont she nodded im glad youre here anyway commissar i dont like that mon bijou scene you know the ladies club scorpions i mean beggars cant be choosers and id have done it with her if shed asked me nicely you know but i take no pleasure in a woman touching me down there i put a cigarette in gerdas mouth and lit it she was thin with short red hair bluish eyes and a reddish face she drank too much although she could hold it well enough most of the time the one time i knew she couldnt shed fallen down in front of a number tram on kopenicker strasse she might easily have been killed instead she lost her left arm and her left leg i remember now she said you put ricci kamm in the hospital smiling happily she added you deserve an iron cross for that copper as usual youre well informed gerda i lit my own cigarette and tossed her the pack easily amusedi figured that was how he became a nazi in the first placegrund was already paying more attention to the show than to our conversation tell me gerda did you ever see a snapper with a caliper age about fifteen blond boyish carried a stick name of anita she had cerebral palsy a spastic we know she was selling it because we found a bedroll in her pocket and because the neighbors said she was selling it neet yeah i heard she was dead poor kid gerda poured herself a drink from the bottle and swallowed it in one like it was cold coffee came in here sometimes nicely spoken girl considering considering what asked grund his eyes remained on the strippers teats which were altogether larger than would have seemed probable considering she couldnt speak very well gerda made a noise that came mostly out of her nose talked like that you know what else can you tell us about her i refilled gerdas glass and poured one for myself just to look sociable from what i gathered she didnt get on with her parents they didnt like her being a gimp you know and of course they didnt like her being on the sledge she didnt do it all the time mind just when she wanted to irritate them i think her dad was something in the nazi party and it used to piss him off that shed come out and sell it sometimes hard to believe murmured grund that anyone would you know with a disabled kid gerda laughed oh no darling its not hard to believe at all lots of men do it with disabled girls in fact its quite the thing these days i expect its something to do with the war all those terrible injuries some of the men came home with left a lot of them feeling quite inadequate in all sorts of ways i think that doing it with gravel helps them find the confidence to get it up makes them feel superior to the gimp theyre with its cheaper too of course cheaper than the regular people dont have the money for that kind of thing not like they used to she shot grund an amused pitying look oh no dearie ive seen girls with half a face find a fritz in here sides most fritzes arent looking at you anyway wont meet your eye so what a girls shine looks like or whether shes got all her bits is not as important as the fact that shes got her mouse gerda laughed no darling you ask some of your mates at work and theyll tell you the same thing you dont look at the whole house when youre putting a letter in the box coming back to anita i said was there ever anyone in particular you saw her with a regular fritz anything at all gerda grinned how about a name she put some rawlooking fingers on the ten make it a gypsy and ill give you his otto normal i took out my wallet and put another ten on the table as a matter of fact there was a guy one guy in particular licked his lollipop myself once or twice but he preferred anita name of serkin rudi serkin she went to his apartment once or twice it was in that big rent barracks on mulackstrasse the one with all the entrances and exits the ochsenhof said grund thats the one but thats in always true territory he said so take an armored car gerda wasnt joking the ochsenhof was a big block of slum apartments in the epicenter of the toughest neighborhood in berlin and a virtual nogo area for the police the only way cops from the alex were ever likely to visit the ochsenhof was with a tank to back them up theyd tried it before and failed beaten back by snipers and petrol bombs not for nothing was it known as the roast what did he look like this rudi serkin i asked about thirty small dark curly hair glasses smoked a pipe bow tie oh and jewish she chuckled at least he didnt have a wrapper on his lollipop a jew muttered grund i might have known got something against jews have you darling hes a nazi i said hes got something against everyone for a moment or two we were all silent then a voice said loudly finished your talking have you we looked around and saw the striptease dancer staring drill holes through us gerda laughed yeah weve finished good said the dancer and dropped her drawers in one quick and unerotic movement she bent over and paused just to make sure everyone got a good view of everything then collecting her underwear off the floor she straightened up again and stalked crossly off the stage i decided it was time we followed her example leaving gerda to finish her bottle alone we went upstairs and took a deep breath of clean berlin air after the venereal atmosphere of the blue stocking i felt like going home and washing my feet in disinfectant and planning my next trip to the dentist the sight of neumanns hideous smile as we were leaving was a dreadful warning grund nodded with enthusiasm at least now weve got a name he said you think so you heard her i smiled rudolf serkin is the name of a famous concert pianist i said all the better make a nice splash in tempo better still in der angriff i said and shook my head my dear heinrich the real rudolf serkin would no more get involved with a crippled whore than hed play my parrot doesnt like hardboiled eggs at the bechstein hall whoever it was gerda met and whoever it was she saw anita with they just gave a false name thats all maybe there are two rudolf serkins maybe but i doubt it would you give your real name to a bit of gravel you picked up in the blue stocking no i suppose not you suppose right gerda knew it too only she had nothing else to give what about the address she gave out the one address in berlin she knows the polenta doesnt dare set foot in she was playing us a tune chum then why did you let her keep the gypsy why i looked up at the sky i dunno maybe because shes only got one leg and one arm maybe thats why anyway the next time i see her shell know she owes me grund grimaced youre too soft to be a cop do you know that from a nazi like you ill take that as a compliment the next morning i left my peek cloppenburg suit in the closet and put on my fathers tailcoat and stiff collar until his untimely death he had worked as a clerk for the bleichroder bank on behrenstrasse i dont think i ever saw him wearing a lounge suit lounging was not something he did much of my father was a pretty typical prussian deferential loyal to his emperor respectful punctilious i got all those qualities from him while he was alive we never got on as well as we might have done but things were different now i took a good look at myself in the mirror and smiled i was just like him apart from the smile and the cigarette and the extra hair on top of my head all men come to resemble their fathers that isnt a tragedy but you need a hell of a sense of humor to handle it i walked to the adlon the hotel car service was run by a pole named carl mirow carl had once been hindenburgs chauffeur but left the weimar presidents service when he discovered he could make more money driving for someone important like the adlons carl was a member of the german automobile club and was very proud of the fact that in all his many years on the roads he had kept a clean license very proud and very grateful too in a raw young berlin policeman named bernhard gunther had stopped carl for going through a red light he smelled like hed gone through quite a bit of schnapps as well but i decided to let him off it wasnt very prussian of me maybe grund was right maybe i was too soft to be a cop anyway ever since carl and i had been friends the adlons had a huge black mercedesbenz pullman convertible with headlamps the size of tennis rackets and fenders and running boards as big as the ski jump at holmenkollen it was a real plutocrats car the kind of plutocrat who might be a director on the board of the dyestuff syndicate impersonating dr duisberg wasnt much of a plan but i couldnt figure out another way of getting anything out of dr gerhard domagk at the state hospitals jelly clinic illmann wasnt usually wrong about such things it did seem highly unlikely that any doctor would ever give out the kind of sensitive information that i was after unless he thought that in effect he was giving out that information to his employer carl mirow had agreed to drive me to the state hospital the big mercedesbenz made quite an impact as we drove through the hospitals grounds especially when i wound down the window and asked a nurse for directions to the urological clinic carl got a little cross about that he said suppose someone sees the license plate and thinks that mr adlon has got a dose of jelly mr adlon was louis adlon the hotels owner he was a man in his sixties with thinning white hair and a rather neat white mustache do i look anything like mr adlon no besides if you had a dose of jelly would you come to the clinic in a car like this or with your collar up and your hat pulled down we pulled up outside the redbrick outbuilding that housed the urological clinic carl sprang out and opened the door for me in his drivers livery he looked like my old company commander which was probably the real reason i hadnt pinched him for running a red light back in i was always a bit sentimental like that i went into the clinic the entrance doors were double and had frostedglass windows the hall inside was bright and cool and the linoleum floor was wearing so much polish that your shoes squeaked loudly as you tried to tiptoe up to the front desk once there under the vaulted ceiling your muttered plea for medical care would have sounded like a stage whisper in an opera a strong smell of ether wasnt just in the air the strawberry blonde behind the welcome desk looked like she gargled with the stuff i placed dr duisbergs business card on her desk and told her i wanted to see dr domagk hes not here she said i suppose hes in leverkusen no hes in wuppertal that was somewhere else i hadnt ever heard of there were times when i hardly recognized the country in which i was living i suppose thats another new town i wouldnt know she said whos in charge while hes away dr kassner then hes the person i want to see have you an appointment i smiled affecting a show of selfimportant patience i think youll find i dont need one if you give dr kassner that business card you see nurse i fund all of the research in this clinic so unless you want to join the ranks of the six million unemployed i suggest you hurry along and tell him im here the nurse colored a little stood up took duisbergs card and her feet squeaking like a series of squashed mice disappeared through a set of swing doors a minute passed and a pale awkward man came through the main entrance of the clinic he was walking slowly like someone with a bad leg he kept his eyes on the linoleum as if expecting to find a better explanation than an overdose of floor polish for the noise under his shoes at the desk he stopped and gave me a sideways sort of look probably wondering if i was some kind of doctor i smiled at him lovely day i said breezily then a man in a white coat appeared in the hall striding powerfully toward me like a founding member of the wandervogel one hand outstretched and the other holding duisbergs business card he was big and baldheaded which made him seem more military than medical underneath the white coat he was dressed much as i was a professional man with a position in the community dr duisberg sir he said unctuously with a slight speech impediment that might have been due to some illfitting false teeth what an honor sir what an honor im dr kassner dr domagk will be so very disappointed to have missed you hes in wuppertal yes so ive just been informed the doctor looked pained i trust there hasnt been some kind of a mixup and that he wasnt expecting you he said no no i said im only in berlin for a brief visit i had a short time to kill between appointments so i thought i might just drop by and see how the clinical trial is coming along the dyestuff syndicate is very excited by your work here i paused of course if its inconvenient no no sir he bowed if youre happy to make do with my own inadequate explanations im sure they will be quite sufficient for a layman like me then do please come this way sir we went through the swing doors and into a corridor where a dozen or more rather miserablelooking men were seated along the wall each of them holding what was either a urine sample or a very poor example of berlins notoriously unpleasant tap water kassner ushered me into his office which was suitably clinical there was an examination couch some shelves stuffed with medical textbooks a couple of chairs some filing cabinets and a small desk on the desk was a portable bing with a sheet of paper rolled into the carriage and a telephone on the walls were some graphic illustrations that had me shrinking into my bladder and were almost enough to persuade me to take a vow of celibacy i reflected i was probably the first man in a long while whod walked into that little office and not been asked to drop his trousers how much do you know about our work here he asked only that youre working on a new magic bullet i said im not a medical doctor im a chemical engineer dyestuffs are my forte just assume youre explaining things to an educated layman well as you probably know sulfa drugs are synthetic antimicrobial agents that contain sulfonamides one of those drugsa drug called protonsilwas synthesized by josef klarer at bayer and tested on animals by dr domagk successfully of course since then weve been testing it on a small group of outpatients who are suffering from syphilis and gonorrhea but in the course of time we hope to find that protonsil will be effective in treating a whole range of bacterial infections inside the body oddly it has no effect in the test tube its antibacterial action only seems to work inside living organisms which leads us to suspect and to hope that the drug is successfully metabolized inside the body how big is your trial group i asked really weve only just started so far weve given protonsil to approximately fifty men and about half as many womentheres a separate clinic for them of course at the charite some of our test cases have only just caught a venereal disease and others have had one for a while its intended that over the next two or three years we shall test the drug on as many as fifteen hundred to two thousand volunteers i nodded almost wishing i had thought to bring illmann with me at least he might have asked some pertinent questions even a few impertinent ones so far continued kassner the results have been very encouraging might i see what the drug looks like he opened his desk drawer and took out a bottle and then emptied some little blue pills onto my gloved palm these looked exactly the same as the little pill id found near anita schwarzs dead body of course it wont look like that when the trial is over the german medical establishment is rather conservative and prefers its pills white but theyre blue for the moment to help distinguish them from anything else were using and your study group notes might i see one case file yes indeed kassner turned to face one of the wooden filing cabinets there was no key he drew up the tambour front and then pulled open the top drawer this is a summary file containing brief notes on all of the patients whove been treated with protonsil to date he opened the file and handed it over i took out my fathers pincenez a nice touch i told myself and pinced them on the bridge of my nez this was my list of suspects i told myself with these names i might very well have solved the case in less time than it took to cure a dose of jelly but how was i going to get hold of this list of names i could hardly memorize it nor could i ask to borrow it one name caught my eye however or rather not the namebehrendso much as the address reichskanzlerplatz in the west end of the city near the grunewald was undoubtedly one of the most exclusive addresses in the city and for some reason it appeared familiar to me as you probably know kassner was saying the problem with salvarsan is that it is only slightly more toxic for the microbe than the host no such problems have presented themselves with protonsil rubrum the human liver deals with it quite effectively excellent i murmured as i glanced further down the list but when i saw two johann mullers a fritz schmidt an otto schneider a johann meyer and a paul fischer i began to suspect that the list might not be all id hoped it was these were five of the most common surnames in germany tell me something doctor are these real names to be honest i dont know admitted kassner we dont insist on seeing identity cards here otherwise they might never volunteer for the clinical trial patient confidentiality is an important issue with moral diseases i suppose thats especially true since the national socialists started talking about a cleanup of morals in this city i said but all of those addresses are real enough we do insist on that so that we might correspond with our patients over a period of time just to keep a check on how theyre all doing i handed back the file and watched as he placed it in the top drawer of the filing cabinet well thank you for your time i said standing up ill certainly be making a favorable interim report to the dyestuff syndicate on your work here ill walk you to your car herr doktor we went outside carl mirow threw away his cigarette and opened the heavy car door if dr kassner had harbored any doubts about who i was they were banished by the sight of a uniformed chauffeur and a limousine as big as a heinkell carl drove to dragonerstrasse and dropped me in front of my building he was glad to see the back of me and especially glad to see the back of dragonerstrasse which wasnt anywhere to bring a chauffeur and a mercedesbenz i went up to my apartment put on some normal clothes and went out again i got into my car and headed toward the west end i had an itch i suddenly wanted to scratch number reichskanzlerplatz was an expensive modernlooking apartment building in just about the richest leafiest suburb in berlin a little farther to the west lay grunewald racecourse and the athletics stadium where some berliners hoped that the olympics might be staged in my late wife had been especially fond of this area to the south of the racecourse was the seeschloss restaurant where i had asked her to marry me i parked the car and went over to a kiosk to get some cigarettes and perhaps some information give me some reemtsmas a new berliner tempo and the week i said i flashed my warrant disc we had a report of some shots fired in this area anything in it the vendor who wore a suit an austrian hat and a little mustache like hitlers shook his head car backfire probably but ive been here since seven this morning and i havent heard a thing i figured as much just looking around i said still you have to check these things out theres never any trouble around here he said although there could be how do you mean he pointed across reichskanzlerplatz to where it intersected with kaiserdamm see that car he was pointing at a dark green mercedesbenz parked right in front of number three yes there are four sa men sitting in that car he said pointing north up ahornallee he added and another truckload of them over there how do you know theyre sa havent you heard the ban on uniforms has been lifted of course its today isnt it some cop i am i didnt even notice so who lives around here ernst rohm nope although he does visit on occasion ive seen him going in there to the groundfloor apartment on the corner of number three owned by mrs magda quandt who the vendor grinned for a bull who takes as many newspapers as you do you dont know much me i just look at the pictures so go ahead and educate me i handed over a five and while youre at it keep the change magda quandt she got married last december to josef goebbels i see him every morning comes out and buys all the papers it gives the clubfoot some exercise i suppose hes not so bad ill take your word for it i shrugged well i can see why he married her nice building like that wouldnt mind living here myself i shook my head thing is i cant for the life of me see why she married a little fritz like him i tossed the papers in the car crossed over to the other side of the square and glanced in the window of the car parked out front of number three the vendor was right it was full of nazi brown shirts who eyed me suspiciously as i went by apart from some clowns id seen fooling around in an old model t at the circus one christmas it would have been hard to have seen more obvious stupidity in one car it was all coming back to me now why the address had jogged my memory in kassners office one of the other homicide teams at the alex had been obliged to check an sa mans alibi with goebbels a month or two before the building had its own doorman of course all the nice apartment buildings in the west end had a doorman probably there was an armed sa man somewhere inside the lobby keeping him company just to make sure goebbels was well protected he probably needed it too the communists had already made several attempts on hitlers life i didnt doubt they wanted to assassinate goebbels i wouldnt have minded taking a poke at the little satyr myself naturally id heard the rumors that despite his cloven hoof and his diminished size he was really quite a ladies man the word around the alex was that it wasnt just goebbelss foot that looked like a club that while he may have been short of stature he was outsized on the butchers counter that goebbels was what berlins lineboys would have called a breslauer after a large sausage of the same name much as i disliked him however i was still finding it hard to imagine joey the crip taking the risk of an open trip to the jelly clinic in friedrichshain unless of course hed gone in as a private patient after hours when no one else was about i rounded the rusticated corner of the building and stopped below what must have been joeys bathroom window it was slightly open i looked back over my shoulder the car containing the storm troopers was out of sight the truck was nowhere to be seen i glanced back up at the frostedglass window if i put my foot on the horizontal joint of the ground floors rusticated brickwork it looked as though it would be just possible to push myself up the side of the building and reach the bottom of the window i tried it once just long enough to check that the bathroom was empty before dropping back down onto the deserted sidewalk i waited for a moment no storm troopers came to beat me up so much for security the next time i did it i pulled myself up the side and slid quickly through the open bathroom window breathing heavily i sat on the toilet and while i waited to see if my entry would be detected i took a closer look at the window and saw that the ratstail casement was broken on the sill even when the window looked like it was closed it would have been a relatively simple matter to open it from the outside it was a big bathroom with pink tiles all over and a round pedestal basin there was a liberal dusting of talcum powder on the bathroom mat the boxedin bath was as deep as a car door with a hand shower in case magda wanted to wash her hair by the wallmounted soap dish was a small framed picture of hitler as if even here the devoted joey could keep his beloved leader in mind at right angles to the bath was a stool on which sat a pile of fluffy towels and next to this a matching table on which stood a loofah and an antiquarian statue of a naked lady above the table was a large mirrored bathroom cabinet which naturally i opened most of the shelves were magdas she used joy perfume kotex nivea wella shampoo wellapon kolestral and blondor i remembered her now i remembered the pictures of the wedding in the magazines a winter wedding the happy smiling couple arminarm in the snow accompanied by several sa menprobably the same careless louts who were sitting outside in the carand of course hitler himself i wonder what hitler would have said if hed known that magdas beautiful perfectly aryan blond hair was dyed joey had only one shelf in the cabinet and it seemed we had something in common after all joey shaved with a schick injector razor and mennen shaving cream and cleaned his teeth with colgate toothpaste a bottle of anzora hair cream explained joeys perfectly brushed head of dark hair then between a packet of beechams laxative pills and some acqua di parma cologne was a bottle containing some blue pills i opened it and emptied one out in my hand it was the same pill i had seen in kassners office earlier that morning protonsil i decided that was my cue to leave but not before using joeys toilet and not flushing it was my way of thanking him for what hed written about me in his newspaper i went out the window returned to my car and drove quickly away in germany there were things that it didnt seem healthy to know about i didnt doubt for a minute that joeys jelly was one of these there were nine technical inspectorates at the alex inspectorate a dealt with murder and c dealt with thefts gunther braschwitz was the boss of c and specialized in burglaries he had a younger brother rudolf who was in the political police but we didnt hold that against him braschwitz was as elegant as your little finger and a real champagnepisser he wore a bowler hat carried a stick with a sword in it which he would sometimes use and in winter at least wore gaiters above his boots he knew all the screensthe citys professional burglarsand it was said could look at a breakin and tell which of them had probably done it jewface klein i said seen him lately jewface he claims hes going straight said braschwitz managed to get himself a job at heilbronners on mohrenstrasse the antique shop thats right he always had a very good eye that jewface why has he been up to his old tricks no but he knows someone im looking for a friend of that widow he used to partner eva zimmer only half of this was true but i didnt want braschwitz asking too many questions poor eva he said she was a good widow that girl a widow was someone a screen used to get rid of his illgotten goods not a real widow just someone pretending to be one some of them like eva zimmer were professional actresses they would dress up in black and with a wellrehearsed hardluck story try to sell stolen gold silver or jewelry to the highstreet goldsmiths until id arrested jewface he and eva had had one of the best partnerships in berlin i knew he was six months out of tegel prison but there was nothing on file of what hed been doing since after braschwitz had told me all he knew about jewface i telephoned the adlon and asked frieda what she could tell me about josef goebbels goebbels was a regular patron of the adlon and frieda was able to give me some information that i thought i might use to help bait klein i walked to heilbronners but the manager told me klein wasnt there its his lunch hour he said youll probably find him across the street at gsellius the bookshop he usually goes in there at lunchtime i crossed the street and peered in the bookshop window jewface was in there all right i saw him straight away a little older than i remembered but a year in the cement can put five on your shine his face wasnt particularly jewish to be honest he had the nickname from the jewelers eyeglass he used to wear when he was appraising something hed stolen but he did have a nose for cops i hadnt been there for more than a few seconds when he looked up from the book he held and met my eye i nodded at him to come outside and reluctantly he did we werent friends exactly but i was counting on his not having forgotten that it was i whod found the pimp whod stabbed eva zimmer the previous year a man named horst wessel and the pity of it was that wessel who was also a member of the sa had then been murdered by another pimp ali hohler in an argument over some whore before i could make the arrest because hohler happened also to be a communist goebbels had managed to turn these tawdry events into a political melodrama which was how horst wessel had achieved his unlikely immortalization in a song that was now heard all over berlin when the sa went on one of its provocative marches through a communist neighborhood naturally goebbels had left out of the story the underworld connections of these plankton protagonists meanwhile hohler had been arrested by one of my colleagues and sentenced to life imprisonment which left jewface very much aggrieved with goebbels for having waxed eva zimmers sordid murder from the nazis canta storia of horst wessels heroic past we went around the corner to siechens on friedrichstrasse where i bought us a couple of nurembergs and took a closer look at him his face was all sharp angles thin and pointed like something pythagoras had doodled on the corner of his scroll before getting on with his theorem so what can i do for you herr gunther i need a favor jewface i want someone to break into a doctors office at the state hospital someone intelligent who can read and write and not get greedy i dont want anything stolen thats good because im retired i dont steal and i dont go breaking and entering not since eva got stabbed look all i want you to do is open a file and do a bit of copying out a secretary with a key could do it but i dont have a key for a man of your experience it couldnt be simpler i sipped my beer and let him blow me off like the froth on top of his own untouched glass youre not listening commissar im retired prison worked for me give yourself a medal medals is it i cant give you a medal jewface but you do what i ask copy out some names from some files at the hospital and i can give you something else i dont want your money copper i wouldnt insult you no this is something better than money its even patrioticthat is if you believe in the republic i dont as it happens it was the republic that put me in the cement all right call it revenge then revenge for eva i sipped some more of my beer and let him wait keep talking how would you like to shove one up joey goebbels im listening joey the crip lives at number three reichskanzlerplatz corner apartment ground floor eastern end a bunch of sa men sit out front so youll have to be careful but they cant see around the corner to where joeys bathroom faces the side street theres a ratstail casement stay on the bathroom window thats broken you can be in and out in no time bread and butter to a man like you jewface i did it myself just an hour or two ago the man is a fanatic jewface do you know hes got a photograph of hitler on the side of the bath anyway the apartment is owned by his wife magda she used to be married to a rich industrialist called gunther quandt who was very generous with the divorce settlement he let her keep all her mints you know the ones you like the ones you can sell at margrafs of course with an election coming goebbels is out a lot making speeches that kind of thing in fact i happen to know that joeys making a speech tonight at nazi party headquarters on hedemannstrasse it will be an important speech theyre all important between now and the end of july but maybe this one is more important than most hitler will be there afterward magdas throwing a little soiree for him at the adlon hotel which would give a man plenty of time i sipped some more beer and thought about ordering some sausage it had been a busy morning so what do you say do we have a deal will you copy out these names for me like i asked like i told you already gunther im a reformed character im trying to lead an honest life jewface smiled and offered me his hand but thats the thing about the nazis they bring out the worst in people the next morning i had a handwritten list of names and addresses from all over the city and beyond not as good as a list of suspects but perhaps the next best thing now all i had to do was check them out the residents registrations office was on the railwaystation side of the alex in room from this thirdfloor office the address of any resident of berlin might be obtained quite legally by any other resident of the city the prussian authorities had meant well the knowledge that information in the state was freely available was supposed to help buttress faith in our fragile democracy in practice however it just meant that nazi storm troopers and communists alike were able to find out where their opponents lived and take appropriately belligerent action democracy has its disadvantages too not available to the general public at the registration office but available to police was the devils directory so called because it worked backward all you had to do was look up a street name and a house number and the devils directory told you the name of the person or people living there so it was the work of a morning to put a real name alongside each of the addresses and bogus patient names that jewface klein had copied from the summary file in dr kassners office this was a mundane task i might normally have ordered one of my sergeants to attend to but i never was very good at giving ordersno more than i was any good at taking them besides if id given the job to a sergeant i might have ended up having to explain where and how id gotten hold of the list in the first place kripo could be very unforgiving of bent coppers even coppers who were bent not for themselves but for the job for the same reason another mundane task i was going to have to perform myself was check out every name on that list there was however nothing mundane about one name in particular i had found using the devils directory this was dr kassners own name and i was looking forward to finding out why his home address should have been on a list of patients involved in bayers clinical trial of protonsil when i got back to my desk grund was there typing something on my ancient carmen one ponderous finger at a time as if he had been killing ants or playing the opening notes of some tuneless russian piano concerto where the hell have you been he asked where the hell have you been sir i said illmann called the schwarz girl tested negative for jelly and gennat wants us to go and check out some girl found dead in the municipal cattle market looks like she was shot but were to give it a quick sketch anyway just in case makes sense i suppose the cattle market is only a few hundred yards from where we found the schwarz girl in friedrichshain park we were there in a matter of minutes market days were wednesdays and saturdays so the place was closed and deserted but the restaurant was open and some of the patronswholesale butchers mostly from pankow weissensee and petershagenreported seeing three men chasing the girl into the yards but the descriptions were vague too vague to be worth writing down the body itself was in the slaughterhouse she looked about twenty shed been shot in the head at fairly close range there was a brown mark around the bullet hole all the clothing below her waist was gone and from the smell of her it seemed probable shed been raped but that was it there had been no amateur surgery on this poor creature circumstances arousing suspicion right enough said grund after quite a while i would have been surprised if he hadnt said it nicelooking box on her he added go ahead and give her one why dont you ill look the other way i was just saying he said i mean look at it her box its been shaved mostly not something you often see thats all bare like that like a little girl i rifled through her handbag which one of the uniformed schupos had found a short distance away from the body and found a communist party card her name was sabine farber shed worked at kpd headquarters close to where i lived her home was in pettenkoferstrasse on the edge of lichterfelde just a hundred yards east of where shed been murdered already it seemed abundantly clear to me what had probably happened fucking nazis i said with loud disgust christ im fed up with this grund said frowning how do you work that out that they were nazis who did this you heard the descriptions given by those butchers no one mentioned seeing any brown shirts or swastikas not even a toothbrush mustache so how do you figure that theyre nazis oh its nothing personal heinrich i tossed him sabine farbers party card but they werent jehovahs witnesses trying to find a convert he looked at the card and shrugged as if allowing only the possibility that i was right come on its got their fingerprints all over it my guess is that the three men the butchers reported seeing were storm troopers wearing plain clothes so as not to draw attention to themselves they must have been waiting for her when she came out of the kpd headquarters on bulowplatz its a nice day so she decided to walk home and didnt notice that they were following waiting for a good opportunity to attack her when she spotted them she ran in here hoping to escape only they cornered her and then did what brave storm troopers do when theyre fighting a terrible menace like international bolshevism heinrich i suppose some of that might be right he said more or less which part do you agree with less i asked grund didnt answer he put sabine farbers card back in her bag and stared down at the dead girl what is it that hitler says i asked strength lies not in defense but in attack i lit a cigarette i always wondered what that meant i let the smoke char my lungs for a moment and then said is this the kind of attack that he means do you think your great leader of course not muttered grund you know it isnt what then you tell me id like to know give it a rest why dont you me i laughed its not me who needs to give it a rest heinrich its the people who did this theyre your friends the national socialists you dont know any of that for a fact no youre right i dont for real vision you need a man like adolf hitler perhaps he should be the detective here not a bad ideaim sure i prefer the idea of him as a cop to the idea of him becoming the next chancellor of germany i smiled and its an even bet hed have a superior cleanup rate to me who better to solve a citys crimes than the man who instigates most of them christ i wish i didnt have to listen to you gunther grund spoke through gritted teeth there was color in his face that ought to have warned me to be careful he was a boxer after all you dont i told him im going back to the alex to tell the political boys that this is one for them you stay here and see if you cant get some better witnesses than those sausagemakers i dunno perhaps youll get lucky perhaps theyre nazis themselves theyre certainly ugly enough who knows perhaps theyll even give you descriptions of three orthodox jews i suppose it was the sarcastic grin that did it for him i hardly saw the punch i hardly even felt it one second i was standing there grinning like torquemada and the next i was lying on the cobbled ground felled like a heifer and feeling as if id been struck by a bolt of electricity in the halflight available to my eyes grund was standing over me with fists clenched like firpo staring down at dempsey and shouting something at me his words were quite silent to my ears all i could hear was a loud highpitched noise finally grund was hustled away by a couple of uniformed bulls while their sergeant bent down and helped me to my feet my head cleared and i shifted my jaw against my hand the bastard hit me i said he did that said the cop searching my eyes like a referee wondering if he should allow the fight to proceed or not we all saw it sir from his tone i assumed he meant that he took it for granted i was going to press disciplinary charges against grund hitting a superior officer was a serious offense in kripo almost as bad as hitting a suspect i shook my head no you didnt i said the cop was older than me nearing retirement probably his short hair was the color of polished steel he had a scar in the center of his forehead it looked as if a bullet had struck him there whats that you say sir you didnt see anything sergeant any of you got that the sergeant thought about this for a moment and then nodded if you say so sir there was blood in my mouth but i was uncut no harm done i said and spat onto the ground what was it all about he asked politics i said thats what everythings always about in germany these days politics i didnt go straight back to the alex instead i drove to kassners apartment on donhoffplatz which wasnt exactly on the way being at the eastern end of leipziger strasse i stopped on the north side of some ornamental gardens the bronze statues of two prussian statesmen stared at me across a low privet hedge a small boy out for a walk with his mother was looking at the statues and probably wondering who they were i was thinking about how dr kassners home address had come to be on a list of names i had got from jewface klein i knew kassner would still be at the hospital so i really havent a clue what i was expecting to find out but i am an optimist like that when youre a detective you have to be and sometimes you just have to do what your instincts tell you to do i walked up to the shiny black front door and took a closer look there were three bells one of them was clearly labeled kassner beside the door were two castiron planters filled with geraniums the whole area oozed respectability i pulled the bell and waited after a while i heard the key being turned and the door opened to reveal a man in his early twenties i lifted my hat innocently dr kassner no said the man hes not here my name is hoffmann i said raising my hat once again from isar life insurance the young man nodded politely but said nothing i glanced quickly at the other two names by the bell pulls herr kortig no herr peters is it no im a friend of dr kassners and as i said hes not here right now when will the doctor be back do you think herr you can probably find him at the state hospital at the urological clinic the man grinned as if somehow he hoped that this piece of information might embarrass me there was a large gap between his front teeth im sorry but i really do have to go im late for an appointment would you excuse me certainly i stepped aside and watched him descend the front steps onto the square he was of medium height goodlooking and dark in a gypsy kind of way but neat with it he was wearing a lightcolored summerweight suit a white shirt but no tie at the bottom of the steps he climbed over the door of a little opentopped opel it was white with a blue stripe i hadnt paid any attention to it beforemaybe i was still a little bit punchybut as he started the engine and drove off i suddenly realized i needed to take down the license plate all i got was the characters a before the car disappeared around the corner of jerusalemstrasse at least i knew that the slippery young man was from munich an hour later i was back at my desk i saw heinrich grund on the other side of the detectives room and was just about to go over and tell him there were no hard feelings on my part when the full ernst arrived beside me like a bus reaching its depot he was wearing a threepiece blue pinstriped suit in a size huge and had a senior going fullblast in the corner of his mouth he removed the cigar and i heard what sounded like the bellows on a church organ an invisible choir of smoke and sweet coffee and something stronger perhaps descended on me as from mount sinai and a lung ailment of a voice commanded my attention anything in that murder over at the cattle yard he asked it looks like an aggravated political killing i said aggravated they raped her as well gennat grimaced the dpp wants to see us gennat never called weiss izzy he didnt even call him bernard he called him weiss or the dpp now whats it about i asked wondering if grund had been stupid enough to report himself for striking a senior officer the schwarz case he said what about it but gennat had already waddled off expecting me to follow as i went after him i reflected that gennat had the flattest feet of any cop id ever seen which was hardly surprising given the bulk they had to carry he must have weighed almost three hundred pounds he walked with his arms behind him which was hardly surprising either given how much of him was in front we went upstairs and along a quieter corridor lined with the pictures of previous prussian police presidents and their deputies gennat knocked on izzys door and opened it without waiting we went inside bright sunshine was streaming through grimy doubleheight windows as usual izzy was writing on the window seat like a warmlooking cat and smelling lightly of cologne sat arthur nebe whats he doing here i growled sitting down on one of the hard wooden chairs gennat sat on the chair next to it and hoped for the best now now bernie said izzy arthurs just here to help i just came back from the cattle market theres a dead girl in one of the pens murdered by nazis most probably given that she was a cardcarrying red he could apply his formidable skills to that case if he wants but theres nothing political about the murder of anita schwarz izzy put down his pen and leaned back i thought i made it clear that there is he said whoever killed anita schwarz was a nutcase not a nazi i said although i will concede that its not at all uncommon for these two particulars to be coterminous i believe commissar gunther makes the point for me said nebe quite eloquently as usual and what point might that be commissar nebe look here bernie said izzy there are certain officials in the general im not in the general i said im in the official have queried your ability to remain impartial he continued they think your open hostility to the national socialist party and its adherents might actually get in the way of solving this murder who said i was hostile to nazism oh come on bernie said nebe after that press conference everyone knows youre iron front lets not talk about that press conference said gennat it was a disaster all right i said lets not after all whats any of it got to do with me finding the killer the dead girls parents herr and frau schwarz have alleged that you have behaved aggressively and unsympathetically toward them because of their politics said izzy since then theyve alleged that you have been acting on some malicious gossip concerning her moral character who told you that heinrich grund i suppose actually they spoke to me said nebe she was a prostitute i told izzy an amateur its true but a prostitute nevertheless call me oldfashioned but i thought that it might just have a bearing on why she was murdered as well as how after all its not like prostitutes havent been murdered before in this city and genital mutilation is something weve come across in cases of lust murder even arthur would admit that much surely i lit a cigarette i didnt ask permission to do it i wasnt in that kind of mood but if we are talking politics may i remind everyoneespecially you arthurthat its not against police regulations to be part of the iron front it is against police regulations to be a member of the nazi party or the kpd im not a member of the nazi party said nebe if bernies referring to my belonging to the national socialist fellowship of civil servants then thats something different you dont have to be a member of one to be a member of the other i feel were getting off the subject here a little said izzy what i really wanted to talk about was herr schwarzs position as a member of kurt dalueges family daluege has been mentioned as a possible future police president for that reason were keen to avoid any possible embarrassment to him i thought an election had to happen before that was even a possibility sir i said as a matter of fact i was counting on it i believe lots of people are you included if im not wrong but maybe thats just me being oldfashioned again i was under the strong impression that our job was to protect the republic not the reputations of thugs like daluege and schwarz not oldfashioned bernie said gennat but perhaps a little naive regardless of what happens in the july election this country will have to reach some sort of accommodation with the national socialists i dont see how else anarchy and chaos are to be avoided in germany we just want whats best for the berlin police added izzy i think we all do and its in the best interests of the berlin police that this matter is dealt with more sensitively izzy shook his head but you you are not sensitive bernie you are not diplomatic you tread heavily you want me off the case is that it i asked him no one wants you off the case bernie said gennat youre one of the best detectives weve got i should know i trained you myself but we think it might be useful to have arthur on board said izzy to take care of the finer points of community relations you mean when it comes to speaking to bastards like otto schwarz and his wife i said precisely said izzy i couldnt have put it better myself well id certainly be grateful for any help in that department i said and smiled at nebe i suppose ill just have to try my best to conceal my prejudices when im speaking to you arthur nebe smiled his crafty smile he seemed impossible to provoke since were all of us on the same side yes indeed i murmured perhaps you would care to share with us what you have discovered so far i didnt tell them everything but i told them a lot i told them about the autopsy and the protonsil pill and the five hundred marks and how anita schwarz had been on the sledge and that i had started to suspect that her probable killer was most likely a fritz whod caught a dose of jelly and wanted to get even with a snapper and that he had probably picked anita schwarz because her disability made her an easy victim and that as soon as i spoke to dr kassner at the state hospitals urological clinic i could have a list of possible suspects i didnt mention i already had one and i certainly didnt mention what id discovered about joey the crip you wont get anything out of a doctor said gennat not even with a court order hell sit on his big fat doctorpatient privilege and tell you to go and screw yourself this sounded good coming from a man whose own fat bottom would have been the envy of a pocket battleship and hell be entitled to do so as im sure you know i stood up and bowed ordinarily id agree with you sir but i think youre forgetting something oh whats that i think youre forgetting that arthurs not the only cop in the alex who can play prince bloody charming i can do that too at least i can when the cause seems even vaguely worthwhile i rang the urological clinic to find out what time it closed and was told five pm at fourthirty i filled a thermos and drove back to kassners house on donhoffplatz once there i switched off the engine poured myself some coffee and started on the papers id bought in reichskanzlerplatz they were a day old but that didnt seem to matter very much in berlin the news was always the same german chancellors made german chancellors overthrown and all the while the number of the unemployed kept on rising meanwhile hitler raced around the country in his mercedesbenz telling people that he was the solution to everyones problems i didnt blame those who believed him not really most germans just wanted to have something to hope for in the future a job a bank that stayed solvent a government that could govern good schools streets that were safe to walk on good hospitals a few honest cops at about sixthirty dr kassner showed up in a new black horch i got out and followed him up the steps to his front door recognizing my face he started to smile but the smile quickly faded when he saw my cheap suit and the kripo disc in my hand commissar gunther i said from the alex so youre not dr duisberg from the dyestuff syndicate no sir im a homicide detective im investigating the murder of anita schwarz i thought you looked rather young to be on the board of a company of that size and importance well youd better come in i suppose we went up to his apartment the place was modern a lot of bleached burr walnut and cream leather and bronzes of naked ladies standing on tiptoe he opened a cocktail cabinet the size of a sarcophagus and helped himself to a drink he didnt offer me one we both knew that i didnt deserve to have a drink he sat down and put his drink on a scallopedged wooden coaster that was on a scallopedged coffee table he crossed his legs and silently invited me to sit down nice place i lied live here alone yes now whats this all about commissar there was a girl found dead in friedrichshain park several nights ago shed been murdered yes i read about it in tempo terrible but i dont see i found one of your protonsil pills near the body ah i see and you think one of my patients might be the culprit its a possibility id like to explore sir of course it might just be a coincidence one of my patients walking home from the clinic could have dropped his pills several hours before the body was found i dont buy that the pill hadnt been there that long there was a shower of rain that afternoon the pill we found was in pristine condition then theres the girl herself she was a juvenile prostitute lord how very shocking one theory im exploring is that the killer may have contracted venereal disease from a prostitute thus giving him a motive to kill one is that it its a possibility id like to explore kassner sipped his drink and nodded thoughtfully so why that stupid pantomime in the clinic i wanted to see a list of patients you were treating couldnt you have asked to see it legitimately yes but you wouldnt have shown it to me thats quite right i wouldnt i couldnt it would have been unethical he smiled so what are you a memory man did you hope to remember every name on the list something like that i shrugged but there were rather more names than you had bargained for which is why youre back here now and at my home rather than the clinic because you hoped that this might make it easier for me to forget my doctorpatient duty of confidentiality something like that yes my first duty commissar is to my patients some of whom are very dangerously ill suppose for a moment that i did share information regarding their true identities with you and suppose you chose to interview some of them all of them i dont know they might very well feel id betrayed their confidence they might never again return to the clinic to complete their treatment in which case they might very easily go and infect someone else and so on and so on he shrugged you do see what i mean i regret the murder of anyone however i do have to be mindful of the bigger picture heres my bigger picture dr kassner the person who killed anita schwarz is a psychopath she was horribly mutilated the kind of person who kills like that usually does it again i want to find this maniac before that happens are you prepared to have another murder on your conscience you make a very fair point commissar its quite a dilemma isnt it perhaps the best thing would be to put the matter before the prussian medical ethics committee and let them decide how long would that take kassner looked vague a week or two perhaps a month and what do you think they would decide he sighed i would never like to secondguess a medical ethics committee im sure its the same in the police there are always proper procedures to be observed although they dont really seem to have been observed here i wonder what your superiors would make of your conduct toward me he shook his head but let us suppose that the committee turns down your request thats a realistic possibility i think what could you do then i suppose you could try to interview everyone coming in and out of the clinic of course its only a small percentage who are in the clinical trial the vast majority of my patientsand i do mean a vast majority commissaris still using neosalvarsan and what would happen then why you would frighten people away of course and we would have an epidemic of venereal disease in berlin as things stand now we are barely controlling the disease there are tens of thousands of people in this city suffering from jelly as you call it no commissar my own suggestion to you would be to try to find a separate line of inquiry yes sir i do believe that would be the best thing for all concerned you make some good points doctor i said im so glad you think so however when i was in your office i couldnt help noticing that one of the addresses on your list of patients using protonsil is this address perhaps youd care to comment on that i see that was very sharp of you commissar i suppose you think that might make me a suspect its a possibility i cant afford to ignore sir no of course not kassner finished his drink and got up to pour himself another but i still wasnt on his list of people he wanted to have a drink with well then its like this its not uncommon for doctors to infect themselves with a disease theyre trying to cure he sat down again burped discreetly behind his glass and then toasted me silently is that what youre saying doctor that you deliberately infected yourself with a venereal disease to test protonsil on yourself thats exactly what im saying sometimes its not enough to test the side effects of a drug on other people they are less able to describe the full effects of a drug on the human body as i believe i stated when first we met its rather difficult to keep tabs on patients in these cases sometimes the only patient one can really trust is oneself im sorry if you think that makes me a suspect but i can assure you that ive never murdered anyone as it happens though i believe i can supply an alibi for the day and night of that poor girls death im delighted to hear it i was attending a urologists conference in hannover i nodded and took out my cigarettes do you mind he shook his head and sipped some of his drink the alcohol hit his stomach and made it start rumbling heres what id like to suggest doctor something that might help this inquiry something you might like to do voluntarily that wouldnt offend your sense of ethics if its within my power i lit my cigarette and leaned forward so i was in range of the scallopedged ashtray have you ever had any psychiatric training sir some as a matter of fact i did my medical training in vienna and went to several lectures on psychiatry once i even considered working in the field of psychotherapy if you are agreeable id like you to look over all your own patient notes see if theres any one of them who perhaps stands out as a possible murderer and supposing there was one patient who stood out what then why then we could discuss the matter and perhaps discover some mutually acceptable way forward very well i can assure you ive no desire to see this man kill again i have a daughter myself i glanced around the apartment oh she lives with her mother in bavaria were divorced im sorry dont be and the man who was here when i called earlier on today ah you must mean beppo hes a friend of my wifes and came to collect some of her things in his car hes a student in munich kassner yawned im sorry commissar but its been a very long day is there anything else only id like to take a bath you cant imagine how much i look forward to taking a bath after a day in the clinic well perhaps you can imagine yes sir i can imagine it quite well enough we parted more or less cordially but i wondered just how cordial kassner would have been if id mentioned josef goebbels there was nothing around the apartment to indicate kassner was a nazi on the other hand i couldnt imagine goebbels taking the risk of being treated by anyone other than a trusted nazi party member joey wasnt the type to put much faith in things like ethics and professional confidence sadly there was nothing to suggest that the nazi party leader in berlin might actually be a psychopathic murderer either a dose of jelly was one thing the murder and mutilation of a fifteenyearold girl was quite another buenos aires i did not open the old kripo files that colonel montalban had somehow obtained from berlin in spite of what i had told him the details of the case were still quite familiar to me i knew perfectly well why it was i had been unable to apprehend anita schwarzs murderer but i started work all the same i was looking for a missing girl who just might be dead and i was keeping an eye out for one of my old comrades who just might be a psychopath neither of the investigative questions i had been set by the heroworshipping argentine policeman seemed likely to get the answer he was looking for mostly i was just looking out for myself but i went along with his idea of course what other choice did i have at first i was nervous about playing the part the colonel had written for me for one thing i wanted as little to do with other exss men as possible and for another i was convinced that in spite of montalbans assurances they would be hostile to someone asking a lot of questions concerning events most of them probably wanted to forget but more often than not the colonel turned out to be right as soon as i mentioned the word passport it seemed there was nothing that europes most wanted war criminals were not prepared to talk to me about indeed sometimes it seemed that many of these creatures actually welcomed the chance to unburden themselvesto talk about their crimes and even to justify them as if they were meeting a psychiatrist or a priest in the beginning i went to their places of work most of the nazis in buenos aires had good wellpaying jobs they worked for a variety of companies such as the capri construction company the fuldner bank vianord travel the local mercedesbenz plant the osram lightbulb company caffetti orbis gas appliances the wander laboratory and sedalana textiles a few worked in slightly humbler occupations at the durer haus bookshop in the city center the adam restaurant and the abc cafe one or two worked for the secret police although these remainedfor the moment at leastsomething of a mystery to me a man at work however is often a very different person from the man he is at home it was important that i encountered these men relaxed and off guard and after a short while i started turning up at their houses and their apartments in true gestapo fashion which is to say late at night or early in the morning i kept my eyes and ears open and always i kept my true opinion of these men a secret it would hardly have done to give my honest impression of any of them there were times of course when i wanted to unholster the smith wesson given to me by montalban and put a bullet in an old comrades head more commonly i went away from their homes wondering what kind of country i was in that would give sanctuary to beasts like these of course i already knew only too well what kind of country had produced them some were happy or at least content with their new lives some had attractive new wives or mistresses and sometimes both one or two were rich only a few were filled with quiet regret but mostly they were ruthlessly unrepentant the only sorrow displayed by dr carl vaernet related to his no longer being able to experiment freely on homosexual prisoners at buchenwald concentration camp he was quite open about this his lifes most important work vaernet was from denmark but living with his wife and children at calle uriarte close to the plaza italia in the palermo district of buenos aires dark thickset with shadowy eyes and a mouth full of pessimism and bad breath he was operating an endocrinology clinic offering expensive cures to the betteroff parents of argentine homosexuals a very masculine country argentina regarded being joto or pajaro as a danger to the health of the nation when your red cross passport runs out i told vaernet that is if it hasnt run out already you will have to apply to the federal police for a special passport to get this passport you will have to prove that while you have been resident in argentina youve been a person of good conduct friendsif you have anywill have to oblige with testimonials as to your character and integrity if this proves to be the caseas im sure it willi myself will issue you with the goodconduct pass that you can then use to apply to a court of first instance for an argentine passport naturally the passport can be in a different name the important thing is that you will be able to travel freely again in europe without fear of arrest like any normal argentine citizen well of course wed like to visit our eldest son kjeld in denmark confessed vaernet he smiled at the thought of it much as we love it here in buenos aires home is always home eh herr hausner we were sitting in the drawing room there was a baby grand piano with a number of framed photographs on the lid one of the photographs was of the perons and their poodleseva holding the black one juan holding the whitetogether looking like an advertisement for scotch whiskey vaernets wife served tea and facturas little sweet pastries that were very popular with the sweettoothed portenos she was tall thin and nervous i took out a pad of paper and a pen and tried to appear properly bureaucratic date and place of birth i asked april copenhagen my own birthday is april i said when he looked blank i added the fuhrers birthday it wasnt true of course but it was always a good way of making men like him think that i was some kind of diehard nazi and therefore someone to be trusted of course how silly of me not to remember thats all right im from munich another lie ever been to munich no lovely city at least it was after a short series of anodyne questions i said many germans have come to argentina believing that the government is not interested in their backgrounds that it doesnt care what a man did in europe before he arrived in this country im afraid that just isnt true at least not anymore the government doesnt judge a man for what he did during the war the past is past and whatever youve done it certainly wont affect your being able to stay in this country but im sure youll agree it does have some bearing on who you are now and what kind of citizen you might become what im saying is this the government doesnt want to issue a passport to anyone who might do something to make himself an embarrassment to the government so you may speak to me in total confidence remember i was an ss officer like yourself my honor is loyalty but i do urge you to be candid doctor dr vaernet nodded im certainly not ashamed of what i did he said at this his wife got up and left the room as if the prospect of her husbands speaking frankly about his work might be too much for her the way the conversation turned out i cant say i blamed her reichsfuhrer himmler regarded my attempts to surgically cure homosexuals as work of the greatest national importance to the ideal of german racial purity he said earnestly at buchenwald i implanted hormone briquettes into the groins of a number of the pink triangles all of these men were cured of their homosexuality and released back into normal life there was a lot lot more of this and while vaernet struck me as being a thoroughgoing bastardi never yet met a queer who didnt strike me as someone quite comfortable being that wayi wasnt convinced he was a psychopath of the kind that could have eviscerated a fifteenyearold just for the hell of it on the piano next to the picture of the perons was a photograph of a girl about the same age as fabienne von bader i picked it up your daughter yes she goes to the same school as fabienne von bader doesnt she vaernet nodded naturally youd be aware shes disappeared yes of course were they friends no not really has she spoken about it yes but nothing important you understand if it had been of any relevance id have called the police of course he shrugged they asked a lot of questions about fabienne they were here yes my wife and i formed the impression that they thought fabienne had run away its what children do sometimes well i turned toward the door i had better be going thank you for your time oh one more thing we were talking about proving oneself to be a person of good character yes youre a respectable man herr doktor anyone can see that i shouldnt think that there will be any problems with issuing you a goodconduct pass no problems at all however yes i hesitate to mention it but you being a doctor im sure youll understand why i have to ask this kind of thing is there anyone among our old comrades here in argentina who you think might not be worthy of a goodconduct pass someone who might potentially bring real disrepute to argentina its an interesting question said the doctor i know and i hate asking it were all of us in the same boat after all but sometimes these questions have to be asked how else are we to judge a man if we dont listen to what other people say about him i shrugged it might be something thats happened here or something that happened back in europe during the war perhaps no no youre quite right to ask herr hausner and i appreciate your confidence well then let me see he sipped some tea and thought for a moment yes theres a fellow called eisenstedt wilhelm von eisenstedt who was an ss captain at buchenwald he lives in a house on calle monasterio and calls himself fernando eifler hes let himself go a bit drinks too much but at buchenwald he was notoriously and sadistically homosexual i tried to suppress a smile eifler had been the man in the dressing gown with whom id shared the safe house on monasterio when i first arrived in argentina so that was who and what he was also yes also a man called pedro olmos his real name is walter kutschmann and hes another exss captain kutschmann was a murderer by anyones definition of the word someone who enjoyed killing for killings sake vaernet described kutchsmanns wartime activities in detail i believe he now works for osram the lightbulb company i cant answer for what kind of man he is today but his wife geraldas conduct is less than proper in my opinion she gasses stray dogs for a living can you imagine such a thing what kind of a person could do that what kind of a woman is it who gasses poor dumb animals for a living i could easily have answered him only he wouldnt have understood but i went to see pedro olmos anyway he and his wife lived on the outskirts of the city near the electrical factory where pedro olmos worked he was younger than id imagined no more than thirtyfive which meant he was in his midtwenties when hed been a gestapo captain in paris and little more than a boy when hed been a lieutenant murdering jews in poland as part of a special action group he had been just eighteen when anita schwarz was murdered in and i thought he was probably too young to be the man i was looking for but you never can tell pedro olmos was from dresden he had met and married geralda in buenos aires they had several dogs and cats but no children they were a goodlooking couple geralda didnt speak german which was probably why pedro felt able to confess that hed been a lot more than just friendly with coco chanel while he was stationed in paris he was certainly smooth enough he spoke excellent spanish french and some polish which he said was why he was working in osrams travel department both he and geralda were much exercised about the citys straydog population which was considerable and they had a grant from the city authorities to round them up and gas them it seemed an unusual occupation for a woman who described herself as an animal lover she even took me to their basement and showed me the humanekilling facility she used this was a simple metal hut with a rubbersealed door that was attached to a petrol generator geralda carefully explained that when the dogs were dead she burned the bodies in their household incinerator she seemed very proud of her humane service and described it in a way that made me think shed never heard of such a thing as a gas van given olmoss ss background it wasnt too difficult to imagine that perhaps she had got the idea from her husband i asked him the same question i had asked vaernet was there anyone among our old comrades in argentina whom he considered to be beyond the pale oh yes olmos spoke with alacrity and i was beginning to realize that there was not much loyalty among the old comrades i can give you the name of just such a man probably the most dangerous man ive ever met anywhere his name is otto skorzeny i tried not to look surprised naturally i knew of otto skorzeny few germans had not heard of the daring author of mussolinis mountaintop rescue in i even remembered seeing photographs of his heavily scarred face in all the magazines when hitler had awarded him the knights cross he certainly looked like a dangerous man the trouble was skorzeny did not appear on the list of names that the colonel had given me and until his name came up id had no idea that he was still alive let alone that he now lived in argentina a ruthless killer yes but a psychopath i decided to ask montalban about him when next i saw him meanwhile pedro olmos had thought of someone else he considered a person undeserving of a goodconduct pass the ratline as the americans called organizations like the odessa and the old comrades which existed to help nazis escape from europe was beginning to look well named the man olmos thought of was called kurt christmann christmann was interesting to me because he was from munich and born in which made him twentyfive at the time of anita schwarzs murder he was fortythree years old once a lawyer who now worked for the fuldner bank on avenida cordoba christmann lived in a comfortable apartment on esmeralda and within five minutes of meeting him i had marked him down as a definite suspect he had commanded a killing detail in russia for a while id been in the ukraine myself of course it gave us something to talk about something i could use to help gain his confidence and get him talking fairhaired with rimless glasses and a musicians slender hands christmann wasnt exactly the kind of blond beast youd have seen striding across the screen in a leni riefenstahl movie he was more the sort youd have seen walking quietly through a law library with a couple of books under his arm until hed joined the ss in hed worked for the gestapo in vienna innsbruck and salzburg and i marked him down as the kind of promotionhungry medalseeking nazi id often met before not so much blood and iron as bleach and bakelite so you were out in ukraine too he said going all comradely on me which part white ruthenia minsk lvov lutsk all over we were in the southern part of russia mainly he said krasnodar and stavropol and in the northern caucasus the action group was headed by otto ohlendorf and beerkamp my unit was commanded by an officer named seetzen nice fellow we had three gas vans at our disposal two big saurers and a little diamond mostly it was clearing out hospitals and asylums the childrens homes were the worst but dont think these were normal healthy kids mind they werent they were gimps you know feebleminded retarded kids bedridden disabled better off out of it if you asked me especially given the way the popovs looked after them which was to say hardly at all the conditions in some of these places were appalling in a way gassing them like we did was a bloody kindness putting them out of their misery we were youd have done the same for an injured horse anyway thats the way we looked at it he paused as if recalling some of the terrible scenes that he had witnessed i almost pitied him i wouldnt have had his thoughts for anything mind you it was still hard work not everyone could stick it some of the kids would catch on as to what was happening and wed have to throw them in the vans that could be pretty rough we had to shoot a few who tried to escape but once they were inside the van and the doors were shut it was pretty quick i think theyd hammer on the sides of the truck for a few minutes and that would be it over the more of them we managed to squeeze into the truck the quicker it would be i was in charge of that detail between august and july by which time we were in general retreat of course then i went to klagenfurt where i was chief of the gestapo then koblenz where i was also head of the gestapo after the war i was interned in dachau by the amis only i managed to escape hopeless they were the amis couldnt guard a fire then it was rome and the vatican before i ended up here right now im working for fuldner but im planning to try the real estate business theres plenty of money to be made in this city but i do miss austria most of all i miss the skiing i was the german police ski champion you know really clearly i had misjudged him completely he might have been a murdering bastard but he was a sporting murdering bastard you are right to look surprised herr hausner he laughed ive been ill you see i was in brazil before coming here to argentina and managed to pick up a case of malaria really ive still not recovered full health he went into the kitchen and opened the door of a newlooking di tella refrigerator beer no thanks i was particular about whom i drank with not while im on duty kurt christmann laughed i used to be like you he said opening a beer bottle but now i try to be more like the argentines i even take a siesta in the afternoon people like me and you hausner were lucky to be alive he nodded a passport would be good but i dont think ill be going back to germany germanys finished i think now that the popovs are there theres nothing there for me except perhaps a hangmans noose we did what we had to do i said what we were told to do i knew this speech well enough by now id heard it often during the last five years we were just carrying out orders if wed refused to obey we would have been shot ourselves thats right agreed christmann thats right we were only obeying orders now that id let him run a bit i decided to try to reel the line in mind you i said there were some a few a few rotten apples who enjoyed the killing who went beyond the normal course of duty christmann pressed the beer bottle to his cheek and thought for a moment then he shook his head you know something i really dont think thats true not that i saw anyway maybe it was different in your outfit but the men i was with in the ukraine all of them handled themselves with great courage and fortitude thats what i miss most the comradeship the brothers in arms thats what i miss most i nodded in seeming sympathy i miss berlin most of all i said munich too but berlin most of all you know something i never went to berlin what never no he chuckled and drank some more beer i dont suppose i shall ever see it now eh i went away full of satisfaction at having done an excellent days work its the people you meet that make being a detective so rewarding once in a while you meet a real sweetie like kurt christmann who restores your faith in medieval justice and vigilantism and other thoroughly sensible latin american practices like strappado and the garrote sometimes its hard to walk away from people like that without shaking your head and wondering how it ever got to be that bad how did it ever get to be that bad i think something happened to germany after the great war you could see it on the streets of berlin a callous indifference to human suffering and perhaps after all those demented sometimes cannibalistic killers we had during the weimar years we ought to have seen it coming the murder squads and the death factories killers who were demented but also quite ordinary krantz the schoolboy denke the shopkeeper grossmann the doortodoor salesman gormann the bank clerk ordinary people who committed crimes of unparalleled savagery as i was looking back at them now they seemed like a sign of that which was to follow the camp commanders and the gestapo types the desk murderers and the sadistic doctors the ordinary fritzes who were capable of such dreadful atrocities the quiet respectable mozartloving germans among whom i was now cast away to live what did it take to murder thousands of children week in week out an ordinary person or someone who might have done it before kurt christmann had spent a whole year of his life gassing russian and ukrainian children the feebleminded the retarded the bedridden and the disabled children like anita schwarz perhaps for him there had been more to it than just obeying orders perhaps he had actually disliked disabled children maybe even enough to have murdered one in berlin i certainly hadnt forgotten that he was from munich id always had a strong suspicion that the man id been looking for in had come from munich berlin there were two men waiting by my car they were wearing hats and doublebreasted suits that were all buttoned up the way you do when youve got more than just a fountain pen in your breast pocket i told myself they were a little far south to be ricci kamms a little too smooth too ring members tended to wear broken noses and cauliflower ears the way some men wear watch chains and carry canes there was all that and the fact that they looked pleased to see me when youve been in the zoo as long as i have you kind of get to know when an animal is going to attack it gets all nervous and agitated because for most people its upsetting to kill someone but these two were calm and selfassured are you gunther that all depends on what on what you say next someone wants to talk to you so why isnt someone here because hes in the eldorado buying you a drink does this someone have a name herr diels rudolf diels maybe im the shy type maybe i dont like the eldorado besides its a little early for a nightclub exactly makes it nice and quiet somewhere private you can hear yourself think i get all sorts of strange ideas when i hear myself think i said like maybe theres some point to my existence but since there isnt wed better get along to the eldorado the eldorado on motzstrasse was on the ground floor of a modern building that was in the high concrete style like the old eldorado which still existed on lutherstrasse the new was a heshe club popular with berlin high society expensive prostitutes and adventurous tourists eager to get a taste of real berlin decadence inside the club was a facsimile of a chinese opiumsmoking den only it wasnt just a facsimile if sex was one reason to visit the eldorado then the ready supply of drugs was another but at that hour of the day the place was more or less deserted the bernd robert rhythmics had just finished rehearsing in the corner beside a copper gong as big as a truck tire a youngish man with a largish scar on his face was sharing a bottle of champagne with two girls i knew they were girlsnot because of their womanly hands and manicured fingernails but because of their private parts which were easy to see since both girls were also naked seeing me arrive in the club with his two doublebreasted scouts the scarfaced man stood up and waved me toward him he was dark with a weak chin i guessed his age was about thirty his suit looked handmade and he was smoking a gildemann cigar he had a womans lips and his eyebrows were so neat and fine that they almost looked plucked and then drawn in with a pencil his eyes were brown with long lashes his hands were womanish too and but for the scar and the company he was keeping i might have wondered if he was a bit warm but he was polite and welcoming which made me wonder how hed come by his scar herr gunther he said im glad you came this is fraulein olafsson and fraulein larsson they are both on holiday from sweden arent you ladies he looked quickly around theres another one somewhere fraulein liljeroth but i think she must have gone to powder her nose if you know what i mean i bowed politely ladies theyre trying to behave like true berliners said diels isnt that right ladies nakedness is normal said one of the swedes desire is healthy dont you agree here sit down and have a drink said diels and pushed a glass of champagne toward me it was a little early for me but noting the label and the year on the bottle i drank it anyway what can i do for you herr diels please call me rudi and by the way you can speak quite freely in front of our two lady friends they dont speak very good german neither do i i said only that might have something to do with the fact that my tongue is hanging out of my mouth ever been here before once or twice but i dont get any kick out of guessing whether someones a man or a woman i nodded at fraulein olafsson it makes a pleasant change to have any doubts on that score removed so unequivocally youd better enjoy it while you can in just a month or two a lot of these clubs are going to be closed down by the new government this one is already earmarked to be the nazi party headquarters in berlin south youre taking a lot for granted theres the small matter of an election to be fought first youre right it is a small matter the national socialists may not manage to win an outright majority in the reichstag but it seems more than probable that they will be the largest party they im not a party member herr gunther but i am broadly sympathetic to the cause of national socialism is that how you got those scars on your face by being broadly sympathetic to the nazis diels touched his cheek without any trace of selfconsciousness this he shook his head no im afraid there wasnt much honor in the way they were earned i used to drink a lot more than was good for me sometimes when i wanted to amuse or intimidate someone i would chew a beer glass there was a bowl of fruit on the table i nodded at it me i prefer a nice apple i lit a cigarette and leaning back in my chair took a good look at our two naked companions i didnt mind looking at them any more than they minded being looked at help yourself no thanks some of my concentration is still caught up with the fate of the republic thats too bad because the republics days are numbered were going to win so its we now a minute ago you werent even in the party i guess you must be whats called a floating voter you mean like rosa luxemburg diels smiled at his own little joke oh im not much of a hitlerite he said but i do believe in hermann goering hes a much more impressive figure than hitler hes certainly a larger one it was my turn to smile at my little joke hitler cares nothing for human life continued diels but goering is different i work for him in the reichstag after the nazis come to power goering is going to be in overall charge of the police in germany kurt daluege is going to be in charge of the uniformed police and im going to be in charge of a muchexpanded political police the number of people wanting to join the police these days and we havent even had a recruiting drive were going to need men we can trust good men who are prepared to devote body and soul to the fight against jewry and bolshevism but not just against jewry and bolshevism its imperative that the power of the sa be curtailed too which is where you come in me i dont see how i can be of any use to you i dont even like the political police weve got now youre well known in kripo as someone who dislikes the sa everyone in kripo dislikes the sa everyone whos worth a damn that is what im looking for to get rid of the sa well need men who arent afraid men like you i can see your dilemma you need the sa to strongarm the election but once youre elected you need someone else to strongarm it back into line i grinned i have to hand it to you theres sophism and then theres nazism hitler adds a whole new section to that part of the dictionary that deals with specious argument and dirty dealing i shook my head im not your man herr diels never will be it would be a real shame if the force was to lose a man of your forensic capabilities herr gunther wouldnt it just but there it is the third swede came back from powdering her nose like her two friends she was as naked as a hat pin without a hat obviously bored the other two got up from the table and went over to her and put their arms around her and slowly they began to dance to some silent music they looked like the three graces they really are tourists you know he said not demicastors or halfsilks or whatever you cops call them just three girls on holiday from stockholm who felt like being true berliners and taking off their clothes for the sheer hell of it he sighed i think it will be a real shame when this kind of thing is gone but things have to change it cant be allowed to go on like this the vice the prostitution the drugs its corrupting us i shrugged youre a cop he said i thought you would surely agree with me about that at least two of the band came back and started to play gently for the benefit of the impromptu floor show youre not from berlin are you herr diels in berlin we say that you should leave another mans mustache alone even if it droops into his coffee cup thats why the nazis will never do well in this city because you people cant leave another mans mustache alone thats an unusual attitude for a policeman dont you want to make councilor or director you could you know the minute this election is over everyone is going to want to help us then but youre in a position to help us now when it really counts i told you im not interested in being a part of your expanded political police im not talking about that i mean that you could stay on in department four that you could keep doing what youre doing now its not like youre a communist or anything we can easily overlook something like the iron front he shrugged innocently no all you would have to do is a favor for us what kind of favor i asked intrigued we want you to drop the schwarz case im a police officer herr diels i cant do that ive been ordered to investigate a murder and its my duty to carry out that investigation to the best of my abilities you were ordered to do it by people who wont be around for much longer besides we both know that in this city there are lots of cases that remain unsolved i go slow is that it so goebbels can accuse grzesinski and weiss of sparing the horses because the victims old man is a big noise in the sa no its nothing like that the schwarz girl was disabled she had a bad leg like goebbels its a little embarrassing for him to have this kind of issue in the public eye it magnifies it somewhat anita schwarz had a bad leg that reminds people that goebbels has one too dr goebbels would be greatly in your debt if the schwarz case could be driven into a sand dune so to speak is joeys foot the only reason hed like this case to go nowhere diels looked puzzled yes what other reason could there be it seemed imprudent to mention just how much i knew about the true extent of joeys current disabilities and what if another girl gets murdered in similar circumstances what then so you investigate it just lay off the schwarz case thats all im asking just until after the election to spare joeys feelings to spare joeys feelings you make me think that maybe theres a lot more to this case than i realized before it might be unhealthy to think that for you and your career my career i laughed that really keeps me awake at night at least youre still awake at night herr gunther he grinned and blew on the end of his cigar thats something isnt it id heard all i wanted to hear i reached for the fruit bowl picked out a nice golden apple and stood up the three naked women were now too caught up in themselves to pay me any regard and it was looking like a proper floor show that berliners would have paid good money to sit and watch hey you i said aphrodite i tossed the apple and one of them caught it naturally she was the bestlooking of the three swedes my name is not aphrodite she said dully it is gunila i didnt say anything back i just walked away with my clothes and my sense of humor and my classical education it was a lot more than she had outside i crossed the road and bought some cigarettes in front of the tobacconists were six men wearing placards for the forthcoming election one was for bruner and the sdp two were for thalmann and the communists and three were for hitler all in all the prospects for the republic were looking no better than my own in i didnt go to the cinema very much maybe if i had i might not have been tricked so easily id heard about fritz langs film m because there was a detective in it who was supposedly based on ernst gennat certainly gennat thought that was the case but with one thing and another id missed the film when it came out it was still showing at my local union theater but in summer there always seemed to be something more important to do than to spend an evening watching a movie like investigate a murder the night before it happened id been up all night checking out political killings in wedding and neukolln the descriptions given by witnesses were predictably vague but then all murderers look the same when theyre wearing brown shirts thats my excuse one thing was for sure the people who ambushed me must have seen the movie as i walked out of my apartment building a small boy ran up to my car i wasnt sure if id seen the boy before but even if i had im not sure id have recognized him all boys in the scheunenviertel looked much the same this one was shoeless with short blond hair and bright blue eyes he wore gray shorts a gray shirt and sported a number eleven of snot on his upper lip i guessed him to be about eight years old a girl i know just went off with a strange man he said her name is lotte friedrich and shes twelve years old and the fritz isnt from around here creepylooking dad he was with a funny look on his shine hes the same schlepper who tried to give my sister some sweets yesterday if shed go for a walk with him the boy tugged my sleeve urgently and pointed west along schendelgasse until i agreed to look see them shes wearing a green dress and hes wearing a coat see sure enough crossing alte schonhauser strasse were a man and a girl the man had his hand on the girls neck like he was steering her somewhere wearing a coat seemed just a little suspicious as the day was already a warm one ordinarily i might have been more suspicious of the boy but then it wasnt every month that an adolescent girl turned up dead with half of her insides removed nobody wanted that to happen again whats your name sonny emil i gave him ten pfennigs and pointed in the direction of bulowplatz you know that armored car outside the red hq emil nodded and wiped the snot onto the back of his shirtsleeve i want you to go and tell the schupo in the armored car that commissar gunther from the alex is following a suspect onto mulackstrasse and requests them to come and give him support got that emil nodded again and ran off in the direction of bulowplatz i walked quickly west unholstering my parabellum as i went because as soon as i had crossed onto mulackstrasse i would be in the heart of always trues territory i might have lacked caution but i wasnt stupid the man and the girl ahead of me were walking briskly too i quickened my pace and came onto mulackstrasse just in time to hear a scream and see the man pick the girl up under his arm before ducking into the ochsenhof at this point i should probably have waited for the twentyfirst battalion and its armored car only i was still thinking about anita schwarz and the girl in the green dress besides when i looked back at where i had come from there was still no sign of the cavalry i took my whistle blew it several times and waited for some sign that they were coming but nothing happened either the twentyfirst didnt care for the idea of chasing a suspect into the most lawless part of berlin or they just didnt believe the story emil had told them probably it was a combination of the two i worked the slide on the parabellum and went in a narrow door and up a darkened stair the ochsenhof also known as the roast or the cattle shed was home to some of the worst animals in berlin a socalled rent barracks that occupied three acres it was a slum tenement from the last century with more entrances and exits than a lump of swiss cheese rats ran along the balconies at night and were hunted for sport by dogs and feral children with air rifles cellar dives housed illegal stills while on the granite back courts that were laughingly called greens packingcase colonies of huts housing some of the citys many homeless and unemployed squatted under lines of gray washing on a dark foulsmelling gaslit stairwell i found a group of young men already playing cards and sharing stumps of cigarette ends i looked at the card players and they looked at the ninemillimeter ace i was holding in my hand did any of you see a man come in here just now i asked he was wearing a lightcolored coat and a hat with him was a girl of about twelve wearing a green dress he might have been abducting her nobody said anything but they were still listening it pays to listen when its a man with a gun whos doing the talking maybe shes got a brother like you i said nobodys got a brother like him quipped a voice maybe hell be upset if his little sister gets sliced up and eaten by some rentbarracks cannibal i said think about that cops said another voice in the halfdarkness theyre the last people in berlin who still care about anything the dealer jabbed a thumb over his shoulder they went across the green i ran up some steps and out onto the back court it looked like a heavy gray stone frame for the brilliantly blue sky something zipped past my left ear and i heard a bang as loud as a truck backfiring an eightmillimeter rifle bullet half a second later my brain registered the subliminal image of a flash from the thirdfloor balcony and impelled my body to take cover behind some bedsheets that were flapping on a clothesline i didnt stay put as soon as i had crawled several meters on my hands and knees i heard another gunshot and something flicked through the sheet id been kneeling behind i scrambled to the end of the line of washing and then sprinted like georg lammers into the relative safety of another stairwell several raggedlooking men cowering in the shadows stared at me fearfully ignoring them i hared up to the third floor of a gunman there was no sign unless you counted the sound of a pair of stout shoes descending another set of stairs three or four steps at a time angry i went after the sound of the shoes some people had come out onto the roast balconies to see what all the fuss was about but the sensible ones stayed quietly in their sties reaching the bottom of the stairwell i paused briefly and then pushed a couple of planks that were leaning against the wall out onto the court to draw the riflemans fire by now i had a good idea that it was a german rifle the mauser gewehr during the war id heard its voice often enough to know its middle name the was an accurate rifle but it was unsuited to rapid fire on account of its peculiar bolt arrangement and in the several seconds it took for him to put another one up the spout i was out of the stairwell and shooting theres nothing slow about a ninemillimeter parabellum the first shot missed him the second too by the time the parabellum was ready for a fourth i was close enough to see the pattern on his bow tie this matched the pattern on his shirt and the pattern on his coat red spots arent normally a favorite of mine but on him they looked just fine especially as their source was the hole id made in his face he was dead before he hit the concrete this was unfortunate for two reasons one was that i hadnt killed anyone since august when i shot an australian at the battle of amiens possibly more than one when the war was over i promised myself id never kill anyone again the second reason it was unfortunate was that id wanted to question the dead man and find out who had put him up to killing me instead i had to rifle through his pockets and all under the curious eyes of a gathering crowd of rentbarracks vultures he was tall thin and losing his hair he had already lost his teeth at the moment of his death his tongue must have forced one of the plates from his mouth and now it sat on his upper lip like a pink plastic mustache i found his wallet the dead mans name was erich hoppner and he was a member of the nazi party since his membership card stated that his number was none of that meant he wasnt also a member of the always true gang it wasnt unusual for gangsters from berlins underworld to be contracted and paid to carry out political murders the question was who had ordered my murder the always true for what i had done to ricci kamm or the nazis for what i hadnt done for josef goebbels i took his wallet and his rifle and his watch and his ring and left him there the vultures were already taking his false teeth as i walked out of the ochsenhof false teeth were an expensive luxury for the kind of folk who lived in the roast on bulowplatz the phwm in charge of the schupo troop stationed there denied ever having received a message from a small boy to come to my aid i told him to take some of his men and go and mount a guard on hoppners body before it was eaten reluctantly he agreed i went back to the alex first i visited the record department of inspectorate j where the criminal secretary on duty helped me discover that erich hoppner didnt have a criminal record this was surprising then i went upstairs and handed over hoppners party card to the political boys in dia naturally theyd never heard of him either then i sat down and typed out a statement and gave it to gennat after id handed in my report i was asked into an interview room and questioned by gennat and two police councilors gnade and fischmann my statement was then filed for later comparison with the findings of an independent homicide team more paperwork followed then i was interviewed again by kok muller who was leading the investigating homicide team sounds like they led you on a nice little trot observed muller and you never saw the girl in the green dress again no and after the shooting i didnt see any point in looking for her and the boy emil the one who fed you the sugar lump i shook my head muller was a tall man with lots of hair only it was all on the sides of his head with none of it on top as if he had grown through it like a rubber plant they had you measured pretty well he said they did everything but chalk a letter m on the dead mans coat for you like in that movie with peter lorre its the kid in the movie who tips off the cop about lorre havent seen it you should get out more sure maybe ill buy a horse see the sights ive seen them already besides maybe i see too much as it is soon its going to be unhealthy to be a cop with good eyesight in this country thats what people keep telling me anyway you talk like the nazis were going to win the election bernie i keep hoping they wont and i keep worrying that they might but ive got seven loaves and five fishes telling me the republic needs more than just a lucky break this time if i wasnt a cop i might believe in miracles but i am and i dont in this job you meet the lazy the stupid the cruel and the indifferent unfortunately thats whats called an electorate muller nodded he was an sdp man like me hey did you hear the good news about joey clovenhoof his new wife magdas apartment got screened her jewels were lifted muller was grinning can you credit it credit it they should give whoever did it the blue max i needed a drink i needed some female company and i probably needed a new job as things turned out i went to the best place for all three i went to the adlon hotel inside the sumptuous lobby i looked around for frieda instead i found louis adlon he was wearing a white tie and tails in his lapel was a white carnation that matched his mustache he wasnt a tall man but he was every inch a gentleman commissar gunther he said how nice to see you and you must think me rude for not writing to thank you for the way you dealt with that thug but i was hoping to run into you and thank you in person he pointed to the bar do you have a minute several in the bar adlon waved for service but it was already on its way like a small express train schnapps for commissar gunther he said the best we sat down the bar was quiet the old man poured two glasses to the brim and then toasted me silently according to my wife hedda theres an old confucian curse that says may you live in interesting times id say these are very interesting times wouldnt you i grinned yes sir i would given that i just wanted you to know that there is always a job for you here thank you sir it might just be that i take you up on that offer no sir thank you it may interest you to know that your superior dr weiss speaks very highly of you i didnt know you two knew each other herr adlon were old friends it was he who leads me to suppose that the police service may soon change in ways we do not yet care to imagine for that reason i felt able to make you an offer like this most of the house detectives here are as you know retired policemen the incident in the bar proved to me that one or two of them are no longer equal to the task we sipped the excellent schnapps for a while and after that he went to have dinner with his wife and some rich americans while i went to find frieda i found her on the second floor in a corridor leading to the hotels wilhelmstrasse extension she was wearing an elegant black evening gown but not for long the smaller less expensive rooms were on that floor these had views of the brandenburg gate and beyond it the victory column on konigsplatz but i had the best view of all and i wasnt even looking out of the window i was trying to avoid arthur nebe this had been easy while i was checking through the list of suspects i had compiled using the devils directory but it was always more difficult when i was in the alex still nebe wasnt the kind of cop who liked leaving his desk very much he did most of his detective work on the telephone and for a while by not answering mine i managed not to speak to him at all but i knew it couldnt last and a couple of days after the shooting i finally ran into him on the stairwell outside the washrooms whats this said nebe has someone else been shooting at you he put his fingers in some old bullet holes in the walls of the stairwell we both knew theyd been there since when the freikorps had taken the alex back by force from the leftwing spartakists it was a very german occasion if youre not careful youre going to spend the rest of your life dead he smiled so whats the story no story not in this town anyway a nazi thug took a potshot at me thats all any idea why i figured it was because im not a nazi i said but maybe you can tell me erich hoppner yes i checked him out it doesnt look particularly political since you mention it how can you tell youre not kpd he wasnt sa but he was a nazi party member lots of people are party members bernie in case you hadnt noticed at the last count there were eleven and a half million people who voted for the party no id say this has more to do with what happened to ricci kamm the roast is in the heart of always true territory you were asking for trouble going in there at the time i had the quaint idea i might be preventing it trouble i mean thats what we cops call it when a real person gets murdered not some thug with an ideology for the record said nebe and between you and me i dont like the nazis its just that i like the communists a little less the way i see it its going to come down to a choice between them and the reds whatever you say arthur all i know is that its not the reds who have been threatening me telling me to lay off the schwarz case so we can spare the feelings of josef goebbelss crummy foot its the nazis oh who in particular rudolf diels hes fat hermanns man not joeys theyre all the same bastard to me arthur anything else you want to tell me about the schwarz case i mean hows that coming along i smiled bitterly a murder investigation works like this arthur sometimes the worst has to happen first before you can hope for the best like another murder you mean i nodded nebe was silent for a moment then he said i can understand that anyone can even you me what do you mean arthur sometimes the worst has to happen before you can hope for the best thats the only reason anyone is going to vote for the nazis looking up from his typewriter heinrich grund could hardly conceal his disgust theres some jew looking for you he said as i returned to my desk really did this jew have a name commissar paul herzefelde from munich he uttered the name with sneering lip and wrinkled nose as if describing something on the sole of his shoe and where is the commissar now grund pointed into the air above our heads the excelsior he said the alex had once been a barracks for the prussian police and the excelsior was what cops called that part of the building that still existed to accommodate policemen who were working late or who were visiting berlin from outside the city they wont like it said grund who wont like what the other lads in the excelsior they wont like having to share their quarters with a jew i shook my head wearily doesnt your mouth hurt sometimes on account of the nasty things that come out of it the mans a brother police officer for christs sake for christs sake grund looked skeptical for christs sake his kind did nothing thats the point isnt it the jews wouldnt be in the spot theyre in now if theyd recognized our lord for what he was heinrich youre the kind of rotten cop that gives rotten cops a bad name i thought of something nebe had said and borrowed it and its not that i love jews its that i love antisemites just that little bit less i went upstairs to find herzefelde after heinrich grunds bigotry i didnt know what sort of man i expected to meet it wasnt that i was expecting to see a cop with a phylactery strapped to his forehead and a prayer shawl wrapped around his shoulders just that paul herzefelde wasnt what i was expecting i suppose i thought he might look a bit more like izzy weiss instead he looked more like a film star well over six feet tall he was a handsome man with gray wiry hair and thick dark eyebrows his hard shiny suntanned face looked as if it had been made by a diamondcutter paul herzefelde had as much in common with the swarthy fat jew wearing a top hat and coattails beloved of nazi caricaturists as hitler had in common with paul von hindenburg are you commissar herzefelde the man nodded and you are commissar gunther welcome to berlin not so as i noticed im sorry about that skip it to be honest with you munich is a hell of a lot worse then im glad i dont live in munich it has its moments especially if you like a beer the beers pretty good in berlin too you know i wouldnt know then how about we go have one and you can find out i thought youd never ask copper we went to the zum pralaten in the arches of the sbahn station it was a good place to drink beer and popular with cops from the alex about every ten minutes a train passed overhead and since there was no point in saying anything while this was happening you could give your mouth a rest and concentrate on the beer so what brings you to berlin bernard weiss we kike cops have to stick together we were thinking of starting our own yid union trouble is with so many jewish cops its knowing where to begin i can imagine actually berlins not so bad the reds do better here than the nazis thalmann got twentynine percent in the last election compared to hitlers twentythree herzefelde shook his head unfortunately berlin is not germany i dont know how things are for jews in this town but in the south they can be pretty rough back home in munich theres hardly a day passes when i dont get some kind of death threat he swallowed some beer and nodded his appreciation as a matter of fact thats why i was speaking to weiss ive been thinking of moving here with my family you mean be a cop here in berlin herzefelde smiled weiss was similarly appalled it looks like im going to have to consider my plan b something thats got nothing to do with government ive been sort of looking around myself you but youre not a jew are you no im sdp iron front a weimar diehard who dislikes the nazis herzefelde raised his glass and toasted me then heres to you comrade so do you have a plan b yet thought i might go private here in berlin sure why not if the nazis get in ive a feeling theres going to be a lot of missingpersons work me ive been offered a job at the adlon hotel house detective sounds nice he lit a cigarette going to take it i thought id wait and see what happens in the election you want my advice sure if you can stay in the force jews liberals communists are going to have need of friendly policemen like you ill bear it in mind youll be doing everyone a favor god only knows what the police will be like if everyone in it is a lousy nazi so why did you want to see me weiss told me about this case youve been working on the murder of anita schwarz we had a similar case in munich you know munich a little about three months ago a fifteenyearold girl turned up dead at the schlosspark just about everything in her pants had been sliced out the whole bag of love and life a real neat job too like a surgeon had done it the dead girls name was elizabeth bremer and she went to the gymnasium in schwabing nice family too her father works at the customs house in landsberger strasse mothers a librarian at some kind of latin library on maximilianeum weiss told me about your girl that she was an amateur whore herzefelde shook his head elizabeth bremer wasnt anything like that she was a good student with good prospects wanted to be a doctor about the only thing you could hold against her was an older boyfriend he was a skating teacher at the prinzregenten stadium thats how they met anyway we hauled him over the coals for it but got nothing he didnt do it he had a castiron alibi for the day of her death and that was that according to him theyd stopped seeing each other before she wound up dead hed been pretty broken up about it the way he told it shed thrown him over for no good reason other than she caught him reading her diary so hed gone back home to gunzburg to see his family and get over it herzefelde waited as an sbahn train passed overhead we had a list of possible suspects he continued after the train had gone naturally we checked them out but with no luck i thought the case had gone cold until weiss told me about your murder victim id like to see that list i said that and the rest of the case file state law forbids me from using the mail to send my papers on the case said herzefelde however theres nothing to stop you from coming to munich to look them over you could stay in my house that would be quite impossible i said i couldnt stay in a jews house i paused long enough to change the expression on herzefeldes handsome face not unless hed stayed in my house first i smiled come on lets go and get your bag from the alex youre staying with me tonight buenos aires it was lunchtime and the cafe at the richmond hotel was busy with hungry portenos i went down to the basement found an empty table and set out a chessboard i wasnt looking for a game with anyone other than myself that way i figured i stood a better chance of winning also i needed to clear my head of old nazis and their war crimes for a while they were starting to get me down i tried not to stare at her but this was almost impossible she was a stunningly beautiful girl eyes just naturally followed her around the room like cows trotting after a milkmaid but mostly it was hard not to stare at her because she seemed to be staring at me i didnt flatter myself she actually wanted to meet me i guessed i was old enough to be her father there had to be some mistake she was tall and slim with a spectacular waterfall of black curly hair her eyes were the shape and color of chocolatecovered almonds she wore a tailored tweed jacket buttoned tight at the waist and a matching long pencil skirt that made me wish i had a couple of sheets of paper her figure was all right if you liked them built like expensive thoroughbreds i happened to like them built that way just fine she walked toward me her high heels perforating the polished wooden air of the richmonds quiet basement like the slow beat of a tall clock expensive perfume tugged an edge of the air i was breathing it made a very pleasant change from the smell of coffee and cigarettes and my own dyspeptic middle age as soon as she spoke to me it was obvious she hadnt mistaken me for someone else she spoke in castellano i was pleased about that it meant i had to pay extra attention to her lips and the way her small pink tongue rested on her gypsumwhite teeth forgive me for interrupting your game senor she said but are you carlos hausner perhaps i am might i sit down and talk to you for a moment i looked around three tables away the little scotsman melville was playing chess with a man whose leathery brown face belonged on the back of a horse two younger portenos with cuban heels and silverbuckled belts were engaged in a rather vigorous game of billiards they put as much vitality into their noisy cue shots as furtwangler conducting the kaim orchestra all of their eyes were on their respective games but their ears and their attention to the richmonds resolutely masculine traditions were on us i shook my head my opponent the invisible man gets a little irritated when people sit on his lap wed better go upstairs i let her walk ahead of me it was the polite thing to do and it gave me a chance to study the seams of her stockings these were straight as if someone had fixed them using a theodolite fortunately her legs were anything but they had better curves than the mille miglia and were probably just as challenging to negotiate we found a quiet table near the window i waved a waiter over she ordered a coffee and i ordered something i had no interest in drinking so long as she was around when youre having a cup of coffee with the bestlooking woman whos spoken to you in months there are better things to do than drink it she took one of my cigarettes and let me light it for her it was yet another excuse to pay close attention to her big sensuous mouth sometimes i think thats why men invented smoking my name is anna yagubsky she said i live with my parents in belgrano my father used to be a musician in the orchestra at the teatro colon my mother sells english ceramics from a shop on bartolome mitre both of them are russian immigrants they came here before the revolution to escape the czar and his pogroms do you speak russian anna yes fluently why because my russian is better than my spanish she smiled a little smile and we spoke in russian i am a legal officer she explained i work in an office next to the law courts on calle talcahuano someonea friend of mine in the police it doesnt matter whotold me about you senor hausner he told me that before the war you were a famous detective in berlin thats right i saw no advantage to myself in disagreeing with her no advantage at all i was keen to be someone who looked good in her eyesnot least because every time i saw myself in a mirror my own eyes were telling me something different and im not just talking about my appearance i still had all my hair there was even quite a bit of color left in it but my face was hardly what it used to be while my stomach was more than it had ever been i was stiff when i awoke in the morning in all the wrong places and for all the wrong reasons and i had thyroid cancer apart from all that i was just fine and dandy you were a famous detective and now youre working for the secret police it wouldnt be much of a secret police if i admitted that was true now would it no i suppose not she said nevertheless you are working for them arent you i smiled my best enigmatic smilethe one that didnt show my teeth what can i do for you senorita yagubsky please call me anna in case you hadnt already guessed im a jew thats an important part of my story i rather supposed you were when you mentioned pogroms my aunt and uncle went to germany from russia somehow they survived the war and came to south america in but jews were not welcome in argentina in spite of the fact there were a lot of jews living here already you see this is a fascist antisemitic country and until recently there was a secret government directive called directive eleven that denied entry visas to all jews even to jews who had family here already such as my aunt and uncle but like many other jews who wanted to live here they managed to get into paraguay and from there eventually they were successful in coming across the land border and entering the country illegally for a while they lived very quietly in a small town called colon in the province of entre rios north of buenos aires from time to time my father would go and see them with money clothes food whatever we could spare and they waited for an opportunity to come and live here in buenos aires but then one day about three years ago they disappeared my father went to colon and found them gone the neighbors knew nothing about where they had gone or if they did they werent saying and because they were illegal my father couldnt very well go to the police and ask them since then weve heard nothing nothing at all for obvious reasons my parents are reluctant to make inquiries about them in case they get into trouble the directive may have ended but this is still a military dictatorship and peopleopposition peopleare sometimes arrested and thrown into prison and never seen again so we still have no idea if they are alive or dead what we do know is that they werent the only illegal jews who have disappeared weve heard of other jewish families who have lost relatives in argentina but nobody knows anything for sure she shrugged then i heard about you i heard that you used to look for missing persons in germany before the war and well it seemed more than likely that some of those missing persons must also have been jewish and i thought no thats not truei hoped that you might help im not asking that you do anything very much in your position you might hear something something that might shed a little light on what happened to them couldnt you hire yourselves a private detective i suggested or a retired policeman perhaps we already tried that she said policemen here are not very honest senor hausner he robbed us of all our savings and told us nothing id like to help you senorita i shook my head but i dont know what i could do really i dont i wouldnt know where to start i dont know my way around very well and im still learning the language trying to settle in to make myself feel a little bit at home youd be wasting your money really perhaps i didnt make myself clear i wasnt offering to pay you senor all my extra money goes to supporting my parents my father doesnt play much anymore he used to give music lessons but doesnt have the necessary patience my mother works in someone elses shop the pay is not good the fact is i hoped you might help me out of the kindness of your heart i see this was one i hadnt heard before a request to work for nothing in the ordinary course of things i might have shown her the door but she was hardly ordinary among the many things i had to admire about her already i was now obliged to add her chutzpah but it seemed she hadnt finished telling me what she was prepared to offer in lieu of money she colored a little as she told me what this was i can imagine how difficult it might be to settle into a new life in a new country she said it takes time to adjust to make new friends you might say that as a daughter of immigrants i have a greater understanding of the challenges that lie ahead of you she took a deep breath anyway i was thinking that since i cant afford to pay you perhaps perhaps i might become your friend well thats a new one i said dont get me wrong im not suggesting anything else no i was thinking that we might go and see a play perhaps i could show you around the city introduce you to some people from time to time i might even cook you dinner really im very good company i dont doubt it in a way wed be helping each other yes i can see how you might think that maybe if she hadnt been quite so goodlooking i might have turned her down there was also her jewishness to take into account i hadnt forgotten the ukraine in and the guilt i felt toward all jewish people i didnt want to help anna yagubsky but somehow i felt i had to all right ill help you stammering a little i added that is to say ill do what i can im not promising anything you understand but i will try to help you i could use a homecooked dinner now and then friends she said and we shook hands actually youre the first friend ive made since i got here besides id like to do something noble for once oh why im curious dont be it doesnt help either of us what you say makes me think that you think you have to do something noble to atone for something else you did something not so noble perhaps thats my business i will tell you this though dont ever ask me about it thats part of my price anna you dont ever ask me about it all right are we agreed she nodded finally promise i promise all right then now tell me how did you find me i told you i have a friend in the police as a matter of fact hes the same bastard cop who robbed us of our savings but he feels guilty about it now and wants to help in any way he can unfortunately he has spent all the money gambled it away it was he who told me where you were staying it wasnt so very difficult i think its on your cedula all he had to do was to look it up i went to your hotel and followed you here the less this cop knows about what im doing the better as far as im concerned she nodded and sipped her coffee your uncle and aunt what were their names yagubsky same as mine she picked up her bag found her wallet and handed me a business card here she said thats how you spell it their names were esther and roman yagubsky roman is my fathers twin brother i pocketed the card three years you say she nodded i lit a cigarette and sighed a pessimistic cloud of smoke three years is a long time with a missingpersons case three months maybe we could find a lead but three years and not a word not even a postcard nothing we went to the israeli embassy we asked if maybe they had emigrated to israel but there was no trace of them there either shall i tell you what i think honestly if its that you think theyre probably dead then i agree with you im not an idiot senor hausner i can read the runes with something like this but my father is an old man and a twin let me tell you twins are strange about things like this my father says he feels roman is still in argentina and hed like to know for sure thats all is it so much to ask maybe and nothing is ever for sure in this business youd better take that on board now nothing is ever for sure except death she said thats about as sure as anything can get isnt it i nodded you might certainly think that what i meant is that truth is rarely the truth and the things you thought werent true often turn out not to be false i realize that sounds confusing and it was meant to be because thats the business im in although i dont want to be in it particularly not again i thought i was finished with the whole dirty process of asking questions i dont get straight answers to that and putting myself in harms way just because someone asks me to look for his lost dog when really hed lost his neighbors cat i thought i was through with it and im not and when i say nothings for sure in this business then i mean it because generally i say exactly what i mean and im right too because itll turn out that there was something you didnt tell me that you should have told me which would have made things clearer right from the start so nothings for sure anna not when there are people involved not when they bring you their problems and ask for your help especially then ive seen it a hundred times angel nothings for sure no not even death when the dead turn out to be alive and well and living in buenos aires believe me i know what im talking about if the dead people walking around this city all of a sudden really were dead the undertakers wouldnt be able to cope with the sudden rush of business her face had colored again her nostrils had flared the isosceles of muscles between her chin and her collarbone had stiffened like something metallic if id had a little wand i could have used it to tap out the part for triangle in the bridal chorus from lohengrin you think im lying she started gathering her gloves and handbag as if she was about to climb to the highest hills of dudgeon you mean you think im a liar are you and i thought we were going to be friends she said her thighs pushing back at the chair underneath her bottom i grabbed her wrist easy on the floor polish i said i was just giving you my client speech the one i use when theres nothing in it for me it takes a lot longer than a hard slap on the ear and a palm pressed on top of a holy bible but in the end it saves a lot of time that way if it does turn out that youre lying you wont hold it against me when i have to warm your cheeks are you always this cynical or is it just me her bottom stayed on the chair for now im never cynical anna except when im questioning the sincerity of human motives i wonder what was it that happened to you senor hausner something i dont know in your own personal history that made you this way my history i grinned you make it sound like its something thats over well its not in fact its not even history not yet and didnt i tell you dont ever ask me about it angel being sort of a spy myself i swiftly came to the conclusion that what i needed most was the help of another spy and there was only one person i could trust almost in the whole of argentina and that was pedro geller who had come across on the boat from genoa with eichmann and me he was working for capri construction in tucuman and since half of the exss men in the country were also working for capri enlisting his help seemed like a way of swatting two flies with one newspaper the only trouble was that tucuman was more than seven hundred miles to the north of buenos aires so a couple of days after my meeting with anna yagubsky i took the mitre line from the citys retiro railway station the train which went via cordoba and terminated in la paz bolivia was comfortable enough in first class but the journey lasted twentythree hours so i took the advice of colonel montalban and equipped myself with books and newspapers and plenty to eat and drink and smoke since the weather in tucuman was likely to be warmer than in buenos aires and much of the journey there took place at altitude the doctor had also given me some tranquilizers in case my thyroid problem meant i had difficulty breathing so far i had been lucky the only time id had difficulty breathing was when anna yagubsky had introduced herself to me the heating on the train failed soon after we left retiro and for most of the journey i was cold too cold to sleep by the time we reached tucuman i was exhausted i checked into the coventry hotel and went straight to bed i slept for the next twelve hours which was something i hadnt done since before the war tucuman was the most populous city in the north with about two hundred thousand people it sat on a plain in front of some spectacular mountains called the sierra del aconquija there were lots of colonialstyle buildings a couple of nice parks a government palace a cathedral and a statue of liberty but new york it wasnt there was a prevailing smell of horse shit in the air of tucuman tucuman wasnt a onehorse town so much as a horseshit town even the soap in my hotel bathroom seemed to smell of it pedro geller worked at capris technical office in el cadillal a small town about twenty miles outside tucuman but we met up in the city at the companys main office on rio portero given the nature of my mission we didnt stay there for very long i asked him to let me take him to the best restaurant he could think of and so we went to the plaza hotel close to the cathedral i made a mental note to stay there instead of the coventry if ever i was unlucky enough to come to tucuman again geller whom i knew better as herbert kuhlmann was twentysix years old and had been a captain with an sspanzer division during the battle for france in his unit had executed thirtysix captured canadians gellers commanding officer was now serving a life sentence in a canadian jail and fearing an arrest and a similar sentence geller had wisely fled to south america he looked tanned and fit and seemed to be enjoying his new life actually the work is rather interesting he explained over a glass of german beer the dulce river runs for about three hundred miles through cordoba province and were building a dam on it the los quiroga dam itll be quite a sight when its finished bernie three hundred meters long fifty meters high with thirtytwo floodgates of course its not exactly popular with everyone these things rarely are a lot of local farms and villages will disappear forever under millions of gallons of flood water but the dam is going to provide water and hydroelectric power for the whole province hows our more famous friend ricardo he hates it here he lives with some peasant girl in a small mountain village called la cocha about seventy miles south of here he doesnt come into tucuman any more than he has to scared to show his face i shouldnt wonder were both of us working for an old comrade of course theyre everywhere in tucuman hes an austrian professor by the name of pelkhofer armin pelkhofer hes a water engineer he and ricardo seem to know each other from the war when he was called armin schoklitsch but i have no idea what he did then that brought him here now nothing good i said if he knew ricardo quite so anyway we carry out river survey reports for the prof hydrological analysis that kind of thing not much to it really but im out in the fresh air a lot which suits me after all those months of hiding out in lofts and basements i shall miss this didnt i tell you after another six months here i shall transfer to capris personnel department in buenos aires we ate some lunch the steaks were good the food was always good in argentina just as long as you ordered steak what about you bernie what brings you this far north im working for the police im supposed to be checking out old comrades deciding whether theyre worthy of the goodconduct pass they will need to get an argie passport yours is already in the file thanks thanks a lot dont mention it to be honest its mostly just a cover story so that i can ask some of our old comrades a lot of awkward questions like what did you do in the war fritz the argies are a bit jumpy that theyll unwittingly hand out a passport to some massmurdering psycho and that the amis will find out about it and kick up an international fuss i see tricky stuff i was hoping you might help herbert after all it goes without saying that caprithe compania alemana para recien inmigradosis the largest employer of exss in the country of course ill help said geller youre just about my only friend in this country bernie well theres you and a girl i met back in buenos aires good for you kid apart from ricardo who else have you come across who might be worse than the worst i get the picture a bastard who gives the rest of us bastards a bad name eh thats the idea lets see now theres erwin fleiss hes a nasty piece of work from innsbruck he made a rather tasteless joke about organizing some jewish pogrom there in weve got a couple of gauleiters one from brunswick and one from styria some luftwaffe general called kramer another fellow who was part of hitlers bodyguard of course theres a lot more of them back at head office in buenos aires i could probably find out quite a lot about them for you when im working there but like i say that wont be for a while he frowned who else theres wolf probst yes hes a ruthless character i think might be a good idea to check him out im particularly looking for someone who might just have murdered again since arriving here in argentina now i see set a thief to catch a thief is that it something like that i said the kind of man im looking for is someone who probably enjoys cruelty and killing for its own sake geller shook his head no one springs to mind im afraid i mean ricardos a bastard but hes not a psychopathic bastard if you follow me look here why dont you ask him i mean he must have been to murder camps and seen some horrible things met some horrible people probably the very types youre looking for i wonder i said what if hed cooperate a passports a passport we both know what thats worth when youre sweating it out in someones basement in genoa ricardo too this village where he lives la cocha how long would it take me to get there at least two hours depending on the river weve had a lot of rain in these parts of late i could drive you there if you wanted if we left now we could be there and back before dark geller chuckled what is it i asked just that it might be amusing to see ricardos face when you tell him that youre working for the police thats really going to make his day worth a twohour drive i wouldnt miss it gellers car was a jeep the color of an apricot just four heavyduty wheels a tall steering column two uncomfortable seats and a tailgate we hadnt driven very far before i realized why geller was driving it the roads south of tucuman were little better than dirt tracks through sprawling fields of sugarcane with only the ingeniosthe industrial millsof the large sugar companies to remind us that we werent about to fall off the edge of the earth by the time we reached la cocha it was impossible to imagine being anywhere farther from germany and the long arm of allied military justice if tucuman was a horseshit town then la cocha was its poor pigshit cousin a gadarene number of swine seemed to be wandering about the muddy streets as our jeep bounced into the place scattering a flock of chickens like an exploding mortar bomb of clucks and feathers and attracting the attention of a number of dogs whose prominent rib cages didnt seem to interfere with their propensity to bark from a tall chimney poured a cloud of black smoke at its base was an open oven for eichmann it looked like a home away from home using a longhandled wooden peel a man was moving bread in and out of the oven in his excellent castellano geller asked the baker for directions to the house of ricardo klement you mean the nazi asked the baker geller looked at me and grinned thats him he said with a finger that was all knuckle and dirty nail as if it belonged to an orangutan that was studying witchcraft the baker pointed down the track past a small autorepair shop to a twostory blockhouse with no visible windows he lives at the villa we drove a short distance and pulled up between a line of washing and an outhouse from which eichmann emerged hurriedly carrying a newspaper and buttoning his trousers he was followed by a strong cloacal smell it was evident he had been alarmed by the sound of the jeep and the obvious relief he felt that we were not the argentine military come to arrest and hand him over to a warcrimes tribunal quickly gave way to irritation what the hell are you doing here he said his lip curling in a way i now regarded as quite characteristic it was strange i thought how one side of his face appeared to be quite normal even pleasant while the other side looked twisted and malevolent it was like meeting dr jekyll and mr hyde at the same moment i was in tucuman so i thought id come and see how you are i said affably i opened my bag and took out a carton of senior service i brought you some cigarettes theyre english but i figured you wouldnt mind eichmann grunted a thankyou and took the carton youd better come into the villa he said grudgingly he pushed open a very tall wooden door that was in need of several licks of green paint and we stepped inside from the outside things did not augur well calling that blockhouse a villa was a bit like calling a childs sandcastle the schloss neuschwanstein inside though things were better there was some plasterwork on top of the brickwork the floors were level and covered with flagstones and some cheap indian rugs but the small barred windows gave the place a suitably penal atmosphere eichmann might have evaded allied justice but he was hardly living a life of luxury a halfnaked woman peered out from behind a door angrily eichmann jerked his head at her and she disappeared again i walked over to one of the windows and looked out at a largish wellplanted garden there were some hutches containing several rabbits he must have kept for meat and beyond an old black desoto with three wheels a quick getaway did not seem to be on eichmanns mind he collected a large kettle off a castiron range and poured hot water into two hollow gourds mate he asked us please i said since coming to argentina i hadnt tasted the stuff but everyone in the country drank it he put little metal straws in the gourds and then handed them to us there was sugar in it but it still tasted bitter like green tea with a froth on it akin to drinking water with a cigarette in it i thought but geller seemed to like the stuff and so did eichmann as soon as geller had finished his gourd he handed it over to our host who added some more hot water and without changing the straw drank some himself so what brings you all the way out here he said it cant just be a social call im working for the side i said the peronist intelligence service his eyelid flickered like an almost spent lightbulb he tried not to let it show but we all knew what he was thinking adolf eichmann the ss colonel and close confidant of reinhard heydrich had been reduced to performing hydrological surveys on the other side of nowhere while i enjoyed a position of some power and influence in a field eichmann might have considered his own gunther the reluctant ss man and political adversary possessed of the very job that he eichmann should have had he said nothing he took a shot at a smile it looked more like something had got stuck under his bridge im supposed to decide which of our old comrades is worthy of a goodconduct pass i said you need one to be able to apply for a passport in this country i should have expected that loyalty to your blood and your oath as an ss man would oblige you to treat the issue of any such documentation as a mere formality he spoke stiffly softening somewhat he added after all were all sitting on the same inkblot are we not he finished the mate noisily like a child sucking up the very last drop of a fizzy drink on the face of it thats true i said however the peronist government is already under considerable pressure from the americans from the jews more like he said to clean up its backyard while theres no question that any of us are about to be shown the door nevertheless there are a few people in government who worry that some of us may be guilty of greater crimes than was originally suspected i shrugged and looked at geller i mean its one thing to kill men in the heat of battle and its another to take pleasure in the murders of innocent women and children wouldnt you agree eichmann shrugged i dont know about innocent he said we were exterminating an enemy speaking for myself i didnt hate the jews so much but i dont regret anything i did i never committed any crimes and i never killed anyone not even in the heat of battle as you put it i was little more than a civil servant a bureaucrat who only obeyed orders that was the code we all lived by in the ss obedience discipline blood and honor if i have any regrets at all it is that there wasnt time to finish the job to kill every jew in europe this was the first time i had ever heard eichmann speak about the jewish extermination and wanting to hear more i tried to lead him on im glad you mentioned blood and honor i said because it seems to me that there were a few who dragged the reputation of the ss down into the dirt quite said geller a few who exceeded their orders who killed for sport and pleasure who carried out inhumane medical experiments a lot of that has been exaggerated by the russians insisted eichmann lies told by the communists to justify their own crimes in germany to stop the rest of the world from feeling sorry for germany to give the soviets carte blanche to do whatever they like with the german people it wasnt all lies i said im afraid a lot of it was true ricardo and even if you dont believe it the possibility that some of it might be true is what worries the government now which is why ive been charged to conduct this investigation look ricardo im not after you but im afraid i cant regard some ss as old comrades we were at war said eichmann we were killing an enemy who wanted to kill us that can get pretty brutal at a certain level the human costs are immaterial what mattered most was making sure that the job got done troublefree deportations that was my specialty and believe me i tried to make things as humane as i could gas was seen as the humane alternative to mass shootings yes there were some perhaps who went too far but look here theres always some bad barley in the beer thats inevitable in any organization especially one that achieved what was achieved and during a war too five million can you credit the scale of it no i dont think you can either of you five million jews liquidated in less than two years and youre quibbling about the morality of a few bad apples not me i said the argentine government what you want a name is that it in return for my goodconduct pass you want me to play judas for you thats about the size of it yes i never liked you gunther said eichmann his nose wrinkled with distaste he tore open the carton of cigarettes and then lit one with the air of a man who hadnt had a decent smoke in a long while then he sat down at a plain wooden table and studied the smoke from the tip as if trying to divine guidance from the gods about what to say next but perhaps there is such a man as you describe he said carefully only i want your word that you wont ever tell him that it was i who informed on him you have my word on it this man he and i met by chance at a cafe in the center of buenos aires not long after we arrived the abc cafe he told me hes done very well for himself since he came here very well indeed eichmann smiled thinly he offered me money me a colonel in the ss and him a mere captain can you imagine it patronizing bastard him with all his connections and his family money living in the lap of luxury and me buried here in this godforsaken hole eichmann took a nearlethal drag at his cigarette swallowed and then shook his head he was a cruel man still is i dont know how he sleeps i couldnt not in his skin i saw what he did once a long time ago it seems so long ago that i must have been a child when it happened well perhaps i was in a way but ive never forgotten it no one could no one human i first met him in in berlin how i miss berlin and then again in at auschwitz he grinned bitterly i dont miss that place at all this captain i said whats his name he calls himself gregor helmut gregor berlin i got off the train from berlin walked to the end of the platform handed over my ticket and then looked around for paul herzefelde there was no sign of him so i bought some cigarettes and a newspaper and parked myself on a seat near my arrival platform to wait for him i didnt spend long with the paper the election was only two weeks away and this being munich the paper was full of stuff about how the nazis were going to win so was the station hitlers stern disapproving face was everywhere after thirty minutes i couldnt take it any longer i put the paper in the bin and went out into the fresh air the station was in the west end of the central part of munich the police praesidium was a tenminute walk to the east on ettstrasse between saint michaels church and the cathedral of our lady it was a newish handsome building on the site of a former monastery outside the main entrance were several stone lions inside i found only rats the desk sergeant was as big as a wrecking ball and just as helpful he had a bald head and a waxed mustache like a small german eagle every time he moved his leather belt creaked against his belly like a ship straining on its hawsers from time to time he lifted his hand to his mouth and burped you could smell his breakfast from the front door i tipped my hat politely and showed him my warrant disc good morning i said good morning im commissar gunther from berlin alexanderplatz to see commissar herzefelde i just arrived at the station i thought hed be there to meet me did you now he said it in a way that made me want to punch him in the nose you get a lot of that in munich yes i said patiently but since he wasnt i assumed hed been delayed and that id better come and find him here spoken like a berlin detective he said without a trace of a smile i nodded patiently and waited for some good manners to kick in they didnt spare me the sweet talk and tell him im here the sergeant nodded at a polished wooden bench by the front door have a seat he said coolly sir ill deal with you in a minute i went over to the bench and sat down ill be sure to mention your redcarpet treatment when i see your commissar i said you do that sir he said ill look forward to it he wrote something on a piece of paper rubbed his ham hock of a nose scratched his ass with his pencil and then used it to pick his ear then he got up slowly and put something in a filing cabinet the telephone rang he let it ring a couple of times before answering it listened took down some details and then put a sheet of paper into a tray when the call ended he looked at the clock above the door then he yawned if this is how you look after the polenta in this town id hate to be a criminal i lit a cigarette he didnt like that he pointed at a no smoking sign with his pencil i stubbed it out i didnt want to wait there all morning after a while he picked up the phone and spoke in a lowered voice once or twice he flicked his eyes my way so i got the idea he was probably talking about me so when he finished the call i lit another cigarette he tapped the pencil on the desk in front of his belly and having received my attention pointed at the no smoking sign again this time i ignored him he didnt like that either no smoking he growled no kidding you know what the trouble is with you berlin cops if you could point to berlin on a map i might be interested fat boy youre all jewlovers ah now were getting to it i blew some smoke his way and grinned were not all jewlovers in the berlin police as a matter of fact some of us are a bit like you sergeant ignorant bigoted and a disgrace to the uniform he tried to outstare me for minute or two then he said the jews are our misfortune its time the polenta in berlin woke up to that fact well thats an interesting sentiment did you just think of it yourself or was it written on the skin of the banana you ate for breakfast a detective arrived i knew he must be a detective because he wasnt dragging his knuckles on the floor he glanced at the ape on the desk who jerked his head my way the detective came over and stood in front of me looking sheepish it might have worked too if his face hadnt looked so peculiarly wolflike his eyes were blue and his nose was more of a muzzle but mostly it was because of his eyebrows which met in the middle and his canine teeth which seemed slightly longer than was normal but you get a lot of that in munich as well commissar gunther yes is something wrong im criminal secretary christian schramma we shook hands im afraid i have some bad news commissar herzefelde is dead he was murdered last night shot three times in the back as he left a bar in sendling do you know who did it no as you may know hed had several death threats because he was jewish of course i glanced the desk sergeants way theres hatred and stupidity everywhere even in the police force schramma remained silent im very sorry i said i didnt know him for very long but paul was a good man we went up to the detectives room it was a warm day and through the open windows you could hear the sound of children playing in the yard of the nearby gymnasium human life never sounded so lively i saw your name in his police diary said schramma but he didnt think to write down a telephone number or where you were from otherwise i would have called you thats all right he was about to share some information on a murder hed been working on elizabeth bremer schramma nodded we had a similar case in berlin i explained i came down here to read the files and find out just how similar they were he bit his lip uncomfortably which did little to alter my first impression of him he looked like a werewolf look im really sorry to tell you this after youve come all the way from berlin but all pauls case files have been sent upstairs to the government counselors office when a police officer gets killed its standard procedure to assume it might have something to do with a case he was working on i seriously doubt that youre going to be able to see those files for a while maybe as long as a couple of weeks it was my turn to bite my lip i see tell me did you work with paul a while ago im not up to date with his current cases of late he mostly worked on his own he preferred it that way he preferred it or other detectives preferred it i think thats a little unfair sir is it schramma didnt answer he lit a cigarette flicked the match out of the open window and sat on the corner of a desk that i assumed must be his own on the opposite side of the big room a detective with a face like schmelings was questioning a suspect every time he got an answer he looked pained as if jack sharkey had hit him below the belt it was a nice technique i felt the cop was going to win on a disqualification the same way schmeling did other detectives came and went a few of them had loud laughs and louder suits you get a lot of that in munich in berlin we all wore black armbands when a cop got killed but not in munich a different kind of armbanda red one with a black sanskrit cross in the middlelooked a lot more probable it didnt look like anyone was about to shed any tears over the death of paul herzefelde could i see his desk schramma got up slowly and we walked over to a gray steel desk in a farflung corner of the office which was surrounded with a wall of files and bookcases like a oneman ghetto the desktop was clear but his photographs were still on the wall i bent over to take a closer look at them herzefeldes wife and family in one him wearing a military uniform and decoration in the other on the wall next to this photograph was the faint outline of a graffito that had been rubbed out the star of david and the words jews out i traced the outline with my finger just to make sure schramma knew id seen it thats a hell of a way to honor a man who got himself a first class iron cross i said loudly and glanced around the detectives room three bullets and some cave art silence descended on the room typing stopped voices quietened even the children playing outside seemed to cease their noise for a moment everyone was now looking at me like i was the ghost of walther rathenau so who did it who murdered paul herzefelde does anyone know i paused can anyone guess after all youre supposed to be detectives more silence doesnt anyone care who killed paul herzefelde i walked over to the center of the room and facing down munichs kripo waited for someone to say something i looked at my watch hell ive been here for less than half an hour and i could tell you who killed him it was the nazis killed him thats who it was the bloody nazis who shot him in the back maybe even the same nazis who wrote jews out on the wall beside his desk go home you prussian pig someone shouted yes clear off back to berlin you stupid pifke they were right of course it was time to go home after a short while among munichs neanderthals the men of berlin were already looking like a real advance in human evolution by all accounts munich was hitlers favorite town it was easy to see why i went out of the police praesidium by a different set of stairs which led into the central courtyard where several police cars and vans were parked as i was making my way under the arches to the street i encountered the burly desk sergeant who was now coming off duty i knew this because he wasnt wearing his leather belt or his duty epaulettes also he was carrying a thermos moving to block my way out he said sure its always a shame when a cop goes down in the line of duty he chuckled except when its a jew of course the fellows who shot that yid bastard herzefelde they deserve a medal so they do he spat onto the ground ahead of me for good measure have a nice trip back to berlin you jewloving prick one more word from you you worthless nazi gorilla and im going to pull the tongue out of your thick bavarian head and scrape the shit off it with the heel of my shoe the sergeant put his thermos on a windowsill and bent his ugly mug toward me who the hell do you think you are coming to my city and threatening me youre lucky i dont run you in just for the fun of it one more word out of you sonny and ill have your eggs hanging from our flagpole in the morning if i threaten you youll stay threatened and write me a thankyou letter on nice notepaper in your best writing this is a man with a broken jaw whos talking to me said the sergeant before throwing a punch at my head he was tall and strong with shoulders like the yoke on a frisian milkmaid and a fist as big as a fire bucket but his first mistake was to miss his tunic was still buttoned and this slowed him down so i was already ducking the blow by the time it arrived his second mistake was to miss again and to lead with his chin by now i was ready to take a swing myself as if id been taking a swing at the very man who had shot paul herzefelde and i let him have it hard very hard right under the chin this as von clausewitz would probably have agreed is the best part of the chin with which to make decisive contact i saw his legs go the minute i struck him but i punched him again this time in the belly and when he doubled up i hammered him in each kidney with a heavyweight contenders high ambition and strength of will he fell back against the wall of the archway and i was still hitting him when three schupo men pulled me off and pinned me against the wroughtiron gate slowly the sergeant picked himself off the cobbles it took him a while to straighten up but eventually he managed it ill say one thing for him he could take a punch he wiped his mouth and panting hard came toward me with a look in his eyes that told me he wasnt about to invite me to stay for the oktoberfest hold him up he told the other cops taking his time about it and then he hit me a short right hook that went up to his elbow in my stomach then another and another until his knuckles were tickling my backbone except it wasnt funny and i wasnt laughing they let me go when i started throwing up but they hadnt finished in fact theyd only just started they dragged me back into the building and down into the cells where they went at me againgood expert blows from cops who knew what they were doing and who clearly enjoyed their work after an hour or so i heard a voice from a long way off reminding them that i was a cop and that was when they left me alone i had an idea it was schramma who got them to lay off but i never found out for sure i stayed on the floor of that cell for a long time no one was kicking me and it felt like the most comfortable place in the world all i wanted to do was stay there and sleep for twenty years then the floor slid to one side and i fell into a deep dark place where a group of dwarfs were playing a game of ninepins for a while i joined the game but then one of the dwarfs gave me a magic drink and i slept the sleep of jacob on mount moriah something jewish anyway the cells in the prison below the munich police praesidium were once occupied by augustine monks they must have been tough men those augustine monks my cell had a hard bunk and a straw pallet on top which was about as thick as a blanket the blanket was made of thin air job or saint jerome would have been very comfortable down there there was an open toilet without a seat and no window in the smooth porcelain tile wall the cell was hot and smelly and so was i love the sinner and hate the sin said saint augustine that was easy for him to say he never had to spend the night in a cell beneath the munich police praesidium they left the lights on all the time and it wasnt in case you were scared of the dark i had no idea what time of the day or night it was a few days of that and youre ready to do more or less whatever they tell you just to see the sky again thats the theory anyway and after what seemed like a week but was probably only two or three days a doctor came to look at mea real schweitzer type with a mustache as big as an octopus and more white hair than liszts grandmother he examined the bruises on my ribs and asked me how id come by them i told him id fallen off my bunk when id been asleep do they hurt only when i laugh which is not so much since ive been here oddly enough you may have a couple of broken ribs he said really you need an xray thanks but what i really need is a cigarette he examined the bruises on my ribs gave me a cigarette and asked me for my clothes i dont think theyll fit you i said but i took them off all the same i just wanted to go home well get these things cleaned he said handing my clothes to the custody officer you too if youre up to it theres a shower at the end of the corridor soap and a razor kind of late to be handing out hospitality isnt it but i had the shower and the shave all the same when i was clean the short man handed me a blanket and took me into an interview room to await the return of my clothes we sat down at opposite ends of a table he opened a leather cigarette case and put it in front of me then someone brought me a cup of hot sweet coffee it tasted like ambrosia i am commissar wowereit he said ive been instructed to inform you that no charges are to be made and that you are free to go well thats very generous of you i said and took one of his cigarettes he lit it for me with a match and then sat back on his chair he had slim delicate hands they didnt look like theyd ever thrown a tomato let alone a punch i couldnt imagine how he fitted in with the rest of the munich polenta with hands like his very generous i repeated considering i was the one who got roughhoused a report of the incident that occurred has already been sent to your new police president and his deputy what do you mean my new police president and his deputy what the hell are you talking about wowereit of course im sorry how could you know know what ever heard of altona yeah its a dump outside hamburg thats notionally part of prussia much more important than that its a communist town the day you arrived in munich a group of uniformed nazis staged a parade there there was a brawl actually it was more of a riot and seventeen people were killed and several hundred people wounded hamburgs a long way from berlin i said i dont see how the new chancellor von papen with the support of general von schleicher and adolf hitler drafted a presidential decree signed by von hindenburg to seize control of the prussian government a putsch in effect yes i assume the army did nothing to stop any of this you assume correctly general rundstedt has imposed martial law on greater berlin and the province of brandenburg and taken control of the citys police force grzesinski has been removed weiss and heimannsberg have been placed under arrest dr kurt melcher is the new police president of berlin never heard of him i believe he was formerly the police president of essen wheres the new deputy come from toytown i believe the new deputy is someone called dr mosle mosle i exclaimed what does he know about policing hes the head of berlins traffic police colonel poten is the new head of the uniformed police in berlin i believe he was director of the police academy in eichen all prussian law enforcement officers are now directly subordinate to the army wowereit allowed himself a thin hint of a smile i suppose that also includes you for the moment the berlin police wont stand for it i said weiss wasnt popular its true but magnus heimannsbergs a different story hes hugely popular with the rank and file what can they do to believe that the army wont use force to put down any resistance is wishful thinking he shrugged but none of this is of any immediate concern to us here in munich and has little relevance to the case at hand namely yours the report we sent to your superiors describes in detail what we believe happened here doubtless you will present your own side of the story to your superiors when you get back to berlin you can bet on it a storm in a water glass wouldnt you agree compared with what has happened politically speaking thats easy for you to say you didnt get beaten up and tossed in the hole for several days and perhaps youve forgotten the reason for the fight a murdered police officer was defamed by one of your colleagues i wonder if thatll be in your damn report germany is for the germans now said wowereit not a bunch of immigrants who are only here for what they can get and this stupid putsch in berlin will solve nothing its the last desperate act of a republic trying to forestall what is inevitable the election of a national socialist government on july von papen hopes to prove he is strong enough to stop germany from sinking into the mess the jews and the communists have made for us but everyone knows theres only one man who is equal to that historical task i said i hoped he was wrong i said it quietly and i said it politely saint augustine would probably have approved of that theres a lot to be said for turning the other cheek when youve been in receipt of a severe beating you stay alive longer you get to go back to berlin i just hoped that when i did get back there i would still recognize the place i found the third army all over berlin armored cars outside the public buildings and platoons of soldiers enjoying the july sunshine in all of the main parks it was as if the clock had been turned back to but there seemed little chance of berlins workers organizing a general strike to defeat this particular putsch as had happened then only inside the alex did there appear to be any appetite for resistance police major walter encke who lived in the same apartment building as commander heimannsberg and was his close friend was the focus for a counterputsch the alex was full of nazi spies however and enckes plan to use uniformed schupo riot brigades to arrest all of the nazis in the berlin police came to nothing when a rumor began to go around that he and heimannsberg were lovers later on the rumor proved to be entirely without foundation but by then it was too late fearing for the loss of his reputation as a policeman and as a man encke quickly wrote and circulated a letter in which he condemned all talk of a counterputsch using riot brigades and assured the army of his loyalty as a former officer of the imperial army meanwhile no less than sixteen kripo officials among them four commissars denounced bernard weiss for alleged improprieties in office and i was summoned to the office of the new berlin police president dr kurt melcher melcher was a close associate of dr franz bracht the former mayor of essen and now deputy reichskommissar of the prussian government melcher was originally a lawyer from dortmund and was the author of a wellknown but turgidly written history of the prussian police which only made what happened next all the more remarkable ernst gennat was present at my meeting with the new police president so was the new deputy police president johann mosle but it was the fiftyfouryearold melcher who did most of the talking an obviously irascible man he lost little time in coming to the point with the assistance of an accusatory and nicotinestained forefinger i will not have officers of the berlin police force brawling with other policemen is that clear yes sir im sure you think you had a good reason but i dont want to hear it the political differences that have existed between various officers are now over all disciplinary proceedings against officers with nazi affiliations are to be dropped and the ban on membership of the nazi party for officials in the service of the prussian state is to be lifted if you cant live with these changes then theres no place for you in this force gunther i was about to say that id been living and working with men who were openly nazi for a while but then i caught sight of gennat he closed his eyes and almost imperceptibly shook his head as if counseling silence yes sir theres a greater enemy than nazism abroad in this country and this city in particular bolshevism and immorality were going to go after the communists and were going to crack down on vice of all kinds the meatmarket shows are going to close and the whores are going to be kicked off our streets yes sir and thats not all kripo is going to operate more like a team there will be no more star detectives giving press conferences and getting their names in the newspapers what about police officers writing books sir i asked will that be permitted ive always wanted to write a book melcher smiled a toadlike smile and leaned forward as if taking a closer look at some kind of grubby schoolboy you know its plain to see how you got those bruises on your face gunther youve got a smart mouth and i dont like detectives who think theyre smart surely there would be no point in employing stupid detectives sir theres smart and theres smart gunther and then theres clever the clever cop knows the difference he knows when to shut his strudel hole and listen he knows how to put his personal politics aside and get on with the job at hand im not sure that you know how to do any of that gunther i cant see how else you ended up spending three days and nights in a munich police cell what the hell were you doing there anyway i went there at the invitation of a brother police officer to look at the case notes on a murder ive been investigating the anita schwarz case there were some striking similarities between that case and a murder theyd been investigating i had hoped to find a new lead but when i arrived in munich i discovered that this police officer commissar herzefelde a jew had been murdered i used the word brother with emphasis in an attempt to provoke melcher into some sort of antisemitic outburst i hadnt forgotten izzy weiss and the lies that were now being spread about my old boss and friend all right what did you find out nothing commissar herzefeldes case notes were placed under an interdiction by those detectives now investigating his murder as a result i wasnt able to do what i set out to do sir and so you took out your frustration at being forbidden to look at herzefeldes case notes on a fellow officer it wasnt like that at all sir the sergeant in question melcher was shaking his head i told you i dont want to hear your reasons gunther theres no excuse for hitting another officer he glanced mosles way for a moment no excuse echoed the dpp so where are you with this case well sir i think our murderer might be from munich something brought him to berlin something medical perhaps i think hes been having treatment for venereal disease a new treatment thats being pioneered here in the city anyway when he got here he met anita schwarz possibly he was a client of hers it seems that she was an occasional prostitute nonsense said melcher a man with a venereal disease does not usually go and have sex with a prostitute it just doesnt make sense with all due respect sir thats how venereal disease is spread and this notion that anita schwarz was a whore thats nonsense too i tell you frankly gunther its my belief and the belief of several senior detectives around the alex that youve cooked up this whole line of inquiry just to embarrass the schwarz family for political reasons thats just not true sir do you deny that you eluded the oversight of the political officer who was assigned to this case arthur nebe no i dont deny it i just didnt think it was necessary i was satisfied in my own mind that i wasnt remotely biased against the schwarz family all ive ever wanted to do was catch the lunatic who killed their daughter well im not satisfied and youre not going to catch her murderer im taking you off the case gunther if youll permit me to say so sir youre making a big mistake only i can catch this man if you could arrange for me to see herzefeldes files sir im sure i can wrap this case up in less than a week youve had all the time youre going to get on this one gunther im sorry but thats how it is im also reassigning you im taking you out of the a inspectorate off homicide why im good at my job sir i looked at gennat tell him ernst dont just sit there looking like a meat pie you know im good it was you who trained me gennat shifted awkwardly on his enormous bottom he looked pained as if his hemorrhoids were giving him trouble its out of my hands bernie he said im sorry really i am but the decision has been made sure i get it you want a quiet life ernst no trouble no politics and by the way is it true that you were one of the detectives who turned up in izzys office with a bottle of wine to toast dr mosle here when he got izzys job it wasnt like that bernie insisted gennat ive known mosle for longer than ive known you hes a good man so was izzy that remains to be seen i think said melcher not that your opinion really matters here im transferring you from the a inspectorate to j with immediate effect j thats the criminal records department its not even a proper inspectorate damn it its an auxiliary inspectorate the move is a temporary one said melcher while i decide which of the other seven inspectorates can best use a man of your investigative experience until that happens i want you to use that experience to suggest some ways in which the records department might be improved by all accounts the trouble with records is that it has no real appreciation of how a real investigation works itll be your job to put that right gunther is that clear normally i would have put up more of an argument i might even have offered my resignation but i was tired after the rail journey from munich and very sore from the beating i had received all i wanted to do was go home have a bath and a drink and sleep in a bed besides there was still the small matter of a general election in a few days time on july i still held out some hope that the german people would come to its senses and make the social democrats the largest party in the reichstag after which the army would have little choice but to restore the prussian government and throw the likes of papen and bracht and melcher and mosle out of their illegally held offices yes sir i said thats all gunther permission to take a weeks leave of absence sir granted i walked out slowly with ernst gennat bringing up the rear mosle remained behind in what was for a while melchers office im sorry bernie said gennat but there was really nothing i could do so you can talk after all gennat smiled a small weary smile ive been in the force for more than thirty years bernie i was a commissar in one thing ive learned in that time is to know which battles to fight and which ones to concede theres no point in arguing with these bastards any more than there was a point in going up against the army to my mind papens government is doomed one way or the other we just have to hope and pray that the election turns out right after which you can go back to being a homicide detective maybe izzy and the rest of them as well although after what happened to your friend herzefelde in munich i rather think hes well out of it martial law will be lifted in days i suspect they wont dare try to hold the elections with the army still on the streets and the charges against weiss and heimannsberg will be dropped for lack of evidence grzesinskis already planning a series of speeches around the city to defend his policy of nonviolence so go home get well put your faith in german democracy and pray that hindenburg stays alive buenos aires i was working late in my office at the casa rosada it wasnt much more than a desk and a filing cabinet and a coatrack in the corner of the larger side office overlooking irigoyen and facing the ministry of finance my socalled colleagues left me quite alone which reminded me a little of paul herzefeldes desk in the detectives room at police headquarters in munich it wasnt that they thought i was jewish merely that they didnt trust me and i cant say i blamed them i had no idea what colonel montalban had told people about me perhaps nothing at all perhaps everything perhaps something quite misleading but thats the thing about being a spy its easy to get the idea youre being spied on the kripo case files from berlin were open on the desk in front of me the box that had contained them was the nearest thing to a time machine i was ever likely to encounter it all seemed so long ago and it seemed like yesterday what was it that hedda adlon used to say the confucian curse may you live in interesting times yes that was it id certainly done that all right as lives went mine had been more interesting than most by now i had a clear recollection of everything that had happened during the last months of the weimar republic and it was plain to me that the only reason i hadnt managed to solve the anita schwarz murder was that following my meeting with kurt melcher i never worked homicide again after i came back from a weeks leave i took up my new post in the records department hoping against hope that somehow the sdp would turn its fortunes around and that the republic might be restored to full health it didnt happen the elections of july found the nazis gaining more seats in the reichstag but still without the overall majority that would have enabled hitler to form a government incredibly the communists then sided with the nazis in parliament to force a vote of noconfidence in papens hapless government after that i disliked the communists even more than i disliked the nazis once again the reichstag was dissolved and once again an election was called this time for november and once again the republic clung on by its fingernails as the nazis failed to achieve an overall majority it was now schleichers turn to take a shot at being chancellor of germany he lasted two months another putsch was forecast and desperate for someone who could govern germany with any authority whatsoever hindenburg sacked the incompetent schleicher and asked adolf hitler the only party leader who hadnt had a turn at being chancellor to form a government less than thirty days later hitler made certain that there could be no more inconclusive elections on february he burned down the reichstag the nazi revolution had begun not long after that i left the police and went to work at the hotel adlon i forgot all about anita schwarz and i never again spoke to ernst gennat not even five years later when i went back to the alex at the request of general heydrich it was all there in the box file my notes my reports my police diary my memoranda illmanns forensic report my original list of suspects and more much more because it was only now i realized it wasnt just the anita schwarz notes the box contained but the case notes on the murder of elizabeth bremer as well after i had left homicide the schwarz case had been handed to my sergeant heinrich grund and he had managed to have herzefeldes notes sent to him from munich much to my surprise i was now looking at the very case file i had traveled to see during that fateful july of most of herzefeldes inquiry had been focused on walter pieck a twentytwoyearold man from gunzburg pieck was elizabeth bremers skating teacher at the prinzregenten stadium in munich in summer he was a tennis coach at the ausstellungspark he was also a member of the rightwing stahlhelm and a nazi party member since it was hard to see what a twentytwoyearold man could have seen in a fifteenyearold girl at least it was until you looked at elizabeth bremers photograph she looked just like lana turner and just like lana filled every inch of the sweater she was wearing in the picture the happiest moments of my life have been the few i passed at home in the bosom of my family they would have been even happier if my family had been possessed of a bosom like elizabeth bremers id seen a bigger chest but only on a pirate ship reading herzefeldes case notes i was reminded that pieck had maintained elizabeth had binned him the week before her murder because she had caught him reading her diary in elizabeths eyes this was an unpardonable sin and to me her upset was easy to understand over the years ive read a few private diaries myself and not always for the best hardly satisfied with this explanation grund had got hold of the diary and noticed that elizabeth was in the habit of noting her menstrual period with the greek letter omega in the weeks preceding her murder a sigma had replaced the omega in elizabeth bremers diary leading grund to suppose that she may have been pregnant grund had interviewed pieck and suggested that this had been the real reason why he had been in the habit of reading his young girlfriends diary and that he had helped to procure her an illegal abortion but despite several days of questioning pieck had steadfastly denied this what was more pieck had a castiron alibi in the shape of his father who just happened to be the police chief of gunzburg which is several hundred miles from berlin neither elizabeths own doctor nor any of her school friends knew about a pregnancy but grund noted elizabeth had inherited some money in her grandfathers will which she had used to open a savings account and that the day before her death she had withdrawn almost half of this money and none of it had been found on her body and he had concluded that even if pieck had not helped her to procure an abortion elizabethby all accounts a resourceful and capable girlmust have managed to do so by herself and that anita schwarz might have done the same and that these abortions had been botched and that the illegal abortionist had sought to cover his tracks by making their accidental deaths look like lust murders i couldnt disagree with much of grunds conclusions and yet no one was ever arrested for the murders the leads seemed to dry up and after there were only two more notes on the file one was that in walter pieck joined the ss and became a guard at dachau concentration camp the other concerned anita schwarzs father otto having joined the berlin police in as kurt dalueges deputy assistant otto schwarz was subsequently appointed as a judge i got up from my desk and went to the window the lights were on in the ministry of finance probably they were trying to work out what to do about argentinas rampant inflation either that or they were having to work late to decide how they were going to raise the money to pay for evitas jewelry the street below was busy with people for some reason there was a long line of people outside the ministry of labor and traffic buenos aires was always full of traffic taxis trolleybuses micros american cars and trucks like so many unconnected thoughts in a detectives brain outside my window all the traffic was going in the same direction so were my thoughts i told myself that just maybe i had it all figured out more or less anita schwarz must have got pregnant and fearing the scandal that might result from the discovery of their disabled daughters amateur prostitution herr and frau schwarz must have paid the medicine man from munich to carry out an abortion on her probably that was why she had been carrying so much money in her pocket only the abortion procedure had gone wrong and anxious to cover up his crime the medicine man had tried to make her death look like a lust murder the same way he had done in munich after all it was better for him that the police should be looking for some kind of crazed sexkiller than an incompetent doctor lots of women had died at the hands of illegal abortionists they werent called backstreet angelmakers for nothing i recalled the case of one man a dentist in the bavarian city of ulm who during the s had actually strangled several pregnant women for sex while he was supposed to have been giving them abortions the more i thought about it the more i liked my theory the man i had been looking for was a doctor or some sort of medicine man most probably from munich my first idea was the jelly doctor kassner until i remembered checking out his alibi on the day of anita schwarzs murder hed been at a urologists conference in hannover and then i remembered his estranged wifes young friend the gypsylooking type with a little opentopped opel from munich beppo that was his name a strange name for a german kassner had said he was a student at munich university a medical student perhaps but how many students could have afforded a new opel unless of course hed been supplementing his income by carrying out illegal abortions possibly in kassners own apartment when he wasnt there and if like many students who came to sample berlins worldfamous nightlife this beppo had contracted a venereal disease who better than kassner to help him out with a course of protonsil the new magicbullet cure it would certainly have explained why kassners own address had appeared on the suspect list id made using kripos devils directory and the patient list copied in kassners office beppo then the man id met outside kassners own front door why not in which case if somehow he was here in argentina i might easily recognize him again of course if he was in argentina that would have to mean that hed done something criminal to have left germany in the first place something in the ss perhaps not that hed seemed like the ideal ss type not in back then theyd liked them to look aryan blond and blueeyed like heydrich like me beppo had certainly not been that i tried to picture him again in my minds eye medium height goodlooking but swarthy with it yes like a gypsy the nazis had hated gypsies almost as much as they had hated the jews of course he wouldnt have been the first person to have joined the ss who wasnt the perfect aryan type himmler for one eichmann for another but if beppo had been possessed of a medical qualification and had been able to prove that his family had been free of nonaryan blood for four generations he might easily have got himself into the medical corps of a waffenss unit i decided to ask dr vaernet if he could remember such a man working late i see it was colonel montalban yes i do my best thinking at night when its quiet me im more of a morning person you surprise me i thought you people liked to arrest people in the middle of the night he smiled actually no we prefer to arrest people first thing in the morning ill try to remember that he came over to the window and pointed at the line of people outside the ministry of labor you see those people on the other side of irigoyen theyre there to see evita i thought it was a little late to be looking for a job she spends every evening and half the night in there he said handing out money and favors to the countrys poor and sick and homeless very noble and during an election year pragmatic too thats not why she does it youre a german i wouldnt expect you to understand was it the nazis who made you so cynical no ive been cynical since march of what happened then the second battle of ypres of course i sometimes think if wed won that wed have won the war which would have been better for everyone in the long run the british and the germans would have agreed on a peace and hitler would have remained in welldeserved obscurity luis irigoyen who was related to our president and was our ambassador in germanyhes the one this street is named afterhe met hitler many times and admired him enormously he told me once that hitler was the most fascinating man he ever met this mention of hitler prompted me to recall anna yagubsky and her missing relatives and choosing my words carefully i tried to bring up the subject of argentine jews with montalban is that why argentina resisted jewish emigration he shrugged it was a very difficult time there were so many who wanted to come here it just wasnt possible to accommodate them all were not a big country like america or canada i avoided the temptation to remind the colonel that according to my travel guide argentina was the eighthlargest country in the world and was that how directive eleven came into existence montalbans eyes narrowed directive eleven is not a healthy thing to know about in argentina who told you about it one hears things yes but from whom this is the central state intelligence department i said not radio el mundo it would be surprising if one didnt hear the odd secret in a place like this besides my ability to speak castellano is improving all the time so i noticed i even heard that martin bormann is living in argentina thats certainly what the americans believe which is the best reason of all to know that its not true only do try to remember what i told you in argentina it is better to know everything than to know too much tell me colonel have there been any other murders murders you know when one person kills another on purpose in this case a schoolgirl like the one you showed me at the police headquarters the one missing her wedding trousseau he shook his head and the missing girl fabienne von bader she is still missing he smiled sadly i had hoped you would have found her by now no not yet but i may be close to discovering the true identity of the man who killed anita schwarz for a moment he looked puzzled she was the girl who was murdered in berlin back in you know the one you remembered reading about in the german newspapers when i was still your idea of a hero yes of course do you think he might be here after all its a little early to say if he is especially as im still waiting to see that doctor you told me about the one from new york the specialist dr pack thats exactly why i came to see you to tell you hes here in buenos aires he arrived today he can see you tomorrow or perhaps the day after depending on his other more important patient i know i know but not too much just everything i wont forget see that you dont for your own sake he nodded youre an interesting man senor no doubt about it yes i know that too ive had an interesting life i ought to have paid more attention to the warning the colonel had given me but i always was a sucker for a pretty face especially a pretty face as beautiful as anna yagubskys my desk was on the second floor on the floor below was the archivo where sides files were stored i decided to look in on my way out i was already in the habit of going in there for each old comrade i interviewed i added to his file a detailed record of who he was and what crimes he had committed i didnt think i would be risking very much by looking in some other unrelated files the only question was how this was to be achieved in berlin all known and suspected enemies of the third reich had been registered in the a index located in gestapo headquarters on prinz albrechtstrasse the a index also known as the office index was the most modern criminal records system in the world or so heydrich had once told me the index comprised half a million cards on people the gestapo considered to be worthy of attention it was set on a huge horizontally mounted circular card carousel with an electric motor and a dedicated operator who could locate any one of those half a million cards in less than a minute heydrich a firm believer in the old axiom that knowledge is power called it his wheel of fortune more than anyone it was heydrich who helped to revolutionize the old prussian political police and made the sd one of the largest employers in germany by more than six hundred officials worked in the gestapos berlin records division alone nothing so sophisticated or large existed in buenos aires although the system worked well enough at the casa rosada a staff of twenty worked around the clock in five shifts of four files were kept on opposition politicians tradeunion officials communists leftwing intellectuals members of parliament disaffected army officers homosexuals and religious leaders these files were stored in mobile shelving that was operated by a system of locking handwheels and referenced according to name and subject by a series of leatherbound ledgers called los libros marrones access to the files was controlled via a simple signature system unless the file was deemed sensitive in which case the entry in the libros marrones was written up in red the senior officer on duty in the archivo was known as the orthe oficial registroand he was supposed to supervise and authorize the acquisition and use of all written material i knew at least two of these ors reasonably well to them i had confessed my former trade as a berlin policeman and in an effort to ingratiate myself i had even regaled them with descriptions of the apparent omniscience of the gestapo filing system most of what i told them however was based on the few months i had spent in kripos records division following my exit from homicide but sometimes i just made it up not that the ors knew the difference one of them whom i knew only as marcello was keen to use the gestapo filing system as a model for updating its side counterpart and i had promised to help him write a detailed memo for submission to the head of side rodolfo freude i knew that marcello would be on duty in the archivo and as i came through the swing doors i saw him in his usual position behind the main desk this was completely circular and with its argentine flag and sidearmed military officers it looked more like a defensive redoubt than a records division except that marcello hardly resembled anything military in a uniform that fitted him only where it gripped him whenever i saw him he always reminded me of one of those babyfaced boy soldiers drafted to defend hitlers bunker against the red army during the fall of berlin i returned the updated files on carl vaernet and pedro olmos and asked for the file on helmut gregor marcello took the returned files checked the libros marrones for helmut gregor and then dispatched one of the junior officers to go and retrieve it from the shelves i watched as the officer started to wind the handwheel like a man opening a lock gate until the relevant shelf had moved far along an invisible track to permit his ingress tell me more about your a index said marcello who was of italianargentine origin all right i said hoping that i might waltz him in the direction i wanted there were three kinds of cards in group one all cards had a red mark indicating an enemy of the state in group two a blue mark indicating someone to be arrested in time of national emergency and in group three a green mark indicating people who were subject to surveillance at all times all these marks were on the left side of the card on the right side of the card a second color mark indicated a communist someone suspected of being in the resistance a jew a jehovahs witness a homosexual a freemason and so on the whole index was updated twice a year at the beginning and at the end of the summer our busiest time himmler insisted on it fascinating said marcello informers had special files and so did agents but all of these files were completely separate from those held by the abwehrgerman military intelligence you mean they didnt share intelligence absolutely not they hated each other now that id danced with him i figured it was time to make my move do you have a file on a jewish couple called the yagubskys i asked innocently marcello removed the heavy brownleatherbound ledger from the curving shelf behind him and consulted it with a frequently licked forefinger he must have licked it a thousand times every day and i was surprised it wasnt worn away like a stick of salt a minute or so later he was shaking his head nothing im afraid i told him some more made up stuff about how heydrich had planned to build a huge switchprogrammed electronic machine to deliver the same information as the wheel of fortune by teleprinter paper tape and in a tenth of the time i let marcello ooh and aah about that for a while before i asked him if i could see the files relating to directive marcello didnt consult his brown books before answering and he flinched a little as if it bothered him that he was about to fail me again no weve got nothing about that either he explained files like that arent kept here not anymore all files relating to the argentine immigration service were removed by the ministry of foreign affairs about a year ago and i believe they were put in storage oh where at the old hotel de inmigrantes its on the north dock on the other side of the avenida eduardo madero it was constructed at the beginning of the century to deal with the huge number of immigrants coming here to argentina rather like ellis island in new york the place is more or less derelict now even the rats stay clear of it i believe theres just a skeleton staff that works there i havent been there myself but one of the other ors helped to move some cabinets there and said it was all a bit primitive if you were looking for something there it would probably be best to go through the ministry of foreign affairs i shook my head its really not that important i said i drove to president peron station parked my car and found a telephone i called the number anna yagubsky had given me an old man answered his voice full of suspicion i guessed it was her father when i gave him my name he started to ask a lot of questions none of which i could have answered even if id wanted to listen senor yagubsky id love to talk awhile with you only im a little pressed for time right now so would you mind just putting your questions on hold and fetching your daughter to the phone theres no need to be rude about it he said as a matter of fact i was trying very hard not to be rude about it im amazed that you have any clients at all senor hausner if this is how you treat them clients uhhuh exactly what did your daughter tell you about me senor yagubsky that youre a private detective and that she hired you to find my brother i smiled what about your sisterinlaw to be really honest with you my sisterinlaw i can live without i never understood why roman married her and we never got along that well are you married senor have been not anymore well at least you know what youre doing without i pushed another coin into the telephone right now im in danger of going without speaking to your daughter that was my last five centavos all right all right thats the trouble with you germans youve always got a reason to be in a hurry he laid the receiver down with a clunk and a long minute later anna came on the line what did you say to my father theres really no time to explain i want you to meet me at president peron station in half an hour couldnt it be tomorrow night tomorrows no good i might have a hospital appointment tomorrow maybe the day after as well i quickly lit a cigarette look just be here as soon as you can ill wait by the belgrano platform cant you tell me anything wear some old clothes and bring a flashlight two if you have them and a flask of coffee were liable to be a while but where are we going to do a little digging youre scaring me maybe i should bring a pick and shovel too no angel not with those lovely hands of yours take it easy were not looking to dig anyone up were just going to dig around in some old immigration files and its liable to get a little dusty thats all im very relieved to hear it for a minute i thoughti mean im a little bit squeamish about digging up dead bodies especially at night i hear that normally thats the best time to do that kind of thing even the dead arent paying much attention this is buenos aires senor hausner the dead are always paying attention in buenos aires thats why we built la recoleta so we wouldnt forget it death is a way of life for us youre talking to a german angel when we invented the ss we had the last word in death cults believe me the phone began to demand more money and that was my last five centavos so get your beautiful behind over here like i told you yes sir i put down the receiver i regretted involving anna there was some risk in what i was planning but i couldnt think of anyone else who might have helped me to understand whatever documents were being stored in the hotel de inmigrantes then again she was involved it was her aunt and uncle we were looking for she wasnt paying me enough to take all of the risks on my own and since she wasnt paying me anything at all she could damn well come along for the ride and like it i was of two minds about her calling me sir like that it made me feel like someone worthy of respect by virtue of my age which was something i told myself i was going to have to get used to as long as i was getting older that was okay you had to remain alive to get older i bought some more cigarettes a prensa and a copy of the argentinisches tageblattthe only germanlanguage newspaper it was safe to read in the sense that it didnt mark you out as a nazi but the main reason for going into the station was the knife shop mostly the blades were for tourists bonehandled cutlery for chartered surveyors and accountants who fancied themselves as gauchos or streetfighting tangodancers a few of the less spectacular knives looked about right for what i had in mind i bought two a long thin stiletto for pushing right through a keyway and tripping the catch within a lock housing and something bigger for jimmying a window i tucked the big one under my belt in the small of my back gaucho style and slipped the little stiletto inside my breast pocket when the shop clerk shot me a look i smiled benignly and said i like to be well armed when my sister comes to dinner hed have looked a lot more surprised if hed seen my shoulder holster half an hour passed fortyfive minutes turned into an hour id just started to curse anna when finally she showed up wearing an ensemble of old clothes supplied by edith head a nice plaid shirt neatly pressed jeans a tailored tweed jacket a pair of flat heels and a large leather handbag and too late i realized my mistake telling a woman like anna to come out wearing old clothes was like telling berenson to frame a great painting with firewood i guessed she had probably changed her clothes several times just to make sure that the old clothes she had on were the best old clothes she could have chosen to wear not that it mattered what she was wearing anna yagubsky would have looked wonderful wearing half a pantomime horse she eyed the belgrano train uncertainly are we taking the train somewhere the thought had crossed my mind but not this one i hear the slow train to paradise is more comfortable no i wanted to meet you here so i wouldnt miss you in the dark outside but now that ive seen you again i realize i wouldnt miss you in an exodus she blushed a little i led her out of the station with that huge echoing cathedral of a building behind us we walked east through a double row of parked trolleybuses and into a big open square dominated by a redbrick clock tower that was now striking the hour under acacia trees people played music and lovers trysted on benches anna took my arm and it would have seemed romantic if we hadnt been planning trespass and the illegal entry of a public building what do you know about the immigrants hotel i asked her as we crossed eduardo manero is that where were going i wondered if it might be she shrugged theres been an immigrants hotel here since the middle of the last century my parents could probably tell you more about it they stayed there when they first came to argentina in the beginning any poor immigrant arriving in the country could get free board and lodging there for five days then in the thirties it was any poor immigrant who wasnt jewish im not sure when they closed it there was something in the paper about it last year i think we approached a honeycolored fourstory building that was almost as big as the railway station surrounded by a fence it looked more like a prison than a hotel and i reflected that this had probably been closer to its real purpose the fence wasnt more than six feet high but the top wire was barbed and it did the job we kept walking until we found a gate there was a sign that read prohibida la entrada and underneath a large eagle padlock that must have been there since the hotel was built when she saw the big gaucho knife in my hand annas eyes widened this is what happens when you ask questions people dont want you to ask i said they lock up the answers i flicked open the padlock aiee said anna wincing fortunately for me they use crummy locks that wouldnt keep out a rat with a toothpick i pushed open the gate and walked into an arrivals yard overgrown with tufts of grass and jacaranda trees a gust of wind blew a sheet of newsprint to my feet i picked it up it was a twomonthold page from el laborista a peronist rag i hoped it was the last time anyone had been there it certainly looked that way there were no lights in any of the hundred or so windows only the sound of distant traffic driving along eduardo manero and a train moving in the rail yards disturbed the quiet of the abandoned hotel i dont like this admitted anna im sorry about that i said but my castellano isnt up to the kind of legalese and bureaucratic language you usually find in official documents if we do find something well probably need those beautiful eyes of yours to read it and here was me thinking you just wanted some company she glanced around nervously i just hope there arent any rats i get enough of those at work just take it easy okay from the look of this place nobodys been here in a while the main doorway smelled strongly of cat piss the frosted windows were covered with cobwebs and salt from the estuary river a largish spider scrambled away as my shoes disturbed its gossamer repose i forced another padlock with the big knife and then raked the yale on the door with the stiletto do you always carry a complete cutlery drawer in your pockets she asked its that or a set of keys i said gouging at the locks mechanism where were you during choir practice you do that like youve done it before i used to be a cop remember we do all of the things criminals do but for much less money or in this case no money at all moneys a big thing with you i can tell maybe thats because i dont have very much well then we have something in common maybe when this is all over you can show me your gratitude sure ill write you a nice letter on my best notepaper how does that sound if we find your miracle you can write to the local archbishop with evidence of my heroic virtue and maybe in a hundred years theyll make me a saint saint bernhard they did it before they can do it again hell they even did it for a lousy dog by the way thats my real name bernhard gunther i suppose there is a doglike quality about you she said i finished raking the lock sure im fond of children and im loyal to my family when i have one just dont hang a little barrel of brandy around my neck unless you expect me to drink it my voice was full of bravado i was trying to stop her from being scared in truth i was just as nervous as she was more so probably when youd seen as many people killed as i had you know how easy it is to get killed did you bring those flashlights she opened her bag to reveal a bicycle lamp and a little hand dynamo you had to keep squeezed to make it light i took the bicycle lamp dont switch on until were inside i told her i opened the door and poked my muzzle inside the hotel it wasnt the one on my face it was the one on my gun we went inside our footsteps echoing on the cheap marble floor like those of two ghosts uncertain about which part of the building to go and haunt there was a strong smell of mildew and damp i switched on the bicycle lamp illuminating a doubleheight hallway there was no one about i put away my gun what are we looking for she whispered boxes packing cases filing cabinets anything that might contain records of immigration the ministry of foreign affairs decided to dump them here when this place closed down i offered anna my hand but she brushed it off and laughed i stopped being afraid of the dark when i was seven she said these days i even manage to put myself to bed maybe you shouldnt i said its odd of me i know but somehow i feel safer that way we walked the length of the building and found four large dormitories on the ground floor one of these still had beds and i counted two hundred fifty which if the upper floors were the same meant that as many as five thousand people had once lived in the building my poor parents said anna i had no idea that it was like this its not so bad believe me the german idea of resettlement was a lot worse than this in the communal washrooms between the dormitories were sixteen square sinks as big as a car door and beyond the farthest washroom was a locked door the padlock which was a new one told me we were probably in the right place someone had felt obliged to secure what was on the other side of the door with a lock superior to the ones on the gate and on the front door but new or not this padlock yielded just as easily to my gauchos knife i pushed the door open with the sole of my shoe and shone the light inside i think we found what were looking for i said although it was evident that the real work was only just beginning there were dozens of filing cabinetsas many as a hundredin five ranks one in front of the other like tightly dressed lines of soldiers so that it was impossible to open one without moving the one in front of it this is going to take hours said anna it looks as though we are going to spend the night together after all then youd better make the most of it she said she put the lamp down on the floor faced the cabinet at the head of the first rank and pointed at the cabinet heading the second here you look in that one and ill look in this one i blew some dust off a mistake there was too much dust it filled the air and made us cough i pulled open the top drawer of the filing cabinet and started to riffle through names beginning with the letter z zhabotinsky zhukov zinoviev these are all zs you dont suppose the one behind this one could be the y cabinet do you like y for yrigoyen youngblood and yagubsky i slammed the drawer shut and we moved that cabinet out of the way of the one behind even before i had wrestled it completely clear anna had hauled the top drawer of the next cabinet open there was more strength in her arm than she realized or possibly she was suddenly too excited to know her own strength either way she managed to pull the entire drawer completely out of the cabinet and narrowly missing her toes and mine it thudded on the marble floor with the sound of a door closing in some deep pit of hell do you want to try that again i asked only i dont think they heard it in the casa rosada sorry she whispered lets hope not anna was already kneeling in front of the fallen drawer and with the light from the little hand dynamo she was holding examining the contents you were right she cried excitedly these are the ys i picked the bicycle lamp off the floor and trained the beam on her hands then she said i dont believe it and removed one thin file from the pack yagubsky even in the semidarkness i could see the tears in her eyes her voice was choked too it seems that you can work miracles after all saint bernhard then she opened the file it was empty anna stared at the empty file for a long moment then she flung it aside angrily and sinking back on her haunches let out an enormous sigh so much for your miracle she said im sorry its not your fault i didnt want to be a saint anyway after a while i went to find the empty file i picked it up and looked at it more closely it was empty all right but the file wasnt without information there was a date on the plain manila cover when did you say they disappeared january this file is dated march and look underneath their names are written the words judio and judia jew and jewess and theres the small matter of a rubber stamp in red ink anna looked at it d she said whats d theres another date and a signature inside the stamp the signature is illegible but the date is clear enough april yes but what is d i have no idea i went back to the cabinet and removed another file this one belonged to a john yorath from wales and it was full of information details of entry visas details of john yoraths medical history a record of his stay at the hotel de inmigrantes a copy of a cedula everything but not jewish and no d stamp on the cover they were here said anna excitedly this proves that they were here i think it also proves that theyre not here any longer what do you mean i shrugged i dont know clearly however they were arrested and then deported perhaps i told you weve never heard from them not since january then perhaps they were imprisoned warming to my theme i said youre a lawyer anna tell me about the prisons in this country lets see theres the prison at parque ameghino here in the city and the villa devoto of course where peron imprisons his political enemies then theres san miguel where regular criminals are sent where else yes a military jail on martin garcia island in the river plate thats where peron himself was imprisoned when he was originally deposed in october yes yes you might imprison a great many people on martin garcia she thought for a moment but wait a minute theres nowhere more remote than neuquen prison in the andean foothills you hear stories about neuquen but almost nothing is known about it except that the people who are sent there never return do you really think its possible that they could be in jail all this time i dont know anna i waved at the regiment of filing cabinets ranked in front of us but its just possible well find the answers in one of these you really know how to show a girl a good time gunther she stood up and went over to the next cabinet and drew the drawer open an hour or so before dawn exhausted and grimy with dust and having found nothing else of any interest we decided to call it a night we stayed too long i knew that because as we came back into the front hall someone switched on the electric lights anna uttered a little stifled scream i wasnt exactly happy about this turn of events myself especially as the person who had switched on the lights was pointing a gun at us not that he was much of a person it was easy to see why marcello had talked about a skeleton staff ive seen healthierlooking men in coffins he was about five feet six inches tall with lank greasy gray hair eyebrows that looked like two halves of a mustache that had been separated for its own good and a rats narrow recreant features he wore a cheap suit a vest that looked like a rag in a mechanics greasy hands no socks and no shoes there was a bottle in his coat pocket that was probably his breakfast and in the corner of his mouth a length of drooping tobacco ash that had once been a cigarette as he spoke it fell onto the floor what are you doing here he said in a voice made indistinct with phlegm and alcohol and a lack of teeth in fact there was just one tooth on his prominent upper jaw a front tooth that looked like the last pin standing in a game of skittles im a policeman i said i needed to look at an old file urgently im afraid there was no time to go through proper procedures is that right he nodded at anna and whats her story none of your goddamn business i said look take a look at my id will you its just like i told you youre no cop not with that accent im secret police side im one of colonel montalbans people never heard of him we both report to rodolfo freude youve heard of him havent you matter of fact i have it was him who gave me my orders explicit orders he says no one and i mean no one no one gets in this place without the express authority in writing of the president himself he grinned have you got a letter from the president he crept forward and patted me down his fingers quickly turning my pockets inside out he grinned thought not up close i wasnt inclined to change my impression of him he looked inferior and secondrate but there was nothing secondrate about the gun in his hand that was special a police special with a twoinch barrel and a nice bright blue finish it was the only thing about him that looked like it was in perfect working order it had crossed my mind to tackle him while he was searching my pockets but the police special quickly changed it for me he found my gun and tossed it away he even found the little stiletto in my breast pocket but he didnt find the gaucho knife hidden under my belt in the small of my back he backed away and patted anna down mostly on her breasts which seemed to give him an idea you he told her pretty lady take off your jacket and your shirt she stared at him with dumb insolence and when nothing happened he got handy with the gun pressing it under her chin youd better do it pretty lady or ill blow your head off do as he says anna he means it the man grinned his onetoothed grin and stood back to enjoy the sight of her undressing the brassiere too take it off lets see those titties anna looked at me desperately i nodded back at her she unhooked her bra and let it fall onto the ground the man licked his lips staring at her bared breasts now those are nice he said real nice titties nicest titties ive seen in a while i pressed my spine back a little against my belt feeling the big sheath knife that was there and wondering if i even knew how to throw a knifeespecially one that looked as if it belonged on a butchers chopping block the man with one tooth reached forward and tried to take one of annas nipples between his forefinger and thumb but she shrank away from his touch behind the shield of her forearms stand still he said twitching nervously stand still or ill shoot you pretty lady anna closed her eyes and let him take hold of her nipple at first he just kneaded it with his fingers like a man rolling tobacco but then he started to squeeze hard her face told me that much so did his he was smiling with sadistic pleasure enjoying the pain he was inflicting on her anna bore it silently for a while but that only seemed to make him do it harder until she begged him to stop he did but only to squeeze her other nipple by now i had the knife in my hand i slid it up inside the forearm of my sleeve there was too much distance between the two of us to risk attacking him with the blade in my hand most likely he would have shot me and then raped and killed her it was too much gun to take a chance with but throwing the knife was risky too i let the knife slide into the palm of my hand and gripped the blade like a hammer anna sank onto her knees whimpering with pain only he kept hold of her his face contorted with ghastly pleasure enjoying every second of the agony that was written in her face you bastard she said that was my cue and with a small step forward and both arms pointed straight at the target i threw the knife putting my whole hip into it to add to the power of my throw i aimed at his side just below his outstretched hand that was still twisting her nipple he cried out the knife appeared to hit him in the ribs but then it was in his hand he let it go and it fell onto the ground at the same time he shot at me and missed i felt the bullet zip over my head i rolled quickly forward expecting to find myself facing the twoinch barrel or worse instead i found myself staring at a man who was now on all fours coughing blood onto the ground between his hands and then curling up into a ball holding his side i glanced at the knife and seeing the blood on the blade guessed that it must have pierced his side to a depth of several inches before he had plucked it out of his torso my close proximity seemed to deflect him from the pain and distress of his wound twisting his whole body to one side he tried to shoot again only this time without lifting his forearm from the stab wound in his side look out yelled anna but i was already over him wrestling the gun from the grip of his bloody hand even as it fired harmlessly into the ceiling anna screamed i punched him hard on the side of the head but the fight had already gone out of him i tiptoed away from him trying to avoid the pool of his blood that was spreading on the floor like an expanding red balloon he wasnt dead yet but i could tell there was no saving him the blade had gone through a major artery just like a bayonet from the amount of blood on the floor it was clear he would be dead in minutes are you all right i picked up annas brassiere and handed it to her yes she whispered her hands were cupping her breasts and her eyes were full of tears she was looking at him almost as if she pitied him put your clothes on i said we have to leave now someone might have heard those shots i put his gun under my belt holstered my own put the flashlights in annas bag and picked up the two knives then i glanced around for anything the cops might get their teeth into a button a hank of hair an earring the little spots of color on a canvas like georges seurat that ernst gennat had been fond of but there was nothing just him wheezing his last breaths away a dead body that didnt know it yet what about him asked anna buttoning her shirt we cant just leave him here hes finished i said by the time an ambulance gets here hell be dead i took hold of her arm and moved her smartly toward the door then switched out the light with any luck by the time anyone finds him the rats will have spoiled the evidence anna took my hand off her arm and switched the light on again i told you i dont like rats maybe you can flash a message in morse code while youre at it i said just to make sure people know that theres someone here but i left the light on hes still a human being she said going back to the body on the floor trying to keep her shoes out of the blood she dropped down on her haunches and shaking her head helplessly she looked back at me as if begging for a clue about what to do next the man twitched several times and then lay still i had a rather different impression i said crouching down beside her i pressed my fingers hard under his ear and paused for the sake of verisimilitude well hes dead i said are you sure what do you want me to do write out a death certificate the poor man she whispered then she did something that struck me as an odd thing to do if you were a jew she crossed herself speaking for myself im glad the poor mans dead the poor man was going to rape and kill you but not before the poor man killed me probably the poor man had it coming if you ask me now if youre quite through grieving for the poor man id like to get out of here before the cops or any of the poor mans friends show up and wonder if this murder weapon im holding in my hand makes me a suspect in case youve forgotten they have the death penalty for murder in argentina anna glanced at the gaucho knife and nodded i went to the door and switched out the light she followed me outside at the gate in the fence i told her to wait a minute i ran to the edge of the north dock and hurled the knife as far as i could into the river plate as soon as i heard the evidence hit the water i felt better ive seen what lawyers can do with evidence together we walked back to where i had left my car in front of the railway station the sun was coming up another day was dawning for everyone except the man with one tooth who was now lying dead on the floor of the immigrants hotel i felt very tired in every way it had been a long night tell me something she said does this sort of thing happen to you often herrwhat did you say your real name was again gunther bernhard gunther and you make it sound like you werent there anna i can assure you im not likely to forget this evening in a hurry she stopped walking for a moment and then threw up i gave her my handkerchief she wiped her mouth and took a deep breath all right now i asked she nodded we reached my car and got in that was quite a date she said next time lets just go to the theater ill take you home i said anna shook her head and wound down the window no i cant go home not yet not feeling the way i do now and after what happened i dont want to be alone either lets stay here for a moment i just need to be still for a while i poured some of the coffee shed brought she drank it and then watched me smoke a cigarette what no trembling hands no unsteady lips on that cigarette no deep drags you smoke that cigarette like nothing happened just how ruthless are you herr gunther im still here anna i guess that speaks for itself i leaned across the seat and kissed her she seemed to enjoy it then i said tell me your address and ill drive you home youve been out all night your father will be worried about you i guess youre not as ruthless as i thought dont bet on it i started the engine so she said you really are going to drive me home thats a first maybe you do want to be a saint after all she was right of course the fact is i wanted to prove to her how polished and shiny my armor really was i drove quickly i wanted to get her home before i changed my mind nobility swims only so far in my gut before it hits its head on something hard and unyielding especially where she was concerned berlin and buenos aires the first we knew about it was a strong smell of burning then we heard the fire engines and the ambulances from artilleriestrasse frieda went outside the hotel entrance to take a look and saw an excited crowd of people heading northwest across pariser platz above the rooftops of the french embassy something lit up the night sky like an open furnace door its the reichstag said frieda the reichstag is on fire we ran back into the hotel intending to get a better view from the roof but in the lobby i met herr adlon i told him the reichstag was on fire it was just after ten pm yes i know he drew me to one side thought better of what he had been about to say and then took me into the managers office he closed the door theres something i want you to do and it might well be dangerous i shrugged it off do you know where the chinese embassy is yes its on kurfurstendamm next to the nelson theater i want you to go there to the chinese embassy in the hotel laundry van said louis adlon handing me some keys i want you to pick up some passengers and bring them straight back here but on no account let them alight at the front door of the hotel drive them through the gate to the tradesman entrance ill be waiting for you there might i ask who it is sir you may its bernard weiss and his family someone tipped him off that the nazis were coming to his house tonight to lynch him fortunately chiang kaishek is a friend of izzys and agreed to let him and his family take refuge there he just called me a few minutes ago and asked if i could help naturally i agreed to let him stay here and i assumed you would want to help too of course but wouldnt he be safer remaining in the embassy perhaps but hed be more comfortable here wouldnt you agree besides we are used to having people stay here in our vip suites in conditions of almost total secrecy no we shall look after him very well and for as long as is necessary this has something to do with reichstag fire im certain of it i said the nazis must be planning a complete overthrow of the republic and to declare martial law i think you must be right are you carrying a gun no sir but i can fetch one theres no time you can take mine he took out a key chain and unlocked the safe the last time i took this gun out of the safe was during the spartakist uprising of but its been well oiled he handed me a broomhandled mauser and a box of ammunition then he upended a leather briefcase emptying the contents onto his desk put the mauser in this and be careful bernie i dont think its going to be the kind of night that makes one feel proud to be a german louis adlon was right the streets of berlin were full of marauding gangs of storm troopers they sang their songs and waved their flags as if the fire were cause for celebration i saw some smashing the windows of a jewishowned store near the zoo it was all too easy to imagine what would have happened if theyd met up with an old rabbi or some luckless idiot wearing a leninstyle peaked cap and a red flag on his lapel there were police vans and armored cars everywhere but i didnt suppose they were intent on protecting communists and jews and seeing the schupo men doing very little to stop disorder in the city i was very glad i was no longer a policeman on the other hand it was an excellent night to be chinese when i arrived i saw that no one was paying any attention to the chinese embassy or its occupants leaving the engine running and the doors open i got out of the van and rang the embassys doorbell a chinese answered the door and asked who i was i told him louis adlon had sent me at which point the double doors to a groundfloor anteroom were flung open and i saw izzy and his family waiting there with their luggage they looked at me anxiously izzy shook my hand and nodded silently we didnt say anything much there wasnt time i grabbed their suitcases threw them in the van and when i was satisfied that it was quite safe i waved my passengers out of the embassy slamming the doors of the van shut behind them when i reached the adlon i drove through to the tradesman entrance as instructed and found louis adlon waiting max the hall porter loaded the weiss family belongings onto a baggage trolley and disappeared into a service elevator he didnt even look for a tip everything was strange about that night meanwhile we hurried the refugees into another service elevator and along to the best suite in the hotel that was typical of louis adlon and i knew the significance would not be lost on izzy inside the magnificent suite the heavy silk curtains were already drawn and a fire was burning brightly in the grate izzys wife disappeared into the bathroom with her children adlon was pouring some drinks for us all max showed up and began to put the luggage away while you couldnt see anything of what was happening outside you could hear a lot some storm troopers had come along wilhelmstrasse and were chanting death to the marxists izzys eyes were full of tears but he tried to smile it sounds as though they have already found the people to blame for the fire he said people will never believe that i said theyll believe what they want to believe said izzy and right now they certainly dont want to believe in the communists he took the glass offered by louis and the three of us toasted one another to better days said louis yes said izzy but i fear this is just the beginning this is more than just a fire mark my words this is the funeral pyre of german democracy he placed an avuncular hand on my shoulder youre going to have to watch yourself my young friend me i grinned im not the one who was hiding out in the chinese embassy oh its been over for me for a while weve been prepared for something like this our suitcases have been packed for weeks where will you go sir holland well be safe there i could see he was tired exhausted so we shook hands and i left him i never saw him again i went up to the roof and found frieda watching the fire with some of the guests and hotel staff one of the waiters from the cocktail bar had brought up a bottle of schnapps to help ward off the cold night air but no one was drinking very much everyone knew what the fire meant it looked like a beacon from hell im glad youre back she said im scared i put my arm around her why theres nothing to be scared of youre perfectly safe up here i didnt mean that bernie im jewish remember id forgotten im sorry i drew her closer to me and kissed her on the forehead her hair and overcoat smelled strongly of smoke almost as if she herself had caught fire i coughed a little so much for berlins famous air i said i was worried about you where have you been a strong gust of bitterly cold wind filled our faces with smoke where had i been i didnt know i was dull without thoughts i swallowed with some difficulty and tried to answer the smoke was bothering me a lot now there was so much of it that i couldnt see the fire anymore nor the adlons rooftop or even frieda after a minute i took a deep breath that hurt my throat then i called out to her where are you a man peered at me out of the smoke he was wearing a white coat and a gold wristwatch his eyes were on my collarbone and then his fingers too as though he expected to find something he was looking for under my adams apple i turned my head on the pillow and yawned how does that feel asked the man wearing the white coat hurts a bit when i swallow i heard myself say otherwise it feels fine he was tanned and fitlooking with a smile as neat as the teeth on a comb his castellano wasnt up to much he sounded english or american perhaps his breath was cold and perfumed like his fingers where am i youre in the british hospital in buenos aires senor hausner you had an operation on your thyroid remember im your doctor dr pack i frowned trying to remember who hausner was as it happens youre a very lucky man you see the thyroid sits on either side of your adams apple like two small plums one of them was cancerous we took that part of your thyroid out but the other part was fine so we left it there all of which means you wont have to spend the rest of your life having to take thyroxin pills just a little calcium until were satisfied with your blood analysis youll be out of here and back at work in just a few days there was something attached to my throat i tried to touch it to feel what it was but the doctor stopped me those are some little clips to keep the skin over the incision together he explained we wont stitch you up finally until were quite satisfied that everything in there is all right and if its not i croaked ninetynine times out of a hundred it is all right if the cancer hasnt already spread from one side of your thyroid to the other it probably wont now no the reason we dont sew you up yet is because we like to keep an eye on your windpipe sometimes after removal of the thyroid or a part of the thyroid theres a small danger of asphyxiation he brandished a pair of surgical pliers if that happens we unlock those clips with these and open you up again but i can assure you sir theres really very little chance of that happening i closed my eyes i didnt mean to be rude but there was too much dope inside me to mind my manners and i was having a hard job just trying to remember my real name my name wasnt hausner i was certain of that much i hope you operated on the right patient doc i heard myself whisper im someone else you know someone i used to be a long time ago the next time i woke up she was there stroking the hair back from my forehead id forgotten her name but i certainly hadnt forgotten how lovely she was she was wearing a figurehugging cigarbrown dress with short tight sleeves it made her look like shed been rolled on a cuban girls thigh if id had the strength id have put her in my mouth and sucked at her toes here she said putting a little necklace around my neck its a chai necklace for life to help you get well thanks angel by the way how did you find out i was here they told me at your hotel she glanced around my room its a nice room youve done all right for yourself i had a private room at the british hospital because they didnt have a private room at the american hospital and because colonel montalban didnt want dr george pack from sloankettering in new york seen anywhere near the president juan peron hospital and especially nowhere near the evita peron hospital but i couldnt tell anna any of that it was a very british room there was a nice picture of the king on the wall but why here instead of the german hospital asked anna i suppose youre scared someone will recognize you is that it its because my doctor is an american and doesnt speak german i said and because his castellano isnt much either anyway im cross with you you didnt tell me you were ill im not angel not anymore as soon as i get out of here ill prove it all the same i think i would have mentioned something if it had been me who had cancer she said i thought we were friends and thats what friends are for maybe i thought youd think it was contagious im not an idiot gunther i know cancers not contagious maybe i didnt want to take that risk i could tell the king agreed with me he didnt look too well himself he was wearing a naval uniform and enough gold braid to supply a shipful of ambitious officers there was pain in his eyes and in the sinews of his thin hands but he seemed the type to stick it out in silence i could tell we had a lot in common and talking of risk i told her sternly i meant what i said angel youre to say nothing about what happened or to ask questions concerning what we found out about directive eleven i dont know that we found out very much she said im not convinced youre the great detective my friend said you are well that makes two of us but either way this is not something people in this country want anyone asking about anna ive been in this business a long time and i know a big secret when i smell one i didnt tell you this before but when i mentioned directive eleven to someone in side he started twitching like a divining rod promise me you wont talk about it not even to your father and your mother and your rabbi confessor all right she said sulkily i promise i wont say anything about any of it not even in my prayers as soon as im out of here well put the wheels in motion again see what we can find out in the meantime you can answer me this question what are you a jewish catholic or a catholic jew im not sure i can tell the difference not without chucking you in the village pond anyway my parents converted when they left russia she said because they wanted to fit in when they got here my father said that being a jew made you too noticeable that it was best to keep a low profile and seem like everyone else she shook her head why have you got something against jewish catholics on the contrary if you go back far enough youll find that all catholics are jewish thats the great thing about history if you go back far enough even hitlers jewish i guess that explains everything she said and kissed me tenderly what was that for that was in lieu of some grapes to help you get well soon it might just help at that then so should this ive fallen for you dont ask me why because youre too old for me but i have i had other visitors but none of them as lovely as anna yagubsky and none who made me feel as good the colonel looked in on me so did pedro geller and melville from the richmond cafe he was kind enough to beat me at chess it all felt very civilian and commonplace as if i were part of a community instead of a man in exile from his own country with one very tall and scarfaced exception he was about sixfeetfour and two hundred fifty pounds his hair was thick and dark and brushed back from a broad lumpy forehead looked like a frenchmans beret his ears were enormous like an indian elephants and his left cheek was covered with the schmissen beloved of german students for whom a dueling saber had been a more attractive diversion than a slim volume of poetry he was wearing a lightbrown sports jacket a pair of very baggy flannel trousers a white shirt and a green silk tie his shoes were very polished and stout and probably contained a taperecording of a military parade ground in his left hand was a cigarette i guessed he was in his early forties and when he spoke german it was with a strong viennese accent so youre awake he said i sat up in bed and nodded who are you he picked up in his huge mitts the surgical pliersthe ones that were supposed to open the clips on my neck in case anything went wrong with my windpipeand started to play crab with them otto skorzeny he said his voice sounded almost as rough as my own as if he gargled with battery acid thats a relief i said most of the nurses have been quite pretty up until now he chuckled so i noticed maybe i should check in here myself im still plagued with an old war wound i got in fortyone i was blown up with a katyusha rocket and buried alive for a while i hear thats the best way in the long run he chuckled again it sounded like a drain emptying what can i do for you otto i called him otto because all three buttons were done up on his jacket and there was something bulging under his right armpit i didnt think it was his thyroid i heard you were asking questions about me he smiled but it was more a way of stretching his face than anything pleasant oh at the casa rosada maybe one or two that might not be a healthy thing to do my friend especially for a man in your position he tapped the jaws of the pliers together meaningfully what are these things for anyway i thought it better not to tell him in any detail theyre surgical pliers you mean for pulling out ingrown toenails and things like that i imagine so i saw a man have all his fingernails pulled out by the gestapo once that was in russia ive heard its a fascinating country those bloody russians can take pain like no one else he said with real admiration in his voice once i saw a russian soldier both of whose arms had been taken off at the elbow just an hour or two earlier get up from his mattress and take himself to the latrine must have been some pair of pliers anyway im here now so what did you want to know and dont give me that phony passport story a goodconduct pass or whatever it is what do you really want to know im looking for a killer is that all skorzeny shrugged were all of us that i imagine he put out his cigarette in the ashtray on my bedside cabinet otherwise wed hardly be here in argentina true but this man has killed children young girls anyway gutted them like pigs in the beginning i thought one of our old comrades might have developed a taste for psychopathic murder now i know its something else altogether also theres a missing girl who may or may not be connected with any of this she might be dead or abducted and you thought i might have had something to do with all this abduction used to be your main claim to fame as i recall you mean mussolini skorzeny grinned that was a rescue mission theres a hell of a difference between pulling the duces eggs out of the fire and kidnapping a bloody schoolgirl i know that all the same i felt obliged to look under every stone those are my orders anyway whos giving them i cant tell you that i like you hausner youve got guts unlike most of our old comrades here i am quietly intimidating you is that what youre doing and you refuse to be intimidated damn you so far i could go to work on those clips with these pliers he said i bet thats what theyre for as a matter of fact but it occurs to me that id rather have a man like you on my side allies men you can rely on are rather thin on the ground in this country he nodded as if agreeing with himself from the look of him and the reputation he had it was probably the safest thing to do yes i could use a good man on my side in argentina sounds like youre offering me a job otto maybe i am at that everyone wants me to work for them at this rate ill make employee of the year so long as you stay alive you might meaning i wouldnt want you shooting off your mouth about my business he said if you did id have to shoot off your mouth he said it in a way that made me think he believed it sounded cute only i didnt doubt that he was serious about it from what i knew about otto skorzenywaffenss colonel knights cross hero of the eastern front the man who rescued mussolini from british custodyit would have been a grave mistake not to take him seriously an unmarkedgrave mistake i can keep my mouth shut i said everyone can keep their mouths shut skorzeny said the trick is to do it and stay alive at the same time that was cute too the scars the knights cross the reputation for ruthlessness all of it was starting to make a lot of sense the man who put otto skorzenys nose out of joint wasnt about to get the loan of his collection of pressed wildflowers he was a killer maybe not the kind of killer who enjoyed killing for killings sake but certainly the kind who killed without even the least idea of how anyone could lose any sleep over it all right ill help you out if i can otto im not awful busy right now so go ahead pretend im your priest or your doctor tell me something confidential im looking for some money i tried to stifle a yawn small world i said not that sort of money he snarled theres a kind i dont know about yeah the kind you cant count because theres so bloody much of it serious money oh that kind of money here in argentina about two hundred million us dollars well i can understand why you would be looking for that kind of money otto maybe twice that i dont know for sure this time i stayed silent four hundred million dollars is the kind of figure that commands a lot of respectful silence during the war two maybe three or four uboats came to argentina with gold diamonds and foreign currency jew money mostly from the camps on arrival the monte cristo was handled by five german bankers germanargentines who were supposed to be financing the war effort on this side of the atlantic he shrugged i dont have to tell you how successful they were at that and most of the money remained unspent safely tucked up in vaults at the banco germanico and the banco tourquist thats a nice little legacy for someone i said now youre getting it said skorzeny after the war the perons had the same thought as you the greasy general and his bitch blonde started putting a little pressure on these five bankers suggesting that they might like to make a generous campaign contribution in return for all the traditional argentine hospitality that was being shown to our old comrades so the bankers anted up and hoped that was the end of it of course it wasnt its expensive being a dictator especially one without the same line of jewish credit that hitler enjoyed so the perons bless their black shirts asked for another contribution and this time the bankers demurred as bankers do big mistake the president started to apply a little pressure one of the bankers the eldest ludwig freude was charged with espionage and fraud freude made a deal with peron and in return for turning over the control of a nice chunk of change his son rodolfo freude was made the head of security police thats a nice quid pro quo i said isnt it heinrich dorge who was formerly an aide to hjalmar schacht was less cooperative he didnt have a son like rodolfo which was too bad for him the perons had him murdered to encourage the other three bankers von leute von bader and staudt and they were encouraged they handed over the lot the whole monte cristo since then they have remained effectively under house arrest why if the perons have the loot then whats the point of that because theres a lot more to it than the money that walked down the gangplank of a couple of uboats a lot more money anyway you see the perons have got this foundation going for the last five years evas been giving reichsbank money away to just about every argie bastard who can spin her a hardluck story theyve been buying the loyalty of the people the trouble is at the rate theyre spending the uboat cash theyre going to run out and so to stay in power for another ten maybe twenty years they would dearly like to get their hands on the real prize the big prize the motherlode you mean your four hundred million dollars isnt it we didnt lose the war for lack of money my friend at the end of the war there was so much money held in the reichsbanks swiss accounts it made what was in german banks here look like small change there are billions of nazi dollars in zurich and its all of it every last cent under the control of those three remaining bankers here in buenos aires at least it is so long as they remain alive i see for the perons the question is how to get their hands on it to exercise control of the zurich accounts requires the physical presence in switzerland of at least one of those bankers accompanied by the signed letters of the other two but which one of them can be trusted to go trusted by the perons trusted by the other bankers naturally theres no guarantee that the one who goes to zurich is ever going to come back again nor any guarantee that he will do what the perons want him to do when hes there which is of course to sign control of the money over to them it leaves these three in a bit of a tight spot and thats where i come in oh are you a banker now otto i tried to look and to sound like all this was news to me but my meeting with the von baders and the disappearance of their daughter fabienne left me in no doubt that the money and her disappearance were somehow connected more of a banking regulator you might say said skorzeny you see im here to make sure the perons never see a pfennig of that money to this end ive managed to become quite close to eva largely on account of how i managed to foil an attempt on her life well it was easy enough he chuckled especially since it was me who set her up anyway shes come to rely on me rather otto i said grinning you dont mean were not lovers exactly he admitted but like i said shes come to rely on me so who knows what might happen especially as the president is off fucking young girls oh how young thirteen fourteen sometimes younger according to eva and how is this trust in you going to manifest itself in a way thats relevant to the money in switzerland i asked carefully by making sure i can be in a position to find out if ever she manages to send one of these bankers to zurich because then i should have to act to prevent that from happening you mean kill someone one of the bankers maybe all three of them probably as i said the trust wont be under their control forever eventually the money will be dispersed to certain organizations throughout germany you see its our plan to use the money to rebuild the cause of european fascism our plan you mean the old comrades plan dont you otto the nazi plan of course and doublecrossing the perons it sounds dangerous otto it is he grinned which is why i need someone in the secret police watching my back someone like you suppose that im the nervous type suppose that i dont want to be involved that would be a shame for one thing it would mean youd have no one watching your back besides eva trusts me you she hardly knows if you denounce me youll be the one who disappears not me think it over how long have i got times up i can hardly say no can i thats the way i see it too you and me were two of a kind you see it was eva who told me about you about that little speech you made to her and the greaseball how you used to be a cop stuff like that that took a boxful of eggs peron appreciated that so do i were both mavericks you and i loners outsiders we can help each other out a phone call here a phone call there and depend on it we never forget our friends he produced a business card and placed it carefully on my bedside table on the other hand on the other hand he glanced at the picture of the british king that was hanging on the wall beside my bed for a moment he just stared at it with something like malevolence then he punched it hard hard enough to smash the glass and knock the picture off the wall the picture fell on the floor small pieces of glass showered my chest and legs skorzeny ignored them preferring to concentrate on allowing a small trickle of blood to run off his lacerated knuckles and onto my head he smiled but his meaning was less than companionable on the other hand the next time we meet this could be your blood were looking at not mine thats a nasty cut youve got there otto you should get it seen to i believe theres a good veterinary hospital over on viamonte maybe theyll even give you a rabies shot while theyre fixing your paw this skorzeny lifted his hand and let the blood drip onto my face for a moment he seemed fascinated by the sight of it maybe he was at that there were plenty of people in the ss whod been fascinated by bloodshed most of them seemed to be living in argentina this is just a scratch you know it might be a good idea if you were to leave now otto after what you did to their king this is the british hospital after all otto spat on the fallen picture i always hated that bastard he said no need to explain no need at all i was humoring him now anxious for him to be gone not from a man who once met adolf hitler more than once he said quietly really i said feigning interest the next time we see each other you must tell me all about it in fact ill look forward to it then were partners sure otto sure he held out his bloody hand for me to shake i took it and felt the strength in his forearm and closer to him now saw the dirty ice in his blue eyes and breathed the rank odor of his decaying breath there was a little gold star in his lapel i didnt know what it was but i wondered whether he would grind to a halt if i removed it like the murderous creature in gustav meyrinks the golem if only life were that simple buenos aires it was a short convalescence but not so short that i wasnt able to lie in bed and do nothing but think and after a while i managed to put some of the bits together in my mind unfortunately it was the kind of puzzle where the jigsaw was still moving and if i wasnt very careful the narrow vertical blade might slice off my fingers while i was trying to arrange the interlocking pieces or worse than that living long enough to see the whole picture might prove to be difficult yet i could hardly just put it all down and walk away i dont care for a word like retirement but that was what i wanted i was tired of solving puzzles argentina was a beautiful country i wanted to sit on the beach at mar del plata to see the regattas at tigre or visit the lakes at nahuel hupi unfortunately nobody wanted me to do what i wanted what they wanted was for me to do what they wanted and much as i wished things to be different i couldnt see a way around any of this i did however decide to attend to things according to my own idea of precedence contrary to what id told colonel montalban i did hate loose ends it had always bothered me that id never arrested anita schwarzs killer not just for the sake of my professional pride but for the sake of paul herzefeldes professional pride too so the first thing i did when i got out of the hospital was drive to the house of helmut gregor by now i had a pretty shrewd idea of who and what he was but i wanted to make sure before i threw it back in the colonels face helmut gregor lived in the nicest part of florida the house at calle arenales was a handsome spacious colonialtype white stucco mansion owned by a wealthy argentine businessman called gerard malbranc there was a pillared veranda out front and chained to the balustrade a mediumsized dog that was doing its best to ignore the tantalizing proximity of a longhaired cat that seemed to have the run of the place i staked out the house i had a flask of coffee some cognac one or two newspapers and several books in german from the durer haus bookshop i had even borrowed a small telescope it was a nice quiet street and despite my best intentions i left the books and the papers alone and slept with one eye half open one time i sat up and saw a rather handsome couple ride by on even more handsome horses they wore normal clothes and used english saddles florida wasnt the kind of neighborhood to see anything more picturesque on calle arenales a gaucho would have looked about as inconspicuous as a football on a cathedral altar another time i looked up to see a van from gath chaves delivering a bed to a woman wearing a pink silk dressing gown from the way she was dressed i had the idea she was probably planning to sleep on it the minute the two apes lifting it into her home were back in their van i wouldnt have minded joining her in the late afternoon after id been there several hours a police car showed up a policeman and a girl of about fourteen got out of the car the policeman looked old enough to be her grandfather he might have been her caballero blanco which was what portenos called a sugar daddy but uniformed cops dont usually make enough to spend it on anyone other than their fat wives and their ugly children of course he might actually have been a father taking his stunningly attractive young daughter to an appointment with the family doctor but for the fact that most fathers dont usually put their daughters in handcuffs not unless theyve been very bad indeed the dog started to bark as they mounted the steps to the front door the cop patted the dogs head it stopped barking through the telescope i watched the polished black front door it was opened by a man wearing a lightcolored tweed suit his hair was dark and he had a short errol flynnstyle mustache he and the policeman seemed to know each other the man from the house smiled to reveal a noticeable gap between the two front teeth on his upper jaw then he placed an avuncular hand on the girls shoulder and spoke kindly to her the girl who had seemed nervous until now was reassured the man pointed at the handcuffs and the cop took them off the girl rubbed her wrists and then put her thumbnail between her teeth she had long brown hair and skin the color of honey she was wearing a red corduroy dress and redandblack stockings her knees touched when she talked and when she smiled it was like the sun coming out from behind a cloud the man from the house ushered the girl inside looked at the cop and pointed after her as if inviting him in too the cop shook his head the man went inside the door closed and the cop went to sit in the car where he smoked a cigarette tipped his cap forward folded his arms and went to sleep i glanced at my wristwatch it was two oclock ninety minutes passed before the door opened again the man from the house followed the girl onto the veranda he picked up the cat and showed it off to her the girl stroked the cats head and put some candy in her mouth the man put the cat down and they went down the steps the girl was moving more slowly than before coming down the steps as if each one were several feet high i looked through the telescope again her head hung heavy on her shoulders but not as heavy as her eyelids she looked like shed been drugged several paces ahead of her the man tapped the window of the police car and the cop sat bolt upright as if something sharp had come through the bottom of his seat the man opened the rear passenger door of the car and turned to see where the girl was and saw that she had stopped walking altogether although she was hardly standing still she resembled a tree that was about to topple her face was pale and her eyes were closed and she was breathing deeply through her nose in an effort not to faint the man went back to her and put his arm around her waist the next thing she bent forward and vomited into the gutter the man looked around for the cop and said something sharply the cop came over collected the girl up in his arms and laid her on the backseat of the car he closed the door took off his cap wiped his brow with a handkerchief and said something to the man who bent forward waved at the prostrate girl through the car window and then stood back and waited he looked around he looked in my direction i was about thirty yards up the street i didnt think he could see me he didnt the police car started the man waved again as it drove off and then he turned and went back up to the house i folded away the telescope and returned it to the glove box i swallowed a mouthful of cognac from the flask in my pocket and got out of the car i collected a file and notepad off the passenger seat shifted my shoulder holster a few inches rubbed the stilltender scar on my collarbone and walked up the steps the dog started barking again sitting on the white balustrade the cat which was the size and shape of a feather duster viewed me with verticaleyed scrutiny it was a minor demon the familiar to its diabolic owner i hauled on the doorbell heard a chime that sounded like something from a clock tower and gazed back across the street the woman in the pink dressing gown was getting dressed now i was still watching when the door opened behind me you certainly couldnt miss the postman i said speaking german not with a bell like that it lasts as long as a heavenly choir i showed him my id i wonder if i might come in and ask you a few questions a strong smell of ether hung in the air underscoring the obvious inconvenience of my visit but helmut gregor was a german and a german knew better than to argue with credentials like mine the gestapo no longer existed but the idea and influence of the gestapo lived on in the minds of all germans old enough to know the difference between wedding rings and a set of brass knuckles especially in argentina youd better come in he said standing politely to one side herr hausner i said carlos hausner a german working for central state intelligence thats rather unusual isnt it oh i dont know there was a time when we were quite good at this sort of thing he smiled thinly and closed the door we were standing in a highceilinged hallway with a marble floor i had a brief glimpse of what looked like a surgery at the far end of that hallway before gregor closed the frosted door in front of it he paused as if half inclined to force me to ask my questions in the hallway then he seemed to change his mind and led the way into an elegant sitting room beneath an ornate gilt mirror was an elegant stone fireplace and in front of this a hardwood chinese tea table and a couple of handsome leather armchairs he waved me to one of them i sat down and glanced around on a sideboard was a collection of silver mate gourds and on the table in front of us a copy of the free press which was the nazileaning germanlanguage daily on another table was a photograph of a man wearing plusfours riding a bicycle another photograph showed a man wearing white tie and tails on his wedding day in neither of these two photographs did the man have a mustache and this made it easier for me to remember him as the man id met on the steps of dr kassners berlin house back in the summer of the man hed called beppo the man who was now calling himself helmut gregor apart from the mustache he didnt look so very different he was not quite forty and his hair was still thick and dark brown and without a hint of gray he wasnt smiling but his mouth remained slightly open his lip curled like a dog getting ready to growl or to bite his eyes were different from how i remembered them they were like the cats eyes wary and watchful and full of nine lives worth of dark secrets im sorry for disturbing your lunch i pointed at a glass of milk and a sandwich that lay uneaten on a silver tray on the floor next to the leg of his chair at the same time i wondered if the milk and the sandwich might have been meant for his young female visitor thats all right what can i do for you i rattled off the usual spiel about the argentine passport and the goodconduct pass and how everything was nothing more than a formality because i was exss myself and knew the score hearing this he asked me about my war service and after id supplied the edited version that left out my time with the german war crimes bureau he seemed to relax a little like a fishing line slackening after several minutes in the water i was also in russia he said with the medical corps of the viking division and in particular at the battle of rostow i heard it was tough there i offered it was tough everywhere i opened the file i had brought with me helmut gregors file if i could just check a few basic details certainly you were born on march in gunzburg i shook my head its somewhere on the danube thats as much as i know about it im from berlin myself no wait a minute there was someone i knew who was from gunzburg a fellow named pieck walter pieck he was in the ss too at dachau concentration camp i think it was perhaps you knew him yes his father was the local police chief we knew each other slightly before the war but i was never at dachau i was never at any concentration camp as i said i was in the viking division of the waffenss and what did your own father do in gunzburg he soldstill sellsfarm machinery threshing machines that kind of thing all very ordinary but i believe hes still the towns largest employer im sorry i said pen poised ive missed a question name of father and mother please is this really necessary its normal on most passport applications he nodded karl and walburga mengele walburga thats an unusual name yes isnt it walburga was an english saint who lived and died in germany i assume youve heard of walpurgis night on the first of may thats when her relics were transferred to some church or other i thought that was some kind of witches sabbath i believe its also that he said and you are josef any brothers or sisters two brothers alois and karl junior i wont keep you much longer dr mengele i smiled i prefer dr gregor yes of course im sorry now then where was it that you qualified why is this relevant youre still practicing as a doctor arent you i should say it was highly relevant yes yes of course im sorry its just that im not used to answering so many questions truthfully ive spent the last five years being someone else im sure you know what thats like i certainly do now perhaps you understand why it is that the argentine government asked me to carry out this task because im a german and an ss man just like you in order that you and our other old comrades could be put at ease about the whole process you can see that cant you yes it makes quite a lot of sense when you think about it i shrugged on the other hand if you dont want to have an argentine passport we can stop this right now i shook my head i mean it certainly wont make me itch as the saying goes please do carry on i frowned as if thinking of something else i insist he added no its just that ive got a feeling weve met before i dont think so im sure i would have remembered in berlin wasnt it the summer of in the summer of i was in munich yes surely you remember it was at the home of another doctor dr richard kassner on donhoffplatz i dont recall knowing a dr kassner i unbuttoned my coat so that i could treat his eyes to a little taste of the gun i was wearing just in case he thought to try something surgical on me like trepanning a little hole in my head with a pistol because by now i had no doubt he was armed there was something heavier than a packet of cigarettes in one of his coat pockets i didnt know exactly what mengele had done during the war the only thing i knew was what eichmann had told me that mengele had done something bestial at auschwitz and for this reason he was one of the most wanted men in europe come now surely you remember what was it he used to call you biffo wasnt it no wait a minute it was bippo whatever happened to kassner i really think youre mistaking me for someone else if you dont mind me saying so this was eighteen years ago no its all coming back to me now you see herr doktor mengelebeppoi was a policeman in working for the homicide division in berlin kripo a detective investigating the murder of anita schwarz do you remember her perhaps he crossed his legs coolly no look this is all very confusing i think i need a cigarette his hand went into the pocket but i was quicker uhuh i said and holding the smith wesson just a few inches above his belly i smacked his hand out of his coat pocket and then took out a walnuthandled ppk i glanced at it briefly it was a thirtyeight with a nazi eagle on the grip not very clever of you i said keeping something like this youre the one whos not being very clever he said i pocketed the pistol and sat down again oh hows that because im a friend of the president is that so i advise you to put that gun away and leave now not before weve had a little talk mengele about old times i thumbed back the hammer on the smith and if i dont like the answers then im going to have to offer you a prompt in the foot and then in the leg im sure you know how it works doctor a socratic dialogue socratic yes i encourage you to reflect and to think and togetheri waved the gun at himtogether we search for the truth to some important questions no philosophical training is needed but if i think youre not trying to help us reach a consensuswell you remember what happened to socrates dont you his fellow athenians forced him to put a gun to his head and blow his own brains out something like that anyway why on earth do you care what happened to anita schwarz mengele asked angrily it was almost twenty years ago not just anita schwarz elizabeth bremer too the girl in munich it wasnt what you think he insisted no what was it then dadaism i seem to remember that was quite popular before the nazis lets see now you eviscerated those two girls because you were an artist who believed in meaning through chaos you used their insides for a collage or perhaps a nice photograph there were you and max ernst and kurt schwitters no how about this then you were a medical student who decided to make a bit of extra money by offering backstreet abortions to underage girls its the details im not clear about the when and the how if i tell you will you leave me alone if you dont tell me im going to shoot you i took aim at his foot then ill leave you alone to bleed to death all right all right lets start in munich with elizabeth bremer mengele shook his head until seeing me take aim at his foot again he waved his hands no no im just trying to cast my mind back but its difficult so much has happened since then youve no idea how irrelevant all this seems to a man like me youre talking about two accidental deaths that happened almost twenty years ago he laughed bitterly i was at auschwitz you know and what happened there was of course quite extraordinary perhaps the most extraordinary thing that has ever happened three million died at auschwitz three million and you just want to talk about two children im not here to judge you im here to finish an investigation listen to yourself you sound like one of those stupid canadian cowboys what is it that they call them the mounties they always get their man is that really all this is professional pride or is there something else im missing im asking the questions doctor but as it happens there is some professional pride here yes im sure you know what thats like you being a professional man yourself i got taken off this case for political reasons because i wasnt a nazi i didnt like that then and i dont like it now so lets start with walter pieck you knew him quite well didnt you from gunzburg of course everyone knows everyone else in gunzburg its a very catholic little town walter and i were at school together at least until he failed his abitur he was always more interested in sports especially winter sports he was a fantastic skater and skier and i should know im a good skier myself anyway he quarreled with his father and went to work in munich i passed my abitur and went to study in munich we lived very separate lives but occasionally we would meet up for a beer i even lent him a bit of money now and then my family was quite wealthy by the standards of gunzburg even today gunzburg is the mengele family but my father karl was a cold figure and somewhat jealous of me i think for this reason perhaps he kept me short of money when i was at medical school and i resolved to earn some extra myself it so happened that another old friends girl was pregnant and having already studied quite a bit on the subject of obstetrics and gynecology as a student i offered to help them get rid of it actually its quite a simple procedure before long id carried out several abortions i made quite a bit of money i bought a small car with the proceeds then walters girlfriend got pregnant elizabeth was a lovely girl too good for walter anyway she was adamant that she didnt want to keep the child she wanted to go to university and study medicine herself mengele frowned and shook his head i thought i was helping her but there were complications a hemorrhage even in a hospital bed she would probably have died you understand but this was in my apartment in munich and i had no way of helping her she bled to death on my kitchen table he paused for a moment and almost looked troubled at the memory of it you must remember i was still a young man with my whole future ahead of me i wanted to help people as a doctor you understand anyway i panicked i had a dead body on my hands and it would have been quite obvious to any pathologist that she had had an abortion i was desperate to cover my tracks it was walters idea really that i should remove all her sexual organs there had been some lurid details of an old lust murder in some magazine hed been reading and he said that if we made elizabeths death look like one of those it would at least ensure the police did not come looking for an illegal abortionist i agreed so i cut her up like something out of an anatomy lesson and walter disposed of her body his father in gunzburg gave him an alibi said hed been at home at the time of elizabeths death he was used to doing that for walter but after that walter had to toe the line do what his father told him which is how he ended up joining the ss to keep him out of trouble mengele laughed ironic really when you think about it the americans shot him at dachau he shook his head but i certainly didnt mean to kill that poor girl she was lovely a real aryan beauty i was trying to help her and why not she made a mistake thats all it happens all the time and to the most respectable people tell me about kassner i said how did you know him from munich his estranged wife lived there he was trying to persuade her to come back to him unsuccessfully as it turned out someone introduced us at a party and it turned out we shared a number of interests in anthropology in human genetics in medical research and in national socialism he was a friend of goebbels you know anyway i used to go and visit him in berlin to spend in the fleshpots some of what id been making from carrying out abortions they were the best times of my life im sure i dont have to tell you what berlin was like in those days there was complete sexual license which is how you caught a dose of jelly yes thats right how did you know about that and kassner treated you with the new magic bullet he was testing for i g farben protonsil mengele looked impressed yes thats right too i can see that the reputation of the berlin police force was well deserved he was also treating goebbels for venereal disease did you know that i suspect its one of the reasons i was taken off the case because someone thought that i might find out about it which i did of course i knew he was treating someone famous but i didnt know it was goebbels actually i thought it might be hitler there was some talk you know that the fuhrer was syphilitic so it was goebbels all along mengele shrugged anyway protonsil was highly effective until the advent of penicillin i think it was the most successful drug that the dyestuff syndicate ever had i got to know them quite well myself when kassner went to work for them i tested a number of drugs for them at auschwitz it was important work not that anyone remembers that now all theyre interested in are the medical mishaps that im afraid were an inevitable consequence given the exigencies of wartime scientific and medical life thats a nice clinical way of describing mass murder i said and i suppose youre here in argentina for the beef he said never mind that just tell me about anita schwarz i cant believe that youre wasting my time with this shit if you cant believe me then believe this i brandished the gun for a second how did you come to meet her i met her father when i started coming to berlin he was in the sa later on when he became a judge we became much better acquainted anyway someone introduced us kurt daluege i think i had performed an abortion on his mistress with no complications actually it was her second and i had asked daluege if hed ever considered the advantages of having her sterilized he hadnt of course but he talked her into it eventually youre joking not at all its simply a question of tying off the fallopian tubes anyway daluege mentioned this to otto schwarz as a possibility for his daughter i shook my head horrified at what mengele was telling me although given what i remembered about otto schwarzs general demeanor upon being told that his disabled daughter was dead the doctors explanation also seemed to make perverse sense are you telling me that you sterilized a fifteenyearold girl look here this girl was hardly the same type as elizabeth bremer not at all anita schwarz was disabled and despite her young age an occasional prostitute it made a lot of sense to have her sterilized not just for the benefit of her poor parents but also for the genetic health of the country she was quite unfit to reproduce later on of course otto and i were colleagues he became a judge in one of the genetichealth courts that came into being under the law for the prevention of genetically diseased offspring to decide upon matters of racial hygiene certain people were forbidden to marry while others were the victims of forcible sterilizations he paused so the sterilization of anita schwarz was cooked up by the two of you for the genetic health of the country i said did anita have any say in the matter mengele shook his head irritably her consent was irrelevant she was spastic you understand hers was an unworthy life any genetichealth court would have agreed with our decision where did the operation take place in a private clinic in dahlem where the girls mother worked as a night nurse it was quite suitable i can assure you but something went wrong he nodded unlike carrying out an abortion a general anesthetic is required in sterilization procedures and so the services of an anesthesiologist were needed naturally i called on the same person id used in the procedure on kurt dalueges mistress someone daluege knew someone less than competent as it turned out i was unaware of the fact that he himself was a drug addict and he made a mistake you understand it was not the procedure that killed her it was the anesthesia quite simply we were unable to revive her and left with a dilemma similar to the one before with elizabeth bremers death in munich i decided to mutilate her dead body in the same sensational fashion with i may add the full complicity of the girls mother she was a strict roman catholic and believed that god had not meant her daughter to have lived in the first place which was a great relief to my colleague and myself he and i disposed of the body at the opposite end of the city in friedrichshain park and the rest you know and after that i went home i meant in the years after that up to you joining the ss i carried on doing abortions and sterilizations until legally i might add then i joined the reich institute for heredity biology and racial purity at the university of frankfurt where i was a research assistant and now now i live a very quiet life i am a humble doctor as you can see not so humble i think tell me about the girl who was here half an hour ago i suppose you just polished her toenails and combed her hair you are way out of your depth hausner thats all right im a good swimmer youll have to be you know what they do with the people they dont like in argentina they take them for a plane ride and push them out over the river plate at ten thousand feet listen to me man forget you ever saw that girl i put the gun down and sprang forward gathering his cashmere coat lapels in one hand and then slapping him hard on each side of his astonished swarthy faceforehand and backhand like a pingpong champion when i want to listen to you ill slap you first i said now lets have the rest of it every rotten detail of your filthy work in this city you got that i want it all or ill show you the real meaning of an unworthy life i pushed him back down on the chair and let go of his lapels mengeles eyes were cold and narrow now like small stones in a snowball his face was pale except where the palm and back of my hand had crimsoned his cheeks he put his hand on his jaw and snarled an answer back at me like a cowed dog peron has a taste for young girls he said twelve thirteen fourteen virgins and none who are using contraception any more than he does he likes the tightness of a young girl because his penis is so small im telling you that because just knowing it in a country like this will get you killed hausner he told me this when we first met and since july of last year when i came to argentina ive carried out as many as thirty abortions for him and grete wohlauf whos she a fifteenyearold girl in the police morgue i dont know their names he said but i can tell you this none of these girls has died im good at what i do now i didnt doubt it everyone has a skill in life destroying life was his fabienne von bader what about her as i said i dont know their names for some reason i believed him you know im not the only one he said the only german doctor doing this i mean being an ss doctor is an attractive combination for the general it means that unlike the local catholic doctors who have scruples about carrying out abortions we have to do what were told or risk being sent back to face allied justice so thats why he likes to meet doctors from germany yes and that means im important to him that im serving his needs can you say the same mengele smiled no i thought not youre just a stupid policeman with a taste for the sentimental you wont last long here these people are just as ruthless as we germans perhaps more so you see theyre easier to understand its money and power that motivates them not ideology not hatred not history just money and power i showed him the smith in my fist dont be so sure im not as ruthless as they are im liable to shoot you in the stomach and then sit back to watch you die just for the hell of it you would probably call that an experiment maybe i will shoot you at that theyd probably give me the nobel prize for medicine right now however youre going to find a pen and paper and then youre going to write out everything you just told me including the part about the presidents taste in young girls and the useful cleaningup service you provide for him afterward and then youre going to sign it with pleasure said mengele ill be signing your death warrant before you die i think im going to visit you in your cell ill make sure to bring my medical bag perhaps ill remove one of your organs while youre still alive until then i said youll do what i tell you and smile while youre doing it or ill want to know why i slapped him again just for the pleasure of it i could have slapped him all afternoon he was that kind of guy some people just bring out the worst in me he wrote out the confession i read it and put it in my pocket since youre in a confessional mood i said i have one more question for you i brought the gun nearer his face and remember im in the mood to use this so youd better answer carefully what do you know about directive eleven all i know is that it was something to do with preventing displaced jews from coming here he shrugged thats it i reached into my pocket and took out the little chai necklace anna yagubsky had given to me i let it spin in the light for a moment i could see that he recognized what it was that was a neat trick ripping their guts out like that so as to put us off the scent i said but youre not the only one who can do that kind of thing if i have to shoot you ill leave this little chai near your body chai is a hebrew word that means life the police will find it and assume that one of those israeli murder squads caught up with you they wont look for me mengele so im going to ask you just one more time what do you know about directive eleven mengele had gripped the underside of his chair still holding it tightly he leaned forward and yelled at me i dont know anything else about it i dont know anything else i dont know anything else then his head fell onto his chest and he started to weep i dont know anything else he sobbed ive told you all i know i stood up slightly horrified at this outburst and the way id suddenly reduced him to the level of a schoolboy it was odd i felt only disgust with him but what was odder still was the disgust i now felt with myself at the darkness that dwelt within me at the darkness that dwells within us all buenos aires i got up at six just like always had a bath and then ate some breakfast the lloyds served something called a full english breakfast two fried eggs two strips of bacon a sausage a tomato some mushrooms and toast i certainly felt full by the time id finished every time i ate one i came away with the same thought it was hard to believe anyone could have fought a war on a breakfast like that i went outside to buy some cigarettes i paid no attention to the car that overtook me until it stopped and two doors opened it was a black ford sedan with nothing to indicate that it was a police car unless you counted the two men with dark glasses and matching mustaches who sprang out and walked swiftly toward me id seen them before in berlin in munich and in vienna all over the world they were always the same thickset men with thickset brains and thickset knuckles and they had the same practical and dynamic manner regarding me as if i were an embarrassing piece of furniture to be moved as quickly as possible to the backseat of the black car id been removed before many times when i was a private detective in berlin it had been a kind of occupational hazard the gestapo never much liked private bulls even though himmler had once used a munich firm to find out if his brotherinlaw was cheating on his sister instinctively i turned to avoid them and came up against thickset number three i was searched and inside the car before i drew my next nervous breath nobody said anything except me it kept my mind off the road ahead and the speed at which we were now moving you boys are good i said look here i dont suppose it would do any good to mention that my side credentials are in my breast pocket no i guess not we headed south toward san telmo i made a few more cracks in castellano which got ignored and after a while i gave in to their thickset silence the car turned west near the ministry of war at sixteen stories with two separate wings it was the thickestset building in buenos aires and it dominated the surrounding area like the great pyramid of cheops from the look of it things hardly augured well for neighboring countries like chile and uruguay after a while we came to a pleasant little park and behind this a castellated fortress that looked as if it had been there since francisco pizarro had come to south america as we drove through the main wooden gate i almost expected the car to be hit with boulders and boiling oil poured on us from the battlements we parked and i was hustled outside of the car and down some steps in the courtyard at the end of a long damp corridor i was placed in a short damp cell searched by a man who was almost as big as the thickset ministry of war and then left alone with a chair a wooden bunk and a chamber pot for company the pot was half full or half empty depending on the way you look at these things i sat on the floor which looked more comfortable than the chair or the bunk and waited in some faraway ratinfested tower a man was laughing hysterically nearer to where i was being held water was trickling noisily onto a floor and not being particularly thirsty i hardly minded the sound but after several hours had elapsed i started to feel differently about it it was dusk when the door finally opened again two men came into my cell they had their sleeves rolled up as if they meant business one was small and muscular and the other was large and muscular the smaller one held what looked like a walking stick made of metal with a twopin electric plug on the end the larger one held me i struggled against him but he didnt seem to notice i didnt see his face it was somewhere above the cloud line the smaller one had tiny blue eyes like semiprecious stones welcome to caseros he said with mock politeness outside there is a little monument to the victims of the yellowfever outbreak in the deepest dungeon of this fortress is a pit where the bodies were thrown every year there are more and more victims of the yellowfever outbreak understand i think so youve been asking questions about directive eleven have i i should like to know why that is and what you think you know so far i know very little possibly it precedes directive twelve and i wouldnt be at all surprised if someone one day discovered that it followed directive ten how am i doing so far not very well youre german yes i nodded the country of beethoven and goethe printing and xrays aspirin and the rocket engine dont forget the hindenburg i said you must feel very proud in argentina we have given the modern world only one invention he lifted his metal stick the electric cattle prod it speaks for itself does it not the device emits a strong bolt of electricity sufficient to move a cow wherever one wants it to go on average a cow weighs about two thousand pounds ten times as much as you perhaps but this is still a highly effective means of shocking the animal into submission so you can imagine the effect it will have on a human being at least i hope you can imagine it while im asking my next question ill certainly try my best i said he rolled up one sleeve to reveal an arm covered in a shocking amount of hair somewhere in argentina there was a freak show missing its missing link the frayed cuff of the sleeve went all the way up the arm to the crescent of sweat underneath his armpit before he stopped rolling probably he didnt want to get anything on his shirt at the very least he looked like a man who took his work seriously i should like to know the name of the person who told you about directive eleven it was someone at the casa rosada one of my colleagues i suppose i dont remember who exactly look one hears all kinds of talk in a place like that the small hairy man tore open the body of my shirt to reveal the scar on my collarbone he tapped it with his filthiest fingernail aiee youve had an operation forgive me i didnt know what was the matter with you i had half of my thyroid removed why it was cancerous he nodded almost sympathetic its healing nicely then he touched the scar with the end of the cattle prod fortunately for me it was not yet switched on normally we concentrate on the genitals but in your case i think we might make an exception he jerked his head at the big man holding me a moment or two later i was tied securely to the chair in my cell the name of the person who told you about directive eleven please he said i tried to put anna yagubskys name to the farthest corner of my mind i wasnt worried that id reveal that she was the person whod told me about directive eleven but id seen the way pain can jolt words out of a man i hated to think what a pair like this would do to a woman like her so i started telling myself that the person whod told me about directive eleven was marcello the duty officer in the records department at the casa rosada just in case i had to say something i shook my head look honestly i dont remember it was weeks ago there were several of us talking in the records department it could have been anyone but he wasnt listening here he said let me help jog your memory he touched my knee with the cattle prod and this time it was switched on even through the material of my trousers the pain shifted me and the chair several feet along the floor and left my leg jerking uncontrollably for several minutes feels nice doesnt it he said and youre going to think that was just a tickle when i put it on your bare flesh im laughing already then the joke is on you im afraid he came at me again with the cattle prod aiming it squarely at the scar on my collarbone for a split second i had a vision of the remains of my thyroid sizzling inside my throat like a piece of fried liver then a voice i recognized said thats enough i think it was colonel montalban untie him there were no words of protest certainly none from me my two wouldbe tormentors obeyed instantly almost as if they had expected to be stopped montalban himself lit a cigarette and put it in my grateful trembling mouth am i glad to see you i said come on he said quietly lets get out of this place resisting the temptation to say something to the man with the cattle prod i followed the colonel outside into the fortress courtyard where a nice white jaguar was parked i drew a deep breath that was a mixture of relief and exhilaration he opened the trunk and took out a neatly folded shirt and a tie that i half recognized here he said i brought you these from your hotel room that was very thoughtful of you colonel i said unbuttoning the ragged remains of the shirt i was almost wearing dont mention it he said climbing into the drivers seat always a nice car colonel i said getting in beside him this car belonged to an admiral who was plotting a coup detat he said can you imagine an admiral owning such a car he lit a cigarette for himself and drove out of the gate where is he now the admiral he disappeared perhaps he is in paraguay perhaps he is in chile then again perhaps he is nowhere in particular but then again sometimes it is best not to ask such a question you understand i think so but whos minding the navy truly the only safe questions to ask in argentina are the questions one asks of oneself that is why there are so many psychoanalysts in this country we drove east toward the river plate are there many psychoanalysts in this country oh yes a great many there is more psychoanalysis done here in buenos aires than almost anywhere else in the world no one in argentina thinks himself so perfect that he cant be improved take you for instance a little psychoanalysis might help you to stay out of trouble thats what i thought anyway thats why i arranged for you to see two of the best men in the city so that you might understand yourself and your relationship to society and to appreciate what i told you before that in argentina it is better to know everything than to know too much of course my men are better than most at helping a man to understand himself fewer sessions are required sometimes only one and of course they work much more cheaply than the kind of freudian analysts most people go to see but the results im sure youll agree are much more spectacular its rare that anyone comes out of a session at caseros without a profound sense of what is needed to survive in a city like this yes yes i do believe that this city will kill you unless psychologically you are equipped to deal with it i hope im not being too cryptic here not at all colonel i understand you perfectly youll find a hip flask in the glove box he said sometimes therapy gives a man a keen thirst for more than just selfknowledge there was cognac in the flask it tasted just fine it gave me more breathing space as if someone had opened a window i offered him the flask he shook his head and grinned youre a nice guy gunther i wouldnt want anything to happen to you ive told you before you used to be a real hero of mine in life a man should have a hero dont you think so thats sweet of you colonel rodolfothats rodolfo freude the head of side he thinks my belief in your abilities is irrational and perhaps it is but hes not a real policeman like us gunther he doesnt understand what it takes to be a great detective im not so sure i understand that myself colonel then i shall tell you to be a great detective one must also be a protagonist a dynamic sort of character who makes things happen just by being himself i think you are this kind of a person gunther in chess wed call that a gambit usually it involves the sacrifice of a pawn or a knight yes that is quite possible also i laughed youre an interesting man colonel a trifle eccentric but interesting and dont think i dont appreciate your confidence in me because i do appreciate it almost as much as your booze and your cigarettes i took his packet and lit another good because i should hate to think you needed a second session of therapy in caseros it was evening the shops were closing and the clubs were opening all over the city people were getting depressed that they were so far away from the rest of the civilized world i knew how they felt on one side was the ocean and on the other the vast emptiness of the pampas we were all of us surrounded by nothing with nowhere else to go perhaps most people just resigned themselves to that just as they had in nazi germany i was different saying one thing and thinking another was second nature to me i get the picture colonel i told him id click my heels and salute if i wasnt sitting down i sipped some more cognac from now on this horse is wearing blinkers and a tongue strap i pointed through the windscreen theres the road ahead and nothing else i uttered a wry little laugh as if id learned a hard lesson the colonel seemed pleased by this admission now youre getting it he said im only sorry that it cost you a shirt to find that out i can buy a new shirt colonel i said still affecting craven acquiescence a new skin is harder to come by you wont need to warn me again ive no desire to wind up in that morgue of yours speaking of which the girl grete wohlauf im not sure ive found her killer but i certainly found the man who killed those two girls in germany and you were right hes living here in buenos aires as i said i cant be sure he had anything to do with grete wohlaufs death or that he knows anything about fabienne von bader but i wouldnt be at all surprised since hes pursuing the same trade in illegal abortions he was back then his name is josef mengele but hes living here as helmut gregor but i expect you already knew that anyway you can read all about it in a statement i persuaded him to write i have it hidden in my hotel room colonel montalban put his hand inside his breast pocket and took out the envelope containing mengeles handwritten confession do you mean this statement it certainly looks like it naturally when you were arrested we searched your room at the san martin naturally and i suppose youre going to destroy that now on the contrary im going to keep it in a very safe place there may come a time when it could be very useful you mean in getting rid of mengele hes small fry no i mean in getting rid of peron this is a very catholic country herr gunther even an electorate thats bought and paid for might find it hard to vote for a president whos used a nazi war criminal to carry out illegal abortions on juvenile girls with whom hes been having sex of course i hope i shant need this statement but placed somewhere safe it becomes a very useful insurance policy for a man such as myself in a very uncertain profession its the best thing for having job security that there is for some time now ive suspected something like this was going on only i couldnt connect any of it with peron that is until you came along but how could you possibly know he was the man i was after in i asked ive only just worked it out myself a month or two after mengele arrived in argentina a box of papers arrived from germany addressed to helmut gregor here in buenos aires these were mengeles own research files from his time at the race and resettlement office in berlin and at auschwitz it seems that the doctor was unwilling to part with his lifes work and reasoning that he was safe here he had all of his papers shipped on to him from someone in his hometown of gunzburg not just his research files there was also an ss file and a gestapo file for some reason his gestapo file contained your kripo files the ones i gave to you when you first started working for me it would seem that someone tried to reopen the schwarz case during the war tried and failed because someone higher up in the ss was protecting him an ss colonel called kassner who had also worked for i g farben anyway mengele never received any of his papers he believes they were destroyed when a cargo hold in the ship bringing them from germany was accidentally flooded in fact the files were intercepted by my men before they came into my hands i had had my suspicions about who helmut gregor really was and that he was carrying out illegal abortions here in buenos aires i suspected peron was sending him young girls hed impregnated but i couldnt prove anything i didnt dare not even when one of perons fruta inmadurathats what he calls his younger girlfriendsturned up dead her name was grete wohlauf and she had died from an infection sustained during an abortion procedure when mengeles papers turned up i realized that he had been the man you were looking for and i decided to awaken your interest in the case in a way that might be to my advantage so i had the pathologist mutilate her in order to prick your curiosity but why didnt you just level with me because it didnt suit my purpose mengele is protected by peron you managed to sidestep that protection i couldnt do what you have done not and keep perons confidence as you said yourself you were my gambit herr gunther when i heard that perons men had arrested you and taken you to caseros i was able to exercise some influence in another quarter and have you released but not before teaching you a lesson as ive told you before asking questions about directive eleven is not a good idea that much i know and fabienne von bader is she really missing oh yes have you found any trace of her no but im beginning to understand why shes disappeared her father has part control of the reichsbanks swiss bank accounts and the perons are keen to get their hands on that money its my guess that the von baders have hidden her for her own protection so that the perons cant use the girl to make her father do what they want him to do something like that anyway the colonel smiled as always its a little bit more complicated than that oh how much more complicated i think youre about to find out buenos aires the colonel drove past the ministry of labor where as usual a long line of people was already waiting to see evita and then around the corner where he stopped the car in front of an anonymouslooking door id been turning over in my mind what hed told me about mengele and as we got out of the car i told him i thought id probably wasted a lot of time speaking to old comrades which with a little careful direction from him could have been more usefully spent elsewhere we have a saying it takes more than one dead mouse to make a good cat in front of the door he took a bunch of keys out of his pocket unlocked it and then ushered me inside when i intercepted mengeles private papers it reminded me of how little we actually know about all the exnazis who have come to argentina peron may care nothing about what any of you did during the war but that could hardly be good enough for me after all its my job to know about people so i decided it was high time that we started gathering intelligence on all our guest workers i decided that you were our best means of obtaining it he closed the door behind us and we walked up a quiet marble stairway the handrail was sticky with wood polish and the marble floor as white and shiny as a string of freshwater pearls on the firstfloor landing was a picture of evita she was wearing a blue dress with white spots a large pink tea rose on her shoulder a rubyanddiamond necklace and a matching rubyanddiamond smile at some stage relations with the united states will have to improve if argentina is to recover the economic wealth we enjoyed a decade ago said the colonel for that to happen it may be politic eventually to ask some of our more notorious immigrants to go and live somewhere else paraguay for example paraguay is a lawless primitive country where even the worst animals can live quite openly so you see all this time you have been doing this country a great service for which one dayone day soon i suspectwe will have cause to thank you i feel patriotic already hold on to that feeling youre going to need it when you meet evita the woman is the most patriotic person i know is that where were going yes and by the way you remember how i mentioned that when i heard that perons men had arrested you and taken you to caseros i was able to exercise some influence in another quarter and have you released evita is that quarter she is your new protector it might be a good idea to remember that colonel montalban paused in front of a heavy wooden door on the other side was what sounded like a beehive he looked me up and down and handed me a comb i ran it quickly through my hair and gave it back if id known i was going to meet the presidents wife tonight id have spent the day shopping for a new suit i said maybe even had a bath believe me she will hardly notice how you smell not in this place he opened the door and we entered a woodpaneled room about the size of a tennis court at the far end was another larger painting of evita she was wearing a blue dress and smiling at a group of children behind her head was a bright light and if i hadnt known better id have said she had a husband called joseph and a son who was a carpenter the room was full of people and the smell of their unwashed bodies some of them were disabled some were pregnant most looked poor all of them were quite certain that the woman they were hoping to see was nothing less than the madonna of buenos aires la dama de la esperanza there was no pushing or jostling for position however each of them had a ticket and from time to time an official would come into that room and announce a number this was the cue for an unmarried mother a homeless family or a crippled orphan to come forward and be received into the holy presence i followed the colonel into the room beyond here there was a long mahogany table against one wall on it were three telephones and four vases of calla lilies there was a goldsilkcovered sofa and three matching chairs and four secretaries holding pads and pencils or a telephone or an envelope full of money evita herself stood next to the window which was open to let out some of the smell of unwashed bodies this was more noticeable than in the big antechamber because it was a smaller room she was wearing a dovegray robestyle dress with a tied waist on her lapel was a brooch made of small sapphires and diamonds in the shape and colors of the argentine national flag i reflected it was probably fortunate that she wasnt the wife of the president of germany theres not much a jeweler can do with black yellow and red on the ring finger of her left hand was a seaanemonesized diamond ring with its brother and sister on her little ears on her head was a rubystudded gray silk beret that was more lucrezia borgia than holy mother she didnt look particularly ill not nearly as ill as the skeletal woman and the skeletal child who were each kissing one of evitas ungloved hands evita handed the woman a folded wad of fiftypeso notes if otto skorzeny was right some nazi loot had just found its way into the deserving hands of the argentine poor and i didnt know whether to laugh or cry as a means of preventing the democratic overthrow of a government this touching scene lacked the symbolism of setting fire to parliament but on the surface it looked every bit as effective the apostles themselves could not have handled this kind of charity with any greater efficiency a photographer from a peronist newspaper took a picture of the scene and it seemed unlikely he would leave out of the frame the enormous painting of christ washing the feet of his disciples that was behind evitas shoulder out of the corner of his blue eye the carpenter seemed to be regarding his pupil and her good works with some approval this is my beloved daughter in whom i am well pleased dont vote for anyone else evita caught the colonels eye still full of effusive thanks the skeletal woman and child were led outside evita turned smartly on her heel and went through a door at the back of the room the colonel and i went after her she closed the door behind us we were in a room with a hand basin a dressing table a rail of clothes and only one chair evita took it among the makeup and the many bottles of perfume and hairspray was a photograph of peron she picked it up and kissed it which made me think that otto skorzeny was fooling himself if he thought this woman would ever risk having an affair with a scarfaced thug like him very impressive i said jerking my head at the door behind me she sighed and shook her head it is nothing not nearly enough we try but the poor are always with us id heard this somewhere before all the same your work must give you a lot of satisfaction some but i take no pride in it i am nothing a grasa a common person the work is its own reward besides none of what i give is from me it all belongs to peron he is the true saint not me you see i dont regard this as charity charity humiliates what happens out there is social aid a welfare state nothing more nothing less i handle its dispensation personally because i know what its like to be at the mercy of bureaucracy in this country and i dont trust anyone else to do it there is too much corruption in our public institutions she tried to stifle a yawn so i come here every night and i do it myself especially important to me are the unmarried mothers of argentina can you imagine why senor gunther i could easily imagine one reason why but i hardly wanted to risk my new benefactors displeasure by mentioning her own husbands efforts to procure abortions for all the underage girls he was having sex with so i smiled patiently and shook my head because i was one myself before i met peron i was an actress then i was not the putita my enemies like to paint me as but in when i was plain eva duarte and working in radio soap opera i met a man and gave birth to his child that mans name was kurt von bader thats right senor fabienne von bader is my daughter i glanced the colonels way he nodded back at me by way of corroboration when fabienne was born kurt who was married agreed to bring her up his wife could not have a child of her own and at the time i thought i would have more children myself sadly for the president and myself both love children that has not proved to be possible fabienne is my only child and as such very precious to me at first kurt and his wife were very generous and allowed me to see fabienne whenever i wanted to on condition that she was never told i was her real mother more recently however all of that changed kurt von bader is one of the custodians of a large sum of money deposited in switzerland by the former government of germany it is my desire to use some of that money to help lift the poor out of their poverty not just here in argentina but throughout the roman catholic world von bader who still entertains some hope of restoring a nazi government in germany disagreed he and i quarreled violently much was said too much fabienne must have heard some of it and learned the truth about her origins soon after that she ran away from home evita sighed and sat back in her chair as if the effort of telling me all of this had been a strain there she said i have told you everything are you shocked herr gunther no maam not shocked a little surprised perhaps and maybe a bit puzzled as to why you should choose to confide in me i want you to find her of course is that so hard to understand no not at all but when you have a whole police force at your disposal maam its a little hard to understand why you should expect me to succeed where they have failed she said hearing me hesitate to complete the sentence isnt that right colonel your men have failed me have they not so far we are without success senora said the colonel you hear that said evita she puffed out her cheeks in a scornful laugh he cant even bring himself to say the word failure but that is what it amounts to you on the other hand you are someone who has experience looking for missing persons yes some experience yes but in my own country yes you are a german like my daughter who has been brought up as a germanargentine castellano is her second language already you move easily among these people and i am convinced that is where you will find her find her find my daughter if you succeed i will pay you fifty thousand dollars in cash she nodded with a smile yes i thought that would make your ears move evita lifted her hand as if taking an oath im no chupacirios but i solemnly swear by the holy virgin that if you find her the money is yours the door opened briefly to admit one of her dogs evita greeted her as canela picked her up and kissed her like a favorite child well she asked me what do you say german ill do my best maam i said but i cant promise anything not even for fifty thousand dollars but i will do my best yes yes that is a good answer once again she looked accusingly at colonel montalban you hear he doesnt say he will find her he says he will try his best she nodded at me its said throughout the world that i am a selfish and ambitious woman but this isnt the case she put down the dog and took my hand in hers her hands were cold like those of a corpse her red fingernails were long and beautifully manicured like the petals from some petrified flower they were small hands but oddly full of power as if in her veins was some strange electricity it was the same with her eyes which held me for a moment in their watery gaze the effect was remarkable and i was reminded of how people had once described the experience of meeting hitler and how they had said there was something about his eyes too then without warning she opened the front of her dress and placed my hand between her breasts so that my palm was directly over her heart i want you to feel this she said urgently i want you to feel the heart of an ordinary argentine woman and to know that everything i do i do for the highest motives do you feel it german do you feel evitas heart do you feel the truth of what im telling you i wasnt sure i felt anything very much other than the swell of her breasts on either side of my fingers and the cool silkiness of her perfumed flesh i knew i had to move my hand only an inch or two to cup the whole bosom and to feel the nipple rubbing against the heel of my thumb but of her heartbeat there was no sign instinctively she pressed my hand harder against her breastbone do you feel it she asked insistently her gaze was tearful now and it was easy to see how she had once been such a success as an actress on the radio the woman was the personification of high emotion and melodrama if shed been the duport cello she couldnt have been more highly strung it was a risk letting her go on she might have burst into flames levitated or turned into a saucerful of ghee i was getting a little excited myself its not every day that the presidents wife forces your hand inside her brassiere i decided to tell her what she wanted to hear i was good at that id had a lot of other women to practice on yes senora peron i can feel it i said trying to keep the erection out of my voice she let go of my hand and to my relief she seemed to relax a little then she smiled and said whenever you are ready you can take your hand off my bosom german for a split second i let it stay there long enough to meet her eye and let her know i liked my hand being just where it was and then i took it away i considered kissing my fingers or maybe just smelling the perfume that was on them now only that would have made me as melodramatic as she so i put the hand in my pocket saving it for later like a choice cigar or a dirty postcard she adjusted her dress and then opened a drawer from which she took out a photograph and handed it to me it was the same photograph kurt von bader had given me the reward he had mentioned was the same amount i wondered whether if i did manage to find fabienne each would pay or just one or neither neither seemed more likely usually when you found a missing child the parents got angry first with the child and then with you not that any of this seemed particularly relevant they were asking me to look for her because theyd tried everything else since that had already failed i figured i had next to no chance of turning up a lead on the kid to succeed i would have to think of something that hadnt been thought of which wasnt a good bet on anyones quinella probably the kid was in uruguay or dead and if she wasnt then there had to be an adult who was helping her stay below the radar do you think you can find her asked evita i was kind of wondering that myself i said perhaps i might if i had all the facts forgive me but isnt that a detectives job to work without all the facts i mean if we had all the facts then we could probably find her ourselves we wouldnt need you german and we certainly wouldnt be offering a reward of fifty thousand dollars she had a point of course melodramatic she might have been stupid she wasnt what makes you think shes still in the country i asked could be she just got on the riverboat to montevideo twentynine dollars end of story for one thing said evita im married to the president of argentina so i know that she doesnt have a passport and even if she did have a passport she doesnt have a visa we know because my husband asked luis berres hes the president of uruguay and before you ask he also asked presidents videla chaves and odria perhaps if i spoke to her parents again i said correcting myself i added i mean to her father and her stepmother if you think it would do any good said montalban i didnt but i hardly knew what else to suggest all of it was a dead end id known that the first time id met von bader from everything id heard his daughter and whomever she was with didnt want to be found for a detective when people dont want to be found its like looking for the meaning of life youre not even sure that it exists i hated taking on a job that promised so little chance of success and normally i might have turned it down but normal didnt even get to peek through the spy hole of this particular situation eva peron wasnt the kind of presidents wife you refused especially not soon after my trip to caseros well she asked how will you go about it i put a cigarette in my face and lit it i didnt want a cigarette but it gave me time to think of something to say colonel montalban cleared his throat it sounded like a lifebelt hitting the water above my head as soon as we have something to report well be in touch maam when we were on the stairs outside the antechamber i thanked him for what for coming to my aid back there that question she asked how will you go about it thats right and how will you go about it he grinned amiably and took a light off my cigarette oh i dont know ill go and look for inspiration probably stick a gun in its face slap it around a bit see what happens the forensic judicial approach on the other hand i might just have to hope that i get lucky that usually works for me i may not look like it colonel but im quite a lucky guy this morning i was in prison five minutes ago i had my hand inside the cleavage of the wife of the president of argentina believe me for a german thats as lucky as luck can buy you these days i dont doubt it evita didnt seem ill nor do you not now maybe but i was packs a good doctor said the colonel the best there is you were both lucky to have someone like him treating you i expect so ill call the von baders and say that you want to speak to them again perhaps there was something we missed before theres always something that gets missed on account of the fact that detectives are human and humans make mistakes shall we say at midday tomorrow i nodded come on he said ill drive you back to your hotel i shook my head no thanks colonel ill walk if you dont mind the landlady sees me arriving in that white jaguar of yours shes liable to put my room rate up buenos aires they were pleased to see me at the hotel san martin of course a lot of that was to do with the fact that the secret police had turned over my roomalthough not so as you would have noticed there wasnt much to turn over mr and mrs lloyd greeted me like they hadnt expected ever to see me again one hears stories about the secret police and that kind of thing mr lloyd told me over a welcomeback glass of whiskey in the hotel bar but well its not something weve encountered before there was a misunderstanding about my cedula thats all i said i dont suppose it will happen again all the same i went ahead and paid my monthly bill just in case it did it helped to put the lloyds at ease losing a guest was one thing losing a guest who hadnt paid was quite another they were nice people but they were in it for the money after all who isnt i went up to my room there was a bed a table and chair an armchair a threebar electric fire a radio a telephone and a bathroom naturally id added a few personal touches of my own a bottle a couple of glasses a chess set a spanish dictionary a weimar edition of goethe id bought in a secondhand bookshop a suitcase and some clothes all my worldly possessions id like to have seen young werther cope with gunthers sorrows i poured myself a drink set out the chess set switched on the radio and then sat in the armchair there were some telephone messages in an envelope all but one of these was from anna yagubsky the one that wasnt was from isabel pekerman i didnt know anyone called isabel pekerman agustin magaldi came on radio el mundo singing vagabundo this had been a huge hit for him in the thirties i turned off the radio and ran a bath i thought about going out to get something to eat and had another drink instead i was just thinking about going to bed when the telephone rang it was mrs lloyd a senora pekerman calling who she rang before she says you know her thanks mrs lloyd youd better put her through i heard a couple of clicks and the tail end of another woman saying thank you senora pekerman this is carlos hausner i dont believe weve had the pleasure oh yes we have then you have the advantage of me senora pekerman im afraid i dont remember you are you alone senor hausner i glanced around the four bare silent walls at my halfempty bottle and my hopeless game of chess i was alone all right outside my window people were walking up and down the street but they might as well have been on saturn for all the good it did me sometimes the profound silence of that room scared me because it seemed to echo something silent within myself across the street at the church of saint catherine of siena a bell began to toll yes im alone senora pekerman what can i do for you they asked me to come in tomorrow afternoon senor hausner she said but i just got offered a small part in a play on corrientes its a small part but its a good part in a good play besides things have moved on since last we met annas told me all about you about how youre helping her to look for her aunt and uncle i winced wondering how many other people shed told when exactly did we meet senora pekerman at senor von baders house i was the woman who pretended to be his wife she paused so did i or rather so did my heart remember me now yes i remember you the dog wouldnt stay with you it came with me and von bader well its not my dog senor hausner she said as if i still didnt quite get what she was talking about to be honest i dont think i really expected you to dig up anything about annas aunt and uncle but of course you did i mean its not much but its something some proof that they did at least enter this country you see im in the same boat as anna im jewish too and i also had some relatives who entered the country illegally and then disappeared i dont think you should say anything else on the telephone senora pekerman perhaps we could meet and talk this over in the evenings when she wasnt acting isabel pekerman worked at a milonga which was a kind of tango club on corrientes i didnt know much about the tango except that it had originated in argentine brothels that was certainly the impression i had from the club seguro it was down some steps underneath a small neon sign and at the far end of a yard lit by a single naked flame out of the flickering shadows a large man approached the vigilante guarding the door he had a whistle around his neck to summon the police in the event of a dispute he couldnt handle are you carrying a knife he asked no he seemed surprised at this admission all the same i have to search you so why ask the question because if youre lying then id figure you might be out to cause trouble he said patting me down and then ill have to keep an eye on you when he had satisfied himself i wasnt armed he waved me to the door music which was mostly an accordion and some violins was edging its way into the yard in the doorway was a sort of coop that was home to the casita woman a largish negress who sat in an easy chair humming an altogether different tune from the one played by the tango orchestra on her thigh was a paper napkin and a pair of lamb chops maybe they were her dinner but they might just as easily have been the remains of the last man to cause trouble for the huge vigilante she smiled a big uneven smile that was as white as a swath of snowdrops and gave me a sizing upanddown look you looking for a stepney i shrugged my castellano had much improved but it fell apart like a cheap suit the minute it got snagged on the local slang you know the cafe creme im looking for isabel pekerman i said where you from honey germany its twenty pesos adolf said the casita woman dont know what youve got in mind but the ladys canfinflero is blue vincent and vincent prefers it if you give him the bouquet before you speaks to the gallina i only want to speak to her dont make no difference if youre a hunter or not every one of these creolos is from the center and if you speaks to baggage youll have to give him a bouquet its that kind of joint ill bear that in mind i peeled off a couple of notes and pressed them into her leathery hand uhhuh she shifted for a moment and tucked the notes under one of her substantial buttocks it looked as safe there as in any bank vault youll find her on the dance floor probably i breaststroked my way through a beaded curtain into a scene from the four horsemen of the apocalypse the brick walls were covered in graffiti and old posters around a dirty wooden dance floor were lots of little marbletopped tables the low lights on the ceiling barely illuminated the lowlifes below there were women with skirts slit up to their navels and men with trilbies pulled down low over their watchful eyes the orchestra looked as oily as the music it was playing the only thing that seemed to be lacking in the place was rudolph valentino dressed in a poncho with a whip in his hand and a pout on his mouth nobody paid me any attention nobody except the taller of the two women who were dancing the tango with eyes that had done a lot more than just meet i hardly recognized her from before she looked like a circus horse her mane was long and very blond with just a touch of gray her eyes were big but not as big as her beautiful curving behind which her skirt did nothing to conceal she was also wearing a kind of spangled leotard that almost preserved her modesty at least i think it was a leotard only it was a little hard to be sure the way it disappeared between her buttocks i stared hard back at her just to let her know id seen her she stared back and then pointed at a table i sat down a waiter appeared everyone else seemed to be drinking cubano from large round glasses i ordered the same and lit a cigarette a burly man came over to my table he was wearing boots black trousers a gray jacket that was a size too small for him and a white scarf he had pimp written all over him like the numbers on a pack of cards he sat down turned slowly to look at the circus horse when she nodded at him he looked back at me spreading his mouth into a smile that was somehow both approving and pitying at the same time i worked it out he approved my choice of woman but pitied me for being the kind of jerk who would even contemplate the kind of degrading transaction that was about to occur there was no fear in his craggy face it was a tough face it looked like something you could use to beat a carpet when he spoke his breath sharpened my thirst for strong liquor i kept my nose in my glass until hed finished blowing his patter my way silently i tossed some notes onto the table i wasnt in the mood for anything except information but sometimes information costs the same as the more intimate relations he gathered the money in his fist and went away only then did she come over and sit down im sorry about that she said ill get the money back off him at the end of the evening and pay you back later but you did the right thing to pay him vincents not an unreasonable man but hes my creolo and creolos like things to look like what theyre supposed to look like in case youre wondering hes not my pimp if you say so a creolo just looks out for a girl kind of like a bodyguard some of the men i dance with they can get a little rough sometimes its okay about the money keep it you mean you want to i mean keep the money thats all its information im after nothing more no offense but its been a hell of a day do you want to talk about it no lets just talk i sipped some of my cubano you look different from the last time we met a waiter placed a drink in front of her she ignored it and him so who put you up to it the cop the one who brought you he came to my apartment and said hed seen me in a show and that he had a special kind of job for me if i did as i was told id make some money and keep some nice clothes into the bargain all i had to do was play a rich worried mother she shrugged that was easy enough there was a time when i had a rich worried mother of my own she lit a cigarette so i met von bader and we talked how long were you there most of the day we didnt really know what time you were going to show up and this was all for my benefit ostensibly yes but colonel montalban wanted me to report on von bader as well yes that does sound like him two jobs for the price of one i nodded so how was he von bader nervous but nice a couple of times i heard him on the telephone i think he was planning to go abroad he made and received several calls to and from switzerland while i was there i know that because once he asked me to answer the telephone he was in the bathroom i speak german as you know i also speak polish and spanish by birth im a german pole from danzig she puffed at the cigarette but seemed irritated with it and put it out only half smoked sorry but im a little bit on edge about this the colonel was none too pleased when i said i couldnt repeat the performance tomorrow morning hes not the kind of man one lets down lightly so why did you when von bader said that you were a famous german detective and that youd often looked for missing persons in berlin before the war im afraid i rather lost interest in their scheme whatever that is you see it was i who told anna yagubsky about you and i who suggested that she might approach you for help i thought that by helping anna find her missing aunt and uncle you might also help me find my missing sisters and since you were helping me albeit by proxy i decided to help you i decided to put you in the picture as much as im able concerning what the colonel and von bader are up to you see the girl fabienne has gone off with her mother and nobody knows where thats pretty much all i know von bader wants to leave the country but he cant until he knows theyre safe i dunno something like that either way im taking a big risk telling you all this so why do it at all because anna says shes sure that youre the man whos going to find them and i dont mean fabienne and her mother i mean our relatives annas and mine i sighed go ahead tell me about them tell me about yourself i shrugged why not ive paid for your time my mother got me out of poland just before the war i was twentyfive years old she gave me some jewels and i managed to bribe my way into argentina my two sisters were too young to come with me at the time one was ten and the other was eight the plan was that id send for them when i could i wrote to tell my mother i was well and received a letter back from a neighbor saying that my mother and sisters were now in france and in hiding then in i received word that my two sisters were false weight aboard a cargo ship from bilbao false weight its what we used to call an illegal immigrant on a ship when the ship docked here in buenos aires however there was no sign of either of them my then husband made some inquiries he was a former policeman he found out that they had both been sold by the captain to a casita as franchuchas i shook my head a franchucha is what the portenos call a french prostitute a gallina is what they call one from russia wherever they come from they usually always had one thing in common they were jewish at one time half the prostitutes in this city were jewish not by choice most of them were sold into it like slaves then my husband ran away with what was left of my money and most of annas by the time he came back hed spent it all and i needed to make a living so i am as you see me now i do a little acting some dancing sometimes a little bit more when the man is nice my new life had one major advantage however it allowed me to search for my sisters and about two years ago i discovered theyd been arrested the previous year in a police raid on a casita they were taken to san miguel prison but instead of appearing before the magistrates they disappeared from prison altogether since then ive heard nothing from them nobody has its like they never existed it was my exhusband pablo who introduced me to the colonel and i really only took the job with senor von bader in the hope that i might find an opportunity to ask the colonel about my two sisters and did you no for the simple reason that he and von bader made some remarks about jews antisemitic remarks you remember i remember as a result i didnt think it likely he was going to be very sympathetic to my situation then i noticed how you didnt seem comfortable with those remarks either and what kind eyes you seemed to have and i decided to abandon my plan to speak to the colonel and speak to you instead or at least to persuade anna to speak to you about our situation the rest you know shes broke of course but very beautiful i hardly expected you would help us for nothing i can assure you nobody does anything for nothing in this country dont count on it happening a lot that way i pay just as easily as the next man sometimes the halo slips and i get an appetite for all the usual vices and some of the unusual ones too ill try to bear that in mind she said itll give me something to think about the next time i cant get to sleep how old were your sisters when they got here fourteen and sixteen is there much of a whiteslavery racket here in buenos aires listen theres a racket in that sort of thing almost anywhere you go girls arrive somewhere thats a long way from home theyve no money no papers and theres no way back they find they have to work to pay off the hidden costs of their passage im just lucky the same thing didnt happen to me whatever i do i do by choice more or less who does the buying and the selling you mean of the baggage the girls i nodded first of all this doesnt happen so much anymore the supply of new girls has dwindled the sellers were usually the same men who organized passage for these girls ships captains first mates all from places like marseilles bilbao vigo oporto tenerife and even dakar younger girls like my sisters were underweight older girls were overweight if they were really young the girls were called fragiletoo young ever to see daylight during the voyage the trade was controlled by a pole in montevideo called mihanovich montevideo was where all the ships docked before coming on to buenos aires some stayed in uruguay but usually the girls were sent here where more money was to be made from their sale mihanovich would make a deal with the men from the center thats what we call organized crime in this city its called the center because its based in the area between corrientes belgrano the docks and san nicolas a lot of it is run by two french families one from marseilles and the other from paris so the men from the center would buy the girls from mihanovich scare the hell out of them when they got here and put them to work in the casitas of buenos aires youre a sailor with a few days leave and a cockstand this is the place to go there are more casitas in this part of buenos aires than in the rest of argentina even the cops go carefully around here so you can imagine how i felt knowing my two teenage sisters were put to work there she shook her head bitterly this city is like something from the last judgment i lit another cigarette and let the smoke curl into my eyes i wanted to punish them for looking into her cleavage when what i needed most was for them to do their job and keep looking her in the eye so that i might get a better fix on whether she was telling the truth but i guess thats how things like cleavages evolved in the first place i shifted on my chair and looked at the room isabel pekerman made buenos aires sound a lot like berlin during the last days of the weimar republic but to my cynical old eyes nothing of what id seen here compared with the old german capital the girls who were dancing were still wearing their clothes and the men who were their partners were at least men most of them and not something in between the band could carry a tune and there was no pretense to sophistication i didnt doubt what isabel pekerman had said but whereas berlin had flaunted its vice and corruption buenos aires hid its appetite for depravity like an old priest sipping from a brandy bottle concealed in the pocket of a cassock she took my hand opened my palm and looked closely at it running her forefinger over the various lines and mounds she said according to your hand were going to spend the night together after all like i said its been a hell of a day it might look bad for me if you dont she said contradicting much of what had been said earlier on after all you already paid for it blue vincent will think im losing my touch no he wont not if hes got eyes in his head putting her arms around me she said no come on it might be fun its been ages since i slept with a man i really liked small world i said and stood up to leave her as things turned out i should have stayed buenos aires the next morning i thought some more about what isabel pekerman had told me about argentinas whiteslave traffic i wondered if it might be connected with what peron and mengele were up to with young girls none of it made much sense i decided my brain needed a completely different kind of problem to work on i had most of the morning before i had to go meet von bader and the colonel so after breakfast i went to the richmond in search of a game of chess melville was there and i played a carokann defense to a victory in just thirtythree moves that bronstein would have been proud of afterward i let him buy me a drink and we sat outside for a while and watched the world go by usually i paid no attention to the little scotsmans chatter on this occasion however i found myself listening to him more closely that was quite a peach you brought in here the other week he observed full of envy she is isnt she i said assuming he was talking about anna much too tall for me of course he said laughing melville couldnt have been more than fivefeetthree redhaired bearded with a wicked gaptoothed grin he looked like something kept to amuse the spanish royal family me i need them much shorter he added and that generally means younger too i felt my ears prick up at this admission how much younger the age isnt important he said not for a shortarse like me i have to take what i can get yes but theres young and theres too young surely is there he laughed i dunno well just how young is too young you must have some idea he thought for a moment and then shrugged silently so whats the youngest youve ever had whats it to you im interested thats all i mean with some of these girls you meet these days well sometimes its a little hard to tell how old they are i was hoping to draw him out on a subject melville was already beginning to look evasive about the makeup they wear the clothes some of them have experience way beyond their years back in germany for instance i had a few close shaves i can tell you of course i was a lot younger then myself and germany was germany girls were naked in the clubs and naked in the parks before the nazis sun worshipnaturism they called itit was all the rage like i say that was germany sex was our national pastime under the weimar republic we were famous for it but this this is a roman catholic country id have thought that things were a bit different here then youd be wrong wouldnt you melville uttered his manic gargoyles laugh to tell the truth this countrys a paradise for perverts like me its one of the reasons i live here all the unripe fruit you only have to reach up and pick it off the tree again i felt my ears prick up the castilian phrase melville used to describe young girls was fruta inmadurathe very same phrase the colonel had used to describe perons similar predilection i dont know about germany said melville ive not actually been there but it would have to be pretty bloody good to beat the argentine for lecheras lecheras milkmaids i nodded is it true what ive heard that the general likes them pretty young himself melville pursed his lips and looked evasive again maybe thats why you can get away with it i said you make it sound like a crime hausner isnt it i dont know these girls know what theyre doing believe me he rolled an emaciated little cigarette and held the match up to his mouth the rollup crackled into flames like a tiny forest fire with one chuckling puff he managed to consume almost a third of it so where would i go i asked affecting nonchalant curiosity if i was thinking of picking it off the tree like you describe one of the pesar poco joints down at the portside in la boca he said of course you would have to be introduced by a member he lifted his whole mug in the air in a big selfsatisfied grin like me restraining my first impulseto introduce his jaw to a short uppercuti smiled and said thats a date then mind you he said the fruta inmadura scene is not what it used to be immediately after the war the country was flooded with underweight baggage thats what we used to call the really fragile fruit that was coming from europe little jewish virgins escaping to a better life they imagined all of them looking for the caballero blanco a few found one some grew up and went on the game the rest who knows who knows indeed the way i hear it some of those illegal jews got themselves picked up by the secret police and disappeared melville pulled a face and shook his head everyone disappears at one time or another in argentina its a national bloody pastime the portenos get depressed about all kinds of shit and then they take off for a while sooner or later most of them turn up again without a word of explanation like nothing happened as for the jews well its my own experience theyre an especially melancholy lot which if you dont mind me saying so is largely the fault of your own countrymen hausner i nodded conceding the point which was well made now take peron he said warming to his theme he was vice president and secretary of war in the government of general edelmiro farrell then he disappeared his colleagues had arrested him and put him in jail on martin garcia island then evita organizes some mass demonstrations of popular support and a week later hes back six months after that hes the president he disappears he comes back its a very argentine story not everyone has an evita i said and not everyone who disappears comes back surely you cant deny that the jails are full of perons political opponents you cant make an omelet without breaking a few eggs besides most of those people are communists do you want to see this country handed over to the communists like poland and hungary and east germany like bolivia no not at all well then you ask me theyre doing the best they can this is a fine country perhaps the finest country in the whole of south america with excellent prospects for economic growth and id much rather live in argentina than in britain even without the unripe fruit melville flicked the pungent rollup into the street it was something id dearly like to have done to him what are you doing here anyway melville i asked trying to conceal the exasperation i felt with him i mean what is it that you do your work your job i told you before he said obviously you werent listening he laughed but theres no great mystery about what i do for a living unlike some i could mention he shot me a look as if to say he meant me i work for glasgow wire we supply a range of stock fencing and wire products to cattle ranchers all over the argentine i tried to stifle a yawn and failed he was right he had told me before it was just that id seen no reason to think it was something i ought to remember it sounds boring i know he said wryly but there wouldnt be a beef industry in this country without galvanizedwire products i sell it in fiftymeter rolls by the pallet the argie cattlemen buy miles of the stuff they cant get enough of it and not just the cattlemen wire is important to all sorts of people really this time the yawn got the better of me melville seemed to regard my apparent disinterest as a challenge oh yes why just a few years ago one of your own countrymen awarded me quite a large contract he was an engineer working for the ministry of foreign affairs what was his name now kammler thats right dr hans kammler ever heard of him the name itched a little although i couldnt think why i had several meetings with your mr kammler at the san martin palace in arenales an interesting man during the war he was a general in the ss i expect you knew him all right i was in the ss satisfied melville smacked his thigh with the flat of his hand i knew it he said triumphantly i just knew it course it doesnt matter to me what you did the wars over now and were going to need germany if were to keep the russians out of europe what would the ministry of foreign affairs need with a large quantity of wire fencing i asked youd better ask your general kammler said melville we met several times he and i the last time at a place near tucuman where i delivered the wire oh right i said my curiosity relaxing a little now you must mean the hydroelectric plant run by the capri construction company no no theyre a client of mine its true but this was something different something much more secret my guess is that it was something to do with the atom bomb of course i could be wrong but perons always wanted argentina to be the first nuclear power in south america kammler used to refer to the project as memorandum something or other a number eleven directive eleven thats right no wait it was directive twelve youre sure about that quite sure either way it was all topsecret stuff they paid well over the odds for the wire largely i suppose because we had to deliver the stuff to a valley in the middle of nowhere in the sierra de aconquija oh it was easy enough as far as tucuman itself theres quite a reasonable railway from buenos aires to tucuman as you probably know but from there to dulcethat was the name of the facility they were building up there after the river of the same name i supposewe had to use mules hundreds of mules melville do you think you could point the place out on a map he smiled uncertainly i think i probably said too much already i mean if it is a secret nuclear facility they might not care for me telling people exactly where it is you have a point there i admitted theyd probably kill you if they found out youd told someone like me about it in fact im quite sure of it but on the other handi lifted my jacket clear of the shoulder holster i was wearing and let him see the smith that was nesting thereon the other hand it isnt so good either in a moment you and i are going to walk to the bookshop across the street and im going to buy a map and either your brains or your finger is going to be on it by the time i leave youre joking he said im german were not exactly famous for our sense of humor melville especially not when it comes to killing people we take that sort of thing quite seriously which is why were so good at it suppose i dont want to go to the bookshop he said looking around the richmond was busy you wouldnt dare shoot me here in front of all these people why not ive finished my coffee and youve thoughtfully taken care of the check it certainly wont spoil my morning to put a bullet in your head and when the cops ask me why i did it ill simply tell them you resisted arrest i took out my side credentials and showed them to him you see im sort of a cop myself the secret kind that doesnt usually get held to account so thats what you do melville uttered his manic laugh only now it was more of a nervous laugh i was kind of wondering well now that your curiosity has been satisfied lets go and try to remember what i said about the german sense of humor in the figuera bookshop on the corner of florida and alsina i bought a map of argentina for a hundred pesos and taking melville by the arm walked him onto plaza de mayo where in full sight of the casa rosada i unfolded the map on the grass so lets have it i said where exactly was this place and if i find youve lied to me im going to come back like banquo in that play of yours scotsman and im going to make your hair a lot more red than it is now the scotsman moved a forefinger north from buenos aires past cordoba and santiago del estero and west of la cocha where eichmann was now living about here he said its not actually marked on the map but thats where i met kammler just north of andalgala there are a couple of lagoons in a depression near the basin of the dulce river they were building a small railway when i saw the place probably to make it easier to move materials up there yeah probably i said folding up the map and sliding it into my pocket if youll take my advice you wont mention this to anyone probably theyd kill you before killing me but only after torturing you first luckily for you they already tortured me and it didnt work so youre in the clear from my end of this conversation the best thing you could do now would be just to go away and forget you ever met me not even across a chessboard suits me melville said and walked quickly away i took another good look at the map and told myself colonel montalban would have been disappointed in me i really wasnt much of a detective who would ever have thought that melvillethe bore in the richmond barmight turn out to hold the key to the whole case i was almost amused at the accidental way i had managed to obtain the clue to what directive was and where it had been implemented but melville was wrong about one thing directive had nothing to do with a secret nuclear facility and everything to do with the empty file from the ministry of foreign affairs that anna and i had found in the old hotel de inmigrantes i was certain of that buenos aires i telephoned anna and told her to meet me for lunch at around two oclock at the shorthorn grill on corrientes then i drove to the house in arenales where von bader and the colonel were waiting for me after what isabel pekerman had told me at the club seguro i knew i was probably wasting my time but i wanted to see how the two of them behaved without her and how their story would sound in the light of what i now knew not that i knew anything very much for sure that would have been too much to expect i supposed that von bader was planning to go to switzerland and that evita wasnt about to let him go until the real baroness produced fabienne there were a number of reasons why the real baroness might have disappeared with evitas daughter always supposing that fabienne really was evitas daughter some of it was to do with the reichsbanks accounts in zurich but i couldnt see how exactly the bottom line of it was that id been led in a merry dance by colonel montalban i knew what his motives were for having me reopen a twentyyearold murder investigation hed explained these to me quite clearly but the only possible explanation for his not telling me that fabienne had gone into hiding with her mother was that he knew for sure that they were hiding out with one of the old comrades in any event he had a reason for arranging the charade involving isabel pekerman the colonel wasnt the kind of man who did anything without a good reason wont your wife be joining us i asked von bader as he closed the door of the drawing room behind us im afraid not he answered coolly shes at our weekend house in pilar im afraid this has all been a dreadful strain for her im sure it must have been i said still that makes it easier i suppose seeing his blank face i added to talk about fabiennes real mother with you now i let him squirm for a moment and then said the presidents wife told me all about it oh i see yes it does she said your daughter overheard the two of you arguing and then ran away yes im sorry i had to mislead you a little herr gunther said von bader he was wearing a different suit but the same look of easy affluence his gray hair had been trimmed since last wed met his fingernails were shorter too but bitten rather than manicured and bitten down to the quick but i was still am very worried that something might have happened to her is fabienne close to her stepmother would you say yes very i mean she treats my wife like shes her real mother and to everyone who knows us thats the way its always been evita has had very little to do with her daughter until comparatively recently i looked at colonel montalban what made you think she might have chosen to hide out with a german family and in case you didnt recognize it colonel thats a straight question of the kind that deserves a straight answer i think i can answer that herr gunther said von bader fabienne is a very sophisticated little girl she knows a great deal about the war and what went on and how it is that so many germans such as yourself have chosen to live here in argentina you might even say that fabienne was a national socialist she herself would say that she was my wife and i sometimes argued about that the reason the colonel wanted you to search among our old comrades here in argentina is really quite simple because it was fabienne herself who had suggested she might run away and seek sanctuary with one of them she was often threatening it after the discovery that evita was her real mother fabienne could be cruel like that she said who better to hide her than one who was himself in hiding i know this seems a strange thing for a father to say about his own daughter but fabienne is a very charismatic sort of girl her photographs dont do her justice she is quintessentially aryan and among those who have met her there is general consensus that the fuhrer himself would have been captivated by her if you ever saw leni riefenstahl in the blue light herr gunther youll know the sort of thing id seen the picture an alpine picture they called it the alps had been the best thing in it to that extent she is truly evitas daughter since youve met her i assume you will know what im talking about i nodded all right i get the picture shes everyones little sweetheart geli raubel leni riefenstahl eva braun and eva peron all rolled into one precocious siren why didnt you level with me before we werent at liberty to do so said the colonel evita didnt want her secret to be told to anyone her enemies would use this kind of information to destroy her however eventually i persuaded her to talk to you about it and now you know everything hmmm what does that mean asked the colonel it means maybe i do and maybe i dont and maybe im used to not expecting to know the difference and besides shes his daughter so why would he want to lie about it except that people will lie about anything of course and on any occasion except when theres a month with an x in it i lit a cigarette these old comrades that she met did they have names about a year ago said von bader my wife and i held a garden party to welcome many of the old comrades to argentina very hospitable of you im sure one of my former colleagues was in charge of the guest list dr heinrich dorge formerly he was aide to dr schacht hitlers finance minister i nodded fabienne was the star of the party said her father she was so fresh so captivating that many men seemed to quite forget why they were here i remember she sang a number of old german songs my wife played the piano fabienne moved many of them to tears she was remarkable he paused dr dorge is dead im afraid he had an accident which means we are unable to remember everyone who was there certainly there must have been as many as one hundred and fifty old comrades possibly even more than that and you think shes hiding with one of them is that it id say it was a strong possibility one that is still worth checking added the colonel which is why i would like you to keep going with your previous inquiry there are still a great many names you havent yet spoken to true i said but look here its my guess that if she hasnt been found its because shes no longer in buenos aires the chances are shes somewhere in the country tucuman perhaps there are lots of old comrades up there working for capri on the dam at la quiroga maybe i should go and look for her up there we already did said the colonel but why not perhaps we missed something when can you leave ill catch the evening train there were only two dishes on the menu at the shorthorn grill beef with vegetables and beef on its own there was a lot of beef displayed on skewers in the window and pictures of various beef cutscooked and uncookedhung on the roastbeefcolored walls a steers head surveyed the restaurant and its patrons with glassyeyed bewilderment as fast as the beef was cooked and carried to the tables it was eaten in companionable silence as if beef were something much too serious to be interrupted with conversation it was the kind of place where even your shoe leather felt a little nervous anna was sitting in a corner behind a table covered with a redchecked cloth above her head was a lithograph featuring a gaucho roping a steer there was pain in her eyes but i didnt think it was because she was a vegetarian as soon as i sat down a waiter came over and heaped some beef sausage and red peppers onto our plates most of the other waiters had eyebrows that met in the middle our waiter had eyebrows that had already mated i ordered a bottle of red wine the kind i knew anna liked made of grapes and alcohol when hed gone i laid my hand on top of hers whats the matter dont you like beef perhaps i shouldnt have come she said quietly ive just had some bad news about a friend of mine im sorry to hear that i said do you want to tell me about it she was an actress said anna well thats what she called herself frankly i had my doubts about that but she was a good person shed had a hard life i think much harder than shed ever have admitted to and now shes dead she couldnt have been more than thirtysix anna smiled ruefully i guess it doesnt get much harder than that does it isabel pekerman i said anna looked shocked yes how did you know never you mind just tell me what happened after you telephoned this morning i got a call from hannah a mutual friend hannah has the apartment upstairs from isabel its in the once thats the barrio officially known as balvanera historically its where the citys jews used to live still do quite a few of them anyway she was found dead this morning by hannah she was in the bath with her wrists cut as if shed committed suicide as if isabel was a survivor she wasnt the suicidal type not at all not after everything shed been through and certainly not while there was any hope that her two sisters might still be alive you see i know she told me about the sisters as a matter of fact she told me last night she certainly didnt look like someone who was going home to cut her wrists you were with her she telephoned me at my hotel and we arranged to meet in a place called the club seguro she told me everything your doubts about her profession were quite correct i think but she was a good person i liked her anyway i liked her just about enough to have gone to bed with her i wish i had maybe shed still be alive why didnt you go to bed with her all sorts of reasons yesterday was a hell of a day i called you twice but you werent there i was arrested briefly why its a long story like isabels mostly i didnt go back home with her on account of you anna thats what i told myself this morning anyway i was feeling quite proud of myself for having resisted the temptation to go to bed with her until you told me she was dead so you think im right that she might have been murdered yes why would anyone kill isabel being the kind of actress she was is not without risk i said but thats not why she was killed i imagine it had something to do with me maybe her phone was tapped maybe my phone is tapped maybe she was being followed maybe im being followed i dont know do you know who it was ive a very good idea who issued the orders but its best you dont know any more than ive told you this is quite dangerous enough already then we have to go to the police no we dont i grinned amused at her naivete no angel we definitely do not go to the police are you suggesting they had something to do with it im not suggesting anything at all look anna i came here to tell you that i think i might have found out something something important about directive eleven a place on a map i had this stupid romantic notion that you and i might catch the night train to tucuman and go and take a look at this place but that was before i heard about isabel pekerman now i think its best i dont say any more about anything and you think that trying to shield me from something like some naive schoolgirl doesnt make you sound stupid and romantic she said believe me its safer that i dont say any more she sighed well this should be an interesting lunch with you not saying anything lon chaney came back with the wine he opened it and we went through the pantomime of me tasting it and him pouring it as absurd as a japanese tea ceremony as soon as he had filled annas glass she picked it up and drained it he smiled awkwardly and started to refill it anna took the bottle away from him poured it herself and drank a second glass as quickly as the first well what will we talk about now she asked take it easy with that i said the waiter went away he could sense trouble coming we could talk about football i suppose she said or politics or whats on at the cinema but you should start youre better at avoiding certain subjects than i am after all i imagine youve had a lot more practice she poured herself some more wine i know lets talk about the war better than that lets talk about your war what were you anyway gestapo ss did you work in a concentration camp did you kill any jews did you kill lots of jews are you here because youre a nazi war criminal and because theres a price on your head will they hang you if they ever catch up with you she lit a cigarette nervously how am i doing so far not talking about what we came here to talk about by the way what was it that made you take me on as a client bernie guilt are you trying to make yourself feel better about what you did then by helping me now is that it yes i can see how that might work her eyes narrowed and she bit her lip as if she was putting her whole body into each stroke of the verbal whip she was wielding the ss man with a conscience its quite a story when you think about it a little corny but then real stories often are dont you agree the jewess and the german officer someone should write an opera about it one of those avantgarde ones with miserable songs minor keys and bum notes only i do think that the baritone who plays you should be someone who cant really sing or better still wont thats his leitmotif and hers something impotent repetitive and hopeless anna picked up her glass only this time she stood up when she had finished it thanks for lunch sit down i said youre behaving like a child maybe thats because youre treating me like one maybe i am but id rather that than see your body on a slab in the police morgue thats my only real motif anna now you sound like my father no wait i think youre a little older than he is and then she left i finished what was left of the bottle and went to the casa rosada to look through all the information montalban had given me about old comrades in argentina but there was nothing about a hans kammler but then neither was there anything about otto skorzeny apparently some old comrades were beyond suspicion later on i telephoned geller to let him know i was coming back to tucuman and to ask if i might borrow his jeep are you planning to visit ricardo again he asked because he still hasnt quite forgiven me for telling you where he lives geller laughed i dont think he likes you im sure of it by the way you were asking about bastards who give us bastards a bad name youll never guess who showed up here the other day otto skorzeny is he working for capri too thats the funny thing hes not at least not according to my records anyway see if you can find out what hes doing there i said and while youre at it see what you can find out about a man called hans kammler kammler never heard of him he was a general in the ss pedro geller groaned whats the matter why ever did i agree to the name pedro he said every time i hear it i wince its a peasants name it makes me think i probably smell of horseshit not so as youd notice pedro not in tucuman everything in tucuman smells of horseshit in the evening i drove to the railway station as usual the place was full of people many of them indians from paraguay and bolivia and easily identifiable in their colorful blankets and bowler hats at first i didnt see her standing at the head of the mitre line platform she was wearing a sensible twopiece woolen suit gloves and a scarf by her shapely leg was a small valise and in her hand was a ticket she appeared to be waiting for me i was wondering when you were going to show up she said what the hell are you doing here i asked i might say that this is a free country except that its not she said you really think youre coming to tucuman thats what it says on my ticket i told you before this is dangerous my heart is in my mouth she shrugged everythings dangerous when you read the small print gunther sometimes its a good idea not to bring your glasses besides these are my relatives not yours always supposing you have such things as relatives didnt i tell you they found me under a rock it figures you have a number of rocklike qualities then i guess i can hardly stop you angel it might be fun to see you try all right i let out a sigh i know when im beaten somehow i doubt that have you been to tucuman before i never saw the point of spending twentythree hours on a train just to end up in a fleabitten dump thats what everyone says anyway that there are just a couple of churches and what passes for a university that and a couple of million acres of sugarcane you make it sound like ive been missing something no but i have i took her in my arms and kissed her i hope youve got a sweet tooth a million acres is an awful lot of sugar after what i said to you at lunchtime i could use a little sweetening dont you think youve got twentythree hours to make it up to me then its lucky i brought some cards wed better get on the train i picked up her bag and we walked along the platform past vending trolleys laden with food and drink for passengers to take on board we bought as much as we could carry and found ourselves a compartment minutes later the train started to move out of the station but after half an hour we still werent going much faster than an old lady on a bicycle its no wonder it takes twentythree hours i complained at these speeds the british built the railways she explained until peron came along they owned them too that doesnt explain why they go so slowly the railroads werent built for people she said they were built for the transportation of cattle and here was me thinking that it was only the germans who had mastered the art of transporting people like cattle hmm were you always this cynical no i used to be a twinkle in my fathers eye you should have seen me then i could light up a room from twenty feet your father sounds like quite a man he had his turn ruthless as well as cynical like all ss men how would you know ill bet im the first ss man you ever met i certainly never expected to like kissing one i never expected to be one thats for sure do you want me to tell you about it weve got plenty of time what about our noquestions deal no i think its time you knew something about me just in case i get killed youre saying that just to try to scare me forget it these days i even sleep with the light out do you want me to tell you or not i guess i can hardly walk out the door if i decide you dont like me after all even at this speed go ahead i can always play patience if i get bored listening my brand of straight talk is strong stuff it needs a little mixer like ginger ale or indian tonic water i took a bottle of whiskey out of my bag and poured a measure in my one small glass or some of this perhaps thats quite strong for a mixer she said sipping it like it was nitroglycerin i lit two cigarettes and put one in her mouth its a strong story come on drink up i can only tell it to you when youre seeing double and im blowing smoke in your eyes that way you wont notice when i grow lots of hair on my face and my teeth get longer the train was leaving behind the suburbs of buenos aires if only i could leave behind my own past as easily a strong smell of seawater arrived through the open window gulls hovered in the blue sky close to the shore the wheels rattled underneath the carriage floor like a sixeight march and for a moment i remembered the bands that had marched underneath the windows of the adlon hotel on the night of monday january that was the day the world changed forever the day hitler was appointed chancellor of the reich i remembered how as each band had neared pariser platz where both the adlon and the french embassy were situated they stopped whatever they had been playing and struck up with the old prussian war song we mean to beat the french that was the moment i realized that another european war was inevitable all germans carry an image of adolf hitler inside them i said even the ones like me who hated hitler and everything he stood for this face with its tousled hair and postagestamp mustache haunts us all now and forevermore and like a quiet flame that can never be extinguished burns itself into our souls the nazis used to talk of a thousandyear empire but sometimes i think that because of what we did the name of germany and the germans will live in infamy for a thousand years that it will take the rest of the world a thousand years to forget certainly if i live to be a thousand years old ill never forget some of the things i saw and some of the things i did i told anna everything that is everything i had done during the war and its aftermath up to the time id set sail for argentina it was the first time id ever spoken to anyone about it honestly leaving nothing out and not trying to justify what i myself had done but at the end of it all i told her who was really to blame for it all i blame the communists for calling a general strike in november which forced an election i blame von hindenburg for being too old to tell hitler where to get off i blame six million unemployeda third of the workforcefor wanting a job at any price even if it meant hitlers price i blame the army for not putting an end to the street violence during the weimar republic and for backing hitler in i blame the french i blame von schleicher i blame the british i blame goebbels and i blame all those rich businessmen who bankrolled the nazis i blame von papen and rathenau and ebert and scheidemann and liebknecht and rosa luxemburg i blame the spartakists and i blame the freikorps i blame the great war for taking away the value of human life i blame the inflation and the bauhaus and dada and max reinhardt i blame himmler and goering and hitler and the ss and weimar and the whores and the pimps but most of all i blame myself i blame myself for doing nothing which was less than i ought to have done which was all that was required for nazism to succeed i share the guilt i put my survival ahead of all other considerations that is selfevident if i was truly innocent then id be dead anna and im not for the last five years ive been letting myself off the hook i had to come to argentina and see myself in the eyes of these other exss men to understand that i was a part of it i tried not to be and failed i was there i wore the uniform i share the responsibility anna yagubsky lifted her eyebrows and looked away my god she said youve had an interesting life i smiled thinking of hedda adlon and her chinese curse oh im not judging you said anna i wouldnt say you were guilty of much then again youre not entirely innocent either are you but it seems to me as if youve already paid a kind of price for what you did you were a prisoner of the russians that must have been awful and now youre helping me it strikes me that you wouldnt do that if you were like the rest of your old comrades its not up to me to forgive you thats up to god always supposing you believe in god but ill pray for him to forgive you and maybe you could try praying yourself i could hardly have risked her disapproval again by telling her i didnt believe in god any more than i had believed in adolf hitler a jew who was a roman catholic wasnt someone who was likely to treat the matter of my atheism lightly after what id just told her i needed to win her favor back again so i nodded and said maybe ill do that and if there was a god i figured hed probably understand after all its easy to stop believing in god when youve stopped believing in anything else when youve stopped believing in yourself tucuman we reached tucuman the following evening or just about the train was late and it was almost midnight by the time it rumbled into the local station the place looked better at night government house was lit up like a christmas tree under the palm trees on the plaza independencia couples were dancing the tango argentines seemed to need little or no excuse to tango for all i knew the dancers in the main square were really waiting for a bus the station itself was full of children none of them were interested in the submarineshaped locomotive that was cooling down after our daylong journey they wanted money kids were just like everyone else in that respect i shared out a handful of coins and then found us a taxi i told the driver to take us to the plaza why do you want to go there he asked because the last time i saw it the plaza was a hotel you should go to the coventry i could get you a rate there you and your brother right i said remembering the last time id been in tucuman the driver laughed and looked around thats right youd like my brother im sure i would and i guess i couldnt like him less than i liked the coventry actually i think they liked me there less than i liked them because i was covered in bites when i left i dont mind sharing my bed with anyone as long as theyve got just two legs when the luftwaffe bombed coventry in england i figure they must have been thinking of the hotel here in tucuman we drove to the plaza like most good hotels in argentina it was trying to look like it was somewhere else madrid probably or maybe london there was the usual amount of oak panel on the walls and marble on the floors i laid an arm on the front desk like i meant business and looked across at the clerk he wore a dark suit that matched his mustache his face and hair were shiny with the same stuff they used on the machinery of the little elevator cage that stood at right angles to the desk he bobbed his head at me and showed me some teeth that were heavily stained with tobacco wed like a large room i told him it sounded better than asking for a large bed but that was what we really wanted with a bath and what passes for a view in this city and not noisy either anna added we dont like noise except when we make it ourselves theres our bridal suite he said firing a hungrylooking glance at anna i was feeling kind of hungry myself the clerk offered to show it to us anna asked to see the rate instead then she offered to pay about half of what he was asking in cash this would never have worked in germany but in tucuman it was normal in tucuman they haggled with the priest when he gave them a penance ten minutes later we were in the room the bridal suite was adequate there was a pair of french windows that opened onto a balcony with a view of the high sierra and a strong smell of orange blossom that made a pleasant change from horses there was a big bathroom with a view of the rest of the suite and a strong smell of soap that made a pleasant change from drains most important of all there was a bed the bed was the size of mato grosso before long it had a view of annas naked body and a strong smell of her perfume which made a pleasant change from my own bachelor smell we made a night of it every time i woke i reached for her and every time she woke she reached for me we certainly didnt sleep very much the bed was too hard for sleep which was just fine by me i certainly had not expected to enjoy tucuman half as much as i did when morning finally came i took a cold bath which helped me wake up then i ordered us some breakfast we were still eating it when pedro geller called up and said he was waiting for me downstairs in the hotel lobby i met him alone the fewer people knew about annas involvement the better i told myself geller and i went outside to the spot where hed left the jeep i found out where skorzeny is staying he said at a big ranch in a place called wiederhold its owned by a wealthy sugar farmer called luis freiburg and when i say wealthy i mean wealthy he made millions in compensation when a couple of thousand acres of his estate were purchased by the government as part of the hydroelectric project that land is due to be flooded when the dam at la quiroga is finished geller laughed now heres the really interesting thing it turns out that freiburg is none other than that ss general you told me about hans kammler thats right according to ricardo kammler is an engineer who oversaw all the major ss construction projects during the war like the mittelwerk facility and all the extermination camps like auschwitz and treblinka made himself a fortune in the process yes he was quite a man this kammler ricardo told me that himmler regarded kammler as one of his most capable and talented men ricardo told you all this he can get quite talkative when hes had a few said geller yesterday evening we were coming out of capris technical branch office in cadillal when we saw a big white american car driven by skorzeny ricardo recognized kammler immediately what did kammler look like thin bony hooked nose aged about fifty eaglelike you might say had his wife and daughter with him from germany i think thats one of the reasons ricardo hates him because hes got his wife and daughter with him although i rather think ricardos jealous of anyone who got out of germany with lots of money in his trouser pockets that or anyone whos made a better fist of life in argentina than he has you included did ricardo say why skorzeny might be staying with kammler yes momentarily geller looked troubled i offered him a cigarette he took one let me light it for him and remained silent come on herbert i said using his real name for once and lighting one for myself geller sighed this is topsecret stuff bernie i mean even ricardo looked a bit shifty when he told me ricardo always looks shifty i said well naturally he worries that his past will catch up with him we all do even you probably but this isnt past this is now have you ever heard of project poplar poplar like the tree geller nodded apparently peron wants to build an atomic bomb the scuttlebutt around capri is that kammler is the director of perons nuclearweapons program just like he was in germany at riesengebirge and ebensee and that skorzeny is his head of security youd need a lot of money for something like that even as i said it i remembered that peron already seemed to have access to hundreds of millions of dollars of nazi money and if evita had her way possibly billions more dollars in switzerland you also need a lot of scientists i added have you seen lots of scientists i dont know i dont imagine they drive around wearing white coats and carrying slide rules do you good point there was a map on the seat of the jeep and a toolbox in the back show me where kammlers ranch is i told geller wiederhold geller took the map and moved a finger southwest of tucuman its here just a few miles north of the dulce river a few miles to the south and a little to the east and the frosts make sugarcane impossible cane would be impossible in tucuman too if it wasnt for the sierra del aconquija he took a drag from his cigarette youre not thinking of going there are you no im going here i pointed to one of the lagoons on the dulce river just north of andalgala to a place called dulce never heard of it said geller theres the dulce river but ive not heard of a town of that name gellers map was more detailed than the one id bought in buenos aires but he was right there was nowhere called dulce just a couple of anonymous lagoons all the same i didnt think melville would have dared to mislead me again not after the threats i had made against his miserable life how accurate is this map i asked very its based on an old muleteers map up until the beginning of the century mules were the only way to get around this whole area as many as sixty thousand mules a year used to get sold in santa north of here nobody knew these trails better than those old muleteers may i borrow this sure he said dont tell me youve found your top bastard this murderer youve been after something like that its best i dont tell you any more herbert not right now geller shrugged not knowing wont make me itch he grinned while youre borrowing my jeep im off to see a rather attractive girl who works for the institute of anthropology here in tucuman im planning to let her study me in considerable detail i tried to persuade anna to stay behind at the hotel but she wasnt having it i told you before gunther im not the type who sits at home darning your socks i didnt get to be a lawyer without outsmarting a few dumb cops for a lawyer you dont seem to have much in the way of caution i never said i was a good lawyer but get this straight i started this case and i intend to see it through you know something for a lawyer youre a pretty nice girl i just dont want anything to happen to you do all germans treat women like theyre made of porcelain no wonder you lost the war come on lets get in the car anna and i drove southwest out of the city soon we were on a narrow pitted road that was bordered on both sides by the parted waves of a red sea of sugarcane this was green on top and an impenetrable wooden thicket below there were miles of the stuff almost as if imagination had failed the earths creator sugarcane its just a lot of giant grass said anna sure but id hate to see the lawn mowers from time to time i was obliged to slow down as we passed little walking thickets of cane that on closer inspection revealed themselves to be loads on the backs of mules which elicited cries of pity from anna every few miles we came across a shantytown of concreteblock houses with corrugated iron roofs halfnaked children chewing lengths of sugarcane like dogs gnawing bones observed our arrival and departure from their villas miseria with wild gesticulating enthusiasm from the metropolitan comfort of buenos aires argentina had looked like an affluent country but out here on the plantations of the humid pampa the eighthlargest country in the world seemed one of the poorest several miles farther on the sugarcane receded and we came to some fields of corn that led down to the river dulce and a wooden bridge that wasnt much more than a continuation of the dirt road on the other side i pulled over and took another look at the map i had the sierra rising in front of me the river on my right fields of maize on my left and the road leading down a long incline immediately ahead of us theres nothing here said anna just a lot of sugar and a lot more sky she paused what exactly does this place look like anyway i dont know exactly i said but ill know it when i see it i tossed the map onto her lap shoved the jeep in gear and drove on a few minutes later we came to the ruins of a village a village that didnt appear on the map small white roofless shacks lined the road and a derelict church was home to a number of stray dogs but there was no sign of anyone living there where have all the people gone i suppose they were moved by the government this whole area will be flooded when they dam the river im missing it already she said at the bottom of the street a narrow alley led off to the right and on a wall we saw the faintest outline of an arrow and the words laguna dulcesweet lagoon we turned down the alley which became a dirt track leading into a narrow valley a thick canopy of trees covered the track and i switched on the headlights until we were in sunlight again id hate to run out of gas here observed anna as we bounced from one pothole to another the middle of nowhere has its depressing moments anytime you want to go back just say the word and miss whats just around the next corner i dont think so at last we came to a clearing and a kind of crossroads which way now she asked i drove a little farther on before reversing to the crossroads and choosing another direction a moment or two later i saw it this is the right way i said how do you know i slowed down in the bushes by the side of the track was an empty wooden roll labeled glasgow wire i pointed to it this is where the scotsman delivered his wire and you think it was for a refugee camp yes that was what i had told her but already i was beginning to realize that if a refugee camp had once existed out here it didnt any longer the whole valley was deserted any refugee camp would have needed supplies supplies needed transport there was no evidence that anyone had been down that redclay road in a while our own tire tracks were the only ones visible we drove on for almost a mile until i found what we were looking for a thick line of trees and a barbedwire gate in front of an anonymous dirt road that led farther down into the valley behind the tree line was an equally high barbedwire fence there was a sign in spanish on the gate translated it read private property of the capri construction and hydroelectric company unauthorized entry strictly forbidden by order of the federal government keep out danger there were three padlocked chains around the gate and as it was about ten feet high i hardly saw us climbing over it moreover the padlocks were of a type that usually resisted picking i steered the jeep off the road and into a small gap in the tree line then i cut the engine i think were here i said what now asked anna surveying the fence i unlocked the toolbox in the back of the jeep and searched it hopefully it seemed that geller went equipped for almost any eventuality i found a pair of handsized heavyduty wire cutters we were in business now we walk i said we walked through the trees and along the length of the fence there was no one about even the birds remained silent here all the same i figured it was better to cut the wire about thirty or forty yards from the jeep in case anyone saw it and stopped to see why it was there with the wire cutters in hand i set about making an entrance for us well just go in and have a look and see what there is to see i said dont you think we should maybe come back and do this in the dark in case anyone sees us stand back as i cut another length of melvilles wire it zipped away into the trees singing like a broken piano string anna looked around nervously you really are quite tenacious arent you she said i pocketed the wire cutters something bit me and i slapped my neck i almost wished it had been her tenacious i grinned this is your search for answers not mine then perhaps i just lost my appetite for them she said fear does that to you i certainly havent forgotten what happened the last time we broke into somewhere we werent supposed to be good point i said and took out my gun i opened and closed the magazine checked that everything was working and slipped off the safety then i stepped through the gap id made in the fence reluctantly anna followed i suppose killing people gets easier each time that you do it thats what they say isnt it they usually dont know what theyre talking about i said treading carefully through the trees the first time i killed a man was in the trenches and it was me or him i cant say ive ever killed anyone who didnt have it coming what about conscience i let the gun lie flat on my hand for a moment maybe youd feel better if i put this away no she said quickly so its all right if i have to kill someone just as long as your conscience is clear is that it maybe if i was as tough as you i could do it i mean shoot someone but im not angel if theres one thing the last war proved its that anyone can kill anyone all you need is a reason and a gun i dont believe that there are no murderers i said there are just plumbers and shopkeepers and lawyers who kill people everyones quite normal until they pull the trigger thats all you need to fight a war lots of ordinary people to kill lots of other ordinary people couldnt be easier and that makes it all right no but thats the way it is she said nothing to that and for a while we walked in silence as if the preternaturally quiet forest had affected us in some way there was just a light breeze in the treetops and the sound of twigs cracking under our feet to remind us of where we were then emerging from the trees we found ourselves facing a second wire fence it was about two hundred meters long and behind it stood a number of temporarylooking wooden buildings at opposite ends of the fence were watchtowers and fortunately for us these were not manned the camp if camp this was looked deserted i took out the wire cutters melville called this place dulce i said snipping one length of the little scotsmans galvanized wire and then another someones idea of a joke perhaps said anna theres nothing sweet about it its my guess that this is where they held illegal jewish immigrants like your aunt and uncle and isabel pekermans sisters thats the assumption ive been working on anyway we ducked through the wire and into the camp i counted five watchtowersone on each corner of the perimeter fence and a fifth in the center of the camp overlooking a kind of trench that seemed to connect one long barrack to another near the main gate was a small guardhouse a road led into the camp from the main gate and onto what looked like a parade ground in the center of the parade ground was an empty flagpole nearest to the place where we had entered the camp was a large ranch house we peered through the dusty windows there was furniture tables chairs an old radio a picture of juan peron a room with a dozen or so beds on which the mattresses had been rolled up in a canteensized kitchen pots and pans hung neatly on a wallmounted rack i tried the door and found it was not locked we went inside breathing a musty mildewed air on a table we found an old copy of la prensa on the front page was a picture of peron wearing a military uniform a white officers cap white gloves a sash in the colors of the argentine national flag and a big generous grin the lead story was something about peron announcing his first fiveyear plan to boost the countrys newly nationalized industries i showed it to anna pointing out the date nineteen fortyseven i said i guess that was the last time anyone was here i certainly hope so she said i walked into another room and picked up an old helmet other rooms were no more enlightening this must have been where the soldiers relaxed i said we went outside again crossing the parade ground to a group of four long barracks we went inside one it was like a stable except that instead of stalls there were wide wooden shelves some of which were covered with handfuls of straw and almost a minute had passed before i realized that these were supposed to be beds probably two or three people could have been accommodated on each of the shelves anna looked at me with pain in her eyes and i could tell she had arrived at the same conclusion neither of us spoke she stayed close to me and eventually took my left hand my gun was still in my right we went into the second barrack which was much like the first so was the third i was reminded of the pow camp i had been held in by the russians apart from the weather this place looked almost grim the fourth building was just a long empty shed the far end of the shed led down into a sort of trench that was covered with a ceiling of more barbed wire the trench was about thirty yards long and two yards wide we entered it and walked down into a barrack that you knew was there only when you had entered the trench this one was divided into three chambers by two wooden walls each chamber was about ten feet high and thirty feet wide and the inside walls were covered with sheets of zinc on the ceiling were shower pipes the door of each chamber was extra thick and could be closed from the outside by an iron locking bar these doors were sealed with rubber gaskets around the edges in each of the three chambers a copper pipe entered through a wall a few inches above a tiled floor the pipes were all connected to a large central stove in the corridor outside the chambers by now i had a very bad feeling about this place anna was looking at the pipes on the ceiling so where did the water come from she asked glancing around i didnt see a water tank on the roof perhaps they took it away i said why they havent taken anything else away she glanced down at the floor and what are these tram rails what she followed the tram rails to the far end of the barrack and some double doors next to a big extractor fan set in the wall she pushed open the doors and went outside perhaps we should leave now i called out going after her i holstered my gun and tried to take her by the hand but she lifted it away and kept on walking not until i understand what this place is she said i tried to inject some calm into my voice come on anna lets go i wondered how much she knew of what had gone on at the camps in poland weve seen enough dont you think theyre not here perhaps they never were the rails led along the side of five grasscovered mounds about twenty feet wide and forty feet long next to these were a number of heavyduty flatbed trolleys of the kind that might have been used in a railway yard the trolleys were covered in rust but the design was clear enough each trolley could be raised to tip its cargo into one of the pits and i was beginning to suspect what probably lay underneath the grasscovered mounds earthworks i said earthworks no i dont think so yes i said i expect they were going to build some more of these barracks and then changed their minds it sounded pathetic i knew perfectly well what i was looking at and by now so did she slowly anna was bending forward to look at something on the grasscovered mound that had caught her eye she started to crouch then she was on her knees glancing around finding a piece of wood and using it to scrape at the ground around an almost colorless plant that was growing out of the pit in front of her what is it i asked coming closer have you found something she sat back on her haunches and i saw that it wasnt a plant at all but a childs handa decomposed partly skeletal human hand anna shook her head whispered something and then putting her hand to her mouth tried to stifle the emotion rising in her throat then she crossed herself i said nothing there was nothing i could say the purpose of the camp was now clear to us both these mounds were mass graves how many do you think she said finally in each one it was my turn to be nervous now i was looking around for some sign that we might have been observed a death camp was more than i had bargained for much more i dunno maybe a thousand look we really should leave now yes youre right she found a handkerchief and wiped her eye just give me a minute will you my aunt and uncle are probably buried in one of these pits you dont know that can you honestly think of a better explanation look i said the people who are buried here you dont know that theyre jewish they could be argentines political opponents of the perons theres no reason to suppose thats a gas chamber in there she said looking back at the barrack from which we had just emerged isnt it come on gunther you were in the ss you of all people should be able to recognize one i said nothing i never heard of perons political opponents being gassed she said shot yes tossed out of a plane yes but not gassed only jews get gassed this place this camp is a place of death thats why they were brought here to be gassed i can feel it everywhere i could feel it in that dummy showerbarrack i can feel it here most of all we have to leave i said what now if they catch us here theyll kill us for sure i said i took her arm and lifted her up i never expected this angel really i didnt id never have brought you here if id even suspected that it was this kind of place i thought it might be a concentration camp but never a death camp not that this is much more than i ever bargained for i took her back to the hole in the fence christ she said no wonder this is such a big secret can you imagine what might happen if people outside argentina ever find out about this place anna listen to me you have to promise youll never mention this at least not so long as you remain in this country theyd kill us both for sure the quicker were away from here the better entering the trees again i started to run and so did she at least now i thought she had grasped the true gravity of our situation i threw away the wire cutters we found the hole we had made in the first exterior fence we started running back to where we had left the jeep i smelled them first or rather i smelled their cigarettes i stopped running and turned to face anna listen i said holding her by the shoulders do exactly what i say there are men looking for us on this road how do you know because i can smell their tobacco anna sniffed the air and then bit her lip take off your clothes what are you talking about are you mad maybe they wont find the hole we made in the fence i was already undressing our best chance is to make them think that we stopped here to make love thats the story weve got to stick to if they think thats all that we were doing they might just let us go come on angel strip she hesitated no one whos just seen what weve just seen would strip and have sex in the woods now would they i told you we should have come back and done this in darkness she said and started to undress when we were both naked i wrestled my way between her thighs and said now sound like youre enjoying it as loud as you can anna moaned loudly and then again i started to thrust my pelvis at her as if not just her sexual satisfaction and mine depended on this charade but our lives as well tucuman i was still thrusting away between annas thighs when i heard a twig break on the forest floor behind me i twisted around to see some men none of them were wearing uniforms but two of them had rifles slung over their shoulders that was good i thought at the same time i grabbed something with which to cover our nakedness there were three of them and they were dressed for riding they wore blue shirts leather vests denim trousers riding boots and spurs the man without a rifle had a silver belt buckle as big as a breastplate an ornatelooking gun belt and over his wrist was looped a short stiff leather whip he was more obviously spanish than his companions who appeared to be mestizoslocal indians his face was badly pockmarked but he had a quiet confidence in his manner that seemed to indicate his scars didnt matter to him i would ask what you are doing here he said grinning only it seems obvious is it any business of yours i said dressing quickly this is private property he said that makes it my business he wasnt looking at me he was watching anna put on her clothes which was almost as pleasurable a sight as watching her take them off im sorry i said we got lost we stopped to look at the map and then one thing led to another you know how it is i expect i glanced around it seemed like a nice quiet spot no one around you were wrong then out of the trees came a fourth man riding a fine white horse and very different from the other three he wore an immaculate white shortsleeved shirt a black militarystyle cap a pair of gray riding breeches and black boots that were as shiny as the gold watch on his slim wrist he had a head like a giant bird of prey the fence has been cut he told the pockmarked gaucho not by us said anna claims they stopped here for a quiet fuck said the head gaucho silently the man on the white horse rode around us while we finished dressing my holster and gun were still on the ground somewhere only i hadnt been able to find them he said who are you and what are you doing in this part of the country his castellano was better than mine there was something about his mouth that made it better for speaking spanish the size and shape of the chin governing the mouth caused me to suspect that maybe there were a couple of habsburgs in his family but he was german that much i was certain of and instinctively i knew this must be hans kammler i work for the side i said my identification is in my coat pocket i handed the coat to the head gaucho who quickly found my wallet and handed it to his boss my name is carlos hausner im german i came here to interview old comrades so that they can be issued the goodconduct passes theyll need to obtain an argentine passport colonel montalban at the casa rosada will vouch for me so will carlos fuldner and pedro geller at capri construction im afraid we got a bit lost as i was saying to this gentleman we stopped to take a look at the map and im afraid one thing led to another the german on the white horse looked through my wallet and then tossed it back to me before turning his attention to anna and who are you he asked his fiancee the german looked at me and smiled and you say youre an old comrade i was an officer in the ss like you herr general its that obvious is it the german looked disappointed only to me sir i said clicking my heels together and hoping that my show of prussian obsequiousness might excuse anna and me a job with side a fiancee he smiled my you have settled in here havent you the horse shifted under him and he wheeled it around so that he could keep staring down at us tell me hausner do you always bring your fiancee along when youre on police business no sir the fact is my castellano is fine in buenos aires but out here it lets me down sometimes the accent is a little difficult for me to understand most of the people in this part of the world are of guarani stock he said speaking german at last they are an inferior indian race but on a ranch they have their uses herding branding fence mending i nodded toward the barbedwire fence is this your fence herr general no he said but my men keep an eye on it you see this is a highsecurity area few people ever venture this far down the valley which leaves me with something of a dilemma oh whats that sir i should have thought that was obvious if you didnt cut the fence then who did you see my problem yes sir i shook my head awkwardly well we certainly havent seen anyone mind you we havent been here that long perhaps perhaps the horse lifted its tail and did what horses do he didnt seem to believe my story either the general nodded sharply at the head gaucho youd better bring them along he spoke in castellano and it seemed evident that neither the head man nor the two guarani spoke any german we walked back to where wed left the jeep three horses were waiting patiently for their riders the two guarani mounted up and took the third horses bridle while the head gaucho climbed in the back of the jeep i noticed that his holster was unbuttoned and decided he looked like the type who might be quick on the draw besides under his belt was a knife as long as chile just stick to the story i told anna in russian all right but i dont think he believed it she climbed into the passenger seat lit a nervouslooking cigarette and tried to ignore the head gauchos brown eyes on the back of her head who was that nazi anyway i think hes the nazi who built that camp i said and many others like it i climbed into the drivers seat took the cigarette from her mouth puffed it for a moment and then put it back only it didnt stick her jaw was hanging down like the ramp on a truck so i put the cigarette in my own mouth you mean thats exactly what i mean i started the jeep which makes him extremely dangerous so do exactly what i say and maybe well live to know better than to tell the tale the head gaucho tapped me impatiently on the shoulder drive he said in castellano he pointed farther up the road toward the three horsemen and the high sierra i put the jeep in gear and drove slowly along the road its just one man said anna why dont you throw him out or something we could easily escape three men on horses couldnt we for one thing this man behind me is armed to the teeth and for another so are all his friends and they know this country much better than me besides i lost my gun back there in the trees thats what you think she said its under my bra strap between my shoulder blades anna listen to me promise you wont do anything stupid you dont know what youre up against these men are professionals they handle guns every day so let me deal with it im sure we can talk our way out of this that man the general she said if he really did what you said he did he deserves to be shot sure he does only hes not going to be shot unless its by someone who knows what theyre doing the head gaucho pushed his head between us from the smell of his breath i guessed he was a stranger to the toothbrush shut up talking german and drive he said fiercely for added emphasis he produced his knife and pressed the tip under my ribs i felt like a horse who had been pricked with a spur i get the point i said and put my foot down sitting on the edge of a mountain slope with an excellent view of the valley below it was more like a little piece of old heidelberg than a ranchtesserae of handsome wooden chalets ivywrapped castlestyle turrets and a small chapel complete with a bell tower under the arch of the main building was a huge wooden tun that from the bottles beside it looked like it was filled with red wine on the cobbled courtyard in front was an ornamental circular garden with a bronze fawn leaping through a facsimile cliffedge waterfall and i almost expected to see the student prince soaking his head under it after a night on the beer my surprise at seeing a corner of badenwurttemberg in argentina was quickly overtaken by the sight of a familiar face walking toward me his hand held out in front was my old detective sergeant heinrich grund to my relief he seemed pleased to see me bernie gunther he said i thought it was you what brings you up here i pointed at the head gaucho with whom grund had been speaking just a minute or two before him i said grund shook his head and laughed same old bernie always in trouble with the powers that be even after almost two decades he looked like a boxer a retired boxer he was grayer than i remembered there were deep lines in his face and more of a stomach in front of him but he still had a face like a welders mask and a fist as big as a speedball is that what he is gonzalez oh yes hes the estate manager runs everything around here he seems to think you might have been spying spying on what exactly oh i dunno grunds eyes licked anna up and down for a moment arent you going to introduce me to your lady friend anna this is heinrich grund we were in the berlin police together about a thousand years ago is it that long it certainly felt that long i hadnt seen grund since the summer of when he was already a senior officer in the gestapo and wed been very much at arms length with each other when last id heard of him he was a major in an ega special action groupin the crimea i didnt know what hed done i didnt want to know but it wasnt difficult to imagine heinrich i said continuing the formal introduction this is anna yagubsky according to her shes my fiancee then i certainly wouldnt argue with her grund took her hand and smoother than i remembered him bowed like a proper german officer charmed im sure i wish i could say the same said anna i dont know why weve been brought here really i dont im afraid shes not very happy with me i told grund i promised her a nice drive from tucuman and i managed to get us lost the general and his men found us somewhere down in the valley im not sure but i think it was somewhere we werent supposed to be yes gonzalez told me he found you at camp dulce down at the sweet lagoon now thats a very secret place and by the way we dont call him the general we call him the doctor whom youve met of course anyway hes a close friend of peron and takes all breaches of local security very seriously i shrugged occupational hazard i suppose i mean we all of us have to take security very seriously not like up here you dont grund turned and pointed at the tops of the sierra behind us the other side of that is chile theres a secret pass that was used by the guarani indians that only the doctor and gonzalez know about the least sniff of trouble and we can all be off on our travels again grund smiled this place is the perfect hideout what is this place asked anna it looks more town than village i think it was built by a german a fellow named carlos wiederhold toward the end of the last century but quite soon after finishing it he found an even nicer spot to the south of here place called bariloche so he went there and built a whole town in similar style there are lots of old comrades down there you should visit it sometime perhaps i will i said always supposing i can get a clean bill of health from the doctor naturally ill see what i can do thanks heinrich grund shook his head only im still finding it kind of hard to believe bernie gunther being here in argentina like the rest of us i always had you pegged as a bit of a commie what the hell happened its a long story isnt it always but not right now eh sure grund started to laugh whats so funny i asked you a fugitive war criminal the same as me the war made fools of us all didnt it thats certainly been my experience i heard the sound of horses and looked around to see kammler and his men riding up the slope toward us the ss general lifted his boots out of the stirrups and slipped off his horse like a jockey grund went over to speak to him anna was watching kammler closely i was watching anna i put my hand lightly on her back the gun wasnt there where is it i murmured under my belt she said where i can reach it if you kill him what and spoil your little nazi reunion i wouldnt want to do that there seemed no point in arguing that one i said if you kill him theyll kill us both after what ive seen do you really think i care yes and if you dont then you certainly ought to youre still a young woman one day you might have children perhaps you ought to think about them i dont think i want to bring children into a country like this then pick another country i did yes i should think you would feel quite at home here she said bitterly for you this must seem like a real home away from home anna please be quiet be quiet and let me think when kammler had finished speaking to grund he approached us with a sort of smile on his lean face taking his cap off his arm extended toward us both in a show of avuncular hospitality now that he had dismounted i was able to get a better look at him he was well over six feet tall his hair was invisibly short and gray at the sides but longer and darker on the crown so that it looked like a yarmulke the skull on his sticklike neck had been taken from easter island probably the eyes were set in cavelike sockets so deep and shadowy they almost looked empty as if the bird of prey that hatched him had pecked them out his physique was very spare but strong like something that had been unwound from one of melvilles spools of glasgow barbed wire for a moment i couldnt quite place his accent and then i guessed he was prussianone of those balticcoast prussians who eat herring for breakfast and keep griffins for sport ive been talking to your old friend grund he said and ive decided not to kill you im sure were very relieved to hear it said anna and smiled sweetly at me arent we dear kammler glanced uncertainly at anna yes grund has vouched for you and so did your colonel montalban you called montalban i said you seem surprised at that its just that i dont see any telephone lines up here youre right there are none no i called him from a phone down there he turned and pointed into the valley an old service telephone from the days when the hydroelectrical people from capri were here thats quite a view you have there doctor said anna yes of course soon much of it will be under several fathoms of water wont that be a little bit inconvenient she asked him what will happen to your telephone to your road he smiled patiently we shall build another road of course workers are plentiful and cheap in this part of the world yes she said smiling thinly i can imagine besides he added a lake will be nicer i think it will be just like switzerland we went up to the main house it was made of stone bricks and palecolored wood i counted about twentyfive windows on the threestory front the central part of the house was a redroofed turret at the top of which was a man with a pair of binoculars and a rifle the lower windows had tyroleanstyle shutters and window boxes filled with flowers as we came up to the front door i thought we might meet the aryan ski association coming the other way certainly the air was more alpine up here than it had been down in the valley inside the house we were met by germanspeaking servants including a butler wearing a white cotton jacket a big log was burning in the fireplace there were flowers in tall vases and pictures and bronzes of horses everywhere you looked what a lovely house said anna its all very germanic youll both stay to dinner of course said kammler my chef used to cook for hermann goering now there was someone who really enjoyed his food anna said kammler smiled at anna uncertain of her temperament i knew how he felt i was trying to think of a way of getting her to shut up without using the back of my hand my dear he said after your exertions perhaps youd like to go and freshen up a bit to a heftylooking maid hovering in the background he said show her to a room upstairs i watched anna go up a staircase as wide as a small road and hoped she would have the good sense not to come back with the gun in her hand now that kammler was being friendly and hospitable my greatest fear was that she might turn into an avenging angel we went into an enormous living room heinrich grund followed at a respectful distance like a faithful aidedecamp he was wearing a blue shirt and tie and a gray suit that was nicely tailored although not well enough to conceal the fact that he was also wearing a shoulder holster none of these people looked like they were taking any chances with their security the living room was like an art gallery with sofas there were several old masters and quite a few new ones i could see that kammler had escaped from the ruins of europe with a lot more than just his life in a tall freestanding orientalstyle cage a canary flapped its wings and twittered like a little yellow fairy past a pair of french windows an immaculate lawn stretched into the distance like the green felt on some divine billiards table it all looked a very long way from auschwitzbirkenau but in case it wasnt quite far enough there was a plane parked on the lawn i heard a pop and turned to see kammler opening a bottle i usually have a glass of champagne about this time will you join me i said i would its my one real luxury he said handing me a flute i almost laughed as i noticed the box of partagas on the sideboard the lalique decanter and glasses and the silver bowl of roses on the coffee table deutz he said rather difficult to get up here and then lifting his glass in a toast he said to germany to germany i said and sipped the delicious champagne glancing out of the window at the little silver plane on the runwaysized lawn i said whats that a bfw yes a taifun do you fly herr gunther no sir i finished my war working for the okw military intelligence on the russian front accurate planespotting was a matter of life and death i was in luftwaffe when the war started said kammler working as an architect for the air ministry after there really wasnt much opportunity for an architect with the rlm so i joined the ss i was chief of department c building soap factories and new weapons facilities soap factories kammler chuckled yes you know soap oh yes the camps of course i drank some champagne hows your champagne excellent but the truth was it wasnt not anymore the sour taste in my mouth had made certain of that heinrich and i got out early in may said kammler he was my head of security at jonastal werent you heinrich yes herr doktor grund raised his glass to his master we just got in a staff car and drove west we were building the german bomb at jonastal so naturally the amis welcomed us with open arms and we went to new mexico to work on their own bomb program we stayed for almost a year by then however it had dawned on them that at the end of the war i was effectively number three in the ss hierarchy which made my continued employment in the usa very sensitive so i came to argentina and heinrich was good enough to come with me it was my honor sir gradually i was able to get most of my things out of storage and shipped here which is how you find me now its a little remote but we have pretty much everything you would want my wife and daughter are with me now and theyll be joining us for dinner where exactly are they now heinrich theyre looking at some new calves sir how many cattle do you have i inquired about thirty thousand head of cattle and about fifteen thousand sheep in many ways the work is not so dissimilar from what i did during the war we rear the beasts drive them into tucuman and then transfer them by rail to buenos aires for slaughter he seemed unashamed by this confession were not the biggest estancia in these parts not by a long way but we bring a certain efficiency to the running of an estate not usually seen in argentina german efficiency sir added grund precisely affirmed kammler he turned to face a little fuhrer shrine i hadnt noticed before there were several photographs of hitler a small bronze bust of his distinctive head a few military decorations a nazi armband and a pair of sabbath candlesticks that looked as if someone used them to keep the leaders flame alight on the nazi high holy daysjanuary april april and november kammler nodded reverently at his shrine yes indeed german efficiency german superiority we have him to thank for always reminding us of that fact i didnt see it that way of course but for the moment i kept my reservations to myself we were a very long way from the comparative safety of buenos aires when id finished my champagne kammler suggested i might go upstairs and wash the maid showed me to a bedroom where i found anna lying on an elaborately carved wooden bed she waited until the maid was gone then sprang up this is very cozy isnt it his own private berghof just like the fuhrer who knows maybe hell put in a guest appearance at dinner now that would be interesting or how about martin bormann you know i always wanted to meet him only i ought to tell you now im a little worried about dinner i dont know the words of the horst wessel song and lets not beat around the burning bush im a jew jews and nazis dont mix i dont mind you sticking it to me anna but please try to cut the sarcasm in front of the general hes beginning to notice and no confessions about who and what you are that would really cook our goose i looked around the room wheres the gun hidden hidden where she shook her head still thinking of shooting him i know he should suffer more shooting is too quick gas would be better perhaps i can leave the oven on in the kitchen before we go to bed tonight anna please listen to me these are very dangerous people even now heinrich is carrying a gun and hes a professional before you can even cock that smith hell blow your head off what do you mean cock i shook my head see what i mean you dont even know how to shoot you could show me look those dead people in that camp they could be anyone they could be but theyre not we both know who and what they are you said so yourself it was a camp created by order of the ministry of foreign affairs what else would they want a camp for but to imprison foreign refugees and your friend the scotsman melville it was he who mentioned directive twelve an order for barbed wire to be delivered to a german ss general called kammler directive twelve bernie that implies something more serious than directive eleven dont you think she took a deep breath besides before we left tucuman this morning you told me it was kammler who built the big death camps auschwitz birkenau treblinka surely you must agree that he deserves to be shot for that alone perhaps yes of course but i can promise you shooting kammler here today isnt the answer there has to be another way i dont see how we can arrest him not in argentina do you i shook my head then shooting him is best i smiled see what i mean theres no such thing as a murderer theres just a plumber or a shopkeeper or a lawyer who kills someone else ordinary people people like you anna this isnt murder this will be an execution dont you think thats what those ss men used to tell themselves when they started shooting pits full of jews all i know is that he cant be allowed to get away with it anna i promise you i will think of something just dont do anything rash all right she remained silent i took her hand but she snatched it away again angrily all right she let out a long sigh all right a little later the maid brought us some evening clothes a black beaded gown that made anna look stunning a dinner jacket dress shirt and bow tie that somehow managed to fit me well what do you know we look almost civilized anna said straightening my tie there was some perfume on the dressing table she put some on smells like dead flowers she observed actually i rather like it i said it figures anything dead probably smells good to a nazi i wish youd lay off that nazi gibe i rather thought that was the point gunther to make them think youre one of them so we can save our skins she got up and paused in front of the fulllength cheval mirror well im ready for anything maybe even a killing or two we went down to dinner besides kammler grund anna and me there were three other people this is my wife pilar and my daughter mercedes said kammler welcome to wiederhold said frau kammler she was tall and thin and elegant with perfect semicircular eyebrows that looked like theyd been drawn by giotto and lots of wavy fair hair either side of her face which lent her a spaniel look she belonged in the cologne prize winners enclosure at weidenpesch racecourse but i wouldnt have raced her id have put her out to stud at a million dollars a time frau kammlers daughter was no less beautiful and no less charming she looked about sixteen but was perhaps younger her hair was more titian than red because as soon as you saw her you thought she belonged on a velvet couch in the studio of a great painter with an eye for beauty when i saw her i was sorry i didnt paint myself her eyes were a peculiar shade of green like an emerald with a trace of lapis lazuli but quietly knowing too like she was about to check your king and you were just too dumb to know it yet all of us did our best to be civilized and polite even anna who responded to the throwndown gauntlet of so much unexpected beauty by finding a little bit of extra beauty inside herself and switching it on like an electric light but it was difficult to maintain this genteel atmosphere when the last guest was otto skorzeny especially as he had been drinking what are you doing here he asked when he saw me having dinner i hope skorzeny draped a big arm around my shoulder it felt as heavy as an iron bar this fellow is all right hans he told kammler hes my confidant hes going to help me to make sure those greaseballs never get their hands on the reichsbanks money anna shot me a look hows the hand otto i asked him anxious to change the subject skorzeny inspected his big mitt it was covered in some lividlooking scars from when he had punched king georges picture it was clear he had forgotten how the scars had come to be there at all my hand yes i remember now hows your ingrown toenail or whatever it was hes fine said anna putting her arm through mine who are you he asked her his nurse only somehow he manages to look after himself very well without me i wonder why i came at all have you known each other for long asked frau kammler theyre engaged to be married said heinrich grund really said frau kammler its for his own good said anna do you have any friends as goodlooking as you skorzeny asked her no but you seem to have plenty of friends of your own skorzeny looked at me then at kammler and grund youre right he said my old comrades anna shot me another look i hoped she didnt have the gun on her the way things were going i thought she might shoot everyone including me but i need a good woman he complained what about evita i asked hows it coming along with her skorzeny pulled a face not a chance bitch otto please said frau kammler there are children present skorzeny looked at mercedes and grinned with open admiration she was grinning back at him mercedes shes hardly that thank you otto said mercedes at least theres someone here whos prepared to treat me like a grownup anyway hes right mommy eva peron is a bitch that will do mercedes her mother lit a cigarette in a holder the length of a blowpipe scolding skorzeny gently she took him over to the most comfortablelooking sofa and sat down with him evidently she had experience of his behavior because a minute later the hero of the gran sasso was asleep and snoring loudly we dined without him as promised the dinner prepared by goerings chef was excellent and very german i ate things i hadnt tasted since before the war even anna was impressed tell your chef that im in love with him she said full of charm now kammler took his wifes hand and i am in love with my wife he said bringing the long slender hand to his lips she smiled back at him and took his hand back to her mouth then nuzzled it tenderly like a favorite pet tell me anna said kammler have you ever seen two people who were so much in love as us no i cant say i ever did anna smiled politely and looked at me i do hope that im as lucky as you are i cant tell you how happy this woman makes me said kammler i think that i would die if she left me really i would id just die without her so anna said grund when are you and bernie planning to get married that all depends she said treating me to one of her most saccharine smiles on what asked grund he has a small quest to perform for me first so hes a true knight said mercedes how romantic just like parsifal actually hes more like don quixote said anna taking my hand and squeezing it playfully my knight is a little older than most knights errant arent you darling grund laughed i like her bernie he said i like her a lot but shes much too clever for you i hope not heinrich and what is this quest asked mercedes i want him to slay a dragon for me said anna with eyes widening in a manner of speaking when dinner was over we returned to the living room and found skorzeny was gone to everyones relief a little after that mercedes went to bed followed closely by her mother and then anna who mischievously blew me a kiss as she went up i breathed a sigh of relief that we had managed to get through the evening without her shooting anyone i said i needed some night air and having taken one of the cigars offered me by my host i went outside theres nothing like staring at a night sky to make you feel a long way from home especially when that sky is in south america and home is in germany the sky above the sierra was bigger than any id ever seen which made me feel smaller than the smallest point of silvery light on that great black vault perhaps that was why it was there to make us feel small to stop us from thinking that any of us is at all important enough to be a member of a master race and nonsense like that after a moment i heard a match scrape and looking around i saw heinrich grund lighting a cigarette he stared up the heavens took a deep drag on the cigarette and said youre a lucky fellow bernie shes really very lovely and a bit of a handful i imagine yes she is do you ever think of that kid in berlin the crippled one who got herself murdered back in thirtytwo anita schwarz wasnt it yes yes i do and you remember the arguments we used to have about her me saying it was all for the best that people like her died and you saying that mercy killing was wrong he shrugged something like that anyway the fact is bernie i really had no idea what i was talking about no idea at all its one thing saying it but its quite another doing it he was silent for a while then he asked do you think theres a god bernie no how could there be if there was you wouldnt be here now neither of us would grund nodded i was glad when we lost the war he said i expect that surprises you but i was glad it was all over the killing i mean and when we came here it seemed like a fresh start he shook his head sadly as if weighed down by something monumentally heavy only it wasnt when he had been silent for almost a minute i said do you want to talk about it heinrich he let out an unsteady tremulous sort of breath and shook his head words dont help they only seem to make it worse for me at any rate i dont have kammlers strength his sense of absolute certainty i expect it helps having his family around i said trying to change the subject how long have they been here i dunno a few months i suppose grund clapped himself on the chest for him hitler still lives in here always will probably for him and a lot of other germans but not me not anymore there was nothing i could say to this there was nothing i wanted to say we had both made our choices and were living with the consequences of those good or bad i wasnt sure id come off any better than grund but at least thanks to anna i still had some hope for the future grund didnt seem to have hope left in anything at all i left him on the terrace with his thoughts and his fears and whatever else a man like him goes to bed with impaled on the shards of his conscience anna sat up in bed as i came through our bedroom door the bedside light was on i sat down on the edge of the mattress and started to unlace my shoes i wanted to say something tender to her but there was still something on her mind well she said did you think of something some sort of punishment for that bastard kammler yes i said oh yes something terrible yes i think it will be for him buenos aires two days later we arrived back in buenos aires since it seemed unlikely that the colonel would have heard kammlers newsthat his men had picked me up next to the secret camp at dulcewith any equanimity i told anna i needed some time to straighten things out with him before we could count ourselves safe for now i told her she should go home and stay indoors until i called her better still she should go stay with a friend i had no way of knowing if anna was likely to take my advice since for most of the journey back from tucuman she hadnt really been speaking to me she didnt like my idea about what we were going to do about hans kammler she didnt think it was enough of a punishment and told me that as far as she was concerned our relationship was over maybe she meant that and maybe she didnt there was no time to make sure i was coming out of the richmond when they picked me up a second time it might have been the same three men only it was a little hard to tell with the dark glasses and the matching mustaches the car was another black ford sedan but not the same one that had driven me to caseros this car had a cigarette burn on the rear seat and a large bloodstain on the carpet or it might have been coffee it might have been molasses but over the years you get to recognize a bloodstain when you see one on a car floor i tried to keep calm but this time it wasnt working only i wasnt worried for myself as much as i was worried for anna this was the moment i realized i was in love with her thats usually the way of course its only when you have something taken away that you realize how important it was to you i was worried about her because after all id been warned and in no uncertain terms naturally the colonel would have guessed what i was up to when kammler telephoned him that i was sticking my nose into argentinas biggest secret not the pulqui ii jetfighter aircraft not even an atom bomb but the fate of several thousand illegal jewish refugees the puzzle was why the colonel hadnt just told kammler to kill us both i guessed i was about to find out only this time we sped past caseros where are we going i asked youll find out soon enough growled one of my chaperones mystery tour huh i like surprises you wont like this one he said ominously and the other two laughed you know ive been trying to get in touch with your boss colonel montalban i called him several times last night i need to speak with him very urgently i have some important information for him will he be where were going i glanced out of the window and saw that we were driving southwest i know hell want to speak to me i nodded almost as if trying to convince myself of this but struggling for the right spanish vocabulary to find something else that would convince them of my need to see the colonel i found myself unable to say anything much at all there was a hole in the pit of my stomach the size of the football stadium at la boca my greatest worry was that this metaphorical hole might soon become a real one anyone got a spanish dictionary i asked no one answered how about a cigarette one of the thugs sandwiching me shifted on his backside squeezing me for a moment as he reached for a packet of smokes i caught the smell of sweat on his jacket and the oil in his hair and saw a little blackjack poking out of his breast pocket i hoped it was going to stay there id been blackjacked before and i wasnt keen to repeat the experience he turned back with the packet in his hands and pushed open the little cardboard drawer my fingers reached for one the cigarettes looked like little white heads tucked up in bed which was where i wished i was now i put the cigarette in my mouth and waited while he found his lighter thanks i muttered and bent my head down to the flame too late i remembered it had been an old gestapo trick straight out of the unofficial manual part iii how to silence a talkative suspect in the back of a black car one fist holds the lighter the other comes across from the other side of the car as the suspect ducks down to the flame and knocks him out cold at least thats what i suppose must have happened it was that or the argies really did have an atom bomb and accidentally someone had pressed the fire button instead of the bezel on a cigarette lighter for me the effect was pretty much the same however one minute it was a nice sunny day the next darkness all over the land until the ninth hour and the sensation that i was humming like a very sick bee as if someone had just put twenty thousand volts through a metal cap and a brinesoaked sponge attached to my cranium for a moment or two i thought i heard laughter the same kind of laughter you get when youre a cat in a sack full of stones and someone drops you down a well i hit the water without so much as a splash and disappeared below the surface it was a deep well and the water was very cold the laughter went away i stopped mewing that was the general idea i was pacified the way the gestapo liked for some reason i remembered rudolf diels the first head of the gestapo he only lasted until when goering lost control of the prussian police he ended up as a local government official in cologne or hannover and found himself dismissed altogether when he refused to arrest the citys jews what happened to him after that a sucker punch and a trip to a concentration camp no doubt like poor frieda bamberger who died in the middle of nowhere with rubber seals on the shower doors i couldnt see where i was going but i felt like i was already under the earth i felt my hand poking up through the ground reaching for life someone wrestled my arms around behind my back and tied my wrists together i was blindfolded now i was standing up and leaning across the warm hood of the ford i could hear the sound of airplanes we were at an airport i thought it must be ezeira two men lifted me under the arms and dragged me across the tarmac my feet werent coming with me it didnt seem to hinder our progress the noise of the aircraft engine grew louder a metallic oily smell filled the air and i felt the wind of the propeller in my face it seemed to revive me a little i feel i should warn you i said im not a good air traveler they hauled me up a short flight of metal steps and then flung me down on a hard metallic floor there was something else on the floor besides me the something else shifted and groaned and i realized there were others in the same boat as me except that it wasnt a boat it might have been better if it had been either way i had now guessed what lay ahead of us a river trip the river plate perhaps it was better this way after all at least we wouldnt drown the fall would kill us the door closed and the aircraft began to move someone a man a few feet away was reciting a prayer someone else was retching with fear there was a strong smell of vomit and human incontinence and gasoline so the rumors are true then i said there are no parachutes in the argentine air force a woman started crying i hoped it wasnt anna the plane engines roared just two of them i thought a c dakota most likely you often saw them heading out over the river plate people sitting outside the richmond would look up from their newspapers and their coffees and make jokes about these airplanes there goes the opposition or why cant communists swim in the river plate because their hands are tied together the floor underneath me began to vibrate loudly i felt the plane accelerate and we started our takeoff a few seconds later there was a lurch and we were airborne and the vibration settled into a steady droning rhythm the plane began to climb the woman crying was almost hysterical by now anna i called is that you its me someone slapped me hard across the face no talking said a mans voice he lit a cigarette and suddenly i remembered why i was a smoker the smell of tobacco is the most wonderful smell in the universe when youre facing death i remember being shelled in and how a cigarette had got me through without my losing my nerve or my bowels i wouldnt mind a smoke i said under the circumstances i heard a mans voice murmur something from the opposite end of the aircraft and a few seconds later and much to my surprise some fingers pushed a cigarette between my lips it was already alight i rolled it into the corner of my mouth and let my lungs go to work on it thanks i said i tried to make myself more comfortable it wasnt easy but i hadnt expected it would be the cord around my wrists was as tight as the skin on a fat snake my hands felt like balloons i managed to straighten my legs which werent tied and kicked someone else maybe i would kick a shark in the eye before i drowned always supposing i hit the rio and lived i wondered how high the pilot was planning to go before they started bailing us out minutes passed i was down to the filter i spat the cigarette out of my mouth and it burned my shoulder before ending up on the deck i hoped it might hit a pool of gasoline and cause a small fire that would teach them then what sounded like a handful of gravel hit the fuselage it was raining i took a deep breath and tried to steady myself to make peace with myself negotiations opened slowly i told gunther he should think of himself as one of the lucky ones how many others had ever managed to escape from the russians i was still telling myself how lucky i was when someone interrupted my winning streak and opened the door cold air and rain blasted through the guts of the plane with a sound like the roaring of some terrible cloudmonster a minotaur of the skies that needed to be served with regular human sacrifice it was impossible to guess how many human sacrifices were planned i thought there were at least six or seven of us on that plane with the door open now the engines seemed to throttle back a little there was movement all around me but so far no one had tried to move me toward the door there was some sort of commotion and then a naked woman fell on me i could tell she was naked because her breast squashed against my face and she was screaming as they hauled her off me i decided i had to say something or id be telling it to the seagulls colonel montalban if youre there speak to me you bastard the woman who was screaming started begging them not to kill her it wasnt anna the voice was older more mature huskier not well educated it was hard to say more about her voice because suddenly it was not there and i sensed she wasnt there either behind me a man was praying the same prayer over and over again as if the repetition might make it count for more in the long line of prayers that were already winging their way ahead of us to the divine waiting room from the speed of his prayers and his breathing and the way his position changed i guessed he was next in line to the door and even as i was thinking this he was gone too his final scream as he was bundled out of the plane lost forever in the slipstream of eternity i tried to shake the blindfold off my eyes but it was useless i might as well have had no eyes at all only i wished that they had stopped up my ears as well as they deported the other men and women one by one through the open door of the plane it was like having a frontrow seat in the dress circle of hell i bellowed like a man roasting on a spit cursing their mothers and their fathers and their bastard children i told the colonel what i thought of him and his country and his president and his cancerous wife and how i was going to have the last laugh because only i knew what he and she had dearly wanted to know and that i wasnt going to tell him anything now not even if they did throw me out of the plane i told them that i was spitting in all their faces in the knowledge that at least i was going to die knowing that id thwarted their stupid schemes someone slapped me i ignored it and kept on talking a month from now a week maybe even tomorrow you and that dumb blond whore are going to ask yourself if gunther really knew what he said he knew if he really could have told you what you wanted to find out most in the world where you can find her where shes been hiding all this time dont you want to find out colonel i heard a woman scream several times before the open door silenced her permanently some sadistic part of my brain tried to persuade me that there had been something about her scream that had seemed familiar her perfume too but i wasnt buying it i hadnt any more reason for thinking anna was on the plane than for believing the colonel was if she had done as i had told her and gone to stay with a friend there was every reason to suppose she was all right someone snatched off my blindfold i was just in time to see two of my mustachioed friends carrying a man to the open door behind the wing mercifully the man was unconscious he was wearing just underpants his hands and his feet were tied and he looked like hed been badly beaten either that or his face had been stung by a whole jungleful of bees the less said about his toes the better the two who threw him out of the plane probably thought they were doing him a favor one of them pulled a filthy handkerchief out of his trouser pocket and wiped his brow it was hard work then they looked at me what did you expect said a voice behind me i warned you to leave it alone my neck was painful from when id been slugged but gritting my teeth i turned my head into the pain to meet the colonels eye i didnt expect to find what i found i said i didnt expect the unthinkable not again not here this is supposed to be a new world i didnt expect it would be just like the old one but you know now that ive seen your national airline and how it handles doublebooked passengers suddenly it doesnt seem quite so surprising this he shrugged its easier this way theres no evidence no camps no bodies no graves nothing no one can ever prove anything its a oneway ticket no one comes back to tell the tale who were they anyway those people who disappeared just now people like you gunther people who asked too many questions is that all youve got against me i got a grin going and tried to make my mouth hang on to it like i still had an ace up my sleeve it didnt feel right my lips were trembling too much but from here on a showandtell was all i had going for me if he decided i was bluffing i was in for a flying lesson he knew it i knew it the two stooges by the stillopen door of the dakota knew it hell im a detective colonel its my job to ask too many questions to stick my nose in where its not wanted you of all people should know that everythings my business until i find out what ive been hired to find out thats the way this racket works nevertheless you were warned not to ask questions about directive eleven i couldnt have been more specific i thought after your trip to caseros you might appreciate that a little more keenly he sighed i was wrong of course and now youre in a tight spot truly i regret having to kill you gunther i meant all i said when we first met you really were a hero of mine well then lets get to it i said youre forgetting something surely i dont pray so well these days if thats what you mean and my memory is not so good at altitude how high are we anyway about five thousand feet that explains why its so damned drafty in here perhaps if those two altar boys were to close the door i might warm up a little im like a lizard that way youll be surprised what i can do for you if you just let me sit for a while on a nice warm rock the colonel jerked his head at the door and with a weary look of disappointment like some french catholic noblemen denied the pleasure of defenestrating a bigmouthed huguenot the two men closed it there the colonel said hows your memory now improving all the time perhaps when were on the ground again ill remember evitas daughters name thats assuming she really is evitas daughter to my untutored cynical eye she and the presidents wife looked very unalike youre bluffing gunther maybe but you cant afford to take a chance on that can you if you knew any different colonel id be in the river looking for my old comrades from the graf spee so why not tell me dont make me laugh as soon as ive spilled my guts theres nothing to stop you from spilling me out the door maybe but look at it this way if you tell me when were on the ground theres nothing to stop me killing you in a day or two a week from now youre right i never looked at it that way youd better think of something to put my mind at ease about that possibility or youll wind up not knowing anything at all so what are we going to do i dont know really i dont you work it out youre the colonel perhaps if i had another cigarette and my hands free we might reach some sort of understanding the colonel put his hand in the pocket of his suit it came out with a switchblade as big as a drumstick he turned me around and sawed at the cord binding my wrists while i was rubbing some pain back into my hands he put the knife away and took out his cigarettes he shook one loose from the pack put it into my mouth and then tossed me a book of matches if id had any feeling in my hands i might have caught them one of the colonels thugs picked up the matches and got my cigarette going for me meanwhile the colonel leaned through the open cockpit door and spoke to the pilot a moment later the plane began to turn back toward the city i was desperate to know if anna had been one of those poor people thrown out of the aircraft but i hardly knew how to ask the colonel if i didnt ask about anna he might get the idea there was no one important in my life who might be used against me if i did ask id be putting her in grave danger were going back to ezeira he said i feel better already never was one for air travel i glanced around the inside of the plane there was a large pool of blood and something worse on the floor now that the door was closed i could smell the lingering stench of fear inside the dakota there were some seats up front the colonel sat in one i got up off the floor and went and sat beside him i leaned across his lap and glanced out of the window at the gray river beneath us the people you just murdered i said i suppose that they were communists some were and the others there were women werent there these are enlightened times we live in gunther women can be communists too sometimesno usuallytheyre more fanatical than the men more courageous also i wonder if you could take as much torture as one of the women we just dumped i said nothing you know i could always take you back to caseros have my men go to work on you with that electric cattle prod then youd tell me what i want to know i know a little bit more about torture than you think colonel i know that if you torture a man to make him tell you lots of things then gradually hell give them up one by one but if you torture a man to make him tell you one thing the chances are hell clam up and take it make it a contest of wills now that i know how important this is to you colonel id make it my lifes last mission to say nothing a tough guy huh only when i have to be i believe you are i suppose thats one of the reasons i like you sure you like me thats why you wanted to throw me out of a plane at five thousand feet you dont think i enjoy this sort of thing do you but it has to be done if the communists were in power theyd do the same thing to us i can assure you thats what hitler used to say wasnt he right look what stalin has done its the politics of the cemetery colonel i should know i just crawled out of the one called germany the colonel sighed perhaps youre right but i think its better to live without principles than be righteous and dead thats what ive learned in the cemetery theres this too that ive learned if my father leaves me a gold watch i want my son to have it after me not some paisano carrying a copy of marx hes never read they want my watch theyd better kill me first or its out the door they go theyd better know that in argentina we practice the redistribution of health anyone goes around thinking that all property is theft soon finds out that all killing is not murder the last communist we hang will be the one who helped himself to our rope i dont want to take anything from anyone colonel when i came here i wanted a quiet life remember nothing made your business my business except you for all i care you can hang all the communists in south america on your christmas tree all the nazis too but when you hire me to be your dog and sniff around you shouldnt be surprised if i bark a bit and piss on your flower bed that may be embarrassing to you but thats the way it is i embarrass myself sometimes fair enough fair enough he says you havent played fair with me since i got off the damn boat colonel i want to know everything and when i know everything im going to get off this plane and im going back to my hotel and im going to take a bath and when ive had some dinner and im good and ready and ive understood how everything works im going to tell you what you want to know and when you find that im telling the truth you and von bader and evita are going to be so damned grateful youre even going to pay me like you all said you would as you wish gunther no just what i said what i wish would be too much to expect buenos aires by the time we landed at ezeira i knew almost everything almost i still didnt know if anna yagubsky was dead or alive i found a pay phone and called annas parents who told me they hadnt seen her since the trip to tucuman but that shed left them a note saying she was going to stay with a friend do you know who this friend is i asked roman yagubsky as a matter of fact i thought it might be you if she comes back or calls tell her i need to speak to her urgently always in a hurry he said its the business im in did you find my brother yet not exactly what kind of an answer is that not much of an answer but i wont lose any sleep over it if you think ive done an unsatisfactory job you can refuse to pay me i wont argue about that but when i say not exactly thats exactly what i mean there are rarely any definite answers in the privatedetective business there are only probablys and maybes and notexactlys theyre the kind of answers that are to be found in the crevices of what were allowed to know for sure i have no evidence to say your brother and your sisterinlaw are dead i didnt see their bodies i didnt see their death certificates i didnt speak to anyone who saw them die all the same i know theyre both dead sir its not an exact kind of knowing but there it is fact is its best i dont say any more for your sake and mine there was a silence then senor yagubsky said quietly thank you young man of course ive known they were dead for a while if they were alive theyd have got in touch but a brother is a brother and a twin is a twin and you feel an obligation to find out what you can to have someone independent tell you what you think you know already and youre right of course that isnt an exact kind of knowing but its better than nothing right so thank you again i appreciate your candor not to mention your discretion i know what kind of people are in this government but im a jew senor hausner im used to it maybe if i had more money and i was ten years younger id go and live in israel but i dont and im not so i say may god bless and keep the perons a long way from me and mine dont forget sir tell anna to call me ill be at my hotel i know i know urgently germans every time you people open your mouths i hear a clock ticking hitler might still be in power if he hadnt been in such a hurry to do things the next morning i went to meet the colonel at the jockey club as arranged the luxury of the jockey club of buenos aires would have put any berlin or london club to shame inside there was a great empirestyle rotunda a fine marble statue of the goddess diana and a magnificent staircase that looked like the eighth wonder of the world there were corinthian columns everywhere and these were ornamented with onyx ivory and more lapis lazuli than a russian orthodox cathedral i found the colonel in the libraryalthough calling the library at the jockey club a library was like calling rita hayworth an actress there were plenty of books it was true but nearly all of their bindings were tooled with a little bit of gold so that it was like entering a longlost burial chamber in the valley of the kings and there were some members who clearly belonged in a tomb old men with profiles you might have seen on a thousandpeso note there were no women in that club however they wouldnt know what to do with a woman in the buenos aires jockey club try and saddle her probably or in the colonels case defenestrate her he put down the book he was reading i sat in the chair opposite and curious picked it up im always interested in what mass murderers are reading martin fierro by jose hernandez he said our national poet are you familiar with this no then i give it to you i think youll enjoy it its somewhat romanticized but im sure there are elements that will appeal to you the hero is an impoverished gaucho whose house farm wife and family are all gone destroyed he gets himself into one scrape after another knife fights and other brutal combats and various affairs of honor eventually martin fierro becomes an outlaw pursued by the police militia the colonel smiled perhaps this is a familiar tale to a man like you gunther certainly this book is very popular here in argentina most children grow up able to quote a few stanzas from martin fierro myself i know most of it by heart assuming you have one the colonel smiled almost imperceptibly to business he said there was a briefcase beside his leg he laid his hand on it for a moment in here is one hundred thousand american dollars fifty from evita and fifty from von bader there is also an argentine passport in the name of carlos hausner this bag is yours if you tell me what i want to know the true whereabouts of fabienne von bader lets not forget her mother i said ilse von bader her real mother not evita peron and certainly not isabel pekerman beats me why you went to all that trouble originally we thought it might add to the sense of urgency if you believed that only the girl had disappeared a girl who merely goes away with her mother hardly needs to be found with any great urgency true but why the evita story as well evita is a woman who believes in the personal touch as im sure you remember she thought that an appeal to you from her in person would encourage you to find fabienne she was very good i said but then she is an actress after all what will happen to them to ilse to fabienne they will be kept here in buenos aires kept safe no harm will come to them i can assure you as i told you on the plane von bader is the only one of the three remaining trustees of the reichsbank accounts with a family therefore he is the only trustee who can be trusted to go to zurich and do what we require him to do which is to sign over the reichsbank accounts to the perons ilse von bader feared allowing herself and her daughter to become hostages for her husbands safe return that is why they disappeared which left our plans in obvious disarray since we could hardly let von bader go to zurich without some guarantee that he would come back again the colonel lit a cigarette so as soon as you tell me where they are hiding we can pick them up and he can be on his way how much is there i asked in the zurich account no one knows for sure not even the trustees but in all likelihood its several billion dollars i whistled in the jockey club it sounded like a bomb falling out of a junkers stolen of course i said from millions of murdered jews the colonel shrugged perhaps so however youve seen what she does with the money she gives it away to the sick and the poor can you think of a better thing to do with it shes buying an electorate dont be so naive all electorates are bought in one way or another promises to reduce unemployment promises to reduce taxes promises to raise public spending theres not much difference between that and what evita does and whos to say her way isnt less wasteful with no money used up by a bureaucracy he smoked patiently so where are they i had little desire to help the perons but it was that or the plane ride to the bottom of the river theyre living with your friend hans kammler i said at wiederhold his ranch near tucuman posing as his wife and daughter thats impossible said the colonel no its not you must have made a mistake his real wife and daughter are living at ingenios it was i who arranged their visas to come here from germany more than a year ago i think id know if it wasnt them perhaps i didnt make myself clear i didnt say they were his wife and daughter i said they were posing as his wife and daughter it took me a while to recognize fabienne she calls herself mercedes now and has dyed her hair red but her father von bader was right shes still a real beauty only it wasnt she who captivated kammler it was ilse shes a beauty too kammler is very much in love with her so where are his real wife and daughter kammlers a rich man colonel hes got a plane in his back garden my guess is that he paid the real wife off with a nice piece of change and then flew her and his real daughter to chile set them up somewhere else maybe theyre already back in germany i didnt know he had a plane up there hes got it all up there wealth a beautiful home a beautiful mistress i almost envied him kammler the colonel frowned how very ungrateful of him his frown deepened youre sure of this of course im sure i always remember a face especially a pretty face its names i have a problem with yes i think i believe you the colonel shrugged in which case this is yours he patted the briefcase you know its nice to be proved right about someone i was right about you in your own haphazard way youre a hell of a detective gunther he nodded thoughtfully yes perhaps that was it you were the random factor that was needed in this case if you say so colonel incidentally the passport contains visas to a number of foreign countries including uruguay brazil cuba and spain theres also a firstclass ticket for tonights riverboat service to montevideo leaving at twentyone hundred hours i know how much you dislike air travel anyway i strongly suggest you be on that boat very strongly you can leave the car in the compania de navegacion fluvial argentina office at the ferry station getting rid of me is that it as i said to you before many times in argentina it is better to know everything than to know too much im afraid that now you know too much like isabel pekerman for example leaving the country for good is the only possible solution for a man who wont disappear he smiled his infernal smile i hope ive made myself very clear this time very i was thinking of leaving anyway dont judge us too harshly what happened at dulce was regrettable i agree but that was several years ago directive eleven was found to be necessary to stop the country from being swamped with jews but still they came and the question soon arose as to what we should do with all those we had arrested and interned finally it was decided that it might be easier just to get rid of them as quickly and quietly as possible so kammler built argentina its own death camp yes but on a very much smaller scale than anything he had built in poland there were no more than fifteen or twenty thousand jews at most and since then things have changed for the better an amnesty for all foreigners who entered the country illegally was granted last year there are no illegal jews held in camps like dulce anymore and the people who implemented directives eleven and twelve have now been removed so there is even less antisemitism than there was many jews are now peronists peron himself now believes that the jews can actually help argentina that their money and enterprise can help our economy to grow after all what is it you germans say why slaughter the chicken that lays the golden eggs jews are welcome in argentina the colonel pointed a salutary finger in the air all jews except one there is one jew who ought to be on that boat with you perhaps anna yagubsky never heard of her yes it might be a good idea continued the colonel ignoring me if she accompanied you tonight things might be difficult for her if she stayed here in argentina i dont know where she is well she cant have disappeared can she if she had id know about it wouldnt i and if she hasnt disappeared she wont be hard to find not for a detective like you gunther for her sake i hope not and who knows maybe the two of you can find happiness somewhere youre a little old for her perhaps but i believe some women like the older man what if she wont come with me her parents are here theyre old she wont want to leave them that would be unfortunate for you of course after all she is very beautiful but for her especially the colonel stood up i hope you enjoy your trip to uruguay its government is stable democratic and politically mature theres even a welfare state of course the people are entirely european in origin i believe they exterminated all the indians as a german you should feel very much at home there buenos aires it took me three hours to find anna her father was no help i might just as well have asked where martin bormann was hiding eventually i remembered that the person who lived upstairs from isabel pekerman and who had reported her suicide had also been a friend of annas all i knew was that her name was hannah and that she lived in once bisected by calle corrientes and the jewish quarter once was an ugly area with an ugly railway station an ugly plaza out front of it and a rather ugly monument in the center of this ugly plaza at an ugly police station known to locals as the miserere i showed my side identification to an ugly desk sergeant and asked about the pekerman case he told me the address and i went to an ugly building on calle paso it was full of ugly smells and ugly music there was no getting away from it argentina had lost some of its charm for me a dark and coarsefeatured woman came to the door of the apartment above isabel pekermans she had hair like the tail of a noriker mare much of it on her cheeks and a complexion like the inside of a coffeepot is anna here i asked the woman rubbed her cromagnon chin with vaguely hominid fingers and smiled an uncertain smile that revealed gaps in her teeth as big as the keys on a typewriter she seemed like the living proof not just of some improbable paleontological theory but more important durkheims first law of sisterhood which states that every beautiful woman shall have a really ugly best friend who wants to know its all right hannah said a voice holding the door the friend stepped back into the apartment to reveal anna standing a few feet behind her she was wearing a gabardine dress in a blue houndstooth print with a nippedin waist her arms were folded defensively in front of her the way women do when theyre aching to hit you with a rolling pin how did you find me she asked as the friend went back to her stall im a detective remember its what i do find people sometimes i can even find people who dont want to be found well you got that part right gunther i shut the door behind me and glanced around the ugly little hallway there was a hat stand a doormat an empty dog basket that had seen many better days the ubiquitous picture of martel the tango singer and the bag that had accompanied anna to tucuman so did you tell your friends in the secret police about your friends in the ss thats a nice way of putting it but yes i did and i imagine theyre on their way there now as i tried to explain on the train kammlers wife and child are really someone elses wife and child and whatever domestic happiness they once enjoyed is now over and you think thats punishment enough i shrugged punishment is a little like beauty sometimes subjective true lasting punishment at any rate i prefer the kind of punishment that everyone can understand oh you mean like a public execution isnt that what he really deserves probably but we both know that isnt going to happen in the long run i suspect hell get whats coming to him we all do eventually i wish i could believe that take it from someone who knows hmm i wonder youre a hard woman anna its a hard world isnt it thats why im here now that the police know what i know ive been told to leave the country and just to make sure i got the message they took me for a ride in a plane with the door open and showed me the river plate from five thousand feet the bottom line is that i can be on tonights boat to montevideo or i can be underneath it they actually threatened you i laughed you make it sound so much nicer than it was anna i was blindfolded punched in the head with my hands tied and allowed a last cigarette for good measure they threw six people out of the plane ahead of me for a moment i thought one of them was you then it was my turn if i hadnt been able to trade the information about kammlers wife and daughter id be tomorrows shark shit i sighed look can we sit down i still get kind of wobbly thinking about it yes of course please come through we went into an artyfarty sort of living room that was probably more farty than arty everything had been painted with an italian filigree the walls the furniture the doors the electric fan a piano even a typewriter there was an artists palette and some brushes on a filigreed table hannahs an artist explained anna i nodded and told myself i probably had about ten minutes before hannah came and started painting a design on my forehead maybe it needed one too you can grow tired of seeing the same face in the mirror every day thats why people get married so what are you going to do she asked sitting down im not much of a swimmer i said especially when my hands are tied behind my back its been made clear to me that i can spend the rest of my life dead or i can go so im going to montevideo tonight im sorry about that she said and kissed my hand really i am then she let out a sigh i dont know why im surprised most men who are good to meand you have been good to me bernie dont think i dont appreciate what youve donemost of them end up leaving my father says its because i dont know how to hang on to a man with respect to your father its very simple angel especially in this case you dont have to say anything you dont have to do anything not a thing oh maybe just thread your arm through mine and come with me to montevideo why not thats where im going i cant leave bernie this is my home my father and mother live here they left russia because of persecution didnt they yes but that was different somehow i dont think your aunt and your uncle would agree you said you werent sure about that you said we dont know who those people were that they could have been anyone we both know i only told you that to stop you from getting us both killed yes only i do wish id listened to you in the first place you were right sometimes its better not to know i thought dead was dead and that was as bad as it could get well now i know different but maybe i want to forget about it now im not asking you to leave on my account i said but your own the secret police told me that given you know what i know it would be advisable for you to leave the country too im really sorry to have to tell you this anna but i worry about what will happen to you if you stay it could easily be you thats thrown out of the next plane over the river plate is this another lie to make me come with you she pushed her long tangle of hair out of her eyes and shook her head i cant leave i wont i put my hands on her shoulders and shook her gently listen to me anna id like you to come with me but if you dont want to i can understand that only with or without me you have to leave tonight it doesnt have to be uruguay if you like ill buy you an air ticket to wherever you want to go theres a pluna office around the corner well go there now and ill get you a ticket to asuncion la paz wherever you want ill even give you some money to get yourself started somewhere else ten thousand american dollars twenty but you have to leave the country i cant leave my parents she said theyre old then ill pay for them too we can send for them when we get to montevideo its not so far ill buy us a big house where we can all live i promise you it will be fine well manage only you do have to believe me the police know about you they know your name almost certainly they know where you live and where you work this is serious anna one morning soon youll be on your way to work and theyll pick you up and take you to caseros theyll strip you naked and abuse you torture you and when theyre finished torturing you theyll put you on a plane and theyll throw you out of the door if you stay here angel theres nothing left for you but prayer i heard one on the plane yesterday over and over again and guess what it didnt work they threw him out anyway these people theyre immune to prayer theyll listen to your prayers and theyll laugh and then theyll throw you out no there were tears in her eyes but she was shaking her head with disbelief this is just another lie of convenience like telling me those people in the burial pits at dulce were not jews youre just saying all this because you cant bear the idea of going away on your own i cant blame you for wanting me along if i were you id probably say the same thing i like you a lot bernie but ill get over it we both will only i do wish youd stop trying to scare me thats pretty low of you you cant believe im making this up surely why not bernie everything about you is made up i really dont know anything about you i told you everything there was to know on the train how do i know that all i know for sure is that youre here on a false passport even the real name youre supposed to have given to your old comradesthe ones who brought you hereeven thats not yours that man at the ranch heinrich grund you told me he was a murderer but you knew him he greeted you like he was an old friend he was once before the war before hitler i had lots of friends before hitler for all i know youre one of them too how can i possibly trust you how can i believe a word you say im a jew and youre an exss officer what kind of trust could there ever be between us you came to me for help i reminded her i helped you the best i could im trying to help you now i asked for nothing in return whatever you gave you gave because you wanted to i saved your life once before im trying to save it again i put my own life in peril for you i have to leave the country because of you maybe that doesnt mean so much to you but im still glad i did id have done anything for you i suppose what im trying to say is that i love you anna well what of it theres just this if theres any small part of you that feels the same way i do then forget everything else forget everything your head tells you and listen to your heart because thats all that matters between two people i know im not much of a catch for a girl like you you could do a lot better i know if you werent standing in an airplane doorway id probably tell you to go and do a lot better too but youre there i can see the bruises on your face and the wind in your hair angel i pulled her toward me and kissed her hard as if trying to breathe some sense into her body she put her arms around me and kissed me back so that for a minute or two i almost thought it might be working then she said i suppose i do love you but i wont leave the country for you i wont i cant every time i see you it reminds me of what happened to my aunt and uncle i wanted to slap her hard on both cheeks the way youre supposed to when youve been in the ss that might have worked too with anyone but anna hitting her would have been like giving the hitler salute it would only have confirmed what she already suspected that i was a nazi i let her go listen angel this probably isnt going to work but ill try it once more and then ill leave you alone when two people are in love theyre supposed to look out for each other being in love doesnt make any difference she said its not enough of a reason let me finish when you get a little oldermaybe too oldyoull understand that it makes all the difference to everything and anything even as i said it i knew it wasnt going to happen she wasnt going to get any older not if colonel montalban was as bad as his word love is all the reason you need angel its the only reason in the world that exists for you to trust me that might not be the kind of reason that would satisfy a greek in a chiton i dont know if you could ever use that kind of reason as the basis for a truth that exists outside of ourselves but all i know is that you have to give it a chance if youre to know if someone is what we want or what we think we want it needs a little time lets just make it this come with me for just a few days as if we were just going back on the train to tucuman and then if it doesnt work out you can say to hell with you gunther im going back to buenos aires because id rather die than be with a man like you so dont say another word just now think carefully about what ive said speak to your father i did hell give you some good advice fathers usually do ill buy you a ticket for tonights boat we can be in montevideo in less time than it takes to say that ill wait for you at the cnfa office and then i left buenos aires that night it rained heavily the river was calm the tide and the moon were full somewhere on the other side of the plate was uruguay i stood in the office of the cnfa staring out of the window at the pier and the boat and the waves lapping at the jetty i kept half an eye on the clock with each shuddering movement of the second hand i felt my hopes ebbing away i wasnt the first man to be stood up by a woman i wouldnt be the last thats how poetry gets written what are you supposed to do when you know youll be murdered if you stay behind to be with a girl you love meet death together like you were both in some crummy movie it doesnt work that way you dont get to walk out of the picture hand in hand to the sound of some invisible choir heralding your joint arrival in paradise when death comes its usually nasty and brutish and sharp i should know id seen it often enough a voice came on the tannoy loudspeaker the last call for passengers on the twentyone hundred to montevideo she wasnt coming i walked along the pier and felt it move under my feet as if i had been standing on the breathing chest of some enormous giant rain sprayed my face a melancholy rain like the tears of the night wind that stirred my hair i stepped off argentina and into the boat there were other passengers but i didnt notice them instead i remained on deck waiting for the miracle that wasnt going to happen i even started to hope that the colonel might show up to see me off so that i could beg for annas life but he didnt come either the rumbling engines roared into life they were casting off our ties water stirred in a maelstrom underneath the boat and we lurched away from the pier from buenos aires from her we retreated into darkness like some abandoned pagan thing cast adrift from the world of men overwhelmed with selfpity and confusion and struggle and flight i almost threw myself over the side and into the sea in the hope of swimming to the vast edges of the shore instead i went below in the galley a steward lit a little gas ring to boil some water for coffee the blue flame girdling the pot tickled it quietly and i pictured that other flame the small quiet flame inside me that burned with neither joy nor peace nor hope nor help from lonely pain not for adolf hitler but for her it burned for her
