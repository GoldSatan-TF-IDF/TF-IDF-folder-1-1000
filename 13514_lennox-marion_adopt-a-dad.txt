marion lennox adoptadad book in the maitland maternity series prologue married the first of her babies was now a married woman leeann stared at the pages of the maitland maternity clinic newsletter and the laughing face of her firstborn daughter glowed at her it was lana leeanns precious child lana was one of her four children but she was standing now not as a sister but as part of a couple what did the caption say with this ring i thee wed the insert photo was of a truly breathtaking diamond lana lord married to dylan van zandt who was this dylan leeann ached to know his face was proud yet gentletender yet firm he looked as if hed be a loving husband to her daughter but how could she tell from a picture she stirred in bed wincing from the pain why didnt she have the courage to face them she asked herself bleakly why couldnt she take this last step and meet her children in person there was another shot next to the wedding pictureone of the guests almost every person there had some connection to the clinic and right in front of her on the page was the rest of her brood the caption stated they were megan maitlands godchildren and identified megan as the founder of maitland maternity but leeann knew that already shed found out so much in these past few weeks shed managed to get herself onto the mailing list for the clinics newsletter and shed hoarded every piece of information she could find from the last twentyfive years so now she almost knew them here was her lovely garrett looking strong and stern and proud garrett was her firstborn hed been the one to take charge even from infancy shelby was next to him her auburn hair just what her mothers had been so many years ago and that lovely smile and michael standing slightly apart leeanns heart stilled there was trouble with michael she looked at the picture for a long long time searching these faces she really didnt know at all and yet knew so well they were part of her michael was her son even though shed abandoned her children as babies she knew his face like she knew her own there was trouble in michaels face she thought his expression was shuttered and with a pang of distress she saw a suffering there that she recognized as her own all those years ago when shed left her four small children to be cared for by strangers michael she whispered my little one whats wrong there was no answer how could there be leeann was in a hospice in the final stages of incurable cancer and her children didnt even know her name they were no longer her little ones they were adults and unaware of her existence or maybe not had megan maitland given them her gifts given them her message shed sent the three little sweaters shed made herself all those years ago each embroidered with a triplets name and shed tucked in garretts teddy the one shed used as her only comfort over the years it didnt matter she told herself bleakly shed sent them that was enough they were tokens to tell them that they were lovednothing more these lovely young adults smiling at her from the newsprint were no longer part of her life shed forfeited her right to know them when shed abandoned them as babies all those years ago but she couldnt stop gazing at the pictures question after question forming in her heart did they know shed had no choice did they realize that once gary had died thered been so many debts so little moneyno support at allthat to keep them would have been cruel did they judge her harshly or could they sense that the cruelest cut had been to herto walk away from their lives and leave the loving to strangers she loved them still how could she not but she was their mother by birth only they had no need of her but dear lord she needed them and michael what was wrong with michael chapter one gray suits were gray suits no matter which side of the world they were on jenny saw them coming from a mile off and panicked in style as secretary to michael lord head of security at austins maitland maternity clinic she was used to people arriving at her desk staff patients cops and mediashe knew them all and welcomed them with cheerful efficiency but not gray suits not when they were coming for her they hadnt seen her yet theyd stopped at reception and were asking directions peggy was smiling and pointing toward her door and they were turning to look the security offices had oneway windows however so staff could see the reception area without patients and visitors knowing they were being observed which gave jenny time she had a whole ten seconds to consider her choices fainting falling to the floor in hysterics on second thoughtsix seconds of second thoughtmaybe those choices werent all that useful there was only one option left she figured escape through her bosss office michael would hate it bolting through his office was hardly something a professional secretary was supposed to do but she had no choice she stood up staggering a little with the weight of advanced pregnancy and took a leap like a scared and very pregnant rabbit right through michaels door garrett this is a waste of time michael lord swiveled in his leather chair and sighed into the phone what garrett was arguing was water under the bridgetwentyfive years of water in fact since theyd been abandoned on the hospital steps as babies those years hadnt been bad michael decided he his triplet siblings and their big brother garrett had been granted great adoptive parents they had good lives in their chosen professions with friends and family all around the woman whod deserted her babies so long ago obviously hadnt wanted anything more to do with them so why wouldnt garrett leave it alone she didnt want them and they didnt want her simple as that it wouldnt hurt to search garrett said weve had great parents michael said stubbornly we dont need any more family sometimes i dont think you need the family you have garrett snapped you sit there in your coldasice apartment without even a dog to are we talking about finding our birth mother or are we talking of my private life michaels voice was as harsh as his brothers and it was garretts turn to sigh so you wont help ive already told you im not interested and anyway i dont see how i can with your resources mike youve been a cop you have maitland maternitys network behind you and you know megan will support us you have contacts everywhere and moneys hardly a problem look come to dinner on saturday night and well talk about it theres already camille and jakes wedding celebration on sunday i dont need any more family events this weekend yeah and ill bet you intend to stick around for the party after the wedding just like you did after lanas look mike this is just us shelbys cooking and lana and dylan will bring the baby domesticity was closing in michaels resolve firmed no way if youre not there youll be the only one of the lord kids whos not tell dylan to take my place then the familys changing now lanas marriedwell things arent the same we dont need each other as much funny how his gut kicked at the thought of it michael reflected wryly thered always been the four of them michael and lana and shelby the triplets with garrett watching over them like a hawk michael hadnt thought he minded that lana was married who could when she was so happy but his gut definitely kicked were still family garrett said stubbornly we need to talk through our plans to find our birth mother your plans i told you im not doing any michael stopped in astonishment his secretarycalm unflappable and cheerful jennycrashed through the door as if the hounds of hell were after her she shoved the door closed behind her and leaned against it as wideeyed and pale as michael had ever seen her she looked terrified he wasnt head of security for nothing their birth mother could wait emergency he snapped and dropped the phone into its cradle before garrett had time to say another word only it wasnt an emergency or not one he could see michael crossed swiftly to the window and stared out as in jennys office his interior windows were only transparent one way he could see jennys reception area which was empty and the main foyer beyond there were a few visitors milling around reception nothing noteworthy there the receptionists looked calm and unconcerned two innocuous men in gray suits were walking toward jennys door the way she was acting youd think the men were carrying machine guns which was crazy but michael was trained to act first and ask questions later what he saw on jennys face was terror hed be a fool to ignore terror and michael lord was no fool in one fast motion he tugged jenny away from the door pulling her easily against his chest then he flicked the switch shed been leaning against smoothly the security panels slid into place locking the doors and windows and making the smoky glass an impervious bulletproof screen theyd needed these precautions just once since the hospital was built and hed hoped he would never have to use them again but by the look on jennys face he needed them now okay jenny out the back she pulled away tugging out of his arms she was breathing way too fast for someone as pregnant as she was michael i need to go i must theyre after me the back door yeah he had a back door a handy little escape route that led into the rear parking lot but you didnt bolt from the enemy before you knew who your enemy was they were secure enough here if theyre searching for you then maybe theyll have someone waiting out the back jenny who are they she shook her head her face bloodless with shock michaels hold on her tightened his big hands gripping her shoulders heck she was thin hed never really noticed that before in a detached sort of waythe way he saw most peoplehed noticed her pregnancy but not the frailness of her body beneath it with her green eyes huge in her pale face and her mass of dark brown curls shoved from her face in terror she was really quite beautiful he thought suddenly holding her against him funny how hed never noticed that until now her terror wasnt subsiding though once again michael turned to stare at the graysuited visitors theyd entered jennys office and were inspecting her desk one reached over and opened her drawer rifling through her belongings michaels jaw set in anger they had no right to be searching the place he was half inclined to throw open the door and demand to know what they thought they were doing but jennys terror stopped him he hit the oneway intercom on his desk so he could hear what they were saying then turned to jenny the doors locked he said quietly trying to allay her shuddering fear they cant hear us they cant see us and they cant get in theres no way someone can get in here short of using dynamite theyll wait gloria must have put them onto me now they know i have to leavenow what on earth was going on who the heck was gloria michael didnt have a clue he could only wait until she was calm enough to tell him he put his arms around her shoulders and drew her against him restraining her urge to dash for the back door she was so darned small five four or so compared with his six foot hed hardly noticed her in the past few months apart from being grateful hed finally found someone efficient to run his office how could he not have noticed how pregnantand how lovelyshe was there was a thumping on his door as the men turned their attention from jennys desk to his inner sanctum from outside the room the walls looked like mirrored glass theyd see nothing and theyd hear nothing is anyone in there mr lord could you come out please we need to speak to you the voice of the older of the men seemed accustomed to command the two of them looked annoyed but nothing more this wasnt a pair of menacing thugs there wasnt a gun in sight more knocking exasperated this time they were bureaucrats michael thought so what on earth was jenny scared of and then there was a female voice and michael sighed with relief as he saw ellie enter jennys office ellie maitland was the hospital administrator and the only person whod know the security screens and bolts had come down in his office a small red light would have flashed on her desk as the screens dropped shed figure that for some unknown reason michael was in trouble or else thered been a mistake but ellie wasnt the sort to assume hed made a mistake without checking she should have telephoned michael thought grimly instead of coming but the graysuited visitors didnt look physically threatening ellie certainly didnt think they did can i help you gentlemen she cast a flickering glance at jennys desk and michael knew shed noticed the opened drawer and the shifted jumble of papers on the desktop shed be puzzled trying to figure out what was going on but nothing of that was sounding in her voice were here to see mrs morrow the older suit said mrs there was a trace of uncertainty in ellies voice as if she was trying to place the namewhich she wouldnt be ellie knew the names of every one of her staff members and every detail of their lives right down to what theyd had for breakfast that morning her uncertainty was assumed buying time finally her voice cleared oh you mean mr lords secretary jenny thats right the voice was in no mood for hesitation where is she silence michael couldnt suppress a grin as ellie gazed around the outer office with helpful and entirely assumed stupidity she doesnt seem to be here can you open the inner office please its the office of our security chief she apologized im afraid i cant do that i dont have authorization isnt mr lord inside hes not answering and we need to check were from the department of immigration there was a pause as two id cards were produced in michaels arms jenny quivered once and was still open please i still cant do that ellie said apologetically unless you people have a warrant we dont have a warrant has mr lord done something illegal no its mrs morrow were interested in but shes not here once more her tone conveyed helpful stupidity she may be in with mr lord if michael was in his office then hed answer the door not if he was hiding someone why on earth would he be hiding someone ellie asked exasperated hiding jenny do you mean why would he be doing that shes been sitting out here for all the world to see for the past few months shes probably just gone to the ladies room if you people would care to wait theres a coffee shop down the hall contact lord the older suit ordered ellie visibly stiffened i beg your pardon if hes your security chief then you can contact him the man said brusquely surely of course i can contact him do it ellie practically bristled and once more michael had to suppress a grin jenny was still struggling in an attempt to reach the back door as if the men could burst in any minute but there was no chance of that ellie might have a key to his office on the bunch at her waist but by their rudeness jenny had just gained herself a powerful ally once annoyed ellie was one mean opponent but ellie didnt refuse to contact him she gazed at the two men for a long considering moment then raised the cell phone at her belt she dialed and the phone on michaels hip vibrated shh its okay they cant hear us but stay right here thats an order he put a hand on jennys hair in reassurance and gently moved her away from him then pressed her into the chair by his desk he fixed her with a look waited until he was sure she wouldnt argue and then he pushed the response button on his phone yes michael im right here ellie there was nothing in his voice to suggest he could see her and there was nothing in hers to suggest she knew he probably could what can i do for you there are two gentlemen in your office from she paused and michael saw her lift one of the mens cards from his hand then the other from the department of immigration a mr harness and his associate mr gibbs theyre looking for mrs morrow for jenny he deliberately spoke loudly so theyd hear what he said through ellies handpiece it was lucky hed checked these screens for soundproofing he thought what do they want with jenny i have no idea will you tell me where she is will you tell me where she is great michael thought wryly he had no idea what was going on and until he found out he had no intention of handing jenny over but he still didnt like lying if jenny was involved in something illegal he didnt want to get any more involved than he already was will you tell me where she is let him off the hook nicely he deflected things ive given jenny the rest of the day off he said ill be out of the office myself this afternoon the officers want to interview her what for he asked mildly and watched through the glass as ellie turned and put her question to the officers why do you need to speak to jenny he half expected no reply but they answered maybe seeing no risk in letting ellie know their business and with the intercom on he could hear every word her entry visa expires on monday the older man said shes due to leave the country but its only thursday ellie frowned if i remember correctly shes due to finish up here on fridaytomorrow shes british isnt she i assumed shed be flying home then according to our information shes eight months pregnant the officer snapped the airlines wont carry women on international flights when pregnancy is so advanced thats hardly my business ellie said mildly but i dont employ illegal immigrants nor does jenny expect me to i remember jenny made it very clear when she applied for the job that shed only be working here for a few months so shell be back tomorrow i imagine so ellie glanced at her watch signifying her time was short and not to be wasted i believe the secretarial staff is having farewell drinks for her in the cafeteria tomorrow afternoon now if youll excuse me do you have her home address i do ellie sighed itll be in personnel records we need to see it then come this way ellie said dourly but it may take me some time to find it my computer has just crashed ill have to send someone to the basement for a hard copy bless her heart michael thought she was giving him time and letting him know it did you get that michael she said into the phone if you see jenny let her know immigration wishes to speak with her she clicked the phone dead come with me gentlemen she said and ushered them firmly out of the office but as she closed the door behind them she faced michaels office through the oneway glass and raised her eyebrows in a very odd look the door was barely closed behind them when jenny was out of her chair heading for the back door michael caught her as she passed and held her wrist as one might a fugitive jenny i must go not until i know whats going on i she took a ragged breath and tried for control her eyes were huge in her pale face she looked about sixteen michael thought though he was sure her personnel records said midtwenties i guess i mean theyre right she stammered im an illegal immigrant according to them not until monday he frowned its unlike our immigration department to check on people before theyve overstayed i told you gloria will have sent them whos gloria mymy motherinlaw your motherinlaw he considered that a moment but no he couldnt figure this one out at all jenny was british he knew but hed never heard any talk of a husband come to think of it hed never heard any talk at all jenny was bright and bubbly and talkativeabout everyone but herself but she did wear a wedding ring jenny youre not going anywhere unless you tell me whats going on michael said mildly ellie and i have just perjured ourselvesor almost perjured ourselvesto protect you we have the right im not a criminal she said and a flash of anger behind her eyes showed michael that she was recovering the woman had spirit her spirit was the one thing hed noticed right from the start it was why she still had a job michael had gone through about six secretaries before jenny arrived he was professionally demanding and he expected his staff to work as hard as he did one by one secretaries had left and mostly theyd left with a litany of complaints mr lord didnt appreciate them they said mr lord expected them to work overtime without complaining and he didnt care about their social lives but jenny had arrived set herself efficiently to work and hadnt looked back shed come on a temporary basis when his need had been urgentthe last of his line of secretaries had left without warning in the middle of a work crisisand shed stayed for as long as he could keep her sure michael had snapped at her and usually she took it without a murmur occasionally though shed stood up to him and when she had shed done it with spunk no mr lord i cant stay tonight i have an appointment after work i dont care about your appointment i have work that needs doing now shed smiled and gone on with her typing so what did your last slave die of sorry mr lord i cant do it i do have the civility to care about your work even if you dont care about my appointment but it doesnt make one bit of difference i cant change my appointment if you dont like it then phone the agency and hope theyll send you someone more amenable or alternatively ill come in early and see what i can do then thats not good enough thats the best i can do mr lord like it or lump it and shed smile sweetly and take herself off to her appointment with him staring after her baffled then hed come in the next morning to find his work done as promised and jenny acting just as if she hadnt refused him at all but he knew she would again finally hed learned to ask rather than demand and the last few months had been tension free but she was leaving tomorrow he thought he frowned jennys baby had to come sometime and secretaries came and went they werent something he bothered about he was bothering about jenny now so tell me he growled and the spark of challenge flared in jennys eyes she really was recovering or youll sack me nice try but im leaving tomorrow anyway in fact she sighed i guess now im leaving tonight im sorry mr lord but im being forced to quit early can you say goodbye to everyone for me where are you going i dont think you want to know that she said gently looking longingly at the door youve helped me enough i dont want you to lie on my behalf i can act stupid he assured her i dont need to lie you act stupid ha and you dont need to know silence there was no answer to that this was the end then he thought she was asking no more michael could open his door let her leave and never see her again that should suit him fine he didnt get involved with anyone much less a hugely pregnant malnourished illegal immigrant of a secretary with the worries of the world on her shoulders so he could say goodbye and leave it at thatbut for the life of him he couldnt are you going back to england he asked and watched as the color washed from her face again no but do you have somewhere to go mexico she said softly only a tiny tremor in her voice spoiling the bravado of her words you have friends in mexico no but he sighed you know you cant go back to your apartment theyll expect you there i know that so youre heading for mexico without baggage without friends and how do you expect to get over the border theyll have immigration checks there as well ill manage her words were an angry defensive snap but there was fear behind them the borders hardly heavily policed i can do it what by hiking through the desert in the dead of night very clever silence he shouldnt get involved no way but how could he not michael sighed took a deep breath and jumped right in he grabbed his jacket from the back of his chair and opened the door lets get out of here he said but but what you dont need to come she glared im on my own i can see youre on your own thats what i dont like its none of your business you know if you said it was my business then id fight you every inch of the way he said sourly but damn it woman i have enough moral fiber to think i cant allow you to sneak over the border with nothing except the clothes youre wearing and no friends to meet you she glowered again trapped she didnt want his help she didnt want anyones help i dont need your morals neither do i he said dryly i dont need em at all unfortunately i have em and so does ellie shell want to know what the heck ive done with you and if i tell her what you intend doing and that ive allowed it shell be after me with a horsewhip so you can say im doing this because the maitlands are head of this place and i work for the maitlands good enough for you she glowered again no itd better be he took her arm because thats the way it is like it or lump it lady lets go chapter two he took her to her apartment first we have maybe twenty minutes he told her ellie will hold them that long so we move fast you dont have to just shut up he told her kindly like it or not im embroiled in this mess so i might as well be embroiled all the way which wasnt exactly true he decided as he drove fast through austins afternoon traffic he wasnt really embroiled in this messyet at this stage he could put her out of the car and walk away but there was no way he could do that and it wasnt the thought of ellies anger that was keeping him in here it was the set look on jennys face the look of despair combined with that stubborn look of pride shed go to the wall alone he thought as he watched her she had sheer raw courage whatever mess she was in she wasnt facing it alone he decided not while michael lord was around to help her but why he felt that way he didnt have a clue he didnt get involved with women not ever a very pregnant secretary didnt really count as a woman he told himself did she he couldnt answer that question instead he concentrated on driving fast and outmaneuvering the suits some questions were just too hard to answer the place she lived in was the pits michael stopped in front of a rundown apartment block in the poorest part of town and grimaced then steered his corvette around the corner and out of sight the neighborhood was no better around the corner it wasnt the sort of place to leave a corvette much less a pregnant woman youve been living here all the time youve worked for me he demanded why shouldnt i jennys voice was defensive whats wrong with it its a dump can we spare the thoughts on my taste in housing for some other time she asked with asperity worry replaced by indignation anyway i like it its friendly you try being a povertystricken single mom in a rich neighborhood and see how many friends you make so if you really are going to help me yeah right he sighed the place hed put the car was deserted and well out of sight jenny would have to stay in the car he didnt like leaving her but there was hardly a choice he had to move fast and if there was one thing jennys bulk didnt let her do it was that tell me which is your apartment and give me the keys im coming she was still crabby no jenny youre not he put his hands on her shoulders and propelled her onto her seat im going in fast im staying out of sight which is something ive been trained to be good at im getting out of there even faster and if theres a knock on the door while im in there then ill be out the back window like a rat down the drainpipe assuming theres a back window theres a back window but no buts can you shinny down a drainpipe that brought a grin she glanced at her pregnant bulge and her eyes twinkled with sudden laughter she looked better that way michael thought maybe not but then leave the shinnying to me he hesitated i cant bring everything ill just grab what i can i may only have a few minutes i dont have much theres a bag under the bed youll hardly fill it funnywhy had he known shed say something like that the lady was right there sure wasnt much michael stared around her dreary apartment in stunned silence he had two sisters and lana and shelby nested in fact when theyd lived together his sisters had nested all over the house he was used to masses of clothes bathrooms cluttered with toiletries bedrooms with bright fabrics and huge cushionsthe sort of place where a girl could come home and relax with style there was no way jenny could come home and relax in any comfort at all he thought much less with style the oneroom apartment had a narrow iron bed in one corner which was made up with essential bedclothes there was a shabby wardrobe a card table had one chair beside it another chair acted as a bedside table and there was nothing more he had no time for investigation though a leather suitcase was under her bed he grabbed it and discovered it was already half packed with little furniture she was obviously using it for storage that made things easy there were a couple of dresses in the wardrobeshapeless things like the one she was wearing now it took him two minutes to collect her meager toiletries from the bathroom there was nothing else except for a small clock and a picture frame on her bedside chair they all went quickly into the case though he paused a moment to glance at the photo a young man stared at him fair and goodlooking laughing at the camera as if he was laughing at life in general he looked as if he didnt have a worry in the world was this the son of the fearful motherinlaw who was haunting her michael wondered briefly he didnt look as if hed haunt anyone there was no time to think of that now he shoved the lid closed noticing with a mind trained to notice that the suitcase was good quality leather with the initial m burned into it at some time in the past jenny hadnt been as broke as she was at the present she shouldnt be broke now he thought frowning he paid her good money nothing made sense but now wasnt the time to sort it out he grabbed the case and crossed to the door there were footsteps on the landing uhoh ellie hadnt delayed them as long as hed hoped shes not here it was a garrulous female voice and the speaker sounded annoyed the landlady so why do you want her whats so urgent were from immigration silence followed and michael imagined them flashing their id cards we need to ask her a few questions no you dont yep the landlady was definitely annoyed authority wouldnt be all that welcome around here you leave her alone poor kid shes done nothing to no one and shes the nicest kid we just need to ask her shes not here the voice rose belligerently and michael blessed the woman i see everyone as they go in and out she went to work this morning and she hasnt been back since no one has that was because michael had taken great care not to be seen he thought moving fast if they knew he was inside packing her baggage he crossed to the window the apartment was three floors up but an outside ledge led to a fire escape it was a piece of cakeas long as they didnt suspect anything he was out of there with lightning speed and even if he wasnt forced to shinny down the drainpipe he would have done it if hed needed to he thought hed left trouble behind him but jenny had companyand trouble of her own when hed left her she was sitting alone in his gorgeous car now she was surrounded by five or six youths and one look told him they meant no good michael rounded the corner and froze melting swiftly against the brickwork as a cop he was trained to stop and assess before moving and he didnt like the scene before him one bit it had been stupid to bring the corvette here if hed known get out of the car lady the youths had been drinking he figured they were loud and aggressive egging each other on could he handle five of them if they turned nasty there wasnt much choice he decided thinking longing thoughts of his gun which was safely and uselessly locked in his office at the hospital hed hardly been planning to turn it on immigration officials so hed left it behind he couldnt leave jenny on her own while he went for backup he had to move but as he made to emerge from the shadows jennys voice stopped him short why on earth would i want to get out of the car jason hemming what it was the tallest of the youthsa kid of about nineteenand his bravado sounded a bit shaky how do you know who i am we want your car lady another youth butted in his voice threatening get out or well take you me there was laughter in jennys voice she didnt sound one inch afraid come on tommy thats not your speed driving with pregnant women im not she didnt let him finish tommy ive seen you with ten different ladies since i moved in here and every one is a heap more attractive than me i dont want to ruin your reputation you live here it was the same voice raised in incredulity i sure do i know your mom jasonand yours too tommy in fact i helped your kid sister with her homework last night adeles your sister isnt she tommy shes a real cutie i live up in number thirtyseven hey i think ive seen her around one of the boys said his voice nervous shes not lying so why are you driving this tommy was disbelieving me driving this you have to be kidding it belongs to my boss jenny said cheerfully hes loaded isnt it the best we want it you and me both but you want to get me sacked her voice grew reproachful or me to have my baby right here a tremor entered her voice and michael started forward maybe she was afraid he stopped again as he heard what she was saying im off to the hospital she sounded almost proud ive got labor pains my boss offered to drive me hes just gone up to get my toothbrush youre kidding nope michael peered around the corner and saw jenny open the car door get out and stand so they could see just how huge she was she staggered a little and put her hand to her back you want to know what a baby on the way feels like hes kicking so hard heck it hurts though youyoure having the kid it was the first voice jasonand all the aggression was gone its jenny isnt it i recognize you now heck you want me to get my mom thanks jason but i think i need a hospital more than your mom jenny was allowing the tremor in her voice to grow if mr lord would only get back that was a cue if ever he heard one michael emerged from the shadows carrying her suitcase mr lord jenny practically fell on his neck you took so long is it getting worse following her lead he appeared not to notice the youths two minutes apart she said clutching her back and grimacing im having a bad one now pleaselets go michael threw the case in the back and climbed into the car his face was grim yeah right good luck one of the boys said and michael looked up as if hed only just noticed him thanks i meant the lady the boy said and as the car started he added hey dont spit the kid out onto his leather seats jenny youll be sacked for that no sweat there was goodhumored laughter as they headed out of sight that michael said carefully as they nosed onto the street was amazing he moved the car forward not fast enough to draw attentionthe corvette got enough of that as it wasbut fast enough to be out of there if anyone had followed him down the fire escape i thought there was going to be trouble that was great acting who said i was acting he almost crashed the car veered toward the wrong side of the road and jenny grabbed the wheel and chuckled hey okay i was joking watch the road his blood pressure lurched and settled and he glared at the woman by his side thanks for the advice she dimpled my pleasure honest though there was no problem theyre not bad kids yeah yeah they steal cars but maybe i would too if i was as bored as they are and they wont hurt anyone besides its stupid to drive a car like this yeah right he grimaced you sound like a schoolmarm well she managed another smile smiles seemed her specialty and he realized suddenly why hed liked having her around the office the past few months her smile lit up all sorts of dark places and some of those dark places were right inside him but she hadnt noticed his reaction i guess if youre rich enough to afford it then you can drive it she said but you should have an ordinary one so you can pretend to be an ordinary person sometimes pretend id never presume to call you an ordinary person she said eyes twinkling after all youre my boss gee thanks i know which side my breads buttered on she dimpled nicely as if butter wouldnt melt in her mouth and then hesitated her laughter fading but i guess youre not my boss now if you could take me to the bus station the bus station its where you go to catch a bus when you dont have a car like this to drive or any car to drive her smile suddenly didnt reach her eyes michaelmr lordim really grateful youre not working for me anymore so its michael he said curtly and youre not going to any bus station the immigration guys were arriving at your apartment as i left your landlady will let them in theyll discover your gear is gone and theyll think she knows were looking for her shes on the run so where do you think theyll look the airport she asked doubtfully but he shook his head no theyll never let you on board a plane looking this pregnant and immigration knows that so where she was silent sitting in the plush leather seat and trying to make her jumbled mind think i guess the bus stations not such a hot idea then no more silence michael turned off the main road and headed to the river where are we going she asked she chewed her lip stubbornness returning i guess if you could drop me at a hotel somewhere cheap theyll think of that too itll take them twenty minutes to phone every hotel in town and youre not exactly easily disguised she closed her eyes do you have any money michael asked her curiously and he saw her anger flash again of course i have money why do you think ive been living so cheaply for the past six months ive saved everything so youre intending to live on what youve saved from six months salary while you have the baby michael asked incredulously no wonder the immigration people want you out youre hardly independent im independent youre not he sighed and steered his car to where the oaks lined the cliff tops overlooking the river there was a place there he knew quiet private it was hardly the sort of place detectives would look for a fugitive he pulled to a stop and turned to face the woman beside him and discovered she had the look of someone who expected to be slapped hard it was a dreadful look he gazed at her for a long moment and discovered feelings shifting inside him that had never shifted in his life feelings he didnt understand one bit it put him off balance michael lord was unemotional detached cool as ice and now he suddenly found himself emotional attached and hot as fire damn who had done this to her he thought savagely he had to know tell me about this person youre so afraid of this gloria he said and waited for a while he didnt think shed tell him she sat staring straight ahead at the deeprunning river below the weather was perfect michael thought inconsequentially autumn perfect hed put the top down on the corvette and the sun was warm on their faces she looked as if she needed its comfort he thought and suddenly had to resist the urge to put an arm around those frail shoulders she was making him feel too proprietary for words but he still had to know about gloria tell me he said softly you can trust me jenny he teased her gently have i not shinnied down drainpipes on your behalf that brought an answering smile there was a perfectly good fire escape if you chose the drainpipe heroes always choose drainpipes he told her smiling its far more heroic but much bumpier she managed a chuckle not to say riskyespecially if youre thinking about the future production of little superheroes think of what all those sharp edges on the way down could have done to your manhood that took him aback he stared at her in shock his quiet demure secretary making remarks about his manhood and then slowly his deep green eyes creased into laughter he chuckled a low lazy rumble that jenny hadnt heard before very few people had michael lord wasnt much given to laughter it transformed him she thought michael was big and solid with a blaze of burntred hair deep green eyes and strongly boned features that made him classically goodlooking his aloofness had repelled her though during the time shed worked for him she hadnt noticed what she was noticing now that the laughter behind his eyes made him seem not just classically goodlooking impossibly goodlooking she had other things on her mind though apart from michaels good looks she tore herself away from the laughter in his eyes and forced herself to answer his question after all she did owe him the truth at least talking bought her time she didnt have to get out of this lovely car quite yet and face whatever was before her alone i told you gloria is my motherinlaw she said in a low husky voice that michael had to lean forward to hear or she was my motherinlaw youre divorced no she gave a half smile but it didnt reach her eyes my husbandpeter is dead oh it was hopelessly inadequate im sorry he died seven months ago jenny said tonelessly im used to it now seven months isnt long michael thought back to the death of his partner on the police force was it two years already since dan had died grief and shock stayed with you forever he thought and the emotional damage lasted a lifetime no seven months wasnt long at all jenny was studying him curiously you look like you understand i dont know how it feels to lose the person you love michael said but id guess it must be just about as bad as it can get it is she said forcibly staring at the river one minute i was telling him i was pregnant and watching his face and he she shook her head as if shaking off a nightmare no matter the next thing the hotel phones ringing and theyre telling me peters plane crashed and id best get to the hospital because hes dying she flinched and her eyes looked inward peter died four days later but in the hospital we talked about the baby and his mother came from england and he told hertold gloria told gloria what that i was pregnant he frowned still not understanding so theres a problem with that id imagine it might have been the only piece of good news in the whole tragedy but you dont know peters mother shes gloria hepworthmorrow eighth duchess of epingdale jenny said bitterly the title makes a difference i imagine it might then he shook his head maybe he couldnt imagine no i cant why does it make a difference because gloria wants my baby she looked desolate it took sheer herculean effort for michael not to lean forward and take her in his arms which was stupid he didnt get involved not ever did he why does she want your baby he asked and if his voice ended up sounding halfstrangled she didnt seem to notice you have no idea what shes like jenny said bitterly shes soregal she swans around chairing her charities and opening fairs and making pronouncements on the state of the world and people think shes wonderful what a matriarch they say but she controls everyone she must her husband had no will of his own and peter peter your husband yes peter my husband her son she never let go even though he could never live up to what was expected of him she tried to control him every way she knew how and i saw what it did to him she used every means in her power to impose her will and when he married me she didnt like the match my father was a coal miner from wales jenny said bitterly what do you think i think peter made a very good choice of wife michael said and jenny flushed do you its nice of you to say so but im not so sure peter did in fact i know he didnt after a whileafter a while i figured that hed just married me as one more act of rebellion he didnt stop you see it wasnt enough that hed married someone she hated and was ashamed of he kept taking risks doing things she disapproved ofmaking headlines in his own right he brought us to texas because there were so many extreme sports over here that he hadnt tried before and he was killed doing aerobatics in an aerolite that was sold to him by people only a fool would be crazy enough to trust we fought about it all the time i was so frightened wedwed been thinking of separating and then i found i was pregnant which was a disaster that brought her chin up and the spark into her eyes no theres no way i regret my baby he wasnt planned but i want him so much and so does gloria of course and i have no money to fight her my parents died a long time ago i have no family and glorias moving in for the kill as far as shes concerned im only the breedera very poorclass breeder at thatand i deserve no say whatsoever in the way hes raised my baby is the next earl of epingdale and thats all shes interested in he thought this over and found a flaw your baby might be a girl no such luck i checked she grimaced it was a strange reason for gender testing but there it is i was desperate so yes im carrying the ninth earl gloria doesnt know it yet but the minute hes born she will shell pay to find out and her spies are everywhere thats why the immigration officers arrived today shell have been watching waiting and shell see her chance to move i was lucky in a way that we were here when peter was killed but if she gets me back to england theres no way i can immigrate hereor anywhere elsewith a tiny baby shell have bribed whoever she had to bribe or blackmailed them if they cant be bought but jenny youre this babys mother michael said gently still puzzled no court in the land will take your baby no but she shook her head you dont understand if i stay in england itll be easy for gloria to take control i saw what she did to peter she ruined any chance he had for happiness and shes not doing the same for my little one shes already told the british press im pregnant so therell be no privacy the minute my babys born shell be showering him with expensive gifts pushing me into the lifestyle she dictates maybe its not such a bad lifestyle other people have learned to live with money he tried a smile but she didnt smile back you dont know gloria she just takes shes so strong peter tried to fight her but she destroyed him shell destroy my baby with her corrupt values the only things that matter to her are publicity money and power i wont let her give my son those values you dont have to accept ha she laughed mirthlessly can you see a child refusing what she offers being given a trip to disneyland with his wonderful grandmother and his dragon of a mother refusing or me refusing to let him go to the most expensive schools gloria will make sure the press knows and the press would have a field day mother makes ninth earl live in poverty i cant afford to do anything but send him to a government school and live in an apartment do you think gloria will let her heir do that she can be charming and shes absolutely ruthless she wants this child and if she has her way hell be brought up in a goldfish bowl of publicity with the eyes of the world press on him but theres no way hes mine and she put her arms around her swollen body and hugged it as though she was protecting her baby while it was still in the womb michael sat back stunned things were starting to be clear but the clearer they became the less he liked them if so much money and power were involved what would he have done he thought if hed been gloria and he wanted this child home in england exactly what gloria had done he decided keep tabs on jenny while she was pregnant watch from afar because there was little he could do to pressure her before the baby was born then as the birth neared and jenny wasnt in england hed make sure she returned warn the immigration officials that she was planning to make a run for it even offer how much money does gloria have he asked and jenny shuddered millions i dont know exactly ive never asked but peter said it was ridiculous for one person to control so much wealth so if she wanted you back in england she could offer immigration a private jet with a doctor on board id imagine so yes of course theyd go for that too michael guessed itd get the problem out of their hair and you could hardly plead the case that you needed refugee status fleeing from money doesnt meet any refugee criteria ive ever seen he sighed jenny why didnt you leave the us before this and go someplace where there was a chance of you staying permanently pregnant with no family support you meet no immigration criteria at all no but she sighed have you any idea how hard it is to get immigrant status anywhere when youre pregnant unless youre rich the us isnt the only country with tight immigration laws she flashed him a smile that contained a hint of her usual spunk anywheres impossible really i wanted to stay away from englandas far as i could that was all i could think of to start with i was shocked bereaved confusedand gloria scared me to death with her assumption that the baby would be hers id be paid off and id have no say at all she has so much power it scared me to death so i stayed here and hoped and hoped stupid really but desperation makes for stupidity i guess i hoped id be inconspicuous and gloria would lose track of me i found the job with you you were happy with me i was enjoying working for you and the maitlands were great then when i tried to apply for permanent residency i discovered it was impossible as my pregnancy advanced everywhere else seemed to close their doors too so i had a choicestay here illegally or go home to gloria there are so many illegal immigrants and i was desperate the choice seemed obvious given what was at stake but now i might have known gloria wouldnt give up she shrugged but hey i guess theres still mexico and a whole bunch of immigration officials who mightnt be as efficient and im a great secretary as soon as the babys born ill be able to work she was smiling reassuring him that shed be okay but he was grim she was trying to make light of it but even if you make it into mexico shell find you he said no yes or youll starve for heavens sake jenny youll have no health insurance and as an illegal immigrant youll have no status what if something goes wrong during the birth it wont what if it does then ill cope she said flatly stop scaring me michael lord i can manage i dont think you can watch me or rather dont watch me im not letting you go to mexico on your own he told her his mind was racing and it didnt like a single thing it was coming up with theres no alternative she tilted her chin and a trace of fear shadowed the courage in her eyes unless youre planning to put me on glorias plane hand me over to the authorities she wasnt quite sure that he wouldnt he realized she didnt quite trust him she must there was no other way out of this mess i wont hand you over to the authorities he gave a selfmocking smile after all youre not illegal until monday yeah heaps of time not enoughbut there is an alternative he said softly his voice steady an idea had flashed into his head it was a crazy lunatic idea but the more he thought about it the more it seemed like the only way out of this mess its the only one which is youre sure you wont go home she swallowed but the look in her eye was one of iron determination no way ill lose my baby for this to work youd have to trust me i dont trust anyone she said flatly not where my babys concerned you need help jenny youre proposing to hide me in the basement until gloria goes away she wont now she knows where i am shell be around forever he smiled i dont think hiding in a basement is a sensible solution no but she shook her head believe me theres nothing you can do theres no possibility i can stay here legally and now the immigration officials are aware of me i have to move on there is one thing you can do which is you can marry me chapter three as a conversation stopper it took some beating jenny sat with her mouth open for all of two minutes there was not a single word she could think of to say it was michael who finally broke the silence jenny looked as if shed still be goggling in half an hour arent you going to say something he asked half amused i dont think i can she said breathlessly she sounded as if it took a real effort to make her voice work i feel like ive been slapped in the face by a wet fish gee he chuckled again the second time in one day amazing he smiled at her stunned expression as a romantic maidenly reply to a proposal of marriage that takes some beating slapped in the face by a wet fish good grief she smiled but her face was worriedhumoringalunatic worried michael this is just plain crazy you dont want to marry me no he agreed i dont well but thats just it he continued smoothly i dont want to marry anyone so it might as well be you i beg your pardon he sighed and his face tightened he didnt discuss his private life with anyone but there was no getting out of this not if she was to take his proposal seriously jenny let me tell you something like you ive done the love thing i dont just shut up and hear me out he closed his eyes and when he opened them he was no longer seeing her he was seeing events of two years ago and he was seeing them as though theyd been yesterday you know ive been a cop yes her frown deepened what on earth was he talking about and i left the force when my partner was killed ive heard that too she admitted gossip among the staff at maitland maternity had told her that much about him though michaels private life was very much a closed book he kept himself to himselfabsolutely what people dont know he said heavily was that my mind wasnt on my job the night my partner died he hesitated then went on but he sounded as if it hurt to say every word the pain was real and terrible id gotten myself into a relationship he confessed my first id never had much time for women but barbara well she seemed differentspecialand i thought i could get involved he shrugged okay so i got involved and i was stupid but what happened this wasnt making any sense dan and i were on night duty but wed just attended a call near barbaras place it was quiet we were due for a meal break so dan went for a hamburger while i dropped in to see barbara and she didnt want to ask but she knew he had to tell the words were being torn out of him she was with another guy in bed stupid sordid the sort of thing that happens every daybut to others not to me i was so damned angry so hurt that i slammed out of the house without a wordand then dan got killed he still wasnt making any sense would you mind telling me jenny said carefully how you getting twotimed by some woman with no taste in men could get your partner killed i dont see it part of his mind registered the compliment and a weary smile curved the corners of his mouth but the story was too black for humor the smile died it was easy he said bleakly my mind wasnt where it should have been and i needed every scrap of attention that night his words were savage and she could tell the night was still nightmare fresh we had a call to say thered been an armed robbery what they didnt say was that the owner had shot one of the intruders so we got to the store and the owner was out on the pavement yelling about a carload of kids that had got away as i said i wasnt on the ball i radioed in details of the car and while i did that dan went into the store to check damage oh michael the kid was lying on the floor wounded out of sight of the doorway and he shot dan from almost pointblank range michael said bleakly and then he died himself it was a stupid stupid waste he shook his head so when backup arrived i was blubbering like a baby and i left the force soon after to this job he compressed his lips and squared his shoulders that was the first time in my life ive ever tried having a relationship he went on bleakly my sisters and brothertheyre the emotional hotheads ive always had a sense that i should stand apart be alone maybe its because our birth mother dumped uswho knows i only know the feelings deepseated and real and then the one time i cracked and let barbara close the world exploded around me stupid stupid stupid so you see im not in the market for any sort of relationship ever jenny shook her head what on earth his birth mother dumped him there was so much she didnt understand about this man but maybe it needed to be put aside for now he was holding himself responsible for another mans death and who could believe that of michael michael dans death couldnt have been your fault she whispered even if your mind was a hundred percent focused it might have happened anyway dan must have assessed the risks too you wont always feel like this yes i will he said flatly ive never felt emotional i told youmy brother and sisters have enough emotion for the four of us combined ive never seen the sense of this love bit and when barbara betrayed me and dan was killedwell that was the first and last time ill ever feel like that giving yourself to someone he shrugged again and gave a selfconscious grin enough were not talking about me all im saying is that i intend to stay a bachelor which means theres no reason i shouldnt marry you to get you immigrant status a green card marriage her mind switched to her problems but a part of her stayed with his its been done before its not legal legal enough he gave a bitter smile well be married i have a huge town house she gasped and almost visibly withdrew youre saying you want me to live with you no but well need to for a bit he gave one of his characteristic selfmocking grins call it selfpreservation this way ill get myself a decent secretary again youd want me to keep working for you her voice was rising to squeak level not right away he said considering hed gone into the efficient mode she knew so wellthe michael lord she worked with every day of the week i mean i guess the baby will keep you busy for a while and if you need me to then im happy to support you while you do that he gave a slight shrug my adoptive parents were wealthy and i have a good income and apart from that apart from that she couldnt believe she was having this conversation but michael was totally believablehonest through and through he gave another wry smile yeah well im not all that proud of it but after dan was killed i took to gambling for a bit stupid the only problem was i won and it started getting addictive luckily reality hit home somewhere along the line or maybe it was my sisters and brother worrying themselves into a whitehot melt but i was smart enough to get out while i was ahead it well and truly bankrolled me so theres no rush for you to head back to work when you want to well thats okay too and if theres one thing maitland maternity is good at its child care so theres your permanent status fixed up but michael she was staring at him as if hed arrived from another planet yes theres no way youre supporting me she said flatly no way in the wide world thank you for the offer but no thanks ive saved i can support me and my baby until i can go back to work okay then he spread his hands as if surrendering fine by me im offering marriage though jenny if itll help she gazed at him for a long long moment do you have any idea what youre letting yourself in for she asked marrying a pregnant woman offering to support her even offering to share your apartmentwith a baby the guest room is on the other side of my living quarters and downstairs from my room he told her still in efficient mode i dont expect id hear it i only use the place to crash at night this was like a business proposition calm considered crazy you think we could run separate lives i do otherwise i wouldnt offer i meanyou loved your husband right right then you dont want another relationship yet either it could suit us both he grinned hey and itd get my family off my back my sisters are always trying to set me up with some woman but i cant she closed her eyes and her fingers touched the band of gold on her left hand i dont for the life of her she couldnt stop her fingers trembling he reached out and closed his fingers over hers stopping her shaking for the first time a hint of tenderness came through the efficiency you can it would work you dont want to marry me i dont mind honest he tilted her chin so she was forced to look at him and the smile in his eyes was infinitely gentle it gave her a massive jolt on one level this michael was just as calm and in control as the man she worked forbut on another level he was about a zillion miles from the aloof michael lord she knew at maitland maternity it could work jenny he told her and dont look too worried its not forever so lets not push this too far in time youll be over peter and want to be free and maybewell maybe im wrong and maybe ill want a life too so then we divorce but as long as we can stick it for a couple of years and your babys born into our marriage then youll have a little us citizen as a baby and youll be safe meanwhile tell me what your options are run i dont think so i can you cant he lowered his broad hand to the rising bulge of her pregnancy and placed it there almost unconsciously it was a gesture of comfort and warmth nothing more but it set every fiber in jennys body tingling in response you have a baby to think about i have a stupidly gained fortune i dont mind supporting you with itd take the edge off my guilt a bit and once youre married to me your dreaded gloria cant touch you his smile faded and the look in his eyes was suddenly dangerous the worst she could do is give us a bit of unwanted publicity but itll fade theres no way she can touch you if youre my wife he repeated id like to see her try but jennys eyes searched his troubled michael i dont want to be beholden can you cook iyes then theres our deal he said triumphantly lets leave the beholden bit out of it i hate eating out but i do it all the time because ive been known to burn baked beans you cook for me and well live happily ever after im not living with you there was an edge of panic in her voice no no no way not in a million years jenny this is not for a million years he said as he watched the confusion in her eyes mount to panic its just until we have your immigration legalized this baby safely born and gloria off your back its just until you have a breathing space to figure out what you want to do with your life if you raise this baby in the us theres not a lot gloria can do to control you you can raise him the way you want and then when hes old enough he can make his own decisions about his inheritance but youll be the one whos influenced him she took a deep breath she couldnt think she was so confused the temptation to let this man take charge was irresistible but to be so indebted the thought was unbearable michael are you sure i mean im sure he wasnt he was as confused as she was but he wasnt letting on somehow he made his voice firm and he looked down and saw the bulge beneath her dress move all on its own his eyes widened and he grinned im guessing your sons in agreement too he said will you look at that jenny wasnt looking at her bulge she was looking straight at michael you realize if were marriedif people found out that youve married me and they willthen people might assume youre his father i mean why else would you marry me and the immigration people i dont know what wed tell them but youll have a pregnant wife even the person who marries us will assume its a shotgun affair that this is your baby thats why hed be a us citizen i dont want you to face that it isnt fair michaels eyes widened hey things were happening too quickly here he realized doubts surfacing thick and fast he hadnt thought this through but an image insidious in its strength slid into his mind and stayedan image that had been with him all his life a woman walking toward maitland maternity and leaving four babies on the steps and then walking away jenny was fighting every way she knew to keep this baby she wasnt walking away and by marrying her hed give her the only chance she had i can handle that he said and if his voice didnt sound so sure to himself it was convincing enough to cause a flood of gratitude and absolute relief to wash across jennys face you really mean it i mean it he grinned lessening the tension hey theres a few things we should clear up before we make a final pact he thought hard like i hate custard were not living together maybe we have to for a while at least tell me you wont make me eat custard she choked hey its good for you you make custard and the deals off she managed a wavering smile you drive a hard bargain but okay as long as i dont have to eat pumpkin no pumpkin pies for thanksgiving he sounded shocked and she chuckled ill make you spotted dick instead she promised and his brows rose spotted dick my very favorite dessert englands soul food you eat something called spotted dick sure do she chuckled and so will you what am i letting myself in for aagh he clutched his stomach in mock horror and then managed a shaken grin okay i guess i can live with that what else should we work out you dont snore too loud nope or watch wwf wrestling on tv nope again she smiled you nope promise and you dont decorate your apartment with playboy centerfolds ill move em all into my bedroom he said magnanimously and she laughed again then her smile died michael you wont expect i mean he knew what she was asking even though she couldnt bring herself to say it no jenny he said no way this marriage is in name only i promise you that she believed him maybe she was being a fool but she looked into his deep green eyes and she trusted him absolutely but shed been down that road before trusting a man whose reasons for marrying her werent what they seemed you dont fly aerolites she asked and there was a faint tremor in her voice no jenny i dont fly aerolites do you what do you think she grinned her good humor flooding back okay this was crazy but it was better than the alternativegetting on a bus and heading for mexico alone a million miles better id weigh down any aerolite so much it wouldnt make it two feet off the ground only for a little bit he said until the ninth earl is born not the ninth earl she said sharply baby morrow thats all how about baby lord he asked does that make sense i she stared at him in confusion i dont know we have heaps of time to think about that he said and turned on the ignition meanwhile if were getting married today today can you think of a good reason why not i didnt think you could he said smugly okay jenny lets go find us a preacher they headed for the border el paso michael said as he turned his car onto the highway he was thinking as he moved discarding plan after plan and coming up with the one that made most sense its the only place we can get everything done i thought cant we marry here in austin or even las vegas itd be simpler she was still afraid michael thought as he turned the car toward the border she was expecting any minute that the men in suits would come at them with sirens blazing and cart her forcibly away to the dreaded gloria by the time you see any immigration officialor gloriawell be married he said softly the advantages of el paso are twofold first theres a judge near there i know from my days on the force if its for me personally and i tell him the babys on the way hell waive the threeday license period so we can marry right away hed even enjoy it second its a border town so we can fill out all the immigration forms and get the rubber stamps and signatures you need to make you legal by the time you get back to austin well be so legally correct officialdom wont have a chance but her voice faltered she still looked pale and he couldnt help noticing how many times she glanced behind them jenny dont worry he told her gently theyre not after us guns blazing this is not a bad movie sure gloria will have told them you intend overstaying but youre not illegal yet no matter how much money and influence she has she cant bribe the department to throw the entire weight of the law into finding someone who hasnt broken the law yet even if they found us theyd deport me they wouldnt he put a hand out to touch hers youre my intended bride and were heading off to get ourselves married before our son in born theres not a way in the world they can stop us then why arent you stopping off to collect your toothbrush she asked and he grimaced sharp arent you i have a lot hanging on this she told him and i need honesty here okay he put his hands on the steering wheel and focused on the road he still had the top down the sun was on their faces and they were heading toward the border for all the world like a married couple on vacation its just that i dont know gloria he confessed his brow was furrowed his red eyebrows beetling in concentration it was a gesture that was peculiarly michael and jen was discovering how much she liked it and the sound of his voice gloria sounds like an elderly aristocratic nutcase and my first reaction is to discount a heap of your fear he said i cant figure her intentions but im trained never to underestimate an enemy i dont know so im assuming the worstthat she has the resources to fight for what she wants but once were safely married theres no way she can touch you michael said cutting across her protest i know how to look after my own but lets get married before we go taking any chances they arrived at el paso late far too late to get married that night theyd stopped briefly to eat but jenny was so nervous michael had barely time to bolt a burger before she was edging him back to the car i told you jenny there are no blazing guns i just dont trust her shes known all along what i was doing now shell be thrown right off track and i dont know what shell do her nervousness was infectious and by the time they reached the decent plain hotel michael knew it was as much as he could do not to look over his shoulder he felt crazy to be worrying about an elderly aristocratic female half a world away never underestimate an enemy you dont know do you have a suite with two bedrooms he asked the woman at the hotel desk and jenny looked at him startled no sir the woman said primly we have adjoining rooms with a communication door he thought about that for all of two seconds and rejected it absolutely nope a twin room then certainly sir she cast a curious glance at jenny married couple having a fight the clerks face said and the tension in jennys eyes confirmed it you sleep well then she told them as she handed over the key and she took a deep breath and beamed at the pair of them if i can butt in here youre such a lovely couple and with the baby so close well whatevers bothering you you try real hard to sort it out those twin beds are on rollers if you want they roll together real quick great whats the problem jenny had plunked herself on the farthest bed and was glaring at her intended husband as if her life depended on it she thinks were married she snapped get used to it jenny he said lightly but there was an underlying seriousness beneath his words that had her staring were going to have to play this as if we mean it why the immigration officials wont give you a green card unless they think this marriage is real the judge we see tomorrow has to waive the threeday license period he wont do that unless he thinks this is a real marriage and were only rushing it because of the baby so we convince everyone weve been falling in love over the last few months and the day before you were due to walk out of my life i proposed and you fell into my arms but and we dont convince them by sharing separate bedrooms were not married yet michael lord she said with asperity i dont see why we have to share tonight he paused but there was no room for dishonesty between them this was too important youre afraid of what gloria can do he said i dont know gloria and i dont know what her resources are but i dont trust what i dont know and i want you where i can look out for you i dont want you down the hall you think i dont think anything he said wearily but im taking no chances were a couple jenny get used to it easier said than done jenny was so tired she should be asleep on her feet but she was so aware of michael that every nerve in her body was still wide awake and screaming that there was a man in her bedrooma very large verywell very male man a man who for the past few months had been her boss and was now to be her husband it was too unnerving for words she went into the bathroom washed changed into her pajamas and made a dive for the bed safely there she hauled the bedclothes up to her neck and then glanced over to see michael sitting on the other bed laughing at her very sexy he approved his eyes dancing baggy pajamas wide enough to hide a small house just what id always dreamed my bride would wear yeah well you try being eight months pregnant and figure how to be sexy she snapped glowering go get your own pajamas on i dont have pajamas he said soulfully the drugstore only carried toothbrushes and razorsnot pajamas thats your problem her voice was breathless im going to sleep you do that jenny he said his voice gentling you must be beat she was at that why else would the sound of the concern in his voice make her want to weep it was too strange for words she lay with her eyes closed as she listened to him head for bedlistened to him wash and use his brandnew toothbrush and then secure the room he didnt just lock the door he was taking no chances he hauled his bed across the doorway so no one could enter without stepping right over him surely the precautions were unnecessary jenny thought sleepily but she felt safer all the same she lay still until she heard him slide beneath the sheets pummel his pillows then settle down the sound of his deep even breathing was infinitely reassuring she shouldnt let him do this she thought but there was no way shed stop him not now michael mmm he sounded halfasleep already ii appreciate this she stammered you dont know how much dont mention it he said sleepily you wanted rescuing and i rescued you you have no idea how satisfying it is maybe i always knew i wanted to be sir lancelot and rescue a few damsels in distress she furrowed through her memory bank i thought lancelot was taken up with guineverethe kings wife she frowned did sir lancelot rescue damsels as well sure he did michael said easily into the dark in his preguinevere days he was quite a boy he dashed around on his white charger rescuing maidens all over the place what lots of maidens yep she smiled into the dark didnt it get a bit crowded up on his horse i mean it might have he agreed reflectively i guess he must have had some sort of system you know when the horse got crowded the damsel on the back fell off the dragon got her and he had to rescue her all over again silence i dont think then she said at last staring at the darkened ceiling that i want to fall off not quite yet then you just hang on for all youre worth jenny he said and he chuckled into the darkness and lets see where this dratted horse takes us they were married at eleven the next morning it was the strangest wedding jenny had ever attended though in fairness shed only been to the formal white weddings the british were so good at although her wedding to peter had been quiet theyd done it in a church shed worn white and a vicar had married them in his crimson robes the man who married michael and jenny was a portly little judge in a tooshiny suit hed known michael from way back and greeted him like a longlost friend i never thought id see you facing a shotgun marriage he said jovially and michael grinned have you any idea how hard it is to persuade a girl to marry you these days independent singleminded females hey she sounds just like the sort of wife you need the judge beamed at jenny step right up girl before he changes his mind if theres one thing id like to see this boy do its marry so they married exchanging rings bought half an hour before at a cheap jewelers in the next block a secretary witnessed their signatures and the entire process took just fifteen minutes and not a moment too soon by the look of it the judge inspected the last of the documents and nodded his satisfaction thats that then and im glad to make your little one legal he fixed michael with his sternest look you look after them you hear michael smiled and took jennys hand for all the world as if he was a reallife husband yes sir he said softly i intend to do just that then theres only one thing left the judge grinned whats that michael asked you may now kiss the bride boy he chuckled my favorite part my wife says its the only reason i aimed to be a judge go ahead boy kiss her like you intend to kiss her five times a day for the rest of your lives or more he had no choice michael looked into jennys confused eyes and he knew this was what he must do he must kiss her but for an obligation it didnt hurt one bit he gathered her into his arms and his mouth met hers and what was meant to have been a formal kiss of acquiescence suddenly became much more than that he felt her softly yielding to himbut he sensed the tremor running through her and tried to kiss away the doubts and the fears and the uncertainty of what lay ahead and somewhere in that kiss something changed between themsomething that would stay changed for all time because when he pulled awayfinallyafter a kiss that had gone on forever and must have satisfied any onlooking judge it felt as if he was tearing himself apart to let her go it was as if in her touch he was where he needed to be he thought dazed forever that was crazy he needed emotional attachment like a hole in the head and jenny she looked at him while their hands were still linked he could see the faint indentation where his mouth had pressed against herslike a shadowand he could see matching shadows of doubt and fear in her eyes and the fear had deepened it didnt end there there was a day of legal formalities in front of them one of the reasons i brought you to el paso is that we can do everything at once michael told her well get your immigration forms filled in here and take the first steps to get you legalized that way if immigration officials are waiting when we get back to austin they wont have a leg to stand on or gloria or gloria he agreed gravely shell be so angry she seems so demure so ladylike but she has such power jenny shivered in the warm sunshine and michaels hold on her arm tightened shed been subdued since theyd left the judges office theres nothing she can do to touch you now jenny nothing i know that but still she shivered marrying was easy compared to immigrating the forms jenny filled in were endless she and michael went from one bureaucratic counter to another and her guilt deepened all the while you shouldnt be here you should be at work you know you had appointments today she told him you sound like my secretary he teased and she glared at him thats what i am underneath all this pregnancybride stuff ellie wont know where you are shell be worried i called this morning and told her secretary i wouldnt be in did you tell her why i didnt give her a reason no but youre always in jenny said alarmed shell be worried sick especially if youre not at home if she tries to contact you you call her right away i dont need michael people care about you she said sternly finding a shadow of her old autocratic self even if you dont believe in emotional attachment they do call his eyebrows rose but the look on her face told him she wasnt kidding it was her best schoolmarm look and he answered accordingly yes maam he didnt leave her michael wasnt letting jenny out of his sight not until the last of the legal documents had been signed instead as she sat with head bent plowing through questionnaire after questionnaire he sat at the back of the office and used his cell phone ellie answered on the first ring michael he could hear relief echoing in her voice and he felt a twinge of guilt okay he should have phoned earlier he acknowledged jenny was right it never occurred to him that anyone worried about himit never had which was a side of his personality that drove his sisters nuts where on earth are you ellie demanded ive been calling everywhere and youve had your phone turned off im not in austin he told her obscurely im out of town on business and would this business have anything to do with jenny morrow it might then dont tell me she said hastily i dont need to know what i dont know i cant be forced to tell were not talking torture here i hope ellie he said startled and she gave a reluctant chuckle not quite but the people asking questionsthey have all the right authority and theyre very insistent they say jennys taken off and plans to stay in the country illegally ellie how many illegal immigrants do you guess are in the us michael asked slowly rough guess ballpark figure i dont know thousands thatd be my guess he frowned into the phone so why do you think theres all this interest in our jenny our jenny shes my secretary michael said stifling the impulse to lay claim to a closer relationship that could wait id like to know what the heck is going on i thought you might know ellie said thoughtfully being away from work and all ellie when did i last have time off work beats me she said i dont think you have not since you started here two years ago permission to take the rest of the day off then with that and the weekend that should do it ill be back at work on monday should do what her voice rose no dont hang up i take back what i said about not wanting to know i do michael whats going on i want you to find out youre closer to the action than i am theres a strange woman here ellie said suddenly as if she was looking around reception as she spoke and her gaze had rested on someone not a bureaucrat english upper crust midsixties looks like wallace simpson on a good day not a hair out of place expensively dressed and smooth as silk you know the typeor maybe you dont its a female thingon the surface polite and sweet and a little bit helpless and underneath as tough as nails shes questioning all the staff about where jenny might besays shes jennys motherinlaw and shes worried sick is she now michael turned away so jenny couldnt hear him whats she saying she thinks jennys run away because the immigration officers have come she says jennys pregnant and alone with practically no money she told me the immigration officials are trying to deport jenny and shes desperate to help her daughterinlaw and her poor little unborn grandchild so do i know anything im not telling the immigration people what did you tell her i didnt tell her anything ellie said frankly when she asked the staff in accounts where jenny might be and they didnt know she offered them money a heap of money to be honest she gives me the creeps so no she has nothing from me except blank stares i can be a real dope when i try good girl dont patronize me you toad just tell me watch her ellie michael interrupted youre right not to trust her i dont understand yet if theres just cause but jennys frightened of her and jen doesnt scare easily and dont worry ill see you at work on monday michael ellies voice rose in a wail and michael grinned and disconnected for a change it wouldnt hurt ellie not to know what hed eaten for breakfast that morning or that he was married chapter four right that all appears to be in order the grayhaired woman pushed her glasses down her nose and stared across the desk at jenny and michael her eyes bored right through them but there are a couple of questions i need to put to you both yes michael took jennys hand and exerted gentle pressure leave the talking to me his hand said but he didnt mind admitting he liked the feel of her fingers in his why did you delay marrying for so long she asked she fixed jenny with a stern look youre aware your permit to stay in this country expires on monday she glanced at her computer screen weve been given advice that you didnt intend leaving the country on the basis of information received we have officers checking your whereabouts right at this minute who gave you that information michael asked as though surprised and the woman shook her head i cant tell you that if its jennys family in england maybe we can understand it michael smiled and his grip on jennys hand tightened she was so tense they wanted her to come home when her husband was killed but she thought shed get over his death better if she stayed out of sympathy range and now maybe jens thrown out a few hints that she was thinking of staying here after the babys born and thats whats worrying them i guess they have reason to worry jennys a young widow shes alone shes vulnerable and they dont know me im not vulnerable jenny said but no one was listening so youve been thinking about marriage for a while weve been working side by side for the last five months michael said easily as if pulling the wool over official eyes was something he did every day jen applied for her work permit and came to me as a temporary secretary trying to keep busy to get over her grief at peters death the arrangement was to have been for only a couple of months but it kept being extended by me it didnt take me long to realize jen was special that much at least was true she was the best secretary hed ever had but jenny was newly widowed he went on smoothly its taken time to convince her to look at anyone else he grinned engagingly at the woman behind the desk five months in fact i must be a very slow convincer the woman didnt smile back but she glanced again at the computer screen as though what it told her conflicted with michaels story then she looked again at jenny my information says that you are desperate to stay in this country she said ignoring michaels charm completely maybe desperate enough to consider marriage as a means to staying hey am i someone youd have to be desperate to marry michael was all ready to feign outrage but jenny returned the pressure on his hand to tell him she was capable of answering the question herself thank you very much vulnerable ha but she didnt remove her hand from his i nearly went crazy after my husbands death she said softly thats why i wanted to stay here for a whileto be close to where he died and to avoid the crushing sympathy of friends and media back home you know that my husbandmy late husbandcame from a titled family in britain my baby will inherit that title and my motherinlaw has promised to support us both in luxury for the rest of our lives im not under pressure to stay in america on the contrary my family my wealth my sons inheritance all those things are pressuring me to go home so its been a very hard decision to stay here to stay with michael she smiled and reluctantly the lady behind the desk smiled back it seemed jennys charm worked better than michaels id be guessing the person worrying about meputting pressure on your officialsis my motherinlaw jenny continued pressing her advantage speeding up the thaw she wants me to return home and shes a very strong lady maybe if shes spoken to you then you know that already and that she thinks im a fool for staying i intended to go homeafter all theres a lot to be said for living on my exhusbands inherited wealthbut when i went to the travel agent to book my return ticket i realizedi realized just how much i wanted to stay and why was that jenny cast a sideways glancea loving look that almost shattered michaels composureat her new husband if she was acting she was sure good at it it was knowing how much i wanted to stay with michael she said in a voice that was no more than a whisper so you didnt buy your return ticket the woman pressed her but you thought about it that would be how long ago a month ago jenny said unruffled nearing the end of the time i could fly so youve been planning this marriage for a month i have jenny said serenely i just delayed telling michael can i ask why i wanted to make him sweat jennys eyes twinkled and she gave michael an affectionate grin for all the world as though they were longtime lovers and she was teasing him then she turned to the woman and her smile died no she hesitated thats not the truth to be honest i dont know if you can understand but peters only been dead for seven months its soon maybe too soon that was why we havent told anyone of our relationship weve kept it quiet though it seemed so right it still seemed a betrayal it has been very hard to say yes to michael i only know that i couldnt say no there was a trace of sympathy flickering in the womans eyes but youve said yes now jennys chin tilted i surely have were married now so i guess im as sure as ill ever be michaels promised to care for my baby like his own her eyes defied the woman to doubt her an offer like michaelsfrom a man like michaeldoesnt come along every day id guess that my motherinlaw is very upset i can understand her reasons though we dont always get on but id be a fool to go home to england and to hope that michael would follow i would follow michael said playing his part to the hilt he put his arm around her waist i certainly would itd be me whod be the fool if i didnt and suddenly it was over the woman was rising and smiling her frost giving way to a thaw well this seems satisfactory there will be followup visits checking on you on your home territory so to speak but it seems a formality well give you notice she cast a look of dislike at her computer screen as if it had betrayed her enough of my times been wasted on this i seem to have sent my officers on a wildgoose chase your officers there are two of our people searching austin for you right now she told jenny i suspect theyll be annoyed when i tell them ive had you here all along she pursed her lips of all the useless was that because of us jenny said distressed should i have let people know sooner i didnt think i mean i thought we had until monday to let people know i thought if we applied now no my dear it is not your fault the woman told her you go off and enjoy your honeymoon and i wish you the very best of luck for your life together i dont think michael said carefully as the door closed behind them that gloria is in for a very good reception if she tries to exert more pressure on you through immigration dont be so sure now that she was out of the office jenny felt her knees turning to jelly michael had hold of her arm and she was grateful for his support why she clearly seemed to be on your side gloria has influence everywhere right up to royalty and congress well be checked out thoroughly then theres nothing to worry about michael said tucking her hand firmly into his were a staid married couple off to take our honeymoon before we start our life together come on jenny forget about your motherinlaw come to think of it you dont have a motherinlaw anymore only me so from now on just think about us they had their wedding dinner at a restaurant where michael said the food was better than anywhere else in the states he made her eat migas a very different form of scrambled eggs and try carta blanca a mexican beer she tasted the beer but went back to lemonade in a hurry pleading her pregnancy but he knew he was on a winner with the migas she ate like a starving person shed hardly had any breakfast or lunch now though her color was returning and she looked as if she might be able to face the world again well stay here tonight he told her drive back tomorrow i dont mind when we go she didnt she decided she felt lightheaded and free it seemed the weight of the world had been lifted from her shoulders or at least most of it i guess she began then looked across the table at her new husband he really was impossibly goodlooking she decided with his dark coloring and wonderful red hair there was a trace of chest hair showing at the throat of his opennecked shirt and she felt an almost irresistible urge to reach out and touch it to trace it downward too goodlooking strange how shed hardly noticed it before but she did now hed gone out and bought a casual shirt for their wedding because he always wore a shirt and tie for work and decided he wanted his wedding clothes to be different she wouldnt buy anything newit was a total waste when she was this pregnantbut she loved his casual look and she loved the fact that hed bought something special for their wedding he really wasspecial you guess what he asked and she had to drag her thoughts back to where theyd been or to where they should have been i guess well have to face your family she frowned into her lemonade will you explain things that our marriage is just a formality we dont want them thinking that were really married michael frowned we are really married we need to be jen but we wont be living together yes we will she said theyd check she also said theyd give us notice thats true still so we tell your family the truth otherwise she ran her finger around the rim of her glass troubled they might accept me as part of the family so so it wouldnt be honest or fair jenny youre my wife michael said firmly so loud that people turned to stare he grinned and lowered his tone okay our marriage isnt what most people think of as a marriage we dont love each other and well lead independent lives but its still a marriage weve signed a contract and we play by the rules but if either of us decides we want out sometime in the future then thats okay people understand divorce even if they dont like it but for now we tell people were husband and wife and let them decide what to make of it i guess my brother and sisters might have to be told the truththeyd guess anywaybut for the rest the rest the rest as in everyone else he said they need to know as much as gloria needs to know well send a notice to the local paper we wont tell people that we fell in love but we wont tell them that we didnt love has many different faces there are lots of couples who dont stay tied to each other who travel independently sleep independently watch separate tvs he grinned that too i bet you dont like watching football i do actually she smiled but the trace of uncertainty remained in moderation like once a year for half an hour with plenty of chocolate on the side but i see what you mean its only only what i dont like telling lies were not were married jenny how hard is that to accept it sounded totally reasonable but still the worry remained at least lets insist on a few basics like no presents no party this really is crazy her brow furrowed i mean if people think its romantic well well be in for all sorts of things then we sayfirmlythat we dont want it no fuss but otherwise we treat each other as husband and wife an independent couple but a couple for all that she smiled then though her doubts remained you might not know what youre saying when i tell you off for the sixtieth time for drinking beer out of the can speaking of which she reached forward to grab his can which had been supplied with a glass beside it hed elected not to use it he was faster than she was hauling the beer out of reach not so fast woman have you no respect i might have asked you to marry me but if you start interfering with my beerdrinking habits therell be all sorts of things ill want to interfere with she said her worry returning i wonder maybe we went into this too fast we didnt have a choice i know that but she shook her head i dont want to cause trouble for you michael you wont he smiled hey i was brought up with two sisters and a brother im accustomed to leading my own life surrounded by chaos family doesnt touch me why not its just easier to turn off i always have thats what makes this whole thing feasible somehow that only made her feel worse that night was difficult once again they shared a hotel room after all the authorities would be surprised if we didnt sleep together tonight michael told her and jenny had to agree tonight however he didnt pull the bed across the door if glorias as smart as you think she isand shes obviously paying a bundle to keep informedthen shell know whats happened by now the officials in austin will have been called off and theyll have told gloria why i guess she cant touch you jenny michael said and he stroked her face gently as she sat on the bed dont start looking for threats youre safe safe but at what price she climbed into her appalling cotton pajamas and snuggled under the bedclothes then lay in the dark with michael three feet from her side he went straight to sleep his low even breathing sounding softly across the room it should have been reassuring but it wasnt it was unsettling strange what had michael said family doesnt touch me it touched her people touched her what michael had done for her what he intended to do for herit moved her to tears she was so indebted she should never have agreed to this she knew better than michael what sort of reception would greet them in austin when people found out how would his family react to her she could guess theyd react with horrorand theyd be right his sisters would want a nice local girl to marry their wonderful brother someone he loved not someone he felt sorry for the baby stirred within her and she was achingly aware of the new little life waiting to be born ive done this for you she whispered into the dark her hands resting on her belly ive married michael for you it wasnt totally true she stared at michaels silhouette in the dark and felt emotions that had been repressed for a very long time he was letting her close not too close but closer than hed ever let anyone else hed married her for better or for worse she whispered into the night well michael this is my worst and this is your best i just hope that sometime in the future we can balance things out a bit at three in the morning she scared the living daylights out of him hed been solidly asleep dreaming and his dreams hadnt been half bad jenny was in there somewhere and her smile her low moan had him sitting bolt upright jenny was standing on the other side of the room leaning on the wall and rocking back and forth with pain jenny the light was on and he was over there faster than should have been physically possible gripping her shoulders and turning her to face him jenny what is it hell if it was the baby it wasnt the baby oh michael im so sorry she whispered and there was agony in her voice i didnt want to wake you its not the baby its okay what is it its just cramps my legsthey seize up some nights i tried not to wake you cramps its a side effect of advanced pregnancy she said closing her eyes in pain one of the things you dont hear about until its too late like varicose veins and heartburn let me help theres nothing you can do itll pass lie down jenny he told her pushing her to the bed before she could say a word she was lifted and laid gently on the pillows and he was sitting on the bed beside her he took her legs onto his knees and pushed the loose cotton up this one theyre both bad but thats the worst it had to be her calf muscles were rock hard knotting in vicious spasms hell he muttered jen this is some cramp youre telling me leave it michael go back to sleep itll pass yeah so i just lie in bed and snore while you pass out in agony in your dreams im not completely without feeling we need some cream moisturizer or something theres cream in my bag in the bathroom coming right up and he left her diving for the bathroom to search her toiletries this felt wrong he thought as he lifted her toothpaste and hairbrush and rifled through lipstick cosmetics toiletries it was strangely intimate as if they really were married thats what it felt like he realized he felt married and he wasnt at all sure he liked the sensation hed been alone for so long and now the woman out there needed him and he was responsible this was taking him someplace he wasnt all that sure he wanted to be but this was no time for regrets decisions had been made for better or for worse and he had to live with them he found what he was looking for and headed back to jenny to his wife she shouldnt let him do this jenny thought as she struggled against the pain she shouldnt let him near shed tried so hard to be quiet not to wake him because she didnt need him she didnt but the last few months had been so long and so lonely and to know that he was here and was prepared to stand by her the thought was infinitely comforting she didnt love him but she needed him dear heaven she didnt have the strength to hold him away even michael was better than the bleak future shed faced two days ago even michael maybemaybe especially michael michael took all the time in the world it was almost an hour before the cramps eased and the entire time he sat at the end of the bed and massaged her calves as if he wasnt tiredas if the most important thing in the world was to use his big hands to gently soothe the aching hurt in her legs he applied moisturizer to soften the skin gently working his fingers into each knot one after another over and over again he could feel how much pain she must have been in shed only made that one tiny groan which had woken him but for her legs to be in this mess she must have been awake for hours he swore into the night as he worked thinking over the past few months shed put in long hours at the office for him and he hadnt granted one concession to her pregnancy in fact hed hardly noticed his secretary had been pregnant and each night she must have gone home to this alone lets forget about driving tomorrow he told her i want you checked by a doctor first hell had he caused problems by driving all the way to el paso in one shot he should have stopped often made her walk hired a larger car than the corvette im fine she whispered in fact it was as much as she could do to get her voice to work at all she felt wonderful the pain had eased to almost nothing and to lie here with her head on the pillows while michaels fingers worked their magic while his hands eased the pain taking away the desolation and loneliness of the last few awful months she was feeling so grateful she could almost burst she was feeling as though she could almost reach out and take him to her take him as her true husband which was really really stupid she was eight months pregnant with another mans baby peter her husband no not her husband peter was her first husband and that was over her husband now was the man massaging her legs with such infinite gentleness that she wanted to weep michael was being kind nothing more heavens hed done enough for her without her placing emotional obligations on him somehow she forced herself to lie still and she pushed her errant heart into order youve got yourself a marriage of convenience she thought a green card marriage thats what you need so dont you dare mess it up by letting your heart get involved finally she slept and michael went back to bed but he lay awake staring at the darkened ceiling wondering just what hed let himself in for for better or for worse he was married and he was starting to realize this wasnt just the solution to one problem at all it was the start of a whole heap more and it was the beginning of a brandnew dimension to his existence they took the entire day to drive home with michael insisting on so many stops that jenny was starting to go nuts i dont need this i dont want you cramping again tonight at least i wont be waking you up thats another thing youre not staying in that lousy apartment its where i live michael she said stolidly they said theyll give us warning if they check so im staying there we have to act married besides its a dump dump or not its my home she snapped its nothing to do with you youve offered me marriage and im incredibly grateful but i have no intention of interfering with your life or of you interfering with mine its not sensible theyll check she shook her head her curls flying in the wind they wont check yet and its not sensible to be anything but independent youre my boss michael and im one of your employees who from now on happens to be on leave to have a baby we have a green card marriage nothing more michael glanced at her set face and his head told him she was partly right hed offered marriage on the spur of the moment and shed accepted with gratitude she was asking nothing more and there was nothing more he wanted to give was there maybe not but living together it wasnt negotiable whether he wanted it or not they had no choice immigration officials werent stupid give me a day to clean out the spare room he told her grudgingly in truth his spare room was fine but maybe she needed space and maybe he could do with a day or two to get used to the idea of her living with him but you need to move in with me if were going to make this work no dont be stubborn he accused but she shook her head and looked away maybe it would take the warning of an immigration visit to make her see sense michael thought meanwhile he could hardly cart her to his place screaming and did he really want to her apartment looked exactly the same as hed left itsomewhere between dreary and awful michael carried her baggage up the three flights of stairsthe elevator was out of orderand stared around with distaste he wanted her out of there you cant stay here of course i can she smiled as he put her bag on the bed there wasnt anywhere else to put it ive been living here for months and havent been mugged yet i told you i like it there are nice people here would you like some coffee before you go ino his brow furrowed this is only for a couple of days at the most do you have coffee hey im not exactly starving in an attic she told him exasperated i live simply because i need savings to support myself while i cant work but i know how to look after myself and ill stay here until we hear from immigration you dont need to worry ive eaten every vitamin and done every exercise dr maitlands given me youre seeing abby of course im seeing abby she flushed defensively obstetric care is one of the perks of working at maitland maternity theres no way ellie would employ me unless i was looked after by the maitland obstetric staff and my babys too important for me to take stupid risks yeah right he tried to make his voice sound as if he hadnt been worrying but it didnt come out right okay he had been anxious hed had visions of her without health insurance and not having seen a doctor since shed left england but why on earth was he worrying now when he hadnt so much as thought of her pregnancy since the day he employed her for one reason and one reason only he told himself grimly then she was his secretary now she was his wife the realization slammed home hard and with it came an overwhelming sense of responsibility it was a feeling so vast it almost knocked him sideways he hadnt expected this he hadnt asked for it and hed never dreamed hed feel like it now though it was as much as he could do not to pick up her bag and haul her out of there carry her out in a firemans hold if he had to but she was asking him to leave thank you michael she was smiling youve been wonderful her voice trailed off but the look she gave him was direct and honest i was in a mess and youve rescued me in true hero style you dont know how much it means to me but well thank you and she took two steps forward reached up and kissed him very lightly on the lips it was a feather kiss a kiss of gratitude and relief no more and there was no reason in the world it should pack any charge at all but pack a charge it did a million volts slamming through his body leaving it seared and shaken to its core it was the shock he told himself dazed as she drew backthe shock of acknowledging responsibility he took a step away from her and she was still smiling with her lovely green eyes as though she hadnt felt the charge at all he figured hed better get out of there fast it was their second kissand he didnt dare risk a third iwellill be off yes youd best leave youll have things to do ill see you monday his voice sounded lame spineless no michael i wont see you monday she reminded him gently theres only four weeks before the babys due abby told me to quit ellies hired you a new secretary you met her last wednesday remember thats right this had all been organized he knew itsort of so why the heck was his head fogging up like soup i guess if immigration contacts either of us then well get together she said but after our performance yesterday they might not even check jenny theyre not stupid theyll come and i dont know how much notice theyll give im not going anywhere she gave a selfmocking smile so call me im a cab drive away there was something else gnawing at him when the babys born what will you do when you go into labor it was impossible to keep a note of anxiety out of his voice she heard it and smiled there was no need for his anxiety but she liked it all the same theres no problem she assured him ill take a cab or ill call an ambulance to take me to the hospital ill even walk if theres time dont you dare call me hey im only eight months pregnant and i dont need call me he barked the command and she blinked and then she smiled again okay michael ill call you at two in the morning if necessary he growled anytime you swear i swear theres nothing else you need nothing i told you i can afford theres nothing else she said with a lot more confidence than she felt she opened the door then stood waiting until he passed through it thank you for everything michael goodbye shed sounded so firm jenny closed the door after her husband and stood for a long long time with her back against it staring at nothing there was nothing else she needed except someone except michael unconsciously she traced her fingers where his mouth had touched hers remembering the feel of his harsher skin against the softness of her lips nice michael was nice the girls at work would have kittens if they heard me she said into the silence thinking of the reception staff and the female nurses at the hospital michael lord had a reputation as a hunk of the first order but nice that was the last word theyd use to describe him he was cool aloof demanding but nice she said softly and fingered the ring on her finger shed moved peters rings to her right hand the new band of gold lay light and strange on her ring finger different she touched peters rings and tried to conjure up his face she couldnt frowning she crossed to her bag and found his picture put the photograph on her bedside chair where it belonged because peters my husband peter she closed her eyes pain and guilt washing over her peters title was this babys birthright if she did what gloria wanted the baby could inherit it right away no that way was madness to barter what she knew was right for this new little life for riches and a title im sorry peter she whispered bleakly into the silence i cant do it it just seems so wrong im sorry she opened her eyes and there was no one there nothing except tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow chapter five michael left her and drove to the river theyd had dinner on the road so he wasnt hungry it was nine at night he should go home get some sleep but he was married what did that have to do with anything he didnt feel married he stopped the car and got out walked to the riverbank the night was fresh pleasant but there were no other people around maybe it was too early for the towns lovers to be out walking saturday night most of the local kids would still be at the movies and older couples would be dining in one of the citys restaurants single people didnt tend to come here but he did this was a place for quiet a place to get his thoughts in order so much had changed only it hadnt changed he realized he was free to go home as he always did and jenny expected nothing more of him on monday thered be a chirpy secretarial replacement sitting in jennys office and life would go on as usual but he was married this was stupid he thought savagely jenny was acting as if they could go on as before but their marriage had to be made public if she wanted immigration status she couldnt stay in that apartment she intended to she didnt want to put him to any trouble so what would she do with herself in the weeks of waiting for the baby to be born if she had her way if immigration didnt bother to check shed stay in that dump of an apartment speaking to no one it was none of his business he touched the gold band on his finger according to jenny he could take it off he needed to keep it close in case there were questions but he didnt need to wear it jenny was making no demands unconsciously he started to remove it then let it slide back better not if officials came asking questions if he lost the damned thing what if the baby came early he thought suddenly what if it came tonight his mind was heading off in all directions she has a phone he said into the night shes not irresponsible shes not irresponsible but shes too damned independent why too independent do you want her to live with you no but his voice trailed away of course he didnt want her to live with him but a vision of her face flashed into his mind her skin too pale as if she didnt spend enough time in the sun her eyes creased with worry but her face set and resolute shed been through too much and if she has cramps again tonight butt out lord he told himself savagely youve done enough she needs space so get back to where you left off the phone on his belt buzzed into life and he quickly grabbed it if she needed him mike garrett michaels breath came out in a rush it wasnt jenny hey who were you expecting marilyn monroe yeah right what do you want it was impossible to eliminate the impatience in his voice and he could imagine garretts eyebrows doing a hike upward at the other end of the line you were invited for dinner what tonight garrett said patiently weve had steak and salad and dylan and i have drunk most of the beer but if youre fast you can have some of shelbys pumpkin pie jenny doesnt like pumpkin pie somehow he didnt say it with a mental shake he managed to get himself into the conversation into reality im not coming are you with someone no as usual youre neck deep in work maybe no but then were expecting you garretts growl matched his the girls are disappointed or are you planning on staying out of family life completely now no there was a pause something had caught garretts attention something different his voice lowered a notch and michael heard worry come into it you sound youre not down in that damned casino no then get your butt over here little brother garrett demanded before i drag you yeah okay it seemed sensible enough or more sensible than standing on the riverbank having conversations with himself besides there was no point worrying garrett and his sisters he took a deep breath gathered his wits turned into a single man again and went to face his family theres five leads michael was sitting on the sofa at garretts ranch a can of cold beer in his hand hed refused lanas offer of a glass he sat there trying not to think that jenny would be shoving a glass at him regardless he was trying not to smile at the thought are you with us mike michael blinked and focused garrett was standing in the center of the room their sister shelby was on the floor at his feet playing with lana and dylans baby greg and lana and dylan were sitting way too close on the other sofa the way they were looking at each other thered be another baby before too long oh um yeah right garrett fixed him with a bigbrother look that said pay attention or take the consequences and continued as i said we need to do something concrete what the heck were they talking about they looked like they were waiting for an intelligent question we he said weakly and hoped it was appropriate apparently it wasnt all it earned him was a glower from shelby garrett and me michael youre not listening shut up and concentrate yeah right we found five sets of triplets born around our birth dates garrett repeated frowning at his brother something was up with michael and he didnt know what his eyes stayed watchful as he kept talking without fertility drugs there werent as many triplets born then and most didnt survive there are only five registered in texas as making it so two intelligent questions in one night he was doing well he nudged shelby and she glowered again shut up michael garretts frown deepened yeah something was definitely up with his baby brother but all he could do was keep talking while he tried to figure it out there was one set of triplets born to a leeann and gary larrimore three towns from here at lorretta free clinic that seems the most promising lead mostly because the hospital records are so scant but there are four more around texas we thought if we split up mike if you can help michael sighed as he finally figured what they were talking about their birth mother again he might have known they were asking him to get involved and he didnt want to why would i help because we want to find our mother michael shelby said exasperated with your resources sheila lord was our mother and thats the only mother i want michael said flatly our natural mother dumped us immediately jenny came to mind she wouldnt have dumped her baby no way terrence and sheila were the worlds greatest parents he went on theyre who i think of as mom and dad i dont need anyone else most of the time you dont need anyone at all shelby snapped but some of us do there are easier ways to find someone to care about than searching for a woman who dumped us she cares shelbys voice rose our mother cares you read the note i know shes having a guilt trip all these years later michael argued so she sent megan a stuffed toy and three cute little sweaters it means nothing she doesnt suggest getting in touch the note said she loved us maybe she feels too guilty to ask about getting in touch then maybe shes right to feel like that after all she dumped us she had no guarantee wed be looked after oh right shelby was angry and on her high horse fighting with michael had been her chief pastime since she was three she swiveled on the floor and fixed michael with a withering look she dumped us at maitland maternity where megan was in charge even back then the press coverage on the place would have told her that megan would move heaven and earth to get us cared for and cared for together if she loved us then shed have stuck around to find out that we were okay she had reasons she couldnt well im not interested in them michael said flatly terrence and sheila did their best to bring us up they gave us everything we needed and more and it seems disloyal to them to go hunting for some woman who took the easy way out youre too hard michael im not hard i just see the facts theres no room in our lives for someone who never showed the least interest in being our mother theres no room in your life for anyone shelby snapped now that was a bit much michael considered her words while his siblings glared at him he had everyone he needed right here in this room he thought and he really was fond of his hotheaded sister hey except you he told shelby trying to prod her into smiling he tweaked her hair as she sat on the floor beside him she glowered and he tweaked again cut it out shelby protested then cut out being mad at me you know you dont mean it youre so darned aloof you dont care hey i care about you guys not enough to help us nope because youre selfish because youre wasting time he paused and maybe because searching for this woman might be opening yourselves up to a whole lot of grief arent you even interested she demanded hotly how can you not want to know easy i mind my own business not like some sisters i know oh you are so she grabbed the cushion shed been using to support tiny greg on the floor greg was lying flat on his back now surveying his toes and he had no need of it in a practiced maneuver shelby took aim and swiped the cushion across michaels head cushion swiping had been a skill shelby had practiced since she was a toddler michael knew it and expected it he rose and catching her wrist hauled her to her feet he pushed her easily backward so she fell onto the sofa then laughed into her indignant face some things never change he said fondly isnt this you all over shel when all else fails resort to violence and some things about you never change she retorted hauling her arm back without success to aim with another cushion heres michael lord resorting to indifference because he might just get hurt if he gets involved thats deep shel he said appreciatively you been doing a psychology course on the quiet i dont need a psych and she stopped dead i dont need he prompted but she was no longer concentrating on what she was saying her eyes had grown as huge as saucers and she was staring at his hand as if it had grown another thumb michael she said and her voice sounded strangled and far away whats wrong it was garrett who asked the question michael had seen where she was looking and gave an inward groan he knew what was coming how could he have thought they wouldnt notice shel whats happening lana was distracted enough to pull away from dylans arms and rise in instinctive protective mode the siblings might fight as much as they liked but if there was the faintest thing wrong with one of them the rest of the brood sensed it in an instant and reacted accordingly shelby hes wearing a wedding ring shelby whispered in horror michael youre not married michael considered this for all of ten seconds he stared at his family thinking of one smart reply after another none seemed right in the end there was only one thing he could think of to say after all they had to know sometime well yes he said softly i guess you could say that i am lana sat down it was as if her legs had suddenly gone from under her she opened her mouth to say something but nothing came out on the floor baby greg looked up in wideeyed interest the world was a wonderful place his infant eyes declared and his uncle michael was fascinating if he just stood still which was what he was doing as were his siblings michael looked around at his family and they stared back like so many frozen statues its someone lana gave a soft moan finally recovering her voice oh no its someone from the casino hell lana michael shook his head in disbelief this at least he could handle will you get it into your head that i hit the gambling scene for a whole three months after dan was killed sure i was off the rails but thats over you and shelby have spent the last two years worrying about me ive been worrying too garrett volunteered he took michaels beer can from his hand its the morrow woman isnt it the morrow woman michaels eyes narrowed what sort of a description was that the morrow woman lana moved she grabbed michaels beer can from garretts hand and thrust it at dylan as if it was getting in the way of what was really important she was practically gibbering what morrow woman but michael was no longer listening he was facing garrett headon the morrow woman it sounded like an accusation who told you about jenny he demanded his voice dangerous jenny shelbys voice was practically a squeak whos jenny youve married a woman called jenny i dont know any jenny ellie was looking for you on friday morning garrett told michael ignoring his sisters his eyes didnt leave michaels face she called me and told me thered been a problem with your secretary your secretary lana gasped jenny as in jennyyourtemporarysecretary youre married to jenny your secretary i know jenny shes lovely but shes pregnant shes huge michael shes well there you are i dont have to tell you anything about it michael interrupted dryly youve figured it all out for yourselves catch me dylan lana said dramatically im going to faint and she collapsed with theatrical effect onto the sofa and into her husbands willing arms there was laughter in her eyes but there was no matching laughter in shelbys lanas world had expanded with her husband and child but shelbys life still revolved around her brothers and her sister her eyes were filled with undiluted horror as she struggled from the sofa to face him michael you havent shelby was staring at him as if hed been caught walking naked at midday of all the no tell me you havent surely there were alternatives garrett said uneasily ellie said the womans life is in a mess but you know garrett dylan said conversationally from the sofa his arm holding lana comfortably against him if i were you id stop calling michaels new wife the woman im watching mike from down here and every time you say it his face turns blacker that stopped them dead garrett and shelby stared at dylan then turned to stare at michael his expression was like a thundercloud lana made a noise that was somewhere between a squeak and a gasp then somehow collected herself she hauled herself out of her husbands arms and bounced up to stand before michael she took his hands in hers and fixed him with the lord lookthe look that told him he wouldnt get away with anything but the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth of course shes not the woman shes jenny and shes really really sweet she said warmly and youve married her so tell us all about it michael dont leave a single thing out and dont tell us any lies just tell us michael looked at his sisters troubled faces and gave an inward shrug what the heck they needed to know these guys were his family and somehowso was jenny so he did as ordered he told them everything while they stood and took it in with various degrees of disbelief and incredulity well lana said at last plonking herself down at dylans side again well shes eight months pregnant shelby asked in a distant voice you mean shes found herself a father for her child when you had nothing to do with it of all the conniving sort of like me and lana dylan said softly holding his wife like me finding a mother for greg when lana had nothing to do with it conniving like that do you mean careful shelby it is not like that shelby snapped you guys love each other sheshe trapped him michaels brows lowered i offered shel but you dont love her she demanded wheeling on michael with anger of course you dont love her where is she now i dont know home i guess your home no her home you dont plan on living together not yet he frowned not until he could make her see sense tomorrow maybe well thats something shelby looked relieved but garrett was shaking his head mike do you have any idea what sort of legal minefield youve put yourself into i can handle it but lanas mind had gone off on another tangent youre married to a woman whos eight months pregnant and you dont know for sure where she is she demanded bouncing up from her husbands hold again to face michael headon her indignation was palpable what if she goes into labor she has a phone she knows where you are i have the cell phone shell call you iyes he fell silent would she shed promised maybe she wouldnt she would youre worrying about her arent you lana said triumphantly you care about her lana shes my secretary she might have been hired as a temp but shes the best assistant i ever had this waythis way i get to keep her as your secretary yeah why else would i want her she stared how about as a wife he sighed how often do i have to say it lana this is a business arrangement she needs to stay in the country and i appreciate her secretarial skills theres no way i want to marry anyone else so whats the problem does she have anyone else lana demanded friends family or is she completely alone i guess she has friends he didnt know hell he didnt know are you bringing her to the wedding lana had moved into organization mode wedding camille and jakes wedding lana said patiently its here tomorrow remember dont tell me you didnt notice the marquee on the front lawn yeah but okay hed forgotten after all jake and camille had had a civil ceremony a few months ago but megan had convinced them to hold a formal ceremony so the whole family and their friends could attend a wedding heck why had he ever accepted the invitation he hated them hed barely gotten over lanas wedding or his own bring her mike lana said firmly let us all meet her i know her a bit from popping in to see you at work but i dont know her well shes always friendly but just efficient friendly if you know what i mean we need to get together why lana shes not my wife is that what youre going to tell the authorities no but and if immigration asks questions and garrett and shelby have never even met her theres no real need shes alone michael im assuming shes finished work until the babys born so whats she doing for the next few weeks i have no idea in my shop i see heaps of pregnant women lana told him they all say the last few weeks of pregnancy seem endless theyre full of fears and anxietiesand youre just leaving her by herself i told you lana she has nothing to do with me thats the way she wants it youve married her michael she snapped for better or for worse she has everything to do with you lana enough were going home now she said bending to scoop her small son from the floor come on greggykins lets take your daddy home to bed and tomorrowtomorrow you and me and daddy are coming back here to see camille marry her jake and meet your new aunty jenny and make your first contact with your new cousin cousin gregs my son michael and your new wifes about to have a baby she said serenely standing on tiptoe to give michael a sisterly kiss on the cheek like it or not brother mine youve just expanded our family so shut up and get on with it there was nothing else to say lana and dylan left lana giving michael her unsolicited advice dylan following with amused pride go with the flow he told michael as he passed him on the way out you cant fight city hall city hall meaning lana one and the same he grinned and headed out the door that left shelby and garrett unlike lana shelby was close to tears i dont know how you could do it she said oh michael i wanted you to marrybut not this way shelby you know i never intended to marry yeah but id hoped youd meet someone who would change your mind i already have her names jenny i mean someone you love like i love you guys i dont think so he gave her a hug that was meant to be reassuring but her eyes were still troubled oh michael dont fret about him shelby garrett said roughly putting an arm around his sister and giving her a squeezealmost as if he was protecting her our mikes a big boy now hes got himself into this mess its not a mess michael protested but garrett shook his head this mess he repeated he may not see it yet but its a minefield but dont worry shel if theres one thing mikes good at its minefields hes not security chief of maitland maternity for nothing garrett hesitated then sighed this evening had got sidetracked and hed called them together for a purpose i suppose theres no chance of you helping us look for our mother now mike no you being so busy with your new wife and all get off my case garrett yeah right but youll squeeze in jake and camilles wedding tomorrow i dont youd better garrett warned youve married the woman and now its time she meets your family its not as if just bring her tomorrow mike garrett said heavily well judge your new wife for ourselves chapter six michael left and he should have gone straight home he was tired wasnt he the last sleep hed had seemed days ago in a hotel in el paso with his wife the words kept drifting into his mind and staying his wife she wasnt his wife he told himself savagely she was just some woman hed done a favor for she had nothing to do with him the car nosed itself toward her apartment all by itself what was he doing it was close to midnight jennyd be asleep and he had no business being there hed just drive by to see to see what he was being a dope but hed just drive by all the same her light was on he couldnt see jennys apartment from the street it had one lousy window looking out over the fire escape at the back but michael knew it well enough by now hed just sort of head his car down the back alley where hed parked it before and look up and her light was on so what if it was on so what if she was having a sleepless night maybe she was having cramps again it had nothing to do with him he told himself a note of desperation entering his logic tomorrow hed convince her to move into his place but for now she didnt want him if her muscles cramped then shed just walk around until they eased it was only for one night that was that he should never have come here he backed his car onto the street again and turned away from no he didnt turn away his car slowed to a crawl another car was parked in front of the apartments not just a car a mercedes this wasnt the sort of neighborhood where you parked a mercedes michael knew for one thing no one in this neighborhood owned such a pricey car for another it was careless on saturday nights vandalism was at its worst and parking expensive cars in this lowincome district was asking for trouble michael had left his corvette here two days ago in broad daylight with jenny inside and even then thered been trouble but why was the mercedes here and why was jennys light on maybe there was no connection at all still edgy he drove slowly past the car and noticed the tiny sticker on the edge of the windshield it was a stylish s so small and discreet that thieves werent supposed to know what it stood for but michael did hed been a cop he was trained to notice such things the s stood for sparchans rental servicesuppliers of luxury rental cars for the wellheeled tourist so what was a wellheeled tourist doing parked outside this dump of an apartment block at midnight when jennys light was on he didnt like it and suddenly his logic wasnt driving him instinct was it took him ten seconds to park the car ignoring the threat of thieves and vandals and another ten to race up three flights of stairs jenny at the top of the stairs he forced himself to pause hed been trained too well to rush in without thought stop think and live that was his legacy from dan it was a hardlearned lesson but one hed never forget he paused and slid along the wall his eyes on jennys door it was wide open and a woman was speaking not jenny an older woman with an aristocratic english accent measured controlled and icy with contempt youre coming with me my dear now if you believe ill allow my grandchild to be born here then youre even sillier than i think you are michael frowned there was real venom behind the words im not coming with you gloria that was jenny her breathing was too fast and it was all he could do not to rush in you can take your thugs and leave im staying right here thugs wait force yourself to wait he told himself harshly rushing could do more harm than good the thugs wouldnt be doing any physical harm he figured his thoughts racing if it was gloria she wouldnt allow jenny to be hurtnot while jenny was carrying the baby she wanted so much somehow michael forced himself to keep still straining all the time to hear youre not staying here glorias voice lowered became silky smooth michael slid silently along the wall until he was beside the doorway he could hear but not see thugs jenny had said how many its time this nonsense was over i have a plane waiting to leave the immigration people were ready to escort you there for me and then you had to be so foolish as to take such drastic measures to avoid them you might have known it wouldnt work what did you pay to have someone marry you i didnt pay michael he wanted of course you had to pay no one would want you like this the womans voice was disdainful look at you this place is a disgrace youre fat and unattractive and your breedings appalling what my son saw in you peter wanted me that stopped her for a moment oh yes gloria said at last her voice an angry hiss my esteemed son he wanted you for about five minutes you know very well the only reason he married you was that you were so lowclass he knew it would upset me you were a grubby bit of boyish rebellion nothing more get out jenny whispered and michael could hear fear mixed with her anger get out now this minute or ill call the police you just try it my dear there was a pause then jennys breath rasped inward as if something dreadful had been placed before her this is for you my sweet daughterinlaw we need to be sure you come quietly unless you agree to accompany me like the meek quiet mother of my sons heir no but yes my dear hed heard enough michael spun into the doorway and faced them there were two thugs men built like stud bulls they were dressed in immaculate suits but the image of civility stopped right there they looked like bouncers at some seedy nightclub and he thought he recognized one of them from his days on the force they were thicknecked and heavyjowled and seemed to have been squeezed into their suits with one glance michael understood jennys fear one of the men had a syringe and he was holding it toward jenny like a gun what the hell michaels mind raced hed seen syringes in his time held by drug addicts and wielded like weapons this one was different though these people wanted jennys baby at worst the syringe would contain an anesthetic and unless gloria was a complete fool it wouldnt be harmful to an unborn child or its mother there was no sign of any gun and why should there be they wouldnt need one two large men and one woman against a very pregnant jenny what were the odds jenny would be no match at all nor was there any guarantee michael could do better he thought grimly he wasnt carrying his gun he was fit and well trained but he wasnt as tall or as heavy as either of these guys he moved into the room and stepped aside leaving the doorway clear then he stood still looselimbed and watchful unnecessary violence wasnt his style besides which there was a really good chance he could lose what he needed here was logic thats enough he said flatly youre scaring the lady and shed like you to leave his voice was soft with just the faintest undertone of menace now who hed caught them by surprise gloria wheeled to face him who are you im jennys husband michael told her im asking you to go there was a long drawnout moment of absolute silence in which it seemed the whole world stood still jennys face was drained of all color shed backed away from the men and stood with her hands behind her to hold the table as though she had need of its support her eyes had flickered once to michael as he entered but her gaze returned to the first thugs hand they were fixed on the syringe she wouldnt be thinking the way he was michael knew shed be terrified of the syringe for her babys sake but the threat was fading the guy wielding the syringe hadnt moved he was the one michael had recognized and there was a trace of uncertainty in his eyes bruno michael said what the hell are you doing here brunos hand dropped to his side hes a cop he said into the stillness i know him it obviously made a difference bruno would do a lot for money michael thought grimly but violencekidnapping and assaultin front of cops was out of his league michael had arrested him in a drug bust years back just as well bruno didnt know he had left the force brunos eyes were on gloria and gloria was obviously thinking fast the lady was diminutive and beautifully groomed dressed in an immaculate soft gray suit that must have set the estate back thousands her dark hair was perfectly coiffed her eyebrows penciled into lines of permanent astonishment and her pearls looked to be worth a kings ransom she had the appearance of a woman in charge of her world she wasnt in charge now michael could see a whole gamut of emotions race across her features as her sharp intelligent eyes summed him up she cast a quick glance at bruno and saw his uncertainty it added to her own he saw her other henchmans muscles tense and involuntarily tensed his own he had to deflect the violence fast michael was superbly muscled and trained to use his body to good effect but there were two against one here and he was no superman yeah im a cop and i wouldnt do anything stupid he said into the silence its not worth it it will achieve nothing and get you into so much trouble your heads will spin all the money in the world wont get you out of it and then he waited while gloria thought what were her options he asked himself his eyes not leaving her face keep going make her men bash himif they wouldand take jenny by force even if you hurt me he said pleasantly i have a large extended family who will move to protect jenny plus the police force shes not alone she has meher husbandand she has inlaws and connections if you succeed in taking jenny out of the country wed invoke the full force of the law in having her and her baby returned the lords and the maitlands are a powerful force in austin this is our territory and youre not welcome silence the womans face contorted in fury what are you being paid she demanded at last her voice furious im sorry michael showed polite surprise nothing more his eyebrows arched as if he couldnt make any sense of what he was hearing what has the girl promised you i dont understand you wont get any of it the child stands to inherit but the girl herself shes as poor as a churchmouse if were talking about jenny of course were talking about jenny my daughterinlaw but if shes you know i dont think she is your daughterinlaw anymore michael said evenly his eyes flicking to jenny and then moving away hell she looked dreadful if he kept looking at her hed slug someone she was only your daughterinlaw while she was married to your son but shes no longer married to your son shes married to me you really married her he didnt just want to slug someone he wanted to slug her i really married her why on earth thats none of your business michaels voice was flint hard get out no gloria smiled then and at her nod bruno carefully replaced the cap on the syringe he placed the sealed syringe in his pocket and jennys breath came out in a rush of relief not quite yet now michael took one dangerous step forward but gloria put up two beautifully manicured hands theres no need there is how much do you want it was a raw demand thrown bluntly into the room and it had the effect of making michael stop dead what i assume theres money in here somewhere gloria cast a disdainful look at jenny i have no idea what terms youve agreed on but ill make it worth your while to forget them you can say you married her when you were drunk ill pay you off and well have your marriage annulled youll find me more than generous generous michaels eyes were watchful carefully assessing more than generous glorias mouth twisted into the selfsatisfied smile of someone who knew everyone had his price say two hundred thousand american dollars pounds sterling the smugness grew more pronounced thats about three hundred thousand of your i know what its worth michaels eyes narrowed youd pay that much you must really want her i want nothing about her i just want the baby im not jenny spoke from the other side of the room but gloria turned on her like a snake quiet girl were talking business how high will you go michael asked idly and waited gloria looked at him assessingly i have to assume youll go higher if jenny has offered me more than that she hasnt gloria swiveled to stare at jenny incredulously she doesnt have a penny to her name ive seen to that if shes said she has then shes lying how much michael asked half a million pounds i dont you really want the kid do you want him half a million pounds worth i dont get out then michael said indifferently half a million pounds or were not talking at all michael jennys voice rose in dismay she was staring from gloria to michael and her face reflected her sense of betrayal you dont mean quiet jenny michael said kindly cant you see your motherinlawor your exmotherinlawand i are doing business i dont wish gloria said but michael interrupted thats not the way to talk not when youre trying to buy a mans wife from him half a million or out he took a step toward gloria and gloria fell back as the thugs stepped forward neither of the heavyweights seemed to know what to do very well i agree gloria said weakly half a million silence youll pay that much michael demanded i said i agreed half a million pounds michael said blankly you have to be kidding certified check if you must jenny gave an angry desperate gasp and headed for the door michael moved to block her holding her lightly against him no jen stay im not a possession she said furiously to be bartered no he looked thoughtfully into her furious eyes and smiled then looked at gloria shes right jens not a possession besides shes real cute you know i have a mind to keep her for half a million i know im nuts but a wife like this doesnt come along every day you know you dont want her its just a marriage of convenience how much you mean youd go higher i gloria looked incredulous then the venom returned in force if i must but not shes not for sale youll have your price everyone does and if you dont sell are you threatening me if you like its my sons child no michaels arm held jenny tight jennys carrying my son thats the end of it your son she hissed any dna testing in the world will tell thats nonsense i think youll find michael said smoothly that since ive married jenny any court in the land will uphold my right to claim fatherhoodwith or without dna testing as long as jenny doesnt dispute it and i dont think shell do that he looked into her confused eyes and smiled will you love no i didnt think so his thoughtful gaze returned to gloria now get out and stay out take your hired men and your filthy little syringe and your private jet and get the hell out of this country if jenny and i never see you again itll be too soon you cant oh yes i can michael said softly dangerously jennys my wife and i know how to look after my own get out now they didnt speak they didnt speak while gloria and her thugs took themselves down the stairs bruno giving them a nervous backward glance they didnt speak while the trio gunned the mercedes into action and drove out of sight rubber burning on the road behind them michael could have bet bruno was behind the wheel jenny stood numb while michael crossed to the bed and reached under it for her suitcase finally she stirred to life again a couple of kidsa boy and girl of about sixteen draped around each other in obvious lusthad stopped at her open door and were staring in their curiosity was obvious you heading to the hospital the boy demanded looking with fascination from jennys belly to where michael was placing things in her suitcase looks about time my mom said you went on thursday false alarm iyeah gee youre big the girl breathed and michael suppressed a grin and turned to face them thats what happens when you let your heart take over from your head he told the entwined couple itll happen to you too if youre not careful were not that dopey hes got protection the girl retorted dont you bob but bob it seemed hadnt he gave a shamefaced grin aw we dont need it mary its safe the girl wrinkled her nose in horror and turned to look at jenny her eyes widened obviously jennys condition didnt appeal one bit you moron you think i want to be as fat as that get real aw mary the girl turned and fled downstairs and bob followed bleating protestations of eternal love he hadnt caught her by the time he reached the street and his protests echoed faintly into the night i think we might just have done our bit for population control michael said grinning then he glanced at jennys white face and tried to think of something to ease the strain he saw there she wasnt smiling hey its okay jen dont worry ill look after you i dont want to be looked after she closed her apartment door and leaned against it breathing fast nor do i want to be an advertisement for safe sex michael what are you doing packing i can see that but why you know you cant stay here or youll sell me she said bitterly for half a million pounds that was some offer he tried to make her smile just lucky im already loaded lucky she winced you sounded interested yeah he left what he was doing and put his hands on her shoulders holding her at arms length her eyes were full of worry sure i was interested in seeing just how far shed go and and it seems the skys the limit if shes prepared to pay half a million for this baby then you move into my place right now i thought wed have a couple of days grace from immigration and maybe we do but its not safe for you to stay here glorias gone if you stay here then shell be back no yes jenny he said his eyes locking on hers she wants your baby and she wants it a lot her offer told me that the woman has no scruples you need to be out of her range ill go to a hotel you think she cant find you she has serious money jen she can bribe and she can buy whatever she wants but im married i have the right to stay here she cant touch me even if she forced me to go to england tonight do you think id stay there what would you do if she succeeded in getting you back to england you have no money and she has influence there if she manages to get the baby to england and applies to the courts for custody lord only knows what dirt shell dig up against you she can pay whoever she wants to say whatever she likes since the baby stands to inherit the title then an english court may order that the baby stays with her so so the only thing to do is to stay with our original plan he said still holding her shoulders his gaze was intent and sure jennys world was crumbling so he had to sound confident i understand why you had to run but the threats not over we make sure our marriage sticks its a legal contract but gloria will be down at immigration first thing tomorrow telling them our marriage is a sham shell shout it to the rooftops and if necessary shell bribe them to get their interest but jen if shes not back here tomorrow the immigration officials will be thats almost guaranteed either way you cant be here our marriage has to seem real you have to be with me you need my protection and so does your baby he gave a selfmocking smile maybe its time for me to be a real hero she didnt smile back michael i dont want to live with you jen we started this he told her and his voice took on a note of steel you knew youd have to stay with me whether you want to admit it or not to do otherwise is stupid and glorias proven that tonight now lets get your gear packed and move you where you legally belong living with your husband jenny said nothing on the drive but michael was growing accustomed to her silences he liked them he thought when his sisters were upset they let him have it with both barrels jenny withdrew into herself holding her trouble close they had packed all her belongings into the corvette there was nothing personal left in her apartment the break has to be complete he told her i cant stay with you forever a couple of years he thought but he knew if he said that shed bolt like a startled rabbit lets take one day at a time he said instead or even one night at a time he thought as he watched her worried face her absolute weariness concerned him his first priority was to get her to sleep tonight the responsibility hed taken on was growing heavier by the minute he acknowledged bleakly it seemed he had himself a wife in truth as well as on paper at least she had a calm nature he decided trying to look on the brighter side she wouldnt disturb his bachelor existence much ill try not to be too much trouble she whispered into the dark as if she guessed his thoughts i never meant to do this to you i offered he said and managed a smile dont be grateful jen just do what you need to do to survive and go from there michaels home couldnt have been more different from jennys his multilevel town house was part of a new housing development built on a treelined avenue overlooking the bike trails by town lake michael hit his remote control and the door of his garage slid silently up the corvette entered the garage and the door slid closed behind them and jenny had the sensation of being trapped crazy or not she had to suppress an impulse to get out thump on the garage door and demand to be let out but michael was holding open the door to his house and she had nothing to do but walk inside and gasp his home was white jenny stopped dead and stared around with astonishment of all the places shed imagined michael could live this wasnt it this was no messy bachelor pad the place was stark and coldly white with the occasional splash of black for dramatic effect white tiles white chairs and sofa white wood furniture with glasstopped tables to reflect the white tiles white walls with black and white prints on the walls white drapes michael put down the first load of her belongings and pulled the drapes wide outside was parkland and the river beyond the lights of austin were twinkling against the night sky gorgeous she turned to the roomand shuddered michael whats wrong this room she gestured helplessly i cant you cant what i cant live here she said honestly i dont think i can even stay here why not he smiled at her its in better shape than your place that was a real dump theres no need to get personal but it was admit it her anger flared if were talking of dumps are we he was watching the spark behind her green eyes she came alive when she was angry she really was lovely whats wrong with this place he asked and watched while she tried like crazy to be polite and failed she took a deep breath michael its awful oh yeah who are we kidding here your place was awful this place has serious money spent on it i can see that and of all the wasteful she bit her lip and michael grinned she was so transparent go on im too polite no come on jen he was enjoying this ive been honest about your place you owe me the same you dont want to know yeah i do she was fascinating her eyes were roving around the place as if she were mentally pulling it apart and he could see her courage returning were married remember youre going to have to show immigration officials around and admit you like living here you think i could do that in a million years she asked incredulously why not oh yeah as if i could ever like white id rather face gloria again than admit i had anything to do with this place where do you relax im not here much i can see that it looks like the photographers just left but when you are here where do you watch tv and drink beer mostly i do my beer drinking at garretts ranch he admitted no wonder its so cold here who decorated the place a woman i went out with how many times did you go out with her jenny demanded fixing him with a look michael stared at her she was transforming in front of his eyes this wasnt the quiet jenny he thought hed married beats me twice maybe she obviously didnt know you this isnt decorating this is a vacuum she went to the sofa and stared in disgust at its gorgeous white surface you dont sit on this thing of course i do he was stung how often i dont know sometimes like never she said flatly i tell you michael if you sat here now youd leave a mark thatd take a chemical arsenal to remove i bet your housekeeper has an awful job keeping it clean he glared cornered how do you know i have a housekeeper hey i just guessed she grinned sherlock holmes thats me and ill bet she comes once a day or more whats her name i dont michael frowned what the heck does it matter what her name is its an agency whoevers available comes i dont know names then thats easy michael you dont really like this stuff do you did he he tried to find words to defend his decor but they werent there to find there was something about this woman that demanded honesty no but let me fix it for you her eyes gleamed with challenge and he found himself starting to laugh hey i didnt bring you here to work and theres no way im sitting here idle im scared to sit down this stuff is the pits and if i have to stay here for a month ill go nuts you remember what i did with your office did he his office had been a bit like this all chrome efficiency five months agoit must have been about the time jenny startedit was suddenly transformed his glass desk was replaced by a vast antique wooden one his swivel chair became old leather the chrome disappeared and someone painted the walls a dusky pink instead of gray he hadnt realized shed done it until now hed thought it was part of an office renovation ordered by ellie come to think of it though it was a darn sight more comfortable place to work now than it had been before but she was starting on his home well talk about it in the morning theres no problem she was staring at the furniture as if it were poison ill be able to sell these for heaps and replace them with items that are much more comfortable you wont even have to write a check jen she fixed him with a look and for the first time he felt like alike a husband tell me that you like this stuff and i wont touch it i dont like it butits home you watch tv at your brothers yeah but let me have carte blanche to fix this place and ill feel happier living here itll be a project for me she smiled at him her most charming smile it was a smile that made him blink made him take a step backward please you havent even seen your bedroom yet maybe you wont want to stay he said weakly knowing he was defeated before he started i dont want to stay she said honestly her eyes sparkling at the sound of defeat in his voice she knew shed won but if i must stay then ill be useful and ill run replacements past you before i buy them im not taking over your life michael itll be your choice hell jen he stared at her baffled he was so far at sea here he was almost drowning thats just how he did feel as if his life were being taken overby a tidal wave you do what you want he said heavily humor fading youre my wife so this is your home do what you want her bedroom was the most comfortable place in the house shelby stayed in it while her place was being redone michael told her as he showed her in jenny had fallen silent again and it was worrying him it seemed there were two jennysthe one whod been kicked so many times it was hardly worth getting up again and the stronger jenny who was only allowed to escape for brief airings and then put firmly back in her box she added a few of her own touches there was a bright patterned quilt on the bed a floral print on the wall and a large framed photo on the bedside table the picture showed a middleaged couple parental and proud with their children the two girls and the younger boy looked to be about four years old and there was an older boy of about six there was no mistaking who they were michaels grin even then was unique id forgotten youre a triplet jenny exclaimed finding her voice who are the others thats lana sitting down i gather youve met her shelbys behind me and has my arm twisted behind my backthats because i was going through a phase of sticking my tongue out at the camera garretts the big guy they all live here in austin she frowned in concentration lana runs the baby shop and shelby owns austin eats diner next to the hospital garrett lives on his ranch a few miles out of town jenny was frowning something about the picture didnt make sense you all have red hair she said slowly but your parents dont we were adopted something in his voice warned jenny she shouldnt take it further but she was so far past exhaustion she didnt pick up on it thats right you said your birth mother abandoned you but your adoptive parents took all four of you thats wonderful they were wonderful people were they died some time ago oh michael im sorry she hesitated and your birth parents i know nothing about them his voice was clipped and tight but she was still too tired to pick up on it as i said my birth mother abandoned us when we were babies youve never tried to trace her why would i want to do that it must be the most awful thing she said her hands moving unconsciously to her stomach to give up your baby and to give up four babies itd be like tearing yourself apart not everyone feels like you do maybe not her eyes were clouded doubtful she obviously couldnt see how anyone would feel different his birth mother had michael thought bitterly shed just walked away there must have been some dreadful reason itd probably be easy enough to trace her leave it jen he said roughly lets leave it the force of his words took her by surprise and she backed off okay im sorry she was hurt he could see in her eyes that she was flinching inside wondering what shed said he hadnt meant to snap were both tired he said a note of contrition in his voice lets turn in now the guest bathrooms just here if theres anything more you want no thank you michael youve done enough it was an odd formal little speech and sounded wrong to both of them ill go to bed then he said good night damn she sounded so forlorn he wanted to take her in his arms and he didnt know what he just knew he had to get out of that room while he still had the strength to resist good night then jenny sleep well and he walked out of her bedroom and closed the door so fast youd think there were demons after him chapter seven michael woke to the smell of pancakes he lay for a moment in his stark white bedroom sniffing the air wondering if he was mistaken nope definitely pancakes there were pancakes being made in his kitchen how long since anyone had cooked in his kitchen shelby had when she was here when was thateighteen months ago hed eaten at home then but mostly he ate breakfast down at her diner the rest of his meals too come to think of it he used the kitchen for making coffee and heating tv dinners but pancakes jenny was making pancakes what time was it he lifted his wrist and inspected his watch seventhirty he stared at the dial as if it must be a mistake what was she doing up it had been well past midnight when she went to bed she should still be sleeping he shoved back the covers and headed for the doorand then remembered that he wasnt alone swearing he grabbed his pants as a knock sounded on the door and it started to open he yelped and dived for the bedcovers whether hed made it in time or not he couldnt tell when he turned to face his visitor his sheet decorously up to his neck she was in the room a twitching muscle at the corner of her mouth and a twinkle lurking at the back of her eyes made him suspect that he hadnt im sorry she said apologetically the twinkle growing i shouldnt have disturbed you but ive made you breakfast itll spoil if it stays in the oven but michael was no longer focusing on breakfastor on his modesty what on earth was she wearing he blinked and blinked again he was accustomed to jenny in the plain navy or black shapeless dresses she wore to work they looked like something out of the welfare bin from thirty years back he thought grimly hed grown accustomed to the idea that his secretary spent no money and no time on her clothing but what was she wearing now thered been a pile of clothes in the bottom of her suitcase this must have been among them traces of a previous life he thought and the traces were stunning she was dressed in bright crimson leggings an oversize tshirt that practically reached her knees with crimson purple yellow and white stripes and brilliant yellow trainers on her feet with black laces her shoulderlength curls usually held demurely back bounced happily in a ponytail tied up with a huge crimson ribbon what the she still looked pregnantvery pregnantbut she seemed about ten years younger she looked amazing she looked gorgeous you dont wear clothes like that he said and she grinned bouncing over to put his pancakes on his bedside table her ponytail bounced in unison i do well mostly i do in my past life i did when im doing office work when im eight months pregnant and when i dont have any money to spend on clothes then i dont i wear sacks that i make myself but these leggings are lycra see she held up her tshirt so michael could see where the lycra stretched to dangerous limits he blinked again this is what i wore for jogging before i was pregnant its the only outfit that still fits me though whether or not it will after my babys born she looked thoughtful maybe ive ruined my leggings but i guess i can always wear suspenders she smiled happily at him supremely unconcerned anyway im off heres your breakfast youre off for a jog she grinned well a joggle more like im not very fast and im not very elegant are you supposed to be doing that yep abby says so theres more pancakes in the oven if you want them ive eaten six six he was starting to sound inane and jenny was aware of it she couldnt know he was just plain dumbfounded you dont sound very bright this morning she said peering at him anxiously maybe i shouldnt have woken you she looked at him with maternal concern you just eat your pancakestheres a nice cup of tea here tooand then snuggle under the covers ill come in very quietly when i return so i dont wake you jenny goaded he started to throw the covers off then thought better of it jenny chuckled very wise wait and ill come with you why on earth would you want to do that she asked in amazement its sunday morning why on earth would you want to do it thats easy its a gorgeous morning the rivers calling ive been so worried for the last few weeks that ive been making myself ill but suddenly thanks to you her smile softened so much it made his gut kick in im no longer worried alls right with my world and im off to feel the sun on my face she stooped and before he knew what she was planning to do she kissed him lightly on the forehead then she whisked herself over to the doorway smiling at his baffled expression jenny he began yes he stared he stared at her some more then he stared at the beautifully prepared traythe stack of pancakes the maple syrup and whipped butter the little teapot he hadnt even known he had then he stared at her this stunning laughing woman he hadnt known existed under his staid plain secretary imim sorry i didnt get up when you started to cook he said at last sounding pathetic even to himself im not much into domesticity then thats a pity michael she said softly the twinkle still in her eye he had an overwhelming impression he was being laughed at because like it or not youve married into all the domesticity i can muster for about fifteen minutes after she left he stayed in bed he ate his pancakeswell he ate four and couldnt figure out how shed managed sixand then lay back and stared at the ceiling sunday morning he usually joined up with a couple of buddies who were into basketball like him they were cops or excops they shot a few baskets had a couple of beers and shared some laughs and generally reassured themselves that the bachelor life they led was exactly what they wanted once upon a time there were a dozen or so guys who showed up lately hed been thinking they were becoming an endangered species if he didnt go he told himself theyd be even more endangered so why shouldnt he go hed given jenny a key last night there was no need for him to stay here and wait for her to return he could head off to the courts and she could let herself in there was no need to wait she shouldnt be long he rose and showeredslowlyand dressed and she wasnt back yet he took his breakfast dishes into his pristine kitchen and loaded the dishwasher he collected the newspaper and read a few headlines she still wasnt back the guys would be waiting theyd be on the court he paced and swore she wasnt back even then okay hed just wander down the road take the path by the river heck it was as good for him to take a river walk as it was to shoot baskets and the guys wouldnt miss him this once he started walking but since he was wearing runners it wasnt long before his feet started a jogging rhythm what if glorias thugs had been waiting for her logic told him he was being unreasonable there was no way glorias hired men would be lying in wait for her down by the river so early on a sunday morning there was no chance they could have guessed shed go there but if theyd been driving by youre getting paranoid michael said crossly but his feet hastened their pace all the same his jog turning to a run finally he could see the wide riverbank and she was there if there was one thing that could be said for yellow crimson purple and white stripes on a very pregnant lady it was that they could be seen from a long way off jenny stood out like a striped beacon she appeared to be playing hopscotch she couldnt be michael thought but that was exactly what she was doing home she yelled triumphantly she was surrounded by a sea of little girlshalf a dozen sixor sevenyearoldsand they had a hopscotch court marked with stones theyd been egging her on she held up her stick triumphant and waved you bet i couldnt make it hows that for a pregnant lady the girls fell into a fit of giggles and an elderly lady rose from the park bench and clapped her hands thats wonderful my dear but should you be jumping i mean the baby my babys jumping so much that his mother needs to get her own back she grinned at the girls and then she caught sight of michael who just happened to arrive breathless michael he said the first thing that came into his head and his first thought was the same as the elderly ladys you shouldnt be jumping are you an obstetrician no but then im jumping nope he reached her and pulled her away from the hopscotch court then stood glaring into her laughing eyes honestly woman have you no sense she laughed at him her face glowing with exercise and sunshine the october morning was clear with the promise of a gorgeous day to come im not feeling very sensible she admitted im feeling pretty happy right at this minute michael this is mrs eldbridge and her granddaughter susan and susans friends lucy and veronica and louise and carrie and rebecca its susans seventh birthday or it was yesterday were still celebrating ladies this isthis is michael is he your husband a child with a hole instead of a front tooth and two extremely long pigtails looked at him with interest for the first time jenny faltered yes this is my husband and your husband says you shouldnt be playing hopscotch michael growled and the little girls giggled they clearly didnt think much of his ferocity but they seemed to think michael himself was just fine the little girls obviously thought he was a hunk jenny observed her husband somehow she made herself concentrate on something other than his body michael i was thinking he still held her his hands were on her shoulders where hed pulled her from the hopscotch court she looked into his face and smiled and suddenly she was too close for comfort way too closebut there was no way he was releasing her can we all come back to yourto our place for pancakes she asked that stunned him what everyone he looked around the sea of expectant faces and jenny put an entreating hand on the collar of his shirt its just mrs eldbridge lives in a oneroom apartment with her granddaughter and susan really wanted a sleepover for her birthday party so thats what they had but the girls woke up very early and theres a man who sleeps in the apartment above whowho doesnt like being woken up early and was rude he yelled awful things the little girl with pigtails said wideeyed and the girls arent being collected by their parents until eleven so mrs eldbridge brought them down to the river but she still has more than two hours to fill he gave an inward groan jenny i dont see we have enough to give everyone breakfast dont we i dont think i do michael said i mean we for a start we dont have enough plates for heavens sake what was he saying this was nothing to do with him he didnt want to be part of a childs birthday party of course you dont have enough plates mrs eldbridge said thats nonsense were fine well keep walking wont we girls lets see if we can see some boats the girls faces fell as one ive walked enough one said sadly these are my party shoes she gulped sticking one shiny red shoe in front of her actually she said carefully theyre my sisters party shoes and they pinch my toes they hurt she looked at michael with huge mournful eyes and jenny gazed at him with eyes just as pleading cocker spaniel eyes eyes a man could drown in good grief we dont have enough plates he repeated weakly it sounded pathetic even to him we could share the little girl with the pinching shoes said no the thought of a sevenyearold birthday party in his bachelor town house was almost claustrophobic but every eye was on him including jennys clearly shed offered hospitality and she expected him to back her he was wedged into a corner and he said the only thing possible why dont we go to shelbys shelbys jenny was as confused as the children my sister runs a diner its not too far from here yep thats what theyd do he decided after all what use were sisters if they couldnt bail you out once in a while shelby makes the best breakfast you want to go to your sisters diner she stared at him and then at her stripes now hey maybe it wasnt such a good idea he realized but hed already suggested it and the kids were looking as if theyd been offered christmas this wasnt a privileged group he decided most of the little girls looked as if they were dressed in handmedowns and susan the birthday girl was almost waiflike she obviously lived with her grandma and grandma didnt look as if there was any money to spare at all okay so jennys heartstrings had been tugged and he was expected to come to the party he didnt even know if shelby would be at the diner herself well need two cabs he said in a voice that sounded more sure than he felt hed get this over with and then hed give jenny a very firm talkingto about what she should expect of him maybe it was okay for her to get involved but she couldnt involve him he didnt need this in his life well take two cabs and well drop you back at your home at eleven theres no need for you to do that young man mrs eldbridge said with quiet dignity the girls and i are just fine walking by the water until its time to go home he should agreebut they were all looking at him one elderly lady in a worn dress and six small girls with bright expectant faces and one jenny all of a sudden it was easy there is a need he said smiling at the elderly lady with his most heartstopping smile it would be a real pleasure for jenny and me to be included in susans birthday if youll permit us she smiled then a huge relieved smile that almost made him glad hed offered well young man thats so nice of you you and your lovely wife id almost forgotten that such nice young couples exist she beamed at jenny youre so lucky my dear hes really special jenny beamed right back and tucked her hand proprietorially around michaels arm dont i know it she said im feeling luckier by the minute shelby was at the diner it only took five minutes to get there by car michael and mrs eldbridge went in one cab with three of the girls while jenny and the other three followed behind in a second taxi they assembled on the pavement and michael opened the door to usher them inside shelby looked up from behind the counterand nearly dropped the plate she was carrying michael she said in a voice that sounded like shed been hit with a hundred volts hi shel what do you do in the way of birthday breakfasts birthday its susans birthday michael told her patiently in a voice that suggested shed better treat this as normalor else he motioned to susan here she is the birthday girl herself i thought pancakes or doughnuts or or both susan said wistfully staring around in appreciation at shelbys cozy eatery the smells coming from the kitchen were mouthwatering and michael could see lights coming on in all the little girls eyes or both michael agreed gravely could you manage that shel and maybe hot chocolate all around with marshmallows on top jenny added from behind him working up courage she bit her lip it wasnt the time in front of this birthday group to admit she was meeting michaels sister for the first time hello shelby jenny shelby said dazed her eyes wandering to the amazing stripes youre jenny and i met mrs eldbridge her granddaughter and their friends on the riverbank while we were jogging michael said quickly you were jogging shelby could barely make her voice work as she tore her eyes from jenny to stare at her brother we were jogging his eyes dared her to say more jenny invited everyone home for breakfast but i thought thered be more choices here what do you think there was silence while shelby almost visibly gathered her wits i do a very nice birthday breakfast she said at last im only here for a couple of hours before i need to leave for the wedding otherwise id have missed this very fortunate michael said dryly and his eyes met hers steel meeting steel shelby hot chocolates coming up she said faintly with marshmallows and then under her breath she added a rider just as soon as ive phoned lana and garrett and told them to come over and take a look at this miracle it was a riot of a birthday party once she got over her shock shelby did them proud after they drank their hot chocolate she ushered everyone into the kitchen to flip their own pancakes once theyd eaten they were each allowed two choices on the jukebox and jenny had them all dancing much to the bemusement of shelbys other customers after half an hours dancing she even had a few staid adults jiving their legs off a couple of interns from the hospital wandered in they were given free coffee and directed to a sevenyearold partner michael who was dancing with the birthday girl at jennys direction felt his mind spin at what his wife had accomplished then there was the birthday cake rising nobly to the occasion shelby produced a snake of doughnuts in the shape of a huge s for susan with seven candles shed found partied out each little girl was finally ushered into a cab clutching a bag full of warm doughnuts for home i cant believe you did this susans grandmother whispered as they filled the second cab with her charges her eyes brimmed with tears susan and iwell we dont have very much but she wanted a birthday party so badly this morning everything was going wrong she took michaels hands between hers and squeezed your wife shes just the loveliest girl and she deserveswell you look after her do you hear she gave his hands a last squeeze cast a teary smile at jenny and disappeared into the morning with her swarm of little girls michael turned away to find jenny watching him and shelby and lana and dylan and garrett and greg they were all out on the sidewalk and every single one of them had big goofy grins on their faces what the heck i thought they needed to come down and see shelby said innocently garrett was neck deep in wedding chaos but even he had to come i knew theyd never believe me if they didnt see it for themselves how long weve been here half an hour garrett said grinning weve been in the back spying on you youre a great dancer he turned to jenny so i guess youre michaels jenny i she flushed im not youre not im just jenny she said simply nope garrett shook his head youre not just jenny his eyes were warm and there was laughter lurking somewhere behind them if you can get my brother to put on a birthday party for a bunch of kids he doesnt know thats enough garrett michael said roughly there was hardly a choice jenny was right the kids were getting restless down by the river yeah and youd have noticed without jenny anyone would jenny took a deep breath searching for courage you must be garrett michaels big brother of course she gave him a shy smile you still look like your picture same red hair same bigbrother look whats a bigbrother look he demanded and jennys smile widened i guess sort of proud and worried both at the same time garrett let his breath out whoa i think i just stopped worrying he told her and reached forward to give her a hug of welcome bulging stripes and all i think i stopped worrying right this minute welcome to the family jenny lord jenny lord she cast a doubtful look at michael oh yeah i guess i am i guess you are garrett told her and im wondering whether my little brother knows just what hes let himself in for by the end of the afternoon he was beginning to find out they went to the wedding camille and jake had decided they wanted a lowkey affairjust those we love in a place we loveand there wasnt a chance of michael getting out of it jakell personally come and get you if you dont show up little brother garrett told him and so will camille youre part of their family and jennys your wife michael had cringed inside he did not want to go he had helped jake defend camille from her exhusband vince but the events of those few short months ago were still nightmare fresh the shootout at garretts cabin the dreadful moment when hed thought garrett was dead he should have prevented it he thought savagely he should have realized how desperate camilles exhusband would be he hadntand garrett had been shot the love that camille and jake shared had blossomed from that near tragedy and the family had moved on but for michael it had been one more reason for selfimposed isolation and now sitting beside jenny who looked lovely in the white dress lana had borrowed for her he felt so constrained he wanted to bolt for freedom the wedding ceremony started camille exquisite in her beautifully embroidered gown of soft raw silk gazed into jakes face with love and total trust and she gave him the answers he so longed for with sureness and with pride i camille take you jake for richer for poorer in sickness and in health michael looked away he glanced at jenny and found her expression as strained as he felt shed done this twice before he thought shed marriedand now peter was dead shed made those vows again to him what had these new vows meant for her had peter looked at her the way jake was looking at camille something stirred inside him that could almost have been envy he glanced at jennys hands which she clasped and unclasped in her lap his ring encircled her finger but she wore peters rings on her right hand he had an almost irresistible urge to still those restless fingers with his own but such an action would signal a commitment he thought fiercely and thats exactly what he didnt want commitment meant pain she would walk away as his birth mother had as barbara had so he kept his hand to himself but afterward as the maitland and lord families and their friends milled in the afternoon sunshine reveling in the happiness of the bride and groom and checking out jenny with stunned amazement he finally took her hand not to comfort to escape lets get away he told her ive had enough of this wordlessly she agreedshed said nothing for most of the afternoonand they left as soon as decently possible once in the car with jenny sitting whitefaced and silent beside him all he felt was an overwhelming claustrophobia why he demanded of himself as he drove the afternoon couldnt have gone better jenny had been welcomed and embraced into the family garrett had even hinted she might help in the search for their birth mother michael had nixed that one pretty fast then shelby and lana had started grilling jenny mercilessly about her past what they learned they must have liked because by the time they left his sisters were starting to talk about turning michaels spare room into a nursery and who was the best babysitter around to her credit jenny had mostly listened she hadnt agreed to garretts request for help but had deferred to michael and shed seemed content to have shelby and lana make plans around her however quiet or not she hadnt refuted anything she hadnt come right out and said were not turning michaels spare room into a nursery because thats where i sleep michael and i dont sleep together were not a proper husband and wife it would have been hard to say it in the face of their enthusiasm he acknowledged but maybe she could have tried it was important and what would she have done if shed been faced with the maitland clans attention the two of them made their escape while most of the maitlands were still with the photographer so jenny had been spared megans welcome ellies shock and abbys concern that was to come now that theyd heard the news their curiosity would be aroused even garrett seemed to assume things had changed michael thought as he drove his wife toward town sunday nights michael usually spent at the ranch and he and garrett played pool on their dads old pool table after the wedding celebrations thats ordinarily what would have happened but garrett hadnt even raised the possibility hed helped jenny into the corvette and waved a hand in farewell as if he wouldnt be seeing his brother for a while see you around mike then hed looked sideways at jenny im sorry you need to go but i understand you must be tired jenny you take care of the lady now mike shes quite something she was michael thought bitterly glancing sideways at jenny but she wasnt really his wife im sorry michael she sounded tired and when he checked her out again he saw that her face had sagged it wasnt meant what wasnt meant everything she whispered i mean when i saw those little girls this morning i felt so sorry for their grandma that i just offered without thinking youd think id have learned not to be so darned impetuous by now and then when it ended up with me having to go to the wedding with you and all your family being so welcoming youve hated it and i dont blame you i didnt hate it you did i can see that you did she sighed you mightnt know it but you get a sort of lookthe same one you get when some sales rep comes in with a security system that bores you to snores yet you still have to listen thats what you looked like today what all of today he was shocked surely not no she said not all most of the time you tried not to you were truly wonderful with the children this morning it was mostly this afternoon and maybemaybe its only because i know you well her voice faded to a whisper anyway im sorry and im sorry youre stuck with driving me home dont you and garrett normally spend time together on sunday night how do you know that youve told me she said lots of times when ive asked you about your weekends had he michael frowned he couldnt remember telling her about his weekends but maybe he had in the past few months jenny had become part of the furniture around his office he could very well have talked to her he decided hed never had to watch his tongue when she was around hed learned fast that anything he told her went no further and hed relaxed in her presence but he wasnt relaxed now he was edgy chafed by the ties hed never expected but she was untying them theres no need to stay home tonight on my account she told him just drop me off and go on back out to the ranch say i need to sleep its a family celebration you should be there garrett wont expect me jenny took a deep breath then maybe garrett should he knows this is just a formality our marriage yes our marriage i hope he does michael said and he couldnt keep the note of bitterness from his voice its obvious my sisters dont she hesitated thinking i wasnt sure what youd told them she said after a pause i didnt like to to dispel the romance michael i wouldnt presume she hesitated and cast a nervous look at him i dont want this you know dont want this marriage the strain of the afternoon was still with him youre not making that very clear there was another silence longer this time she fingered the rings on her right handthe rings shed moved the day she wed michael i dont michael peters only been dead for seven months theres no way she took a ragged breath if you think im damn now he had to feel guilty as well as trapped i dont think anything he said wearily i dont think a darned thing its what my sisters think which is that im finally domesticated trapped it was the wrong thing to say he knew it the minute he let the words leave his mouth but it was too late to retract them they hung in the silence between them like a threat then thats just stupid her voice rose a notch anger filtering through it her anger matched his i didnt trap you into marriage michael lord that would have been unfair you offered you came into this with your eyes wide open i was amazingly incredulously grateful for your offer but if id thought for a moment that you believed id engineered this i dont think that thats what it sounds like she said then im sorry but he couldnt get rid of the edge of anger in his voice no matter how unfair he knew he was being more constrained silence michael glanced at her damn she did look tired jenny michael lets just leave this she said wearily i feel so guilty anyway that i cant bear it at least not tonight theres no need for you to feel guilty he told her his own guilt still there youre right i offered what my family does to me is no fault of yours any family would do just what theyre doing theyre right and i should never have agreed to marry you i need towe need to do something she sighed but for now heaven knows what the answer is i seem to be getting deeper and deeper into a quagmire just drop me off at your house and go out to celebrate with your family please michael i dont want if you werent married would you ever stay home for dinner on a sunday night no but then theres your answer she said flatly youre not married not really so do what you always have done chapter eight he went out but he didnt return to the wedding hed be grilled within an inch of his life if he did the look in ellies eyes as shed headed for the family portrait session warned him he was in for it but the interrogation could wait besides he was convinced his brother and sisters would give him a hard time if they thought hed left jenny alone garrett and lana had seemed far too fond of jenny and even shelby seemed to be coming around so so he drove to his friend harveys drank a few beers watched a ball game on tv and tried to keep his hand out of sight so harvey wouldnt notice the ring not that harvey would he wasnt into wedding rings nine oclock the ball game ended there was time to watch another but just as harvey flicked the remote the phone rang harvey gave an apologetic grin and took the phone into the kitchen he came back a couple of minutes later a sheepish expression on his face sorry but i need to kick you out mike he said somethings come up like michael stared at his friends face confounded hed never seen harvey look like this before like a woman rose harvey said a dreamy expression drifting into his eyes i took her out last week it was the first time shes agreed to date me though ive been asking her forever it was worth the wait shes really something she needed to go to vegas to see her parents for the weekend but i said if she got back in time maybe we could go out together tonightgrab a burger or something he paused and the sheepish grin intensified so she called guess this means shes interested huh i guess it does michael said slowly he rose well ill be off then i knew you wouldnt mind hey this morning when you didnt show that had to be a woman right michael hesitated i knew it harvey said interpreting his silence as confirmation he clapped michael on the shoulder and beamed must be something in the water and were all catching it see you next week buddythat is if youre not busy or if im not busy but hey i hope we are okay fate was telling him it was time to go home michael thought and maybe it was nine was late enough jenny would most likely be in bed by now hed hit the cot himself then get up early tomorrow and be at work before she woke theyd start their independent lives together as of this moment was harvey right was there something in the water he didnt think so he sure didnt feel like a dose of domesticity he felttrapped he drove his corvette into the garage his mind filled with dark thoughts he entered his darkened house the same way and looked around as if he was expecting a wife in curlers with rolling pin upraised which was crazy no one was up the lights were all off and jennys bedroom door was shut so this was what he wanted wasnt it he didnt need to check on her shed be fast asleep he flicked on the living room light frowned at the white sofashe was right about thatthen went into the kitchen to make himself a coffee he sure didnt feel like sleep though he didnt know why just then a knock sounded on the outside door who he opened the door and it was gloria there was a gray suit with her michaels first instinct was to slam the door shut on the pair of them but the official beside gloria looked just official enough to make him pause this wasnt one of glorias thugs it was the older of the two immigration officials whod started this whole mess even so he only opened the door wide enough to speak not to let anyone in mr lord it was the official speaking he held out a card henry harness from immigration can we come in no short blunt and to the point the man took a step back and stared apparently he wasnt used to people saying no to him i beg your pardon you heard michael told him no can i ask why not because youre with the lady michael nodded perfunctorily at gloria this woman has been causing my wife grief and shes not welcome here the man flicked an uneasy glance at gloria which made michael wonder just how much he was being paid to take an interest in these proceedings where on earth had gloria dug up an immigration official at ninethirty on a sunday night thereve been allegations of wrongdoings in relation to your marriage the man said and michael grunted yeah let me guess by whom i just need to satisfy myself that your wife is with you he said unless i can do that then tomorrow ill instigate investigations at whose request i dont understand youd better try harder then michael said flatly my wife and i have filled out every required form and satisfied all criteria but this woman he raised his eyebrows and gazed at the elegant gloria as if she was some form of pond scum this woman came around to my wifes old apartment last night while we were in the process of packing her belongings to come here she made certain threats and some of them were physical she upset her so much that my wife hardly slept last night tonight jennys barely asleep and here she comes to upset her again my wifes eight months pregnant this is harassment and shes not here gloria said triumphantly i told you the marriage is a sham do you have a warrant michael demanded of the official ignoring gloria completely a warrant to search michael said patiently i assume you know what a warrant is i the man was right off balance no but then go away and get one and while youre at it id take out some insurance on events that may happen if you badger my wife into giving birth prematurely because ill sue you for every cent youll ever earn and then some i didnt mean the man was flustered im sure if we inquire shes not here gloria was vitriolic in her certainty i tell you im sorry the official said heavily i cant force my way in no matter how how much are you being paid michael asked and the man flushed theres no need to take this further this evening good night mr lord ill come back in the morning if you bring my wifes exmotherinlaw with you then youre not welcome well act through the proper channels the man said stiffly i dont believe this lady is central to our inquiries im sure shes not michael said pleasantly and if i were you id make sure those channels of yours are legitimate or i wont answer for the consequences and he closed the door on the pair of them she must have heard as he closed the door michael expected jennys bedroom door to fly open she had the downstairs room the front door and her bedroom door were only feet apart unless she was sound asleep she must have heard every word that had been said there was nothing only absolute silence from within he heard glorias car start and disappear into the night theyd well and truly gone so why didnt jenny come out she must be exhausted he told himself shed been up way before him this morning and the wedding had been both a physical and emotional strain he didnt want to wake her but jenny he said softly trying to fight his increasing sense that something was wrong jen nothing she was asleep he told himself firmly her bedroom door was closed and that was that but he couldnt for the life of him go to bed without checking he was being stupid paranoid intrusive but he opened her bedroom door just a crack her bed was still beautifully made up and it was empty so was her bedroom where on earth was she michael stared at the untouched bed for all of two minutes his mind racing in every direction had she left him his eyes roved around the room taking in her folded pajamas on the pillow and her husbands photograph in the frame beside the bed she wouldnt have left that behind so where the conversation on the way back from the wedding played uneasily in his brain i seem to be getting deeper and deeper into a quagmire i should never have agreed to marry you she was confused she was depressed and shed been alone all night hell he never should have left her where could she have gone his head was spinning as he tried to find answers she didnt have a car she didnt have any money and if she was leaving then surely shed have taken her few possessions so where the river the answer came so suddenly it was like a bolt out of the blue and it scared him stupid no she couldnt be that depressed i should never have agreed to marry you ill have to do something she wouldnt be so crazy so desperate but he was already moving toward the door and he was starting to run he searched for half an hour without finding her he was close to breaking point as angry and frustrated as hed ever been in his life and scared surely she hadnt done anything stupid he told himself over and over surely she couldnt he forced himself to slow down walking along the hiking trails methodically searching every park bench and every twist and turn of the waters edge his eyes searched the shadows under the trees if she was here then hed find herif she wanted to be found an autumn fog was settling over the water making the pools of light from the lamps strange and distorted the bats that made their home under the bridges were swooping low over the water and the stillness was almost eerie if he called her name the sound would echo up and down the river and achieve nothingexcept make him feel like he was going mad which was just how he was feeling crazy this was unbearable he thought back to the jenny of this morning bouncing up and down on the hopscotch court in her wondrous clothes dancing with her little girls helping light the candles on the birthday doughnuts shed felt great free and this afternoon hed made her feel so guilty shed wanted to end it but not like this surely not like this hed call the cops no they wouldnt come he knew enough of police procedure to know what would happen if he called how long has your wife been missing maybe only an hour was there any disagreement oh right well then we suggest you sit at home and wait it out he couldnt sit at home hed go nuts where the hell was she she had so few options no friends no family just gloria waiting to force her back to england jenny finally he couldnt help himself he stood on the bank staring at the black slowmoving water and he called her name echoed back to him over and over jenny jenny jenny no jenny answered but there was a whimper from below a whimper it wasnt a human sound but it was enough to make him peer where the bank steeped sharply forward there was a huddled figure right at the waters edge dark and large dear god he clambered down with a speed he didnt know he possessed put a hand on the figures shoulderand jennys face turned to greet him for a moment the relief was so great he couldnt believe hed found her he stood stunned with his hand on her shoulder her white face looking at his jenny was here she was safe she was alive dear god jenny his legs wouldnt hold him anymore he sat down hard beside her and shoved his head between his knees for the first time in his life he came close to passing out michael a soft hand ran through his hair and her voice when she spoke was thick with concern michael whats wrong whats wrong he gasped and sucked in a great lungful of fogfilled night air whats wrong jenny have you any idea what he gave another gasp and shoved his head down again silence he sat recovering from fear and she didnt say a word just waited finally he raised his head he stared at the water where the scudding mist was moving and swirling in shredded ribbons and the bats were flying low the river was black and mysterious beneath hiding all if shed been in there how long have you been sitting here he asked at last his voice detached he didnt look at her a couple of hours michael im so sorry if youve been worried a couple of hours he sighed can i ask why i came down here for a walk she told him im im sorry if you were worried but i was sort of upset after you left me and then i found socks and i didnt know what to do with him it all just seemed too difficult socks he looked sideways then really looked and saw what hed been too upset to see until now she was wearing a coata garment he vaguely recognized as his it was the black trench coat he used for night work the coat was vast and dark ideal for checking security at three in the morning when he didnt want to be seen when he wanted to check that his outdoor security guards were doing what they were supposed to be doing the coat had been hanging in his back entrance and it disguised her bulk but there was something apart from jenny and baby underneath her pregnant bulk wasbigger what he asked fascinated do you have under your coat i told you she said patiently socks and socks is a dog right a dog he nodded sagely tossing the idea around in his head while his heart rate settled to almost normal what sort of dog he asked at last cautiously his head was starting to work again recovering from blind panic a big dog a big dog right any more specifics well hes a sort of she hesitated i guess a lots gone into his breeding she said at last maybe thats all i can tell he nodded again so we have a big nondescript dog of uncertain parentage called socks he was buying time jen can i ask why hes sitting under your coat he was cold i see he didnt but he wasnt confessing that for a minute do you think hes warm now maybe then do you think you could let him out now so we can go home hes still frightened hes shivering jen i dont know what to do with him she said in a small voice i cant take him back to your placei mean youve done so much for me already and i cant leave him here you mean hes a stray i guess so he has no collar and he looks starving right a stray michael was still having trouble keeping his heart beating in any sort of normal rhythm but a stray dog was something he could deal with practical its okay jen we can handle this if you dont want to leave him here then well take him to the city pound no no michael look you need to see him she hesitated then unfastened the top three buttons of the coat come on socks come on boy socks came outsort of two eyes peered from beneath her coat brown pools of misery and distrust the eyes looked warily at michael decided they didnt much like what they saw then disappeared again into the coats vastness its okay socks hes a friend jen unfastened a couple more buttons and the dogs head was revealed in its scraggy splendor it was the head of a definitely peculiar dog michael thought dazed scruffy to say the least with matted hair that was a dirty golden brown the dogs ears drooped down like a cocker spaniels but his head looked more like a labradorsa labrador on a bad hair day as jenny had said a whole lot had gone into this dogs breeding but she was obviously seeing something michael couldnt hes just lovely jenny breathed hugging him close oh michael no michael shook his head with certainty youre wrong there jen this dog is not lovely this dog is weird seriously weird ive never seen a dog like this in my life the dog looked at him reproachfully and so did jenny why michael asked carefully still buying time are you calling him socks is he wearing a collar no collar you should see his ribs she held the dog closer as if he needed protecting hes truly a stray no one wants this dog michael could see exactly why then why socks he has white socks or they might be white after a bath and he reminds me of a dog i had as a kid you had a dog like this well no jenny broke into an involuntary chuckle socks one was a basset hound but he looked at me the same as socks two her smile died and she stared over the river my aunt had socks one put down when my parents died when was that michael asked startled he knew nothing about this woman he realized nothing when i was ten your parents died when you were ten mmm in a car crash i lost themand then i lost socks his heart twisted and he put a hand on her shoulder socks looked up as if he wasnt the least bit sure he wanted to share but michael wasnt in the mood for dealing with a jealous dog especially one with ears like this im sorry jen he told her and she shrugged things happen i guess you know that as well as anyone you were adopted too so your aunt adopted you sort of jennys tone changed hardened my parents left me a house you see so my aunt and her boyfriend moved in they took over my life and that was the end of socks they had him put down it was also the end of my house i was shunted off to boarding school the house somehow got sold and the funds disappeared into nevernever land oh jen you had better luck with your adoptive parents though yeah michael thought back to his childhood there was no chance of a dog like socks being put down in the lord household if anything thered been pets to spare there was certainly love to spare yeah i guess and lana says your birth mother loved you i wouldnt know about that his voice hardened i know nothing about her and you dont want to know the past is history theres no need to rake it up it stays with you though she said softly staring again at the river socks stared with her four reproachful eyes you cant let it go completely if my parents hadnt loved me and if i hadnt known that and remembered it in the bad times then i dont think i could have gone on its part of who i am its dead and buried his voice was unnecessarily harsh and he bit his lip but jenny looked bleak is it it has to be dead and buried she took a jagged breath i just wish it was she said bleakly her face twisting in remembered pain her voice cracked then she seemed to catch herself im sorry jenny whats wrong he stared puzzled but she shrugged pushing away remembered nightmares she took a deep breath no thats enough of that im just i was thinking of something i told peter but i dont know what im thinking of now youve come down here in the dark just to find me and here ive taken your coat without even asking she made as if to pull it off but he stopped her the dog whimpered against her as if expecting to be hauled out and thrust away his big ears disappeared inside the coat socks was staying put but michael was no longer thinking of socks why did you come down here he asked gently watching her face the emotion in her eyes was tearing at something deep in his gut she was so lost so at sea i came out for a walk to try to decide what to do she said with quiet dignity she had herself in hand again i cant figure how we can stay together in your town house its crazy theres no choice there is i just need to find another place to stay somewhere gloria cant find me then if immigration comes you can contact me he thought this through and found an immediate flaw or rather the flaw was looking at him again you intend on taking socks with you i she faltered i guess ill find a place where i can take him theres no landlord thatll take a dog like this i dont need to stay in the city she said calmly as if this was a decision shed made hours ago i can go out into the country somewhere get a place to stay on a farm or something oh sure he mocked farms take in dogs like socks all the time and you can always race from a farm to my place at a moments notice when immigration officials arrive asking questions they were here tonight here her eyes widened you mean at your home thats right oh michael its okay he said flinching at the fear in her eyes they think youre safely in bed in my bed they had no right to search and i didnt let them in but if you think you can stay someplace else i must be able to she said in distress i must the fear was still there with a hint of something else the knowledge of being trapped that was pretty much how he was feeling michael acknowledged bleakly claustrophobic closed in hell theyd done this in such a rush they hadnt thought it through but if hed had time would he have acted differently michael found himself searching his heart as he watched the misery on her face would he have done the same thing or would he have waved her off to mexico alone to face childbirth and her future with nothing and nobody no way he saw the courage in her eyes and knew he would do no such thing hed hurt her this afternoon hed hurt her badly shed come here to try to figure out a way to get out of his lifefor his sake not her own here she was distress on her face and it was all on his account not hers hed caused it by showing her how unhappy he was with their situation hey jen reaching out he touched her face it was cool as if the damp and fog had penetrated she gave an involuntary shiver and he flinched guilt swept in like a physical kick in the rear hell he was being a total jerk hed suggested this hed married jenny despite her doubts his sense of honor was telling him to accept that fact and move on come on jenny he said gently lets take socks to the pound and get you home the fear and distress changed in an instant her eyes searched his and her mouth tightened to stubbornness no michael i cant cant socks is not going to the pound im sorry but youre not seriously suggesting we keep him jenny thats impossible i am keeping him but if you wont let me move to the country and if i have to stay with you then im sorry but hell have to stay with us too she took a deep breath okay i know im being a pest and i know you dont want me to stay but youre out all day he wont cause any trouble youll see youll hardly know hes there and its only for the next few weekswhile i need to stay jenny i am not a dog person youre kidding she put her hand down and brought the dogs face out from where it had been pressed against her breast gently she raised it so those great brown eyes were looking straight at michael he stared down and tried to look awayand couldnt how can you say youre not a dog person she asked reproachfully you look socks in the eye and tell me that hes the most wonderful dog you know nothing about him michael glared and the dogsockslooked soulfully back hes probably vicious oh yeah her voice was mocking you see how terrified i am when hes been fed he might have a totally different personality the dog whimpered and licked jennys hand good grief he really was the strangestlooking mutt his goldenbrown hair was straggly and motheaten and he looked as if he hadnt had a bath in years but he gazed at jenny with a slavish adoration that said if he had a choice of half a side of beef or jenny hed choose jenny any day vicious well maybe not yeah one sniff of red meat and he turns into attila the hun jenny was seeing exactly what he was seeing she chuckled and ran her fingers under the dogs ears the dog looked mutely at her id like to see that well i wouldnt michael said bluntly trying not to think about what her fingers were doing trying not to imagine what those fingers could do if they touched him for petes sake jen youre probably catching all sorts of diseases right at this minute i must have already caught em she said cheerfully ive been cuddling him for hours hes staying theres a nopets clause in my title he said driven against the wall and still fighting but jenny shook her head her eyes were mischievous honestly she was like a chameleon flashing from one mood to the next nope nice try though the lady living next door to you in the very same block has a pug called basil i met her this evening and was introduced to basil in person you met mavis he stared at her appalled yep is there anything wrong with that michael groaned jenny mavis is the biggest busybody in the neighborhood what on earth did you tell her what do you mean did you tell her we were married well i sort of had to she confessed she kept asking and what was i supposed to say so i did but it made me feel dreadful like it was an invasion of your privacyto have some strange woman running around saying shes your wife she struggled to her feet still holding the dog rejecting michaels hand as he made to help her no i can manage on my own she took another deep breath searching for words im sorry michael but im afraid thats the last time im going to say it if i keep feeling guilty ill go under so lets forget the sorries forget the guilts and just take socks home and get on with it take socks home and me and the bump she smiled but there was lingering anxiety behind her eyes as if she was expecting to be slapped this woman had been slapped more than once in her life michael realized and the thought made him feel ill jen but she was still speaking take your wife our unborn child and our dog home to bed she said gently welcome to domesticity michael lord we somehow seem to have jumped right in at the deep end but im afraid theres nothing for us to do but to swim together chapter nine swimming was a very good description of what came next michael carried socks home hes too weak to walk and ill carry him if you wont jenny decreed so he had no choice but to carry the misbegotten bag of bones by the time they reached the front door they were both scratching socks it seemed came with friends jenny fed him four tv dinners which appeared to hardly ease his hunger and then they had no choice but to fill the tub and soak off the unwanted visitors socks had agreed entirely with his dining arrangements the bathroom plans however were not so much to his liking jenny had been right in deciding there wasnt a vicious bone in his body but socks had his own way of objecting by the time he was up to his neck in water and soaped to the eyebrows his two new owners were soaked to the skin theres no need for you to stay michael insisted aware that jenny must be exhausted after sitting for so long on the riverbank go shower and change you can handle him sure i can handle him michael fixed socks with a look cant i socks in answer socks shook himself again and water sprayed from one end of the laundry room to the other ill leave you boys together thento bond jenny chuckled and retired to her own room bond ha the only thing bonding was dirt socks was filthy with ingrained grime that looked as if it hadnt been touched for decades michael used laundry soap and elbow grease and more laundry soap and more elbow grease and after fifteen minutes of scrubbing he finally figured he had nice clean fleas too bad about the dog still he scrubbed on knowing it was expected of him which was truly strange he didnt do things because women expected him to did he finally jenny reappeared flushed from a hot shower to michaels amazement she was enveloped in his bathrobe and was holding a bottle of dog shampoo and a container of flea powder like trophies of war how about this she asked gleefully bouncing into the room it was hard to believe she was eight months pregnant its courtesy of mavis i figured we needed proper stuff to kill the little suckers michael stared he was feeling itchy and scratchy he was soaked to the skinhed decided to hold socks under until every flea was drownedand his eyes were suddenly riveted to this brighteyed triumphant pregnant waif of a woman wearing his bathrobe she took his breath away you didnt visit mavis like that his voice came out sounding like a croak i sure did and i even woke her up jennys eyes twinkled with guilty mischief but she doesnt mind mavis hasnt had so much excitement in years what with your callers earlier this eveningi gather they were sniffing around asking questionsand me wearing your bathrobe and announcing we were married i doubt shell get back to sleep all night he groaned great itll be all over the neighborhood by dawn mmm she cast a doubtful look at him does that bother you no but im not saying sorry anymore michael she said resolutely were in this together can i shampoo him now while you have a shower no he took the shampoo from her and emptied half of it into the tub socks almost visibly flinched im soaked to the skin already and there are fleas doing the backstroke in here hunting and killing is mans work clear out lady while i do the dreadful deed ill bring him out to you after ive toweled him dry are you sure jenny gazed doubtfully at her bedraggled mutt who looked even more doubtfully at her poor socks he looks so sad hes sad it was all michael could do not to utter an expletive im itchy im half drowned and ive been told im adopting a dog whos half shetland pony and half goatand he looks sad i guess i can leave you to your fun jenny said chuckling ill plug in the hair dryer in your doggy saloni mean in your living roomand wait for you there she ducked and bolted for cover as a sodden towel whizzed straight at her head dog salon or living room ha it was neither michaels living room looked as if it had never been used in its life white shag carpet white sofa glass coffee table with designer fruit bowl and designer fruit jenny picked up an apple and took a bite amazed to find it was real his housekeeper must go to heaps of trouble with this fruit bowl she thought selecting and arranging each piece like an artwork she grinned as she looked down suppressing an almost irresistible urge to take a bite from every piece and leave it like that cut it out jenny morrow she said you let michaels beautiful artwork be but the fire was a different thing it too looked designer perfect with pine cones and logs set in artful symmetry the firebricks in the back were still white it really hadnt been used austins climate was mild in fall and winter but jenny was still feeling the dampness of the riverbank and the thought of crackling logs was definitely appealing after all she was going to live here too no more apologies she took a match from the beautiful white ceramic container on the white mantel and watched guiltily as the flames flickered into life then she stuck her bare toes out to the warmth and sighed with sheer sensual pleasure yes that was how michael found her when he hauled the toweldried socks in from the laundry room she was sitting staring into the flames and for once his living room looked lovely no jenny looked lovely she glanced at him her eyes dancing in the firelight when she held out her hands to greet her wet dog michael felt his gut wrench in a way it never had before i hes all yours heck his voice sounded strangled ill just go take a shower myself he practically bolted out the door with jenny looking strangely after him it took michael twenty minutes to shower anoint his various bites and regain his composure when he returned he found a transformation of gigantic proportions dirty flearidden and starved socks had looked appalling when he was wet every rib had stood out and he looked bedraggled and sodden all big eyes and droopy ears but now blow dried and brushed with love michael stopped at the living room door and stared socks would never win any pedigree dog prizes but his coat was a gorgeous honey color his ears were a mass of rippling silken fur and the rest of his coat would soon match jenny was lying full length on her side on the carpet before the fire still in his red bathrobe gently stroking the dogs matted fur over and over the two of them made an amazing splash of color in the golden firelight jenny had a brush in one hand and a hair dryer in the other and there was a pair of businesslike scissors on the floor beside her she picked them up as he walked in and waved them in his direction great we need one person on brush and one person on scissors he has kingsize mats under his tummy they stink like crazy when you put them on the fire michael blinked the tableau before him was almost surrealistic socks however was enjoying himself to the hilt sitting up in front of the fire as if he was on show when jenny mentioned his matted fur he tucked his head under his chest and looked down as if inspecting his belly for himself and then he returned his gaze to jenny good grief the dog was practically purring i would be too michael thought dazed staring at them in stunned amazement if jenny was brushing me it was a ridiculous thought somehow he shoved it aside and knelt to take the scissors from jennys hand their fingers brushed briefly as she passed them to him and the feeling was like an electric shock striking right through his body it was as much as he could do not to pull away as if burned oh michael youre fleabitten she looked sympathetically at the red splotches on his chest hed hauled on a pair of jeans but left his chest bare all the better to apply calamine lotion she reached out a finger to touch but he pulled back no way youyou must be too he sounded like an embarrassed schoolkid why the heck wasnt she feeling this strange charge between them nope she grinned or not very much you must be fatter they always chew the fat ones first right its true she said seriously my dad always said that and he was a flea expert i though you said he was a miner his hobby was entomology she gave him a cheeky look an entomologist is someone who studies insects i know what an entomologist is he said goaded sorry she didnt sound sorry at all i just thought you being american and all youre saying my knowledge of the queens english isnt all it ought to be i expect youll get it right sometime she said kindly just as soon as you learn to spell yeah right it had been a major source of conflict between them in the months shed been his secretary shed type center as centre hed change it and shed patiently change it back again hed given up in the end letting her spell as she darn well pleased and he gave in now anything for a quiet life okay okay so whats a coal miner doing with a hobby like entomology contrary to what gloria believes being a miner didnt make my father ignorant she said she glared defying him to argue there was no money to educate him so my dad left school after grade eight but he kept right on learning he studied insects in his spare time so did my mother she said proudly they wrote a great research paper thats still widely acclaimed all about the habits of bumblebees i remember hours and hours with my parents tracking individual bumblebeesonly we kept getting them confused its very hard to tell one bee from another you know unless her voice grew thoughtful unless youre another bumblebee i guess youre probably right she didnt seem to notice his amusement or the way he was watching her he couldnt keep his eyes from her in the end my father roped them with a piece of fine thread and wed run around the garden with our chosen bumblebee tied on our line like a kite she told him she chuckled it was a good piece of research there arent many kids whose dad gets home from work grabs his string and heads out to the garden to rope bumblebees i can see that michael said faintly he hesitated still watching the firelight flickering over her face its a good memory to have its part of me she said softly lifting a tuft of sockss hair for inspection cut here michael i wouldnt have missed it for the world i mean my parentstheyre part of who i am and if this little one inside me starts following bumblebees then ill be really proud ill know where it comes from she paused as if unsure whether to continue but she did dont you feel that about your own birth parents that you need to know themthat theres a part of you missing no he said flatly i dont need them ive learned not to need my parents too she told him sadly i had no choice but every morsel of information i could ever find out about them was important to me i cant understand why its not important to you its not its all to do with not letting people close isnt it she probed still gently stroking socks not needing anyone pretending you can stand alonethat youre you and youre not part of anyone else jenny get off my case he sighed i do let people close my brother and sisters you love them yeah but but you tell yourself that you dont need them look this is getting a bit personal he said tightly the emotion in the room was supercharged and his reaction to emotion was to bolt do you mind if we just concentrate on socks she looked at him for a long moment her green eyes shrewd and assessing and michael thought suddenlyeven more uncomfortablythat she saw more than he wanted her to finally she nodded well at least we know he needs us she said cheerfully looking at the dog she cast another sideways glance at michael tell me she said if you were down on the riverbank just nowalone and not with mewould you have brought socks home no really her eyebrows shot up definitely not he looked at socks and socks looked at him michael felt a pang reproach was something this dog had honed to a fine art maybe he wouldnt have abandoned him entirely he thought he would have at least taken him to the pound jenny was shaking her head in disgust then its just as well im here she told him with asperity michael lord you need humanizing by humanizing you mean turning me into chief cook and bottle washer for a misbegotten mutt the mutt rolled over on his back exposing his newly dematted tummy socks closed his eyes in bliss and waved one back leg begging to be scratched michael glared at the dog glared at jenny then scratched and jenny grinned thats exactly what i do mean she said smugly its very therapeutic she lifted another tuft for michael to clip but she winced as she did it whats wrong nothing im fine you winced i did not wince i never wince you winced he frowned cramp no its not a labor pain he demanded startled yeah right one labor pain and i intend to start yelling my lungs out that was a my legs been stuck in one position for too long winceif there was a wince and if there was then it was a very little wince and im denying it anyway methinks the lady doth protest too much he was sure she was hurting jenny what was he thinking of shed had one heck of a day and it was late go to bed jen he said sternly no i want to finish thisand we havent decided where hell sleep ill organize it ill finish his brushing go to bed i am tired she admitted she paused ill go soon but i want to watch then lie on the couch and watch now he turned his voice into a roar and her eyes twinkledjust the way he liked them most yes sir she started to rise but staggered and he moved like lightning to help her holding her hands pulling her up then supporting her as she lowered herself onto the couch ten minutes of watching he said sternly reluctantly releasing her hands she felt nice and then bed you sound like my father thats exactly what i feel like only it wasnt at all what he felt like he thought as he brushed socks jennys father that would make the feelings he was having paternal ha the dog was asleep abandoning himself to michaels ministrations with absolute trust michael had found the very spot on a dogs belly that needed scratching most and hed thus been deemed a friend for life he could do anything he wanted and it was okay with socks socks was fed and clean and fleafree and he was with belly scratchers friends he could afford to sleep because he was in doggy heaven and it suddenly seemed like that for michael too though he couldnt quite figure out why it was midnight on sunday he should be still over with the guys or else sleeping the sleep of the dead he told himself instead he was sitting by the fire gently brushing a starving mongrel and watching a very pregnant and very lovely woman drift off to sleep beside him shed watched and watched for a whole four minutes and every minute her eyes became heavier and now she slept with socks it was strange surreal he should stop brushing he told himself his hand still rhythmically stroking he should boot socks into the laundry room and send jenny to bed but he wanted her to wake up the next morning to a perfectly groomed dog he knew shed expect it of him and he was content exactly where he was so he brushed on into the night woman and dog sleeping beside him and when he finished brushing he sat and stared into the flames for a very long time sometime about two in the morning he decided he should go to bed he was threequarters asleep himself the dog settled on his knees with his long ears draped onto the floor and he was resting against the couch with jennys sleeping face just inches from his the fire had died to a heap of glowing embers and there were no more thoughts left to think there were only feelings and feelings were threatening to overwhelm him sobed come on boy he told socks lets get you settled his body was lethargic unwilling to stir but he forced himself upright the dog whimpered in protest michael stood firm then stooped and lifted socks into his arms lets introduce you to the garden and then show you your sleeping arrangements he cast one long lingering look at jenny and left her to her slumbers the garden was entirely to sockss satisfaction he did what he needed to do in the manner of a welltrained dog then headed indoors and directed himself straight for the living room again no way michael told him the laundry rooms where dogs sleep socks looked reproachfully at him as if hed just taken offense he sighedheck the dogs sigh was almost humanand then trod heavily to his designated sleeping place he eyed a couple of dry towels michael had laid out for him as if they were an affront to his dignity sighed again then watched with mournful eyes as the door was closed firmly behind michael locking him in which left jenny he could leave her in the living room michael thought it was warm enough she could sleep on the couch for one night the couch wasnt quite long enough he decided her legs were bent shed be better off in bed but there was no way in the world he intended waking her so he stooped and gathered her gently into his arms lifting her to lie against him she didnt stir her body was warm against his bare chest his bathrobe seemed far softer against his skin now than when he wore it himself she was totally relaxed in sleep and she smelled of something what he couldnt place it he didnt know what she smelled of he knew enough of jenny now to know she wouldnt be wearing some expensive perfume but whatever it was it was lovely lavender water maybe or maybe the smell was just jenny this was ridiculous he was growing sentimental in his old age he got a gripmetaphorically as well as literallyand carried his lovely burden to her bedroom she still didnt stir he lowered her onto the bed pulled the bedclothes away and then rolled her over so she was lying on the sheet then he unfastened her robe and stared for a second his mouth twisting at the sight of her pregnant body in her shabby pajamas she looked defenseless young poor his sisters wouldnt be seen dead in clothes like these he thought grimly maybe he could call lana tomorrow and ask what women wore when they were pregnant something soft and pretty and what was he thinking of jenny wouldnt thank him for criticizing her clothes enough he stooped to pull the bedclothes over her and as if hed spoken her name she stirred and opened her eyes she looked at him as if she was dreaming her eyes crinkled into a smile of pleasure but they had that look that told him she wasnt seeing him she was seeing some lovely thing in her dreams he touched her eyelids closing them gently sleep he told her sleep jen love it was a husky whisper her eyes didnt open she wasnt seeing himheaven knew who she was seeingbut her arms came out and her hands reached for his face urging him down to her he was so surprised that he let himself be propelled toward her love the word was whispered in the dark and her lips found his as he froze into stunned submission he let himself be kissed her lips were so soft urgent even in sleep they tasted like nectar and he couldnt believe what she was doing her hands were holding his face against hers and her mouth was searching searching and finding she had what she wanted in the touch of his mouth against hers she hadwhat whatever it was was indefinable the touch was like fire between them a fierce burning pain that threatened to overwhelm him he felt his gut tighten and it was all he could do not to gather her body against his and sink beside her on the soft welcoming bed no for one long moment michael froze but she was too sweet like a sirens song she was impossible to resist he let himself be drawn in sinking to sit on the bed beside her and returning her kiss with a passion that stunned him with a fire he didnt know he possessed with a need no this was crazy jenny was asleep she was dreaming of her dead husband not him somehow he dragged himself back and her hands fell loosely to her sides her eyes were still closed but her mouth curved into a gentle smile of happiness she was making no objection shed kissed her man and now the dream could continue my love she whispered and she turned snuggling into the pillows and drifting into dreams in which michael had no part how could he sleep after that he couldnt no man could he lay and stared into the dark for a long long time at about three or four there was a whimper from the laundry room then another not a howl if it had been a howl maybe he could have resisted but the dog sounded as miserable as he was and lonely he swore then padded through the living room and opened the laundry room door socks lay on his towels and looked at him with eyes that expected nothinghed lost all hope this is ridiculous michael said you should be in the pound the dogs eyes said he agreed with him entirely that was what he deserved she wanted me to brush you ive fed you and housed you theres nothing else you need the eyes said he was entirely right socks needed nothing more except come on michael said goaded holding the door wide i guess im lonesome too it was the first time hed admitted such a thing in his entire life it was also the first time in his entire life that michael lord shared his bed with a dog yet still he stayed awake because all he really wanted to do was to share a bed with jenny chapter ten jenny slept lategloriously late she woke to sunlight streaming in over her bright coverlet and to a snuffling at her side a moist tongue touched her tentatively on the cheek she smiled with delight and rolled over to embrace one ecstatic dog socks how did you get in here and then she frowned remembering the events of the night before how did i get in here michael he must have carried her in her eyes flew open and the memory of a dream came back to hera dream so sweet it made her toes curl and a blush creep across her cheeks michael holding her michaels mouth on hers the feel of his body it must have been a dream she said fiercely sitting up with a start socks looked inquiringly at her and let his tongue loll waiting for the next move i never would have he wouldnt unbidden her fingers came up to touch her mouth and the taste of him still seemed to be there infinitely sweet michael for heavens sake what am i thinking of it was probably you doing the kissing you dopey mutt she gave socks a hard swift hug and swung her feet out of bedthen stopped as a knock sounded at the apartment door she froze michael would get it shed just stay here michael didnt get it the knock sounded again firm and sure and jenny figured this wasnt someone whod go away she looked at the clock on her bedside table and gasped in disbelief it was ten oclock she never slept until ten oclock never michael would be at work he must have left without waking her the knock sounded again she didnt want to answer it not alone but if it was the immigration people then the worst thing she could do was to pretend not to be here she took a deep breath hitched her pajamas over her pregnant tummy grasped sockss scruff and padded barefoot toward the front door this is your job she told socks firmly im the one in charge of tv dinners and youre the one in charge of security around here youre a guard dog socks guard he looked adoringly at her and wagged his tail yeah right it was megan maitland jenny opened the door half an inch without releasing the chain and checked the front step with one cautious eye then she gasped and withdrew fumbling to release the chain megan the ceo of maitland maternitythe matriarch of the entire maitland clanand here was jenny looking like like something the cat dragged in she told socks desperately or maybe you dragged in for heavens sake im wearing peters old pajamas it couldnt be helped megan had seen her and megan was waiting pinning on her most welcoming smile and hoping her hair wasnt sticking straight upwhich it always did after sleepjenny opened the door when she finally made her voice work it came out a ridiculous squeak hi hello my dear megan smiled unfazed at the sight before her she appeared not to notice the pajamas or the amazing hairstyle or even the pregnancy but took jennys hands in hers as though welcoming her into the family michael told me youd be home and that i could find you here ii dont jenny was floundering like a fool but megan didnt seem to notice that either i wanted to catch you yesterday at the childrens wedding she said edging around jenny and heading straight for the kitchen she left jenny to follow talking over her shoulder it was so like michael to bring you to an occasion like that and then take you away before we could meet you honestly we were ready to shoot him i was tired the squeak was still there it was all she could do to get her voice to work i dont blame you for that megan said warmly turning to face her sit down child you look exhausted ellie says youve had quite a time and your babys almost due i now ive pieced together quite a lot between ellie and garrett and lana megan said briskly but why dont you tell me all about it yourself michaels my godson you know and ive always been an honorary aunt to all the lord children i want to know and then her voice trailed away jenny stared megan maitland although jenny had seen megan at the hospital shed never been formally introduced but her reputation as a mover and shaker was daunting but now despite this womans power despite her obvious authority her beautifully groomed appearance her confidence and her interest in michaels life there was a hint of appeal in the older womans voice it was as if she really did want to be allowed to come close as if she really cared i want to know everything she said and her smile wavered please i care so much for those childrenmichael and his sisters and brother its as if theyre partly mine i dont megans hand came out and took hers please my dear i care about michael and if what garrett says is true then i intend to care about you as well jenny hesitated for seven long months shed kept herself apart her troubles had been hers and hers alone but now she had a husband who cared about her and her husband had family and friends who wanted to know all about her who had a right to know and who might just care for her too lets get you some breakfast child megan said and then tell me everything to do anything else was impossible jenny found herself talking freely she talked and she talked in between tackling the cornflakes and coffee megan insisted she demolish after a while she forgot about the baggy pajamas and her tousled curls and even socks devouring cornflakes under the table and all the time she spoke megan listened as if every single word was important as she told her story jenny watched megans face expecting condemnation but there was no such thing when she had finished there was a twinkle in those compassionate eyes well she said well child i never wanted to draw michael into this mess jenny said desperately what you must think of me what i must think i think youre an incredibly brave woman megan said warmly the easiest thing in the world would have been to return to england to surround yourself with luxury and allow your baby to be brought up by others to stay here must have taken sheer courage but in one way its selfishness to keep my baby away jenny said slowly thinking about it as shed done a million times before thinking of what peter would have wanted her babys father im robbing my baby of his birthright so that i can have a say in how hes raised youre not robbing him of his birthright megan said solidly are you telling me when he comes of age he cant head back to britain and claim his birthright no but then dont be silly youre his mother its your rightyour duty evento raise your son the best way you know how you know jenny hesitated and met megans eyes i have the feeling thats why michaels helping mebecause his own birth mother didnt do that raise him i mean im starting to feel that michaels carrying so much anger and by helping me hes almost thumbing his nose at his birth mother saying you could have taken care of us there was a long long silence as megan stared across the table at jennys troubled face and then the older womans face softened she took jennys hand in hers again and held it tight garrett said you were one amazing lady and he was right megan said thats quite an intuition you have there i dont know if im right oh im sure youre right megan told her that boy michael internalizes everything he was the one who was full of questions about his real parents from the time he could understand what happened then when he was about eight all of a sudden he got angry he hated the thought that hed been abandoned and now now now his birth mother is trying to make contact with her children he doesnt want to know hes still so angry id guess jenny sighed and stirred her coffee she needed to do something to keep herself from rising and pacing the floor which was what she felt like doing this conversation was almost unbelievable his birth mother mustnt have had a michael to rescue her from her demons she whispered poor lady she must have had such strong reasons for walking away from her children unconsciously her hand touched her pajamaclad tummy in a gesture of defense she looked up and saw that megans eyes had dropped to her waistline and jenny was embarrassingly aware of her inelegant outfit sorry she hitched the pajama cord tighter over her baby this this isnt me at my best if michael could see how im entertaining guests in his home hed be horrified i dont think horrified is the word for it megan smiled when i talked to michael this morning he seemed just plain befuddled she stooped to look under the table checking out socks and giving jenny a chance to regain her composure to find himself with a wife and a dog all in one weekend and what a dog hes wonderful jenny said warmly the dog was something she could talk about socks come here at the sound of his name socks looked at her adoringly then stood and flopped his big ears across her knees hes just the best you know after he was eight michael would never have a pet of his own megan told her watching socks with interest it troubled his adoptive parents he hasnt let anything or anyone close to him no jenny fondled sockss ears and looked troubled too and now hes landed with me well please dont worry mrs maitland i wont stick around any longer than i must as soon as my babys born and i have residence status but i dont think you understand my dear megan said her hand clasped jennys again her grip was strong and surea woman who knew what was right were not troubled that michael hasas you describe itbeen landed with you garrett and iand as far as i can see lana and shelby tooare delighted but garrett told me you could do michael nothing but good and after meeting you i think i agree so youd have him saddled with another mans baby what im thinking megan said eyeing socks with amusement is that this baby may well end up being michaels baby as socks may well end up being michaels dog now that jenny said warmly grinning despite her trouble is really ridiculous whats really ridiculous michael said from behind her and she jumped about a foot michael it was all so domestic so cozy michael stopped in the doorway and blinked in amazement megan was sitting over a mug of coffee her eyes dancing with laughter and his jenny was laughing too not his jenny not his anything woof socks broke the silence hed obviously remembered jennys injunction that he was the guard dog around here which meant he had to utter one threatening bark before hurling himself across the floor to jump up on michaels best work suit michael caught his paws and staggered under the weight of him as sockss tongue came out to lick his face ugh stupid dog get off jenny i thought you were going to train him hardly before breakfast on day one jenny retorted turning bright pink before breakfast he glanced at his watch and grinned its almost eleven oclock jennys blush deepened just because some people get up early one day in their lives they think they can gloat not likely ill have you know i beat you to work every single day for the last few months so you did he smiled at his wife and the pleasure glimmering in his dark eyes made megan stare was this michael what are you doing home anyway jenny asked and megan stared some more she couldnt remember when shed seen laughter in michaels eyes he always held himself so aloof i was in by six i decided to take an early lunch so i thought i might come home well thats a novelty megan shook her head in amazement youre honored indeed jenny this is a man who has twominute lunch grabs in the hospital cafeteria or at best fiveminute salads at his sisters diner to what does jenny owe this pleasure hey i have a wife now michael said grinning i have domestic responsibilities all over the place and besides jen told me she can cook he checked out his wifes pajamas and shook his head i might have hoped for a more appealing outfit but never mind ill excuse it this once do we have something for lunch jen of course we do she hauled her dignity together as best she could stood and hitched her pajama cord tighter the menu is cornflakes cornflakes cornflakes or cornflakes thats it were even out of tv dinners socks ate the lot sorry socks and i need to go shopping so its cornflakes michael sat down his smile still holding jenny tight my favorite what a woman what do you think of my wife aunt megan i think youre a very lucky man michael lord megan said in a voice that made michaels smile die there was no laughter in megans voice at all she sounded deadly serious im with garrett all the way on this one silence you could have heard a pin drop finally jenny spoke im off to get dressed she said you think you can manage your own cornflakes the directions are on the box a dutiful wife would pour my flakes michael said trying for a casualness he didnt feel jenny chuckled where would you like them poured dearest jenny took a step toward the cereal box speaking in honeyed tones and michael grinned and raised his hands in selfdefense okay woman i can take a hint leave me with our guest and the dog and the domestic chores while you fritter your time away on your appearance marriage its not what its cut out to be aunt megan i can see that megan agreed still serious and arent you lucky that its not once more there was an uncomfortable silence jenny saw the smile die on michaels face he was feeling trapped she thought and wished suddenly that megan would go he needed space he didnt need to be crowded like this she could make him laugh again if megan left the knowledge came to her in a flashshe knew him as well as megan did that was crazy megan was like family but jenny was his wife it was too much to take in im off she said again desperately and headed for her roomthen stopped dead as another knock sounded great will you excuse me jen asked carefully im not dressed for visitors youre dressed for megan michael said isnt she a visitor and then he looked at socks whod abandoned his pursuit of nosing for errant cornflakes socks was standing bolt upright and the hair on the back of his neck was bristling the dog growled but he didnt even bark at mrs maitland jen said wonderingly putting a hand down and touching his bristling fur thats megan to you megan said blandly she had the look of someone who was enjoying herself or aunt megan if you must and its a wise dog socks knows family but so if its not family michael sighed surely its not official ive just about had enough of this jen stay where you are he walked to the front door while jenny stayed behind holding socks by the scruff of his neck the gray suits were back again you guys dont know when to give up michael stood on the front step and stared at the two men summing them up officials through and through there was nothing to fear there then he looked past them and there was gloriaagainstanding next to her luxurious rental car behind her were the two thugs whod threatened jenny with the syringe bruno and the other one now what now nothing the two men on the doorstep were definitely officials there was no way they could stand by and watch while anything untoward happenedespecially since megan was standing in the kitchen with the door open so keep it light hi gloria michael called and waved lovely day great day for traveling you heading to your earldom soon i dont know how england can be managing without you maybe humor wasnt glorias strong point the woman flushed a deep shade of red and then her face was shuttered she was dressed all in black her hair was drawn into a chignon that stretched every muscle tight in her face and she looked as if she was about to bust her stays where had that expression come from michael wondered irreverently and only the thought of the thugs beside her kept him from grinning what can i do for you he asked turning to the officials who were regarding him with caution were doing a residence check on jennifer morrow jennifer lord he reminded them my wife he looked closely at the older of the two men can i see your id please he was presented with two id cards and grimaced okay they were official which meant he had to be polite where did gloria keep digging them up a residence check our information is that jennifer morrowjennifer lordworks at maitland maternity and she lives with you the official who came here last night wasnt able to verify that she was here and she wasnt at work this morning michael sighed nope she was asleep last night because she was tired shes given up work now because shes tired it happens you know tiredness it goes with advanced pregnancy our babys due in a little over three weeks what does he meanour baby the hiss came from the street and michael sighed again i told the official last night that this lady wasnt welcome here he said motioning to gloria my wife is frightened of her shes intimidating and shes unpleasant if this is an official visit then can we go indoors and leave her outside the older official hesitated and then he raised his shoulders mr lord this lady he indicated gloria with an expression that told michael his opinion of the woman was somewhere around the same level of distaste as michaels has been making her presence felt around the department in no uncertain terms she has people leaning on us all over and were not enjoying it one bit shes swearing to us that your marriage is a sham and that this jennifer my wife yes your wife she says that jennifer doesnt live here thats ridiculous but it would save us a whole lot of grief if we could just see her the official said he gestured to gloria and her mightiness too my wife doesnt wish to see her hey michael there was a holler from the street and michael turned to see lana heading toward him with baby greg bundled in a cocoon at her breast what are you doing home whats wrong she called anxiety in her voice is there something the matter with jenny jennys fine ive got the day off from the store and just came to take her shopping she walked up the street toward them making a careful assessment of the callers is she busy shes entertaining guests michael said then sighed one last time and stood aside why fight what was starting to look like an avalanche jen were coming in he called toward the kitchen for petes sake hang on to socks socks was not amused the dog allowed michael in even giving a perfunctory wag of his tail he figured instinctively that lana and the baby were friends but when he saw the suits his hair stood straight up again and when gloria and her thugs marched in his control broke he snarled and launched himself forward jenny held on for all she was worth but socks had strengths she didnt know about she stumbled against somethingprobably lanas footand would have fallen except for michael he caught her and then whirled to catch socks before the mutt went for glorias jugular and then there was silence the silence went on and on the only sound the low growl of socks as he strained against michaels grip whatever canine instinct was working here it was working well these people wished jenny ill and socks wanted them out of here i agree michael said at last as the second of the thugs came in and edged cautiously around the table out of the dogs range i dont like them any more than you do boy but we have no choice but to talk to them now sit and to everybodys amazement socks sat he looked resignedly at michael as if to say okay im sitting but one word from you and ill have these guys on toast jenny couldnt see her face was against michaels chest and she was burning with embarrassment michael grimaced then lightly touched her tousled curls with his lips and turned her to face the assembled company she made a desperate struggle to stay exactly where she was and then gave up she stood there facing gloria in pajamasfacing the world in pajamas they were all looking at her megan was watching with kindly approval lana was staring with stunned surprise and the beginnings of laughter the suits were staring as if she was some sort of peculiar specimen the thugs were watching with veiled menace and gloria was glaring at her with loathing and the waist of her pajamas was slipping down before she could do anything michaels arms came around her and one of his hands slipped to the side and her pajama bottoms rose miraculously to their rightful position she practically sagged with relief she did sag but michaels hold tightened and his mouth once again brushed her hair youre my wife and im proud of you he whispered into her ear and her blush started all over again remember that and then he turned to face the company now michaels gaze took in the assembled company who do we have here lana youre here to take my wife shopping very nice she needs something a little more fashionable in the nightwear line and im counting on you to help out aunt megan youre here to get to know my gorgeous jenny i know you approve his gaze moved to the immigration officials and you two gentlemen what are you here for to satisfy ourselves that this woman is living as your wife the older suit said and are you satisfied i told your colleague last night that my wife was exhausted she slept late this morning and she can hardly look more domestic than she does now or are you saying i telephoned her when i heard your knock she grabbed a cab and rushed across town and arrived here to greet you i think were satisfied now sir he said but the younger man stopped him if i may what is it charles his partner asked and charles gave a selfconscious grin the old lady says this marriage is a sham and she wants us to prove it you want proof this lady lives here use the dog the dog its obviously lords dog charles said patiently he addressed himself to jenny okay the dogs clearly vicious your husbands told it to sit i want you to grab the mutt from behind and haul it backward away from him he raised his brows theres not many dogs thatll tolerate thatexcept from an owner so will you do it unless youre afraid of course if youre the least bit unsure then dont even try this is ridiculous megan said startled but michael was grinning hed seen what jenny could do with socks last night theyd bonded like two soul mates i dont want to jenny said with dignity its not fair to socks to tease him like that but michael propelled her forward just do it jen then never again let them all see that socks is yours as much as he is mine he grinned she didnt grin back her humiliation level somewhere above her eyebrows she stalked around to stand behind socks socks was still sitting as ordered gazing at michael with love his dopey face was a huge question mark its just me socks jenny said then grabbed his skinny frame around the middle and hauled him backward sorry i have to do this as an attack dog socks was definitely a failure his rump slid easily across the polished tiles and he gazed around in surprise to see who was doing the hauling when he realized it was jenny he wriggled all over with delight and gave her a long slurpy lick then he went back to glaring at the thugs sit jenny said as she wiped a hand over her damp face sit she stared helplessly at michael he might let me do anything to him but he wont sit for me he knows whos boss michael said smugly crossing the room to pat socks and then hold his wife hard against him again he turned to the officials satisfied perfectly sir charles said and beamed he turned to his boss this lady knows this dog sir its not totally conclusive the older man said though clearly it was convincing enough for him theres a written interview wed like you both to complete not now michael said my wifes been through enough i do not want my son born prematurely my son the words were like a bombshell there was a hiss from gloria your son yes maam my son michael said blandly meeting her look we had him checked out so we knew what color to paint his bedroom were hoping hell have red hair just like his daddy hes not your son gloria almost spat the words hes my yes michael raised his eyebrows hes my grandson my heir it was practically a wail and despite himself michael softened there was a touch of desperation there then i suggest you get yourself on decent terms with my wife he said softly we have no objections to our son meeting you and getting to know you as he gets olderas long as you realize that were his parents youre not his parents youre saying my wife is not his mother i gloria was almost speechless with rage yes he smiled at her waiting for her to go on and of course she couldnt youll regret this she said and whirled to leave but jenny rushed over to her placing a hand on her beautifully jacketed arm gloria the woman whirled to face her and she looked at jennys hand as if it was infectious get your hand off me but i have nothing to say to you unless you agree to return to england like a sensible woman you know i cant do that jennys voice was laced with unhappiness and michael heard it and took an instinctive step forward then i have nothing more to say to you girl the woman snapped and shook her aside and stalked out of the room her hired men followed chapter eleven the immigration officials left soon after were real sorry to have bothered you again the older man told them while charles made friends with socks you cant believe the pressure were dealing with over this one our report will recommend an end to the thing and the pressure should stop shell be able to insist on one last interview in the case of a rushed marriage involving a green card the usual followup is an interview to make sure everythings in order but now that the claim youre living apart has been disproved well put that off until after the birth michael only had part of his mind on the conversation he was watching jenny who was on the floor socks sprawled ecstatically over her knees lana was down there too with baby greg gurgling on her lap but michaels gaze rested solely on jenny she looked extraordinary in that moment emotions stirred in michael that hed sworn hed never feel again and there were new emotions tooones he hadnt even known he was capable of feeling he knew right then and there that he welcomed them he was falling in love he thought dazed he was falling in love with his wife and he was loving every minute of it she really is very beautiful the older official said watching michaels face with goodhumored understanding iyes im sorry theres definitely no need to apologize sir the man said and beamed we see all sorts in this business and its a pleasure to see a happy marriage and i sure dont blame you for looking at her if i may say so your wifes not the sort of woman youd want to take your eyes off for a minute no i he forced his mind back to business or some of his mindthe part that wasnt taken up with his stunning new discovery the interview its just a formality as i said a check that you know each other as well as most married couples do his beam widened its my guess that your knowledge might be deeper than most so theres nothing at all to worry about well contact you in a few weeks all the very best for the babys arrival and if her ladyship causes trouble please let us know he shook michaels hand charles charles rose reluctantly from the floor where hed been petting socks you know jenny said casually as michael accompanied the immigration officials to the door i might just slip into something a touch more respectable she smiled at megan entertaining in my revolting old pajamas hey i like your pajamas lana told her they could start a new fashion in comfortable maternity wear she grinned but megan shook her head she rose from her chair gave jenny a hand up from the floor and propelled her toward her bedroom lets give the girl back some dignity she told lana jenny nows your chance you make a break for it and well cover your pajamaclad butt two minutes later michael walked into the kitchen after seeing the immigration officers off the premises and found jenny had gone his sister and megan wore identical goofy grins as they watched him enter michael stopped at the door and stared at the pair of them what he demanded what do you mean what lana asked innocently and her eyes danced why are you looking at me like that like what like i have a huge joke written across my forehead i dont know what you mean lana declared do you aunt megan who me no dear i cant imagine weve sent your jenny to get dressed michael dear shes not my jenny oh i think she is megan reached down to fondle sockss ears deny it all you like itll work about as well as convincing me that socks isnt your dog thats another thing lana said carefully where did socks come from she fixed her bother with brighteyed interest jenny found him he muttered and brought him home i see if you laugh youll live to regret it he warned behold me terrified lana gave little greg a hug and held him at arms length greg honey your big bad uncle michael just threatened me did you hear were you frightened nope she chuckled me neither lana yes she smiled sweetly at him and he practically ground his teeth in frustration well lana said apparently satisfied with his response i hate to be the one to break up this cozy family gettogether but youre leaving michael asked hopefully not alone i hope to have jenny with me when you asked me to find her something to wear for the wedding i realized she had nothing organized at all i dont think she wants more clothes michael frowned except pajamas id agree she could use replacements but she hardly needs more maternity clothes the babys almost due thats what i mean lana said patiently jenny looks like shes due to drop her bundle any minute and how many diapers do you have on hand brother dearest diapers she sighed as if she was addressing a bear of very little brain yes diapers you dope if you intend to raise a baby without diapers well see the end of this place as a classy neighborhood oh and on the subject of baby gearyou told gloria that you were painting the babys bedroom which bedroom exactly and do you have a crib crib she sighed again michael okay okay he held up his hands in defeat im not entirely nuts i know what a crib is then as jenny appeared in the doorway demurely dressed in her plain secretarial maternity dress he turned to her in relief shed brushed her curls from her face and he could almost pretend she was back to being his secretary againa role he could cope with emotionally jen do you have diapers do you have a crib not yet she blinked and stared at the faces watching her these people were practically too much to take in all at once her assorted family one husband one sisterinlaw with baby attached one sort of auntinlaw one dumb but gorgeous dog shed gone from rags to riches in the family stakes in one fell swoop she thought suddenly and it feltstunning there was affection on all their faces and she felt tears sting her eyes but they were waiting for her answer so when are you planning to get them lana asked patiently sometime soon and this baby lana probed he intends arriving sometime soon in three weeks he has a diary in there with his planned arrival time written in indelible ink first babies are never early jenny said stoutly and lana chortled as michael watched silently from the sidelines he was doing his own thinking ha lana scoffed i had a lady in my shop on friday buying a romper suit for her baby who was due tomorrow hes now seven weeks old i jenny you need to be organized and im just the person to help you do it lana said organization is my specialty just ask dylan i organized him right into marriage and mike ive been organizing him since he was three years old so while im on a roll i thought id take you back to my shop right now she smiled at jennys bewildered look you know i own oh baby oh jenny gasped how many times had she slowed as shed passed the baby shop looking longingly in the window at all the delightful things for sale of course ive been past there its lovely but i cant afford she closed her eyes things were getting out of control how could she tell them she intended to buy discount store clothes and a crib and stroller secondhand thats irrelevant im paying michael announced and her eyes opened again no yes michael no she said distressed i cant you can megan said shed been watching jennys face saying nothing but her intelligent mind had been assessing and coming to conclusions she moved to take jennys faltering hands in hers but you neednt accept michaels help in this area my dear because this is what im going to do youre going to accept your baby needs as a combined gift from me and the staff at maitland this is our gift to you jenny took a step back but megans hands held fast mrs maitland i cant you left work on thursday without being given your farewell gifts megan said sternly the staff had taken a collection for a baby shower ellies given me a check to add to it shes grateful for the change you brought to our security offices over the last five months and she gave michael a sideways smile shes grateful for the changes you brought about in our security chief im equally grateful lana will dictate what you need and mrs maitland its aunt megan to you while youre married to michael she corrected sternly jennifer i assume youd like your job back at maitland maternity one day i yes then learn to accept gifts gracefully i never got a chance to give the pair of you a wedding gift were not married dont talk nonsense youre more married than you think so take this with my blessings and michael yes maam michael was just plain bemused you were intending to go back to work after lunch of course theres no of course about it she said sternly youre not welcome at work you havent had a break for two years im ordering you to take time off starting today and help jenny get herself organized but you dont think jenny needs help i dont jenny interrupted but megan shook her head there speaks a woman who doesnt own so much as a diaper for a son whos due to appear any minute lana can you take this hopeless pair shopping id love to lana was practically choking with laughter dylans meeting me for lunch maybe we could all go out together make a day of it ill bet we could even persuade jenny to buy some new pajamas whats wrong with my pajamas jenny protested and they all laughed suddenly jenny was laughing with them this was so easy and the way michael was looking at her she gazed at him and her breath caught in her throat there was affection there and more maybe you could do with some pajamas with a proper cord megan was saying as jennys eyes met michaels and held they hardly heard her but diapers first there was nothing more to say yes maam said michael his eyes still on jennys and it was all he could do to get the words out whatever you say aunt megan what followed was an amazing few hours lana collected dylan because she figured michael might need some male support but to jennys astonishment the men took over surely we dont need all this stuff she said helplessly as a miniature baseball league sweater landed on top of a pile of baby gear a mile high you were maybe considering teaching your son cricket michael teased you have a green card now mrs lord this baby grows up playing american sports then we need a baseball bat dylan said decisively and swooped off to the other side of the store to find one like greg has no michael lifted the bat dylan found and inspected it with approval ignoring jennys protest this is more like it do you have a ball lana lets try this out for size while jenny watched helplessly and lana made piles of diapers and undershirts and sleepers dylan and michael set up an impromptu baseball game in the crowded store luckily it was a foam ball customers came and went eyeing the pair with amusement but dylan and michael carried right on its good advertising lana michael told his sister bet you sell a ton of these today and she did by the time hunger hit lana didnt have a miniature bat left in stock then with the guys still in charge they carried the sleeping greg to the car and ended up in shelbys diner for lunchwhere the baseball game started up again a few stunned residents and nurses from the clinic were promptly organized into teams and the foam ball flew from booth to booth youre all nuts shelby told them get out of here michael gave his sister a hug and turned to watch his wife take the bat sorry shelby we seem to have turned this place on its ear jenny seems to have turned you on your ear shelby said softly and hugged him back i was wrong to be worried shes special mike she its only for a bit it can be for as long as you like as far as im concerned she told him gently if she makes my brother look like this after lunch lana and dylan headed back to lanas store with greg and shelby disappeared into the kitchen michael and jen were left with the afternoon in front of them its only three michael said he frowned he wasnt used to spare time socks will need a walk you must have things to do if you drop me off at home then ill take him take him by yourself you should put your feet up i dont want to jenny flashed him a shy smile to be honest ive had so much fun i dont want it to end and neither did he so they drove home unpacked their packages held up each item for sockss approvalthe only thing socks was interested in was the foam balland then rigged up a leash and took their dog to the river it was another gorgeous autumn afternoon socks greeted it with joy but jenny found the warm sun made her sleepy she was tired michael had found an ordinary tennis ball and was throwing it for socks and after the tenth throw she sank onto a park bench and watched her husband and her dog wear themselves out she felt at peace with the world gloria was gone and she was safe now whatever she had to face in the future michael would be there with her she was where she wanted to be and she slept thats it you stupid mutt thats one hundred and twentythree runsmore than enough for any selfrespecting dog home michael caught socks to him attached the leash to his collar and turnedto find his wife soundly asleep on the park bench jenny he stood for a long moment looking at her she was still wearing that awful secretarial smock and although this morning hed found it reassuring fitting her into the role he knew suddenly he hated it she was quite extraordinarily beautiful and he no longer wanted to think of her as his secretary the warm breeze was wisping the curls from her face and her skin was still pale she was wearing no makeup her lips were soft and full and her lashes were long and luxurious socks head on one side looked questioningly at his mistress he put one dusty paw onto jennys knee but she didnt stir and suddenly it was too much for michael it would be too much for any man he thought and this was his wife the woman he wanted more than anything in the world as if compelled he bent and kissed her full on the lips kissed her with a tenderness he didnt know he possessed his jenny his wife as his mouth found hers jennys eyelids slowly opened and she saw his face before her like part of herself and somehow still half asleep she wasnt surprised this was an extension of a lovely dream shed expected that michaels mouth would be on hers and shed known that this feeling would be so immeasurably sweet she couldnt bear it she couldnt resist michael she murmured and her hands rose just a fraction she didnt pull away but she stirred and her eyes smiled into his it was enough he needed no other urging his jenny with a joyous groan he knelt and gathered her to him and then he kissed her properly as a man should kiss his wife he kissed her with a fierceness born of passion born of need his lips were against hers and her mouth was softly opening welcoming wanting him with an urgency that matched his dear heaven she was so sweet so lovely she was so incredibly desirable that it was as much as he could do to breathe his hands felt the roundness of her belly and her breasts yielded to his chest soft compliant jenny and still the kiss held her hands were on his face holding him deepening the kiss with a possessiveness that told him her hunger and her need were as great as his the kiss went on and on while they sat motionless under the cloudless sky but at last it came to an end two small boys came tearing along the path and skidded to a halt at the sight of themand then burst into teasing laughter aw mushy kissy kissy one of the boys pursed his lips and made a kissing sound jenny and michael broke apart in laughing confusion while socks barked his disapproval of this intrusion clear out of here michael ordered the boys but there was laughter in his eyes his heart had no room for anger right now his arms were firmly around jennys waist and there was no way he was letting go cant a man kiss his wife kissing makes babies one small scamp offered and the other boy hooted with scorn stupid theyve already made a baby shes as pregnant as my mom was when she had sarah ill bet shes about to bust at any minute then what do they want to kiss for sarahs older brother was unable to find an answer for such a tricky biological question yuck how would i know he giggled threw jenny and michael a scornful glance and raced away with his buddy what do they want to kiss for their words lingered funny yet profound what did they want to kiss for jenny looked deep into michaels eyes and she knew exactly why peter no the stab of memory caught her by surprise why was she doing this what promises was she breaking now she took a deep breath and pushed away michael i dont want me to kiss you he smiled at the distress in her face honest i very much want to kiss you i cant jen he rose from his kneeling position and sat on the bench beside her taking her hands between his all of a sudden her fingers felt cold and he frowned its too soon isnt it because of peter i she shook her head how to make him see the impossible hes only been dead seven months she said miserably i understand no she pulled her hands away pushed her curls out of her eyes and stared bleakly at the river i dont think you do so tell me he said softly her eyes flew to his you dontyou cantthis has nothing to do with you i thought you never intended to get near anyone again im doing it for the dog he said promptly and his answer was so pat she frowned in confusion the dog lightness was needed here he was thinking fast anything to take the panic from her eyes every orphan needs two parents he explained soulfully i ought to know that your baby needs two parents so i offered thinking we could get into the domesticity bit later but now we have socks and the need is urgent we need to indulge in domesticity right now or socks risks a deeply disturbed adolescence and domesticity means kissing definitely you know socks might not be the most stable adolescent to work on jenny said cautiously trying for laughter and michael shook his head in disbelief and clapped a hand over her mouth shh youll give the dog a complex lets just go back to playing doting parents do what doting parents do he smiled at herthat heartstopping smile that had her insides doing back flipsand tried to draw her into his arms but she somehow managed to pull away no then tell me why his smile died again okay maybe humor wasnt such a good idea maybe honesty was the best bet theres all sorts of electricity between us jenny and i dont understand it one bit its caught me by surprise but my instinct here is to go with it to see where it leads to see if we can fall in love you mean she asked cautiously and he nodded i guess thats what i do mean he caught his breath overwhelmed by what he was about to say maybemaybe its already happened youre saying you love me her eyes widened in incredulity after four days hey ive known you for over five months every weekday for five months her jaw dropped yeah right and you spent all that time treating me like i was part of the furniture i didnt every morning i had the same thing for morning break she said with asperity what was it huh ha i told you you didnt notice how would i know if you had tea or coffee does it matter i had chocolate milk she said with dignity straight out of the carton jen no despite her attempt at lightness the distress was still in her voice no way its true youve only just noticed me theres no way im letting you commit here michael lord let him commit let him commit hell woman i want to commit he roared damn it ive spent most of my life running scared of commitment now ive decided i want to go the whole nine yards and you say you dont but i can feel you do he made a grab for her again but she drew back and rose from the bench no this time there was no laughter at all there was fear he saw it and his indignation died at once he didnt follow just stayed sitting watching her tell me jen he said softly whats bothering you what are you fearful of me no she hesitated maybe he had to know she had to explain it to herself peter married me fast she said how fast he didnt make a move he had the impression that if he did she would retreat into silence sit jen and tell me there was a long drawnout silence and then slowly she sat and started speaking and when she did her voice sounded as if it came from a long way away we met one fabulous weekend at the home of mutual friends she said or rather they werent really mutual friends henry and kate were friends of mine and peter knew henry from university henry had gone home to peters for the weekend while they were undergraduates and gloria had pink fits because henrys mother worked as a char and henry was a scholarship student gloria disapproves of the unmoneyed absolutely so henry became a bone of contention between them whenever peter wanted to infuriate his mother hed extend his friendship with henry when peter had a fight with his mother he took off to visit henry he even told her that he was off to stay with his unsuitable friends oh great of course i never knew that till later jenny said her voice bleak all i knew was that henrys friend was dropdead gorgeous and he swept me off my naive nineteenyearold feet we were married before i could blinkbefore i found out that he was marrying me so he could marry a totally unsuitable woman to get at his mother he must have been nuts he was very mixed up jen said sadly im not saying he wasnt attracted to me like me and you there was thisthing like me and you he paused hating the comparison so its the same i dont know she flushed and looked at him no its not at least i dont think so with you i feel she broke off as he moved fractionally toward her and her hands came out as if to fend him off no i dont know what i feel but i do know that im rushing into no commitment here you married me as a kindness and theres no way im taking it further ive had one man already who was stuck with me is that what peter was oh yes honorably stuck but stuck all the same she said bitterly he was a mixhalf his father whom i gather he admired because he had such a stiff upper lip and was all honorhe died some time agoand half his mother whom youve seen and a bit of rebellion which made him seem vulnerable he just didnt know where he fitted in but he made me promise her voice died away he made you promise what her chin tilted trying to make him see trying to make him understand a little he regretted it you see she said faltering as she fought for the right words he tried to break free of his aristocratic bonds and it didnt work so when he was dying he made me promise to raise our child as he ought to be raisedas the next earl michaels brows creased and you made that promise peter was dying she said miserably and i still loved himsort of id grown but he hadnt by the time he died it was more a maternal sort of love i knew why he hurt mewhy he acted like he didbut there was nothing he could do to change it he was desperately injured i was griefstricken in the early stages of pregnancy alone in a strange country and i was in shock id have promised him anything if it would ease his distress but you didnt mean it at the time i did she told him bleakly i guess i thought i could do what he wantedgo home to england live on the estate and become the next earls mother there didnt seem any choice it was only after peters death when gloria started laying down the rules that i saw clearly what was involved or rather that i wouldnt be involved at all id be welcome to have access visits as long as i didnt take my son off the estate id have a generous allowance as long as i gave my son none of my commoner ideals the womans an autocratic dragon theres no way you can do things her way yeah but i promised jen its unreasonable i know that a hint of defiance returned thats why im still here but it doesnt make it one bit better its like i cant bury peter in my mind hes hanging over me like a sad ghost reminding me that ive betrayed his last wish and i cant get on with anything you mean you cant love me she met his eyes michael i do love you she said softly you are the kindest most generous person that i know but i still feel that im married as if part of me is still tied to peter and will be forever and in some stupid way its tied to that broken promise thank you for trying michael but for nowlets just leave it as it is i need to come to terms with what ive done in my own way for me marriagea proper marriage with hearts involved not the one weve made to keep me in the statesseems like one last betrayal when you kissed me then it was because you wanted because i wanted you she whispered the faintest tremor behind her words betraying her turmoil but then ive always wanted what i cant have love let me love you his voice was urgentinsistentbut she moved away no you mustnt because betraying peter again would drive me to the wall chapter twelve how could you fight a ghost there was no hope and by the end of the following week michael decided he was going nuts this was some crazy situation he thought grimly all his life hed run from emotional attachment and now here he was practically wearing his heart on his sleeve and jenny was holding him at arms length and flinching every time he laid a finger on her she was afraid afraid of him not of what hed do to her he knew her well enough to believe she trusted him she was afraid of what she might feel if she let him close so hed walk into the room and shed hug the dog or curl up on the end of the sofa with socks between her and the world or shed be out walking when he came home from some errand and shed read a book after supperor smile and talk him through his day keeping the conversation casual as if she were his best buddy instead of his wife and all the time there was this tiny glimmer of fear in the back of her eyes that drove him nuts he wanted to take her in his arms and kiss the fear away tell her it was okay hed never hurt her and hed never make her feel she was tying him down damn why had he ever told her he didnt want emotional commitment but he had and thatalong with peters ghostwas enough to make her run scared so whats up bro garrett caught up with him the day he came back to work he only had to look at his little brothers face to know something was wrong michael looked strained to breaking point i thought you just had a week off i did you look like youve run a marathon yeah well you try sleeping in the same house as jenny michael growled and garretts eyes widened hey shes some lady i wouldnt think youd mind sleeping in the same bed as jenny thats just it michael slammed his fist on his desk with such force that his new secretary gave a startled glance his way i wouldnt mind sleeping in the same bed as jenny uhoh garrett grinned and rose lazily to close the door on the flapping ears outside i see so sleeping in a different room is the problem the ladys almost nine months pregnant with another mans child he said gently you need to give her space i love her garrett michael said and put his head in his hands and groaned silence you love her garrett said at last in a voice that sounded strange obviously he was having trouble taking this in yeah well thats great not when she doesnt want me heck mike give her a chance she must have so many mixedup hormones pounding around right now dead husband pregnancy marriage you recommend patience hey i dont know garrett said exasperated youre asking me about women short of lana and shelby i know nothing theyre a breed apart ask lana ask her what what to do garrett said unhelpfully meanwhile think of all the hearts youve broken in your time it wont hurt you to get a taste of your own medicine gee thanks dont mention it garrett said expansively now why i came to see you he hauled a list out of his pocket and tossed it onto michaels desk heres a security check for you whats this michael picked the paper up and stared listlessly at the row of names possible parents shelby and i are working on it already but wed like you to give us a hand he froze what the heck i told you i dont want to know the girls do garrett said lanas changed her mind since she married dylan somewhere out there is our birth mother mike and theres a gut feeling among me and the girls that shes hurting we need to find her i dont mike youve held yourself in that icy cocoon for too many years garrett said gently jennys chipped away at the ice and theres warmth under there while youre waiting for her to come around use the warmth for someone other than yourself maybe jenny can teach you how jenny yeah jenny garrett said firmly if jenny hadnt found youif shed ended up destitutemaybe she would have given up her baby rather than see it starve and if she did would the hurt of losing her child have disappeared after all this time i dont think so mike and neither do you garrett i just look at the list garrett said firmly talk to jenny about it see what she thinks its none of her business if you want her to love you you have to learn to share he hesitated there was real pain on michaels face and garrett didnt want to push it but if the ice was cracking he wouldnt be the one to withhold the sledgehammer on saturday night theres a party at megans to welcome camille and jake home from their honeymoon it promises to be a real shindig fireworks everything now her familys all settled megans feeling like shes on top of the world and shes showing it every way she can im not coming to any family party you know i wont meganll be disappointed if youre not there little brother garrett said and hauled his lanky frame out of the chair and if were talking of hurting people theres one lady youll leave untouched hurt megan and ill dust you down before breakfast or give it my best shot he shrugged and pushed the list across the desk again from where michael had thrust it back at him do what you can with that by saturday and bring jenny to supper at my place first hell garrett i treat her like family mike garrett said kindly maybe the ladyll get used to it maybe shell even like it jennywasfeeling part of the family and she did like it every day the feeling grew a little bit stronger lana came around and sorted baby clothes with her she helped jenny make up the crib talked baby talk and taught her how to change and bathe little greg shelby turned up with offerings of food i know that brother of mine cant do more than open a can of beans she explained and you shouldnt be doing any more than cooking toast in your condition garrett kept dropping injust to see how my favorite sisterinlaw is doingmaking her feel warm all over and megan came too just to check one by one all the maitlands curious at first and then warm and friendly arrived at her front door and embraced her into their fold it was all making her feel so guilty she couldnt bear it every night michael came home and looked at her with those hungry eyes and she wanted to drop everything and run into his arms and let him hold her forever and forever but she mustnt because one day michael would wake up like peter had woken up and hed be trapped and like peter hed be too honorable and proud to walk away i promise how easy it had been to say those words she held her arms over her pregnancy and hugged her unborn child as she thought things through she couldnt keep her promise even for peter she wouldnt hand her baby over but at what cost to herself oh peter you want to go to a party saturday afternoon michael finished writing and looked over to where jen was brushing socks damn every time he was in the room she was doing something it was almost a defense she looked up her eyes a question theres a party at megans tonight he told her to welcome camille and jake home supper at garretts first how about you go without me she asked turning her attention to a nonexistent knot in sockss fur its family yeah its family so everyone expects you im hardly family if you cant go because youre feeling too pregnant then theyll expect me to stay home with you hell they sounded so absurdly formal it was as if they were strangers michael come with me jen he said urgently he hesitated then passed her the sheet of paper hed been writing on were discussing this please i need your support on this one she sat back and read the list then stared at him names and addresses i dont understand theyre all the triplets born in this state in the same year we were born he told her garrett gave it to me this week hes trying to find our birth mother so far ive tried to locate every person who had anything to do with the triplets on this list ive been finding their current names and addresses and whether any of them could possibly be us im whittling the list down she stared at him then at the list you did this yeah he colored like i said garrett asked me to but you said you wanted nothing to do with finding your birth mother why now she grabbed a chair leg and hauled herself up from where shed been kneeling on the floor michael made an involuntary move to help her then pulled back he knew by now what her reaction would be why she asked him again her eyes not moving from his face she knew this was important and it was ive been watching you jen he said softly ive been seeing your pain at whats happening even before your babys born youre being torn apart by whats best for him and maybe im seeing his voice died away as he looked at her that what was best for you might have torn your own mother apart jen said gently oh michael yeah well i havent found anyone yet he said gruffly but maybe im giving her the benefit of the doubt by trying she looked at the list but yeah but theres maybes all over the place he told her come to garretts with me and well talk about it how could she refuse an invitation like that they stopped downtown first if youre coming to the party with me you deserve to wear something decent michael told her then stop at the camping store jenny said half serious a tents all ill fit into threeman at least no camping store lana told me where to go he closed his ears to her protests pulled to a halt in front of an upscale maternity store and then proceeded to take charge just as he had with the baby clothes while jenny muttered protestations about interfering males he delved through one rack after another and finally found what he wanted this he said firmly and she stared it was gorgeousa soft gold silk maternity dress with a scooped neckline and no sleeves it was gathered under the breast with white and gold ribbon then fell away to just below the knee in yards and yards of gorgeous silken folds it would look fabulous on a nonpregnant woman on jennys bulk she wasnt so sure but the sales assistant and michael propelled her into the fitting room and refused to let her out until shed tried it on to her surprise the dress swirled around her in soft folds like a wondrous golden cloud she looked maternal and serene and very very lovely youll be able to wear it after the babys come the saleslady assured her staring into the mirror at jennys reflection oh its just beautiful and itll be perfect even after you get your waistline back im never getting my waistline backi left it in england jenny said darkly michael this is ridiculous what a waste its not a waste jenny he told her turning her by her shoulders to face the mirror again look at yourself and tell me just how ridiculous you are michael just look so she did and what she saw made her stare sure this was a maternity dress but it was made for someone young and beautiful it seemed to light her up from inside it made her hair gloss around her face and deepened the blush on her cheeks it made her feel it made her feel nineteen again young beautiful desirable all the things that peter had knocked out of her with his disparaging comments and his suggestions that she was inferior to the women who moved in his social circles her lips twitched involuntarily into the beginnings of delight and michael saw and smiled his satisfaction you like it that makes the pair of us well buy it michael its way too expensive but her protest was feeble all the better to waste my money on come on cinderella lets head for the ball before your pumpkin escapes from under there its a funny thing the saleslady laughed as she took michaels money nearly every time i sell a maternity dress this close to term the woman comes back laterand thinnerand says the baby arrived almost right away its like a lucky charm i wonder if itll happen this time it had better not jenny said startled and she glared at her bulge you hear that pumpkin you stay right there come on then cinderella michael said and grabbed her hand lets go midnights coming up fast it wasnt quite a ball but it might as well have been for the enjoyment she had supper at garretts was fun the whole family made her feel welcome and although jenny felt more and more like she was being drawn in out of her depth there was no way she could not enjoy herself they were so happylana and her dylan big kindly garrett and possessive shelby whod checked jenny out from every angle and decided shed share this precious brother of hers the mood was lighthearted but there was also the hint of suspensea suspense that ended when garrett said over coffee okay michael what have you got for us michael hauled out his list and showed it to his three astounded siblings michael shelby breathed staring at the names on michaels list you agreed to help she gazed at him in total astonishment why something garrett said michael replied baldly and garrett nodded he smiled at jenny so its thanks to you jenny shelby said i had nothing to do with it jenny retorted flushing under their gazes what michael decides has nothing to do with me but it did and they all knew it the three siblings took in her flushed appearance and michaels scowl and they all came to the same conclusion you might as well look at the list ive made michael said finally breaking the silence instead of sitting there and looking so smug they all check out lana said after sifting through the list of names i mean youve traced them all except for these michael had worked on every set of triplets and tried to research the parents names as well hed also attempted to find an adult contact from each set the one family hed reached so far had splintered the mother had gone one way with the girls the father had gone another with the boy michael had managed to locate the sonin prison ugh im glad thats not you mike shelby breathed a mugger just what every family needs i may be driven to it yet michael said lord knows ive come close enough with you guys for siblings or even murder justifiable homicide if ever i saw it he was hit with a cushion for his pains but shelby only had half a mind on what she was doing her attention was on the list again what about this last one none of these might fit michael warned we could have been brought here from out of state or over the border theres not a lot of mexicans with our coloring shelby retorted theres irish blood in us somewhere but youre right another states a possibility still our mother had to have known megans reputation to have left us where she did so chances are she was local leeann and gary larrimore lana read michael had duplicates of the list and she was leaning against dylans shoulder as she read two girls one boy triplets born april twentysixth the date makes it about right and you cant find any trace of the adults no michael frowned now the outofstate thing comes in if it is them if theyre us then the family must have moved here close to the birth why because theres no trace of a garrett larrimore registered as born in texas in the two years before the triplets were born i assume our mother wouldnt have registered our birthswhich explains why theres no trace of usbut garretts got to be somewhere so maybe this leeann and gary had their triplets here and then took their babies home again to california to canada to anywhere the hospital records are useless for that sort of information im doing a national search but its not in yet the only thing is yes he had the attention of everyone in the room after i found the records of the triplet birth i did a search for births and deaths of larrimores for the surrounding few years looking for garrett mostly but checking anything that came up and and a gary larrimore aged twentyeight was killed two months before this lot of triplets were born silence the lord children were deathly still and dylan and jen sat on the sidelines and watched them absorb this momentous news even baby greg was quiet you mean lana was the first to gather herself she lifted michaels piece of paper and read as if she could see something that wasnt written there our birth fatherdied it may not be us this is all supposition but that would explain it lana breathed horrified oh that poor woman to have a little boy two years old and to be told you were expecting triplets and then to have the man you love be killed do we know what happened i found the local coroners report michael said he was thrown off his motorcycle the coroner said it was raining and his tires were bald so he was poor were assuming all sorts of things here garrett said hastily were jumping to conclusions but then he paused and frowned as if remembering things almost against his will you know thats one thing i remember theres hardly anything but occasionallyits like a shadow but its there a motorcycle you remember a bike mike demanded garrett shook his head i think i do as i said its a shadow of a memory but there was never a motorcycle after we were adopted i guess it probably means nothing but it might mean something and theres no trace of leeann larrimore after she left the clinic michael told them she seems to have vanished without trace so we find her shelbys eyes filled with tears right michael put up his hand in warning shelby we have to eliminate the other names on the list we cant just focus on one we still have contacts to make in four sets including the larrimores you know ill help you michael shelby said im due for a vacation and id be happy to do some outoftown legwork michael nodded just give me a little more time to get as many specifics as i can but it may take a while so youll all have to be patient but youll keep trying shelby asked michaels gaze moved to jenny and his eyes fell to the gentle swell beneath her gorgeous dress his motherwhoever she washad once been like this so pregnant and not pregnant with just one babe pregnant with three and with another tiny child dependent on her he had no choice yes of course i will oh michael youre wonderful shelby said immeasurably moved hes wonderful isnt he everybody isnt he jenny i guess he is jenny said in a voice that was none too steady just wonderful and then individually or in pairs they made their way to megans party the night was unusually sultry a storm was coming jenny thought as they drove across town she hoped it would hold off for the evening she was tired aching to go home to bed if the truth be known and her back hurt but she wouldnt keep michael from his party you okay michael asked as they arrived worry in his voice but she smiled her reassurance come on michael lord no chickening out now your family tells me youre not the best at socializing so lets see you do your worst the party was in full swing when they arrived there seemed to be couples everywhere spilling onto the lawns and dancing inside to the tune of a piano player tinkling in the drawing room the place looked wonderful lit up like christmas megans daughter anna will have done this shes a wedding planner and parties are her specialty michael told jenny taking her hand and leading her into the throng megans family seems to have spent the last twelve months matchmaking megans been through some pretty traumatic times but now shes feeling like partying anyone you havent met yet youll be meeting tonight michael this isnt i mean you dont need to introduce me as if its forever treat it as fun he told her nothing more megans told them whats happening they all know whats between us is not a real marriage did they that wasnt the way they greeted her jenny was met with warmth and welcome and she grew quieter and quieter as the evening proceeded and more worried so many things were being assumed even by michael youre tired michael said in concern at about eleven and she nodded her back was hurting with low stabbing pains but michael was more animated than shed ever seen him this was obviously an important night for megan to have all her family here and michael was having fun too she wouldnt spoil it i can sleep tomorrow she said we can go home if you want soon not yet its raining cats and dogs outside now garrett said coming up to them with megan on his arm id wait until it eases before going anywhere therell be roads flooded all over jenny can i have this dance who me dance she managed a smile i need a partner with a pit instead of a stomach to fit my big bump ill be your pit michael said elbowing garrett out of the way he smiled into her tired eyes one slow dance and then well go home one dancejust for us michael garrett made to object but michael shook his head sorry garrett michael drawled and drew his wife into his arms the ladys taken he loves her megan said in satisfaction as michael led jenny out to the dance floor finally after all these years hes fallen for a woman who has a heart i just hope to hell she can learn to love him too garrett said slowly watching his brother take jenny and lead into the first few steps shes had bad times in the past theres a sadness in her eyes yes megans brow creased thoughtfully she looks and then she paused because so had jenny she stopped dead on the dance floor and her eyes flew wide in agonized surprise jenny michaels exclamation of concern drowned out the sound of the soft piano as jenny stumbled his strong hands already entwined around her waist caught her as she sagged downward jen michael i what is it she gasped her knees had given way beneath her and she would have sunk to the floor if he wasnt holding her taketake me home michael she managed to say or the hospital please oh michael i think the babys coming chapter thirteen the baby definitely was coming the pain in her back was a rolling crippling cramp that enveloped every inch of her being michael could feel the spasms run through her body as he held her she clung to him as if she was drowning and the couples around them stopped dancing and stared in concern michael knelt with her as she doubled over and his face was tight with panic jenny love hey jenny whats happening michael glanced up as someone called from across the room and his shoulders sagged in relief as he saw who it was abby of course abby megans daughter was maitland maternitys chief obstetrician so many of the hospital staff were family if jenny was in labor she had half the staff of maitland maternity right here abby had left her husband and was crossing swiftly to stoop beside the pair on the floor hey jenny lets not panic here she said kneeling is this your first contraction i donti dont think so jenny whispered the pain had eased leaving her room to think maybe not i mean i thought contractions were like stomach cramps but ive been having back pains all afternoon and theyve been getting worse this oneit was the same but different much worse and it sort of slammed around the front that sounds like a contraction to me abby said cheerfully and a good one how far apart would these back pains be she took jennys wrist between her fingers found the pulse and flicked a glance at her watch um two minutes maybe two minutes wow thats terrific abbys voice oozed confidence and reassurance if thats true then youll have danced your way through most of the first stage of labor she grinned okay everyone lets clear a path michael well carry jenny to a bedroom to give us a bit of privacy we seem to be about to have a baby she glanced at her husband kyle you want to call for an ambulance honey i dont want to risk a backseat delivery here but kyle was looking through the french windows to the gardens the unseasonably warm evening had disappeared completely rain was lashing against the glass in torrents and while he watched lightning flashed thunder followed about a millisecond later the storms right overhead kyle said and looked around the room assessing counting heads its a storm and a half therell be flash flooding and the roads will be unsafe he nodded as he took stock of who was present you know given the guest list here staying put might be the wisest option hey were going to the hospital michael said startled he hadnt taken his eyes from jennys white face and his hands were gripping his wife hard in turn she was clinging to him as if fearful of being swept away there are no problems are there abby kyle asked smoothly he wasnt a ceo for nothing sensible decisions were what he was paid for nope abby shook her head ill need to examine jenny to be sure but it seems a nice normal labor a healthy boy being born at term to a healthy mom this baby is not being born at term jenny said through gritted teeth hes not due till next week you want to tell him that abby grinned again and then paused in concern as she saw another contraction hit she glanced again at her watch remember your breathing jenny just breathe through it thats less than a minute apart lord were moving right along here she glanced up searching for megan in the sea of concerned family faces mom can we have a bed and hot water and towels and whatever else you need of course dear oh jenny megan knelt toohalf the world it seemed was gathered in megans drawing room watching jennys contractions megan waited until this one passed then smiled reassuringly into jennys fearful face aunt megan im so sorry it was all she could manage nonsense child megan said firmly anna said we should have a party finale we were planning fireworks until we were washed out but a babywhat a magical end to an evening we havent got the facilities michael snapped damn they were being frivolous and this was his jenny he wanted a brightly lit hospital room and every piece of chrome equipment known to man along with incubators and anesthetics and intravenous drips and hey mike kyles hand was on his shoulder giving him strength we have abby whos the best obstetrician in austin bar none our car is set up like a mobile labor roomwhat abby doesnt have in the trunk hasnt been invented ford carringtons right here behind me and dont tell me youre doubting his pediatric credentials katies with him and she has midwife qualifications as well as her pediatric training if there are any problems well call an ambulance and risk the storm sopick up your wife and take her where megan shows you were all with you every inch of the way and then kyle smiled at jennys white face mrs lord welcome to maitland maternity clinicthe megan maitland annex were all with you they certainly were for jenny the next two hours passed in a blur but what she remembered of her labor was a sea of family michaels family no for now they were her family one by one they came in and sat with michael who didnt leave her side for a minute they told her she was doing great that they loved her and she looked terrific and michael looked paler than she did lana shelby megan and ellie garrett camille the piano player started up again and the party went on in slow mode waiting mode no one was risking driving home in this rain or maybe they all wanted to stay for megans finale or for jenny and michaels finale youre doing great jenny abby told her hell be here soon real soon push just as hard as you want to honey this boy of yours is coming through like a locomotive and push she did though it was like biting down on a sore tooth or worse and she really wanted to cry out in painmaybe she did cry but the faces around her told her it didnt matter one bit if she hollered the place down and michaels hands held her all the while every inch of the way and finally hes crowning abby said jubilantly i can see him jenny the top of his heads coming through lets get ford in here because soon well have a new little person to check over okay ease back jenny now once again push i cant i cant oh she felt him come she felt her son move within her and michaels arms slipped around her shoulders and lifted her so she could see her tiny bluewhite baby come slithering out into the world into abbys waiting arms heshes she could scarcely believe what she was seeing hes just perfect abby said clearing the tiny airway and turning the baby over in her arms there was a moment of absolute silence and then jennys baby son opened his eyes he stared up and took one long look then opened his mouth and hollered the piano player stopped as if hed been struck there was a hush outside the room then the new arrival opened his mouth for his second earthly yell and was joined by laughter and applause filtering in from the room beyond the maitlands and the lords were welcoming another baby into the family clan ford was running an expert eye over the lusty infant nodding and smiling his approval he passed the baby to katie who wrapped him in the receiving blanket and placed the tiny baby into his mothers waiting arms jennys eyes welled with tears as she looked into her sons face oh michael oh look it was all she could do to speak she pulled back the edge of the blanket with tenderness and awe and her eyes flew to michael and back to her son hehe has red hair she stammered oh lord megan had tiptoed into the room unable to stay outside a moment longer she crossed to look at the silent infant cradled in his mothers arms thats just the shade of the triplets hair when they were tiny she breathed stunned just that shade hell have hair just like his daddys but abby paused im not his daddy michael said but his eyes didnt leave the baby for an instant your husband must have had red hair jen my latehusband had blond hair jenny whispered her eyes flew to michael and held my nowhusband has red hair michael youve been so good to me maybe this is gods way of saying hes your son too no but she wasnt listening michael hes as much your son as peters more youve protected us and cared for us and her voice broke and she lay back on her pillows overcome katie smiled and moved to take the little one from jennys arms let his daddy hold him she suggested and before michael could murmur a protest the baby was lying cocooned in his arms he was a tiny fiveminuteold redhead wide eyes stared at michael filled with awe at this amazing new world wondrous eyes jennys eyes and yet these eyes belonged only to this new little person and michael looking at him felt a protective urge that knocked him sideways what had katie said let his daddy hold him youre calling him peter arent you jenny abby asked watching michael with a smile of satisfaction jenny shook her head tears slipping down her cheeks unchecked nope his name is gary richard lord gary richard lord where did that name come from katie asked richard was peters father jenny whispered peter loved his father and my son should have a part of his birthright but gary i have a sense about gary i think a man called gary larrimore died a long time ago and his death is the reason im lying in this room right now with all my new family jenny we dont even know if this gary larrimore had anything to do with us yes we do jenny was almost asleep she was snuggled into her pillows her baby son in a makeshift crib by her side and the world had let them be there were only michael and jennyand their tiny infant son beside them you dont know gary larrimore is my father michael said steadily trying not to turn and look at hisat the baby and even if he was he is i can feel it her eyes smiled at him with a trace of a twinkle call it a mothers intuition and then the twinkle faded and i cant bear it she whispered the thought of your mother being pregnant all those years ago and her gary being killed before you were born leaving her with a toddler and heartbreak and all those unfulfilled dreams i cant get her out of my mind michael whatever she did wherever she is or whatever shes done this is my way of saying thankyou thankyou for what for giving me to you and her eyes closed and he was left with nothing to say gary richard lord garrett stared at his brother in amazement michael had left his wife and was in the living room megan had made up a bed for him next to jenny but he wasnt ready for sleep yet garrett had sensed that and was waiting in the darkened house when michael emerged the oldest lord brother was clearly bewildered afterour father after some person shes imagining was our father garretts eyebrows lifted real or not thats quite a compliment it is mikes lips thinned and he looked grim shes generous through and through my lovely jenny she just gives and gives so why the grim look were not really married hey i think you are garrett said gently the way you look at her but not the way she looks at me michael burst out oh shes gratefulincredibly gratefuland i know shes attracted and shed never do anything to hurt me but as for love he took a fast pace around the room then paused and stood staring out at the drenched garden some aristocratic lowlife back in britain killed that for her you mean he mistreated her there was caution in garretts question it was absolutely out of character for his brother to be exposing his pain the way he was now yes no i dont know michael was still staring outside talking almost to himself the events of the past few hours had shaken him to the core and it showed the way i see it he married her to frustrate his mother and he never stopped letting jen know she was trash as if jen could ever be thought trash by anyone but now he took a deep breath that little baby in there is the next earl of epingdalein fact i guess hes that already since his fathers dead and before he died peter extracted a promise from jenny that hed be brought up to take over his title garrett shook his head at that if it means giving him up then jenny wont do it even i can see that of course she wont michael said grimly but its tearing her heart out she made that promise on his deathbed and then when it came to the crunch she couldnt keep it she couldnt abandon her baby to gloria theres no blame in what shes doing she blames herself and this child is partly peters no matter how much i want him and garrett paused but the question was already half answered you really want him i want himand i want his mothermore than anything else on gods earth michael said simply he hesitated but his heart was exposed for all to see and there was nothing left to do but explain before jen i thought id cut myself off from everything you know more than most that ive tried hard enough but she needs me garrett and shes so darned proud shell take my offer of an identity and shell spend the rest of her life trying to pay me back but i dont want payment i want her she must see it shes just filled with love aching for love have you told her how much you want her garretts voice was suddenly urgent and it made michael blink no he said slowly how can i itll put more pressure on her itd be like insisting that if she lives with me she has to love me too in her position shell say yes just to please me its not possible that she loves you of course she loves me michael exploded shes so kindhearted shed love anyone look until i get rid of the ghost of this peter i dont have a snowballs chance in hell of getting anywhere near her and how can i get rid of a ghost he paused at a sound what there was a scrambling at the french windows and a low voice speaking urgently shh you dumb mutt you want to wake everyone in the house its shelby garrett said his eyes creasing with laughter as he crossed to open the door shelby came bursting into the room her auburn hair damp from the rain and her running shoes squelching with water what on earth are you doing here he started to ask and then stopped dead as he saw the dog at her side and the dog caught sight of michael it was as if socks were drowning and michael was the only lifeguard for miles he launched himself at michael leaping right off the ground and catching his shoulders with his huge paws michael was left with nowhere to go he stood enfolded in soggy dog while socks licked and whined and wriggled out his loneliness and frustration at being abandoned there was a stunned silence from shelby and garrett and there was not a lot michael could say either mmff he finally managed to get out but it didnt make a heap of sense shelby grinned shed changed into jeans and a tshirt which were mudspattered she wiped wet hands on her jeans and looked at michael and socks with affection what do you think hes trying to say she asked garrett and garrett chuckled thank you very much for bringing me my dog he suggested yeah that must be it mmff said michael yeah thats definitely it garrett grinned good thought bringing him here shelby you wanted to keep the family together actually shelby said carefully when i got home there was a message on my answering machine from michaels neighbors several messages in fact theyd been looking for him all over i bet when you get home therell be messages on your phone too seems socks was howling the place apart so what could a girl do but reunite brother and dog garrett finished for her gee i hope megan has a decent floor cleaner and then he frowned at another tap on the window he turned and there was lana signaling to be let in her arms piled high with baby clothes and nightwear lana hey its a family reunion lana entered dumped the clothes on a chair then looked at michael her face cleared so thats where he is where did you think mike would be i meant socks lana said cheerfully i might have known hed get himself here you been looking for him garrett queried and lana gave him a grin that matched shelbys there were five messages on our phone when dylan and i got home she said five all complaining about socks and demanding that someone in the family do something so i left dylan holding the baby and went to fetch him missed him by inches she smiled happily at her sister guess that was you huh got there before me and rescued socks you always were the lucky one so i get the dog hair and muddy paw prints all over my passenger seat shelby said morosely as well as dog slobber on my windshield while you get to carry baby clothes i figured while i was there i might as well bring them over lana said virtuously and besides i wanted to see she turned to look at michael and it was very clear what she wanted to see mmmfff said michael and they all burst out laughing finally garrett took pity on his brother and went over to haul the adoring mutt onto the floor socks immediately shook his wet self from stem to stern spraying everyone he looked adoringly at his master and then flopped down exhausted at his feet what a dog garrett said admiringly now no one needs a shower speak for yourself shelby said darkly wiping mud from her nose ugh anyway enough of mutts michael hows jenny and the new little one asleep michael cut his reply short and shelby stared laughter fading theres nothing wrong is there no but but he doesnt know if she loves him garrett finished for him and michael glared butt out of course she loves him lana ignored michael entirely she was talking only to garrett and shelby shes called her son gary garrett told them gary shelbys mouth dropped open and her voice was shaky gary she quavered oh michael thats lovely she must love you to bits but jenny promised her husband on his deathbed that shed allow his son to be brought up as a little earl garrett continued ignoring michaels dark looks so shes going through all sorts of conscience barbs trying to come to terms with bringing him up here in the states seems thats getting in the way of her relationship with mike you mean she cant love mike because shes broken a promise to her dead husband shelby frowned over this one thats crazy lana said but shelby shook her head no i can see that too much has happened too fast to jenny widowed pregnant remarried hounded by her motherinlaw changing countries worrying about money giving birth getting to know michael her head must be spinning off her shoulders so he should just give her time lana demanded hey excuse me michael said in a voice that boded ill for the fate of his siblings this is my love life were talking about of course it is shelby said kindly so shut up mike and let us get on with it she swiveled to face garrett so michael definitely loves her of course he loves her garrett tossed a laughing look at his younger brother you ever seen someone so besotted as our mike nope shelby grinned cant say i have you lana not me but lana was thinking fast this is tricky though garrett jenny cant take gary back to england ive met gloria shes a horror but if jennys feeling so guilty she just might no michael said but he was ignored we have to face it as a possibility lana decided the lord siblings were nothing if not a team and they never worked so well as when one of the brood was under threat garrett and shelby and lana were totally focused and michael might as well not have been there so what do we do keep her promise shelby said and everyone stared at her even michael what what exactly did she promise shelby demanded and michael shook his head i dont know hasnt she told you yes but then think remember its important come on michael youre trained to remember details think okay okay michaels brow furrowed he was way out of his league here emotionally exhausted but he knew his siblings too well to think theyd let go what had she promised he thought back and suddenly the words were right there he made me promise to bring our child up as he ought to be raisedas the next earl he told them thats what jenny said no specifics shelby demanded like promising to live in a castle for nine months a year and keep ten footmen thirty maidservants and a butler or six i hardly think so they thought it was a joke michael thought grimly but he wasnt laughing peter was dying when he made her promise i cant imagine a dying man would be into specifics hed just ask for what he wanted mostthat the kid grow up enjoying his inheritance shelbys smile faded just as his had then wheres your problem she asked gently gary lord can be brought up to be earl of epingdale right here you teach him about his inheritance and his history from day one you teach him everything he needs to know to take over his fathers mantlewhen and if he ever wants it and once a year you use some of that illgotten cash you have floating around to take him over to visit his family seat this was crazy but but what michael stared his mind racing a mile a minute discarding one thought after another one thing stood out above all gloria will never agree i dont see gloria as having a choice shelby said bluntly as far as gloria is concerned its that or nothing shell give jenny hell if she goes to england not if youre beside her shelby said triumphantly and all the other little lord kids you intend having theyll play baseball in the ancestral halls you can raise the stars and stripes from the ancestral flagpole hey you could even invite us garrett lanahow do you feel about visiting a real live english castle we could do it lana breathed for jenny of course we could do itfor jenny shelby said soundly she took michaels hands and reeled him in to give him a hug and for mike too so what do you say brother mine give it a go or not chapter fourteen jenny woke to flowers flowers as far as the eye could see there were flowers by her bed and there were flowers on the blanket box at her feet vases and vases of them by the window there were standsmaybe a dozen standsand every one had a vase with maybe thirty blooms in it their smell was all around her the window was open there were more flowers in the gardens beyond the terrace and the smell of raindrenched flowers was everywhere there was the faintest murmur beside her and jenny looked down to see her son stirring in his sleep his tiny fist was just touching his rosebud mouth and his bottom lip was trembling her son gary with one wondering finger she touched his cheek his eyelids fluttered open his face turned momentarily toward her and he stared at his mother with a look that would stay with her for the rest of her life and then gary richard lord decided it wasnt time to stir yet he had more important things to do like sleep hes a real sweetheart a voice whispered and jennys eyes flew to the door katie was standing there katie the nurse whod been with her every moment of her labor it was true then it had all happened i thought it must have been a dream jenny said wonderingly and she winced when she moved well maybe not maybe it really is real you feeling sore like ive been steamrollered he makes a great little steamroller katie looked at her small charge he has the best set of lungs in the state ford and i have decided its just as well he was born here maitland maternity would have given him his marching orders for disturbing the peace i think i did my own bit of yelling last night jenny said ruefully i sure messed up the party well thats a heap of nonsense katie told her smiling megan hasnt had such an exciting party for years she eyed jenny closely you really hurting only when i laugh jennys eyes drifted to the couch at the side of the room katie saw where she was looking and she shook her head abandoned she said mournfully thats what happens to the women of the tribe after theyve produced the son and heir youve been deserted by the man you love hell be off handing out cigars and practicing his chest puffing but i dont hey hell be back katie reassured her i bet hes gone to get more flowers as if these arent enough hes been gathering them for hours where hes gotten them all from i dont know michael brought all these she asked in amazement i sure did and you deserve every one of them michaels gruff voice came from across the room and she turned her head on her pillows her husband was coming in through the french windowsand yes he was carrying more flowers holy cow youd think it was a wedding katie grinned michael dumped the flowers on an armchair and crossed the room to take jenny into his arms and kiss her senseless before she could remember a single reason he shouldnt jenny didnt have the energy to fight him well maybe she did but she didnt even try she lay back and let herself be soundly kissed and just for a moment she let herself believe this was how it should be her wonderful beloved husband kissing her after the birth of their child what could be more perfect than this one baby plus one husband plus a ghost peter was still there and as michael finally released her he saw the echoes of her past lingering in her eyes jen michael your flowers are wonderful she said softly but quickly as if to make things more formal i thank you but how did you get them you havent stripped megans garden your son snores he said smiling into her eyes with a look that made her heart do back flips there was no way i could sleep katie stayed in calling distance so i went rose hunting he grinned theres not a garden on the street left untouched you stole them that shook her she sat up and fixed him with the same look shed used when he was trying to impose his will on her as a secretary michael lord are you nuts youll be arrested i left twenty bucks and a thankyou note in every mailbox he told her virtuously there was no way i was waiting for the florists to open youre still nuts but nice nuts he asked hopefully and she chuckled then withdrew imperceptibly he saw it and didnt take things further he had a plan and it involved a bit of careful persuasion plus a lie or two pushing things wouldnt work jenny im here to take your gary richard away for a bit he told her then at her startled look he turned to katie tell her katie jenny megan wants you to stay right where you are for a few days she told her we think its best if youre happy to do that of course but megan megan thinks its just wonderful megan said coming into the room as if on cue it was still before nine in the morning it had been three before megan had slept the night before but she looked as immaculately dressed and as fresh as if shed had a full nights sleep as ceo i should be telling you to get yourself into maitland maternity but were big enough now to cope with losing the business of one mother and babe so youll stay here michael said to jenny as he eyed his aunt doubtfully theyd clued katie in on what was going on but megan didnt know of course id love to stay here if its okay but there was a furrow between jennys eyes but why do you need to take gary away ford wants to check him michael said promptlya bit too promptly and jennys frown grew she knew this man but last night ford said he was okay her eyes flew to her son and panic flared theres nothing wrong of course theres nothing wrong katie said reassuringly but jenny was still suspicious then why i imagine ford wants his bilirubin levels taken for jaundice and a heel prick for thyroid function megan volunteered and all eyes veered toward her good grief michael thought what was she going to say had she guessed i dont understand jenny said i dont suppose you do child megan told her graciously but all newborns are required to have their bilirubin levels taken though your little gary doesnt look jaundiced to me and their heel test needs to be done for thyroid malfunction theyre simple tests that take only a few seconds but they need to be done in a hospital with the right equipment i imagine ford would be unhappy about delaying it michael held his breath he looked at katieand saw she was holding hers was megan really saying this will you be long jenny asked still looking at her tiny son can i come with him theres no way youre going anywhere megan told her sternly and it takes all of ten minutes to get to the hospital an hour at most for the testthats if theres a waitand back here by a little after ten youll have the little one back by then right michael michael stunned could only nod of course and ill take the best care of him i know you will jenny whispered its only she looked at her tiny son and her eyes welled i dont like to be away from him for a minute an hour only michael said softly and bent and kissed her on the lips megan i dont know what youre doing and i dont want to know megan told him as michael carried gary out of the room after jenny had fed him what i dont know i cant tell you just get him back in an hour you promise i promise and michael megans eyes creased into a smile megan good luck the hotel was the grandest in austin michael had guessed shed be here but hed phoned first to make sure certainly theyd said at seven this morning her ladyship is booked to the end of the week hed half expectedfearedthat shed gone back to england which would have made it so much harder now though everything that should be said could be said right now but not alone he wasnt a fool michael remembered the thugs and he remembered glorias threat of a private jet gary was too precious to risk so he waited in the foyer as planned and two minutes after he arrived garrett and lana and shelby came through the revolving doors to meet him she let him go well done lana was first to reach him and her eyes devoured the newborn gary he was so swaddled in his blankets all she could see was one pink nose michael was taking no risks at all and ford said it was okay to bring him ford met me at megans hes given me the all clear and hell cover us if jen starts asking questions but we only have an hour so lets do it garrett said he looked at his three siblings and grinned four lords and one baby lord against one old lady poor old lady there was nothing poor about gloria garrett hadnt met her he did the knocking while michael stayed in the background michael had paved the way with a call gloria its michael lord and id like to talk to you there are things you and i need to discuss he almost saw the curve of satisfaction play on glorias mouth as shed taken in what he said shed be expecting some sort of proposition a request for money every man had his price that was the way she worked michael knew and she wasnt to know the lords had a different set of values entirely like absolute loyalty so shed given him her room number and michael stood back while garrett faced her shelby and lana flanking him what on earth glorias breath whistled in as she saw the group by the door i dont know you im garrett lord garrett said smoothly im michaels big brother garys uncle in fact and these are michaels sisters lana and shelby garys aunts gloria stared at them contempt mixing with confusion on her face behind her in her luxury hotel suite michael caught sight of her two lackeys solidly behind her they werent thugs for hire by the hour then she had them at her beck and calland she must have summoned them fast at michaels phone call he was right he thought hed have been a fool to bring gary here alone how would she react now with gary surrounded she was confused i dont know any gary and i have nothing to discuss with michaels then she caught sight of michael her voice stopped with a sharp intake of breath as she saw what he was holding she took an involuntary step backward and her jaw dropped about a foot were here to introduce you to your grandson gloria michael said gently taking a step forward to stand beside garrett gary richard lord was born last night and wed like to know what you intend to do about it she intended nothing not yet for a long long moment gloria couldnt speak at all she stood totally flummoxed while her hirelings came up behind her looking almost as confused as she was arent you going to invite us in garrett said at last he was sizing up the group before him and acknowledging michaels wisdom in setting this up last night hed thought it was stupid bringing four people to face this woman but one look at the thugs behind gloria and he knew that michael had done the right thing if he had come here on his own they could simply have relieved him of the baby and disappeared not now not with four of them lana and shelby had power dressed for the occasion and the lord siblings looked every bit as formidable as the thugs behind her ladyship the only way they could reach gary was to draw guns but then theyd be involved in a shootout with four us citizens no matter how desperate gloria was she wouldnt be that stupid so the thugs had nothing to do but stand aside gloria did the same and the four lordsand babyentered the suite without a protest it was like something out of a bad play garrett thought grimly but by the look on michaels face he knew this was deadly serious but there was no threat not now there was just one old ladys reaction to watch and so much depended on this jenny gave birth to your grandson this morning michael said softly and lana walked forward and lifted the covers from garys tiny face would you like to see i gloria looked as if every ounce of air had been sucked out of her suddenly she seemed olddefeated why should i because hes your grandson michael said because hes peters son and i assume you loved peter jennys called him gary richard richard is for your husband richard there was a sharp intake of breath i dont believe it what dont you believe michaels voice was quietly insistent and his eyes didnt leave her face everyone else had faded into insignificance now for michael there was only this woman in the room everything depended on the next few minutes his future his love for jenny no way could gloria realize that i cant look at him michael said and he took two steps forward so gary was almost touching glorias black cashmere cardigan she took a step backward then another she did look just like wallis simpson michael thought suddenly and wondered whether that was the image she aimed for a woman who swayed mens emotions look at your grandson michael said again and pressed gary forward as if he would entrust her to hold him gloria didnt take him but she did look down garys hair was so red michael thought ruefully and wondered for the sixtieth time whether it had been crazy to bring him here but dear god gloria said and her face crumpled as she saw the tiny child her hands flew to her cheeks and she stared while the icy mask of selfcontrol and vicious intent faded to nothing there was only awe richard had red hair she whispered finally my richard peters father michael frowned jenny hadnt said that it hit him with a pang last night jennys words had been like a gift to him if shed known the red hair came from her dead husbands family but gloria was shaking her head my richard she said again not peters father peters brother another silence the air was thick with it and suddenly shelby couldnt bear it hey i need a cup of tea here she told everyone loudly theres a kitchenette through here right you dont mind if i make one do you gloria ill make one for you too you english always want tea you twoi need help and before glorias hired men could say a word shed taken an arm apiece and marched them to the other room i know when im not wanted she told them as she propelled them forward ill bet you do too you look like the sort of guys that can take hints real well speaking of which garrett lana come and michael was left alone with his son and gloria and with the silence you want to hold him he asked and he proffered the baby as if he was the most precious thing in all the world you mean it she looked at him in disbelief i mean it if you want i dooh i do and gloria gathered gary into her arms and burst into tears how come michael asked when he figured gloria could speak again hed pushed her into an armchair and found a tissue or two to mop the flood how come i never got to hear about this richard about peters brother gloria looked at him then at gary she could scarcely keep her eyes from him peter didnt know about his brother she said no one did michael frowned i dont understand you want to run that past me again i had a baby before peter she whispered almost as if she was talking to herself in those dayswell a baby that hardly made it through the delivery was hushed up not spoken off especially in a family like ours he richard lived for a day and he was just perfect but then he died while i was asleep it was my first sleep after having him i went to sleep thinking i had the most beautiful little boy in the world and when i woke up theyd simply taken him away why because he was dead she said flatly and the bitterness was still there after all these long years so they took him i dont even know where they buried him never mind dear they said therell be another and i was expected to get on with it my mother burned everything every single baby thing start again she said she told me i shouldnt even think about him michael stared at her then looked at gary no his heart simply balked at the thought how would he feel now if that happened to gary how would jen bear it how must gloria have felt maybe the lady wasnt quite as bad as she was painted he thought a sick feeling churning his gut maybe there were reasons she acted the way she did so then you had peter he was my replacement baby she said bitterly everyone said that have another one to replace it it like replacing a broken cup so i did but he didntreplace him i mean the painit never went away no it wouldnt unaired and unacknowledged it had simply festered like a canker michael saw that as clearly as any psychologist would and he saw why peter could never have been satisfactory poor peter and now i have a grandson who looks like him glorias voice was choked i cant bear it what cant you bear she lifted her teardrenched face to his her mascara had run causing two black rivulets to stream down her wrinkled cheeks she was looking older by the minute i cant bear that i cant have him she whispered you can she stared youre saying youll give him to me an incredulous hope flared in the womans eyes extinguished almost as soon as it was lit of course i wont michael said flatly youre his grandma not his mother jennys his mother and to all intents and purposes im his father youll have to accept that as fact and we can go from there i dont know what you mean i mean youre giving no middle ground michael told her his voice gentle again you want him all or not at all but jenny doesnt want him to grow up without knowing you the woman looked at the sleeping baby and her face twisted in pain i cant believe that after the way youve treated jenny neither can i michael said frankly but this little boy has an english heritage he needs to learn about it you only want my money there is no way jenny or i will touch any money that has any connection with you michael told her flatly there was no joy to be gained in letting her think she had any control but if you want access youd let me have him parttime you could visit him here michael told her while jenny and i are present and if we were invited then maybe wed bring gary overstay awhile so gary could get to know what hes in for maybe a month or so every year what all of you the thought was clearly repulsive its all or nothing michael told her and he stooped and lifted the whitewrapped bundle from her arms and held him close jenny and gary and iwere a family you accept us all or you dont accept any of us thats the deal take it or leave it but thats the way it has to be i dont think about it before answering he said urgently think of what youre losing if you refuse jen wants to do thisfor peters sake there was no point in saying he hadnt mentioned this to jenny jennys staying here he handed her a card with megans address on it if you want go and see her and see if you can rebuild a few bridges before you lose everything im sorry but thats all i have to say to you think about it garrett lana shelby lets go and he whistled up his siblings and marched them out of the hotel room before she could say a word howd it go garrett asked curiously as the elevator doors closed behind them who knows michaels face was grim we heard what you said garrett grinned and shrugged there wasnt a lot of teamaking going on in the kitchenette there were five pairs of ears flapping so hard theyd almost have powered the kettle on their own its true she loses everything if she doesnt agree the only catch to that michael said grimly is so do i you have a visitor jenny laid down her correspondence half the world seemed to have sent her cards and baby gifts she looked up as megan peeped into the room youre not asleep megan exclaimed heavens child you know those were doctors orders sleep sleep and more sleep for the next few days im fit as a flea jenny said soundly if i didnt think michael would fuss more than you id be out of here in a minute she smiled to take any offence from her words and megan smiled back but megan knew enough to sense why jenny had agreed to stay this gave her a few more days of time out away from michael so are you up to visitors i said i thought you were asleep so you have a readymade excuse no its fine but who i think you might have to see for yourself megan told her and whisked herself out of question range two minutes later she ushered gloria in and closed the door behind her the last few times jenny had seen gloria all shed felt was fear as it was her hands went down to clasp gary who was sleeping tucked into the bedclothes at her side she lifted him and held him against her breast in the ageold gesture of a mother protecting her young gloria sawand she winced my dear that was a change gloria had only ever addressed her with silkysmooth disdain or vindictive dislike jennys eyes widened and she suspected a trap gloria sighed she didnt attempt to approach the bed just regally took a seat on the chair carefully smoothing her tailored black skirt over her silk stockings theres no threat to you from me she said softly your husband brought me here hes waiting outside to drive me back to my hotel and tonight im returning to england michael brought you here he did the older womans face creased into a tired smile he came to see me a few days back to introduce my grandson his son hes quite a young man your husband iyes there was no answer to that one jenny was poleaxed i came to agree to his proposal and to ask that you accept mine she said i dont understand how on earth had she gotten her voice to work it was beyond her michael told me you wouldnt gloria went on and then paused i can see i need to explain for the first time her voice faltered she took a long look at the baby in jennys arms then she closed her eyes and took a deep breath i intend to start at the beginning if youll listen so while jenny lay back in stunned silence gloria told her what shed told michael she told her story calmly and rationally without any of the pain michael had heard but there was no way jenny could miss the suffering behind the words and when she fell silent there was a much different feeling in jennys heart from the fear that had been her first reaction to this visit oh maam no gloria said strongly not maam i should never have made you use that my name is gloria i know ive never let you use it but i wish it now if you will what im sayingwhat im telling you is not an excuse for what ive done i dont have one i was hurt so i hurt everyone around me for such a long time ive done much damage and i cant undo it it wasnt until i saw your baby that i realized ive poisoned most things all id like to do now is try to salvage something from the mess for peters memory and for richards she paused but then held out her hand to stop jenny from interrupting the gesture was imperious gloria might be sincerely sorry but the noble blood in her family background had bred a haughtiness she probably wasnt even aware of herself i would very much like to keep in contact with you all she said firmly not just with my grandson but with you and with your husband too and with any children who might follow with that in mind id like to write ill write once a week and theres no need for you to write back photographs will suffice ill pay for any postage and processing id also like very much to be present at garys christening but if thats not acceptable then ill understand she paused and she finally took her eyes from the baby and looked at jenny the haughtiness faded your husband says hell pay for an extended holiday in britain each year but ill fight him on that one ill do the paying she almost sounded humble it would be my honormy absolute privilegeto have you all stay in my home as you know the estate is huge its my sorrow and shame you were never invited there while you were married to peter but we have guest apartments to spare come and bring as many friends as you want make it your home youryour home away from home and at the end of our stay jenny asked her voice hushed in shock at what she was hearing youd let us go again if i cant bear to let go then ill lose you completely gloria whispered and it was as much as jenny could do to hear her i dont think i could bear that ive been so stupid ive lost so much already chapter fifteen michael didnt come near her after that he must have waited outside taken gloria to her hotel and then returned to maitland maternity for the next couple of hours jenny lay in baffled bewilderment going over the events of the last few hours in her mind michael had gone to see gloria michael had taken gary to see her why and she knew she knew where was he why didnt he come as the afternoon wore on so did jennys patience finally at five oclock shelby bounced in to see her having given socks his daily constitutional socks led the way towing shelby and both dog and woman stopped in astonishment at the sight of jenny dressedin her gorgeous golden dressand packing her bags where shelby said carefully are you thinking of going home jenny told her its time does megan know megans right behind her megan came into the bedroom carrying a pile of clean diapers of course i know like jenny says its time an hour later michael came home from work to dump the paperwork he had to do that evening before heading around to megans to see jenny when he arrived he found his wife and his son and his dog sitting before the living room fire waiting for him jen michael to any onlooker it would appear to be a normal evening after work gary was fast asleep in his infant seat by the fire jenny looked placidly at her husband as socks bounded over to greet him welcome home but michael didnt feel normal he put socks aside with a halfhearted pat and focused on his wife why are you here waiting for my husband to return she smiled at him like a good and dutiful wife socks go fetch your masters slippers socks gave a goofy grin and just sat there jenny sighed rats some things will never change sorry michael you dont seem to have a docile dog will a docile wife do michael had stopped at the door now he felt as if hed stopped breathing the world seemed to stand still waiting i dont think id know what a docile wife was he said carefully and she smiled that gorgeous blindingly brilliant smile of hers and rose and came over to him she was wearing her wonderful dress he thought dazed she was looking just just too desirable for words michael thank you she said softly and she caught his hands the faint scent of her perfume drifted into his orbit thank you for seeing gloria she said simply and then she took a deep breath and by doing somaking it possible for me to move forward to bury peter it means you can go home he said and his voice sounded harsh even to him the way gloria is given some castiron guarantees id imagine you could go back to england she wont threaten you now why would i go back to england its your home home is where the heart is she said softly and her hands held his they were smooth against the roughness of his male skin and it was all he could do not to pull her forward and gather her into his arms it was more than a body could stand but he must still he held himself rigid waiting youve grown attached he said trying to keep the sudden burgeoning of hope from surging into something he couldnt control i guess she tilted her chin and met his look with the cleareyed gaze he loved so much you guess right i have to socks to lana and shelby and megan yep and to this place maybe he looked at the fire its a good place to live the white furniture has to go the white furniture can go hell he sounded like a zombie you just say the word michael mmm were talking around the point here she hesitated all the courage she had deserted her but he needed to know she had to say it and the point is there was a long long silence he didnt take his eyes from hers and their gazes linked and held then suddenly jenny had all the courage she needed right there in her heart all the courage she needed was written plain on his face she only had to reach out and take it from him use it herself hed done so much for her hed committed himself so far it wouldnt hurt her to take this one last step of trust i couldnt bear to go back to england michael lord she whispered and you want to know why not i yes it came out a gravelly croak and brought a smile to her lovely eyes she stood on tiptoes and she kissed him ever so lightly on the mouth and still he stood motionless because i love you you great ninny she scolded i think i have for months but i couldnt admit it even to myself but now now youve unlocked the chains and you are my own darling husband and i have fallen so in love with you that i cant bear to think of leaving your side for a moment ever and im sorry if you cant bear to be hemmed in and domesticated but you did say you were in love with me and thats what you get when you michael the last word was a squeak as she was swept off the floor and spun around the room with a great shout of joyous laughter michael what she stared into his laughing triumphant eyes as he spun her still what my love put me down this instant she demanded i have more to say im not putting you down ill sic the dog onto you yeah right he spun her again really jenny you really love me how can i know what i feel when im so dizzy she asked her gorgeous dress flaring as he spun her around and around michael put me down and he did but it was no help at all when he whirled her around she was dizzy but when he set her down he began to kiss her and her world tilted so crazily she knew shed never be in control of it again a knock drove them apart in fact it was the fourth knock that did it or maybe even the fifth it was hard to be sure when one set of ears was asleep two sets heard nothing and even socks was too interested in the proceedings to worry about a small thing like visitors but finally socks noticed barked his dire warnings and drew their reluctant attention to the intrusion were not home michael said but jenny chuckled and pushed herself away to go open the door itll be your familyand i love your family almost as much as i love you she said serenely so learn to share yes maam it wasnt his family it was the suits michael groaned is anything wrong sir once again these were different officials and michael recognized neither of them the older one was a woman in neat black the younger a string bean of a male with a large protruding adams apple they walked in as jenny stood aside and they looked around the living room as if they were inspecting for termites dont tell me michael said youre from immigration and are here to kick jenny out of the country gloria changed her mind im sorry the womandelia according to her name tagset her briefcase down with a definite thump i dont know any gloria but yes were here to do a check on your wifes immigration there was an order that said as soon as the babys birth was registered we needed to make a followup visit that figures gloria had insisted on as much and she wouldnt have been able to rescind a request like that oh well the officials had driven jenny to him in the first place he could afford to be civil he could afford to be nice to anyone right at this minute he decided because jenny was still looking at him with hungry eyes and he had a whole lifetime to get to know how to appease that look okay lets do it he said firmly and reached for jennys hand we really just need to check that your wife and child are home now and well make an interview time later the woman said startled i gather the babys not very old five days do it now do it lets get this over with michaels arm came around his wife and held her close we have better things to do than answer questions like consolidate our marriage and consolidate and consolidate and consolidate for the next fifty years in the end it was a weirdly intimate affirmation of their marriage when did you meet delia asked while her associate tried to look efficient as an immigration officer he made a very good onlooker at work jenny said but she was hushed by her husband he held her tight and grinned nope jen they dont want to hear that they want the real story real story there was this slipper he said promptly turning confidentially to the astonished delia made of glass gorgeous it was who could resist a slipper like thator the girl who was wearing it its taken me ages to find her he turned to look at jenny and the smile in his eyes lit her from the toes up excuse me but i just have he said softly if you two will turn the other way this is serious delia snapped while the string bean goggled so are we michael didnt even bother looking at her he had eyes only for jenny this is the first evening weve been together as a family he explained i have everyone right where i want them to be my wife my son my dog if you knew the trouble ive had with that darned slipper the dog wont fetch it like hes supposed to jenny explained joining in with a giggle the bother of slippers to say nothing about pumpkins whew pumpkins were nearly the end of our marriage do you know my husband expects me to make pumpkin pies i wont of course thats my best carriage hes expecting me to cook then she faltered turning laughing eyes to michael whoops maybe that was the wrong thing to say if i refuse to make pumpkin pies does that mean i cant be a us citizen just answer the questions please delia said a trifle desperately and michael gave dates and times and places with such aplomb that jenny could only stare it was as if he really had been planning to marry her from the very start are you married michael demanded as delia paused for breath on page six of her prepared questionnaire yes i what does your husband drink for morning break when hes at work i the woman stared thats hardly relevant yes its relevant what does he drink coffee i guess she said doubtfully and her partner coughed actually mrs lavorn stewart always has soda water and a mud cake he said apologetically and cast an embarrassed glance at michael mr lavorn works in my department ha michael shook his head hell have to be deported what delia cried if you really loved him youd notice michael said solemnly i watched jen drink chocolate milk every day for six months i loved her then and i love her now he smiled and took both her hands i love the way that curl just twists a little bit across her forehead and bounces and the fact that she sleeps with her hand curled under her cheek like a child and she sneezes three times every morning and he eats his cereal straight from the box when he thinks im not watching jenny said with loving severity i do not you do too i caught you she said triumphantly just because socks cleaned up the dropped evidence you figured id never know and yet you love me there was real wonder in his voice the laughter died and yet i love you she whispered of course i do oh michael my love how could i not harrumph said delia and her partner cleared his throat they didnt notice i love you too michael murmured into her hair hed pulled her close to him against his heart right where he intended to hold her for all time jenny my love i love you now and i love you forever and forever and forever i think we might go delia managed to interrupt and there was a glimmer of a tear in her authoritarian eyes i think we have enough to satisfy our needs if youll excuse us her partner muttered apologetically but there was no need for any excuse they left and michael and jenny and gary and socks didnt even notice their departure epilogue the maitland newsletter lay open on the hospice coverlet stunned leeann larrimore let it fall as she turned to gaze out the window at the city of austin somewhere out there were her children her loved ones garrett and lana and michael and shelby would they ever come to see her did they want to make contact she couldnt presume shed never interfere in their lives she told herself bleakly shed forfeited that right all those years ago but on the page shed been reading was a small black and white photograph that made her heart turn over the picture was of a man and a woman the woman was holding a child newly born she was looking serene her face radiating happiness and the man the pride and the love in the mans eyes were there for all to see michael lord head of security at maitland maternity and his wife jenny proudly announce the birth of their son gary richard lord gary did they know what weird stroke of fate had made them choose gary as their sons name gary leeann whispered and the echo of a longlost love filtered into the room bringing with it the first vestige of comfort shed had for a very long time my gary it mustnt be coincidence they must knowand in spite of everything theyd forgiven her please she lay back on her pillows and felt the first faint stirrings of strength maybe she could live a little longer maybe she could wait because her children were coming please marion lennox marion lennox was born on an australian dairy farm she moved onmostly because the cows werent interested in
