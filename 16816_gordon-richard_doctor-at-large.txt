richard gordon doctor at large first published in all characters institutions and incidents are fictitious qualifying as a doctor is an experience as exciting for a young man as first falling in love and for a while produces much the same addling effects before my own new diploma had uncurled from its cardboard wrapper i was prancing through the streets hoping every pretty girl in sight would be seized with a fit of fainting and longing at each crossroads for a serious accident i scattered prescriptions like snowflakes and squandered my now precious opinion on relatives friends and even people not looking very well who happened to sit opposite me in railway trains i frequently started conversations with speaking as a medical man and an appeal for a doctor in a theatre would have brought me from my seat like a kangaroo after six years as a suppressed medical student this sudden importance was intoxicating and was refreshed every morning with thick envelopes pouring through a letterbox which had previously breakfasted only on slim bills and orange packets from the football pools the drug manufacturers pressed me with free samples diaries the size of hymnbooks and sufficient blotters to soak up the serpentine shops in wigmore street offered to sell me clinical equipment from brass doorplates to xray machines societies opposed to vivisection smoking meateating blood sports socialism and birth control jostled on the breakfast table for my support the bank that a week ago echoed my footsteps like a police court begged to advance me money safeguard my valuables and execute my will even the british medical association officially recognized my existence by sending a free sixteenpage booklet on ethics and members of the medical profession advising me henceforward to live a pure and moral life and not associate with unqualified midwives unfortunately both young doctors and young lovers soon descend from their rosy clouds on to the spiky realities of life at the age of twentyfour i had to look for my first job like a prospective office boy out of school the quest was a serious one for today even those students whose most thoughtful work in the lectureroom is carving their names on the benches are determined to become specialists there seems no point in being anything else when it is common knowledge in medical schools that general practitioners under the national health service are all seedy men signing forms in insanitary surgeries until they drop dead at forty through overwork long before qualifying i had decided to become a surgeon i had rather fancied myself cutting up the dogfish frogs and rabbits in the firstyear zoology class and thought the principle was probably the same further up the evolutionary tree once i had passed my finals the only problem seemed to be finding the smoothest channel for pouring my surgical energies upon the public my own hospital st swithins did not foster its sons beyond inviting them to the annual reunion dinner at two guineas a head exclusive of wines but i remembered that outside the medical school office hung a secretive notice in faded copperplate behind speckled glass saying newly qualified men should consult the secretary who will advise them on their careers few graduates obeyed the invitation for the office was established in the students eyes as a magistrates court which could give summary punishment for minor offences and refer promising cases to the more powerful majesty of the dean next door the secretary himself was a shrivelled old man with pincenez on a thick black ribbon who must have been the last person in london to wear elasticsided boots and he sat surrounded by piles of dusty official papers growing slowly from the floor like stalagmites he suggested that i become a medical officer in the regular army this advice was depressing because i knew that he was an oldfashioned man who suggested the army only to graduates he thought unfit to attend ordinary human beings although i had won no distinctions scholarships or prizes at st swithins i boldly asked the secretary to enter me for one of the house surgeons jobs for these were well known among the students to be distributed in the same sporting spirit that enlivened the rest of the medical school they were awarded by the hospital consultants sitting in committee and represented their last chance of getting their own back on students they disliked youths who had sat on the front bench at lectures and asked intelligent questions to which they already knew the answers were turned down so were earnest young men in open necks and sandals who passed round the new statesman and held intense little meetings in corners of the common room on the conscience of the doctor in a capitalist society another advantage to an applicant like myself was the consultants habit of always voting against the favourites of colleagues they disliked a surgeon with the overwhelming personality of sir lancelot spratt had condemned several dozen promising physicians to start their careers in provincial hospitals because the professor of medicine had once refused to let him park his rolls in the shade of the medical laboratory i fear you are letting your recent qualification unbalance you somewhat the secretary told me there are over eightythree thousand practitioners on the british register so you have added less than one eightythird thousandth to the medical strength of the country if not the army how about the colonial service but st swithins showed extravagant confidence in its educational ability and the next afternoon i was appointed junior casualty house surgeon to the professor of surgery they wont allow you to go cutting up real live people for a bit said my landlady with satisfaction while i was excitedly doing my packing they used to let the learners do the poor people who couldnt afford to pay but the governments gone and stopped all that with the national health service i am perfectly entitled to go cutting up whoever i like now im qualified i told her with dignity naturally one starts in a small way like in everything else bumps ganglions and cysts you knowyou work your way up through varicose veins and hernias but after your first appendix its more or less plain sailing she sniffed i certainly wouldnt want you to go cutting up anyone belonging to me i must ask you to remember please that i happen to be a doctor now not a medical student well theres twelve and six to pay doctor for the breakages the casualty job was admittedly one of the lowliest in the hospital coming ahead in academic status only to an obscure appointment known as skins and vd it was performed in the casualtyroom which was really nothing more than a dressingstation in the battle between londons drivers and pedestrians and its clinical responsibilities could have been undertaken by any confident member of st john ambulance brigade these thoughts did not occur to me as i crossed the hospital quadrangle the next day to start work the subaltern joining his first regiment sees only his promotion to colonel the new clerk plans his managerial reorganization and even the freshlyordained clergyman probably spares a thought for the suitability of his calves for gaiters at the time the end of my career was clearer to me than the beginning i saw myself already rising through the profession to become a consultant surgeon at st swithins itself collecting on the way honours fellowships and degrees like a magnet in a box of iron filings i say someone called across the courtyard as i strode in my new stiff white coat towards the casualty entrance i say old man half a jiff i turned and recognized the first obstacle in my professional path it was bingham the other junior casualty house surgeon he was a pale youth with thick spectacles and bushy hair who still looked seventeen and always had boils as a student he was never a frontbench squatter but he had once won the deans prize in applied anatomy and thereafter always walked through the students quarters with the lancet sticking from his pocket like a flag and a couple of large books under his arm every lunch hour he carried these books to the library where he ate his cheese sandwiches and removed from the reference volumes dust which he transferred during the afternoon to the instructive abdomens of patients in the wards every saturday when the library closed he moved to the surgical pathology museum where patients organs were stored away in thick glass jars on shelves like left luggage and carried his books round the galleries instead bingham seemed to absorb a good deal of knowledge from the armpit im jolly pleased you got the other cas job old chap he said grabbing my sleeve i wondered who itd go to could have been deuced tricky suppose theyd given it to some awful stinker see what i mean but well get along tophole together wont we yes were pretty well bound to i suppose i say he went on enthusiastically this is a lark isnt it whats a lark being qualified and all that i mean now we can get on with things properly ive got a couple of septic fingers a lipoma and four circs lined up for minor ops already he rubbed his hands as if contemplating a good dinner the prof stuck his nose in and said i was pretty quick off the mark by the way old chap he asked why you werent there but why should i have been there i asked in surprise the job only starts today surely yes but from midnight last night or something old chap technical point didnt you know the last hs has cleared off anyway i told the prof you were really quite a reliable sort of fellow and even if you were a bit prone to nip off for long weekends youd be back in a few days i said id willingly cope with the extra work in the meantime i looked at bingham coldly and what may i ask did the professor say to all that nothing old chap he just sort of snorted and went off i see this was a bad start before i could seriously begin my career i would have to win promotion to senior house surgeon and work in the wards themselves under the professor of surgery the appointment would be made after we had finished three months work in casualtyand only one of us could be chosen the reject would be turned out in his medical infancy to wail on some other hospitals doorstep i say old chap bingham continued as we walked along you simply must nip up to the ward after supper and have a dekko at some wizard pancreatic cysts theres a wonderful perf up there toopretty sick you know but i think hell last till weve had a squint at him bingham had the true surgeons mentality for it never occurred to him that interesting signs and symptoms were attached to human beings theres a kid with a smashing ductus too murmur as loud as a bus could hardly take my bally stethoscope away i thought casualty house surgeons werent supposed to go into the wards no really old chap but i told the prof i was working for fellowship already and he said i could nose round as much as i liked i expect itll be all right for you to come too as long as youre with me i began to hate bingham before we first crossed the threshold of our common workplace the casualtyroom at st swithins was not likely to fire in any young man the inspiration to be a second louis pasteur or astley cooper it was a long tiled semibasement place lit by small windows high in the walls smelling strongly of carbolic and always crowded like a public lavatory at a busy crossroads as st swithins had to find money to buy all the latest antibiotics and isotopes it saw no point in spending it on a department where the therapeutic technique had hardly changed since its patients were brought on shutters from beneath the wheels of hansom cabs everything in casualty was old there were old horsehair examination couches sagging screens of old sacking dull old instruments battered old dressing drums and steamy old sterilizers even the porter was past retiring age and all the nurses seemed to be old ladies as we entered the rows of old wooden benches were already filled with peopleonequarter men and a quarter each women children and policemen there were policemen everywhere as thick as tomcats in a fish market they stood in the corners holding their helmets they hid behind the screens with open notebooks they drank pints of free tea solemnly round the sterilizer they peered across stretchers and requested eternal particulars policemen are inseparable from casualty surgery and it was well known at st swithins that anyone falling over in the district and not getting up damn quickly was immediately seized by the police and enthusiastically borne into the casualtyroom i sat down at an old desk in one end of the room which held a large brass inkpot and a pile of different coloured forms my job was simple i handed one of these forms to any patient who i felt was beyond my own professional ability and thankfully disposed of him for ever into some inner department of the hospital as my only postgraduate guidance from st swithins was a leaflet on what to do in case of fire and another describing the most fruitful way of asking relatives for a postmortem i was at first worried about matching the correct form to the case fortunately the old porter had long ago accepted the responsibility of running casualty himself and tactfully brought me the right document to sign after selecting it with the infallible diagnostic instinct of a st swithins employee the casualtyroom never emptied before evening and for a week i was too busy even to notice bingham we met professionally only once a day at the noon interlude in the clinical roughandtumble known as minor ops this was for surgery too lowly for the main operating theatres and was performed by bingham and myself in an undignified theatre made by a partitioned corner of the casualtyroom containing a galvanizediron operating table an edwardian dentalchair decorated with gilt fleurs de lys and a small anaesthetic apparatus on which some former house surgeon had written property of the gas fight and choke company although we made our incisions with scapels that would have been hurled to the floor in the main theatre and probably had been it was minor ops that made the casualty job tolerable as newlyqualified prospective surgeons both of us had the same enthusiasm for the knife as the committee of public safety for the guillotine i shortly became aware that bingham always had far more cases waiting on the benches outside minor ops than i did as we took alternate patients coming through the casualtydoor i envied his luck until i discovered that he had the habit of stopping people he saw in the street with promising boils warts moles or cysts handing them his card and telling them to come to the casualtyroom of st swithins at midday and ask specifically for himself this brought him a brisk practice of taxi drivers railway porters bus conductors teashop waitresses newsvendors and roadmenders and he not only removed the lump and others found by a more searching examination than was possible in public but usually pulled out their ingrowing toenails and extracted their bad teeth as well this unsporting approach to surgery so annoyed me that one morning when bingham was out of the casualtyroom i felt justified in harvesting some of his crop myself i was halfway through removing under local anaesthetic an interesting sebaceous cyst on the nose of an underground ticket collector when bingham burst into the theatre i say he started his white coat flapping furiously that cysts bally well mine i looked at him over my mask oh is it i said in surprise i thought youd gone to lunch lunch have you ever known me go to lunch during minor ops of course i wasnt at lunch you chump i was having a dekko at a pmjolly interesting ruptured kidneyand having a chat about it with the prof if you must know well theres plenty more i said picking up the cyst in a pair of forceps ill be finished in five minutes that isnt the bally point he went on crossly the fact is old chap i particularly wanted to do that cyst ive been looking forward to it all morning and i might add its pretty unethical to pinch another chaps patients old chap its also pretty unethical for a chap to go round the streets of london touting for custom he blushed for a few seconds he said nothing i dont think i like your tone old chap he muttered and i dont ruddy well care if you dont the patient now alarmed that his medical advisers were about to come to blows over his body reminded them of their obligations with a noise through the sterile towels like the neigh of a dying horse ill report you to the prof bingham hissed and swept out he revenged himself immediately by directing all the old chronics to my desk these patients were a human sludge in the machinery of st swithins of which it could never rid itself they appeared regularly with notes as large as the score of a symphony on which the words rep mist were scrawled in the writing of twenty successive house surgeons these abbreviations entitled them to another bottle of medicine the original purpose of which was generally forgotten and the original prescriber probably dead the old chronics that morning seemed unending as they shifted slowly up the benches towards me by two oclock there were still a dozen left i hadnt had my lunch and i was in a bad temper then i noticed a patient queue jumping he was a shiftylooking elderly man dressed in a shabby black coat and striped trousers he had sneaked down the room and sat himself on the edge of the foremost bench he held the finger of one hand in a bloodstained handkerchief and he still wore his black homburg hat i knew his type well we often saw head clerks and managers from surrounding offices who carried their selfimportance on to the equalizing benches of the casualtyroom and we were encouraged by the professor to stop it one minute missus i told a fat woman with some obscure but ancient condition of the feet now look here daddy i began sharply crossing to the interloper whats the meaning of this he looked up at me in alarm yes i saw you i went on sternly thought you were being clever didnt you sneaking up the side like that you ought to be ashamed of yourself you wont bleed to death with that little cut and theres plenty of people in the room more seriously injured than you wheres your treatment card anyway card iim very sorry butwhat card cant you read daddy i asked in despair theres a notice the size of marble arch inside the door it says all patients must ask the clerk for a treatment card so hop off and get one im sorry i didnt think run along daddy i said waving him away i returned to the ladys feet feeling in a better temper already medical pomposity is an invigorating draught to a young doctor within a few minutes the man had returned with his card now he started hovering round the back of my chair for a while i pretended to ignore him then i turned round and demanded angrily what the devils the matter with you now daddy why cant you go to the end of the queue like everyone else yes but you see i am in rather a hurry so is everybody else so am i if it comes to that now get back to the last bench perhaps i should explain im not in the slightest interested if you dont jump to it ill get you shifted by one of the policemen his mouth opened in horror i congratulated myselfi had judged my man shrewdly a fellow of his type would be frightened by such an indignity really i must say doctor its a most now stop arguing you cant chuck your weight around as usual in here and for gods sake daddy take your blasted hat off what on earths going on here i spun round and found the professor looking down at me i had hardly spoken to him before because he was far too occupied with the higher problems of academic surgery to worry about the poultices and fingerstalls of the casualtyroom he was a chilly scientific man with a gravelly voice and a long nose and chin like mr punch he had only once been known to laugh the day sir lancelot spratt arrived at the hospital in a brandnew plumcoloured rolls and was rammed by an ambulance in the courtyard in front of all his students this patient sir i began are you in some sort of trouble charles the professor asked yes i am this young man here has been behaving extremely rudely the professor looked at me as if i were one of the rats in his laboratory developing an interesting disease perhaps i had better introduce my friend mr justice hopcroft he said slowly he unfortunately happened to cut his hand while we were lunching at my club i have been collecting some instruments to suture it i stared at him in silence i felt the casualtyroom was revolving round me at high speed what did you say your name was its slipped my mind since making the appointment gordon sir i croaked gordon eh the professor grunted and nodded his head several times shaking it well into his memory what name demanded mr justice hopcroft staring hard into my face i repeated it he grunted too gordon yes gordon ill remember that as they disappeared into minor ops it not only seemed likely that i wouldnt retain my job but that my first brush with the law would land me in dartmoor for life for the next few weeks i read with equal anxiety the opinions that the professor expressed in his casenotes on my diagnoses and those that mr justice hopcroft expressed in court on the characters of his convicted criminals bingham now smirked every time he spoke to me and had become intolerable he was a bad case of the seasonal disease that struck the medical school known as diplomatosis which was characterized by delusions of grandeur and loss of memory for recent events he had thrown away his ignominious short students jacket and appeared everywhere in a long white coat which he reluctantly removed only for meals his stethoscope which he had never carried secretly now sprouted from his head as proudly as the horns of a rutting deer he hurried round the hospital with jerky urgent strides which implied that consultations of the gravest aspect waited round every corner he addressed patients relatives and junior probationers like a victorian practitioner breaking bad news and the responsibilities of qualification left him too preoccupied to recognize the faces of fellowstudents who had been less fortunate with the examiners i thought binghams most irritating performance was in the lift as well as the wide lifts for stretchers st swithins provided for the staff a small creaking cage that usually had a worn notice on the gate saying out of order which was traditionally forbidden the students bingham now used this lift even to descend between adjoining floors he was particularly careful to summon it when walking along the corridor with a crowd of students and would wait for them to arrive breathless upstairs jolly convenient the old lift he said to me one morning cant understand how we used to manage without it i was not left much time to brood on him for either the drivers and pedestrians of london were becoming more careless or i was becoming less efficient the patients in the casualtyroom never thinned until suppertime and i often had to go without my lunch as well i say old chap be began late one evening as the benches were at last clearing how about buzzing up to the ward and having a quiz round some cases theres an absolutely tophole pyelonephrosis and a retroperitoneal abscess side by sidebet you half a dollar you cant spot which is which no thanks i said as a matter of fact im fed up at looking at suffering humanity for a bit im going out for a pint forgive me for saying so old man but its hardly the way to get through the fellowship is it i dont care a monkeys damn for the bloody fellowship at the moment my feet hurt ive got a headache i want my supper and im thirsty yes cas is a bit of a bind ill be glad to get out of it next month and start proper surgery in the wards i looked him in the eye i will remind you that the post of senior house surgeon will go to only one of us he smirked of course old man i was sort of forgetting for a minute best man win and all that eh exactly bingham another fortnight went by and i began to hope that the hopcroft affair might be forgotten by a busy man carrying the responsibilities of a surgical chair then one afternoon the professor appeared in casualty he stood before my desk looking at me with the same stare of scientific interest and holding in his hand a patients treatment card did you write this he asked i looked at it it was directed to the surgical registrar a genial young specialist with whom i had played rugger and drunk beer and who disliked bingham almost as much as he did the fellowship examiners the card asked for his opinion on a suspected orthopaedic case but in the stress of casualty i had scribbled only three words please xray fracture now i remembered with alarm that the registrar had the afternoon off to visit the royal society of medicine and the professor was taking over his work yes sir i admitted have he snapped isnt he turned on his heel and disappeared bingham said eagerly a few days later the prof was talking about you this morning old man oh yes id nipped into the theatre to have a dekko at him doing an adrenalectomy and he asked if i knew what school you went to i told him i couldnt say offhand then he made a most surprising remark old chaphe thought it was probably one of those progressive ones where the kids learn all about selfexpression and bash the teachers over the head with rulers but are never taught to read or write i suppose you didnt really go to a place like that did you as a matter of fact i did we never learnt to read write do arithmetic play cricket or swap marbles but at least we were brought up not to go around kissing the backsides of people we wanted to get jobs from bingham stiffened i might say thats an extremely offensive remark old chap i might say that i meant it to be old chap my ambition to be a surgeon now burned low but it was not extinguished until the week before my casualty job was to end bingham and i lived on the top floor of the resident medical staff quarters at st swithins a tall gloomy building containing a couple of dozen bleak bedsitters and a diningroom enlivened by a battered piano and a picture of sir william osler gazing at us chidingly down his sad moustaches on the table was a collectingbox in which anyone talking shop at supper had to drop half a crown this was labelled fund for the blind and underneath in smaller letters and what a blind every six months when half the house surgeons left this box was broached as the professors retiring house surgeon had also passed his fellowship found a new job and become engaged on the same day he asked me to take his night duty for him i was delighted because it showed i was capable of accepting higher surgical responsibilities also it made bingham furious there was usually a trickle of emergency cases entering st swithins during the night but that evening i was disappointed to find that the admissionroom inside the gate was quiet about midnight i went to sleep leaving hamilton baileys emergency surgery beside my bed and my trousers hopefully receptive on the chair i dreamed that i was in casualty operating with a soup spoon on binghams double hernias without an anaesthetic and i woke with a start to the porters knock what is it in a second i was scrambling out of bed switching on the light and jumping into my shoes whats the time arf past three case of intermittent abdominal pain getting worse over last three days mostly subumbilical really does the patient look very ill nah came in a taxi i immediately felt sorry it looked as though i would not have the chance of assisting at an emergency operation the porter stood picking his teeth while i pulled a sweater over my pyjamas gallstone colic i reckon it is he said i made my way downstairs through the cold empty black halls of the outpatients department it was a bitter night outside with sleet falling heavily and freezing immediately on the pavement there was no one in sight except a porter sweeping in the distance in the thin light of a lonely bulb i suddenly felt that i was the only doctor in the world i found the patient sitting under a blanket on an examination couch he was a thin neatlooking man in a blue suit and a white collar with a small moustache carefullybrushed hair and hornrimmed spectacles he looked worried but unfortunately not like an immediate candidate for the operating table well now whats the matter i began as briskly as possible im extremely sorry to have troubled you doctor extremely sorry indeed he spoke quietly with a faint cockney accent i have took you away from your no doubt wellearned repose i apologize doctor and ask your forgiveness for that which i have done thats quite all right its what im here for i said to myself as i came in the doctor is now no doubt reclining in the arms of morpheus he is sleeping the sleep of whats the matter with you please i interrupted he suddenly clutched his abdomen with both hands and groaned abdominal pain i said flicking the pages of my surgical textbook through my mind colicky no doubt any relation to food he relaxed looked round and whispered are we alone doctor alone i assure you professional confidences will not be divulged youre the professors house surgeon aint you doctor i nodded well doctor its like this here the professor operated on me six months agopartial gastrectomy up in faith ward all was well doctor until three days ago then i began to have pains he groaned as another spasm caught him something shocking doctor tonight after a bite of supper i coughed and found something hard in my throat he glanced over his shoulder again and whispered it was a nut doctor you mean youd been eating nuts no no doctor i mean a metal nut then five minutes later i produced a screw and after that two more nuts and a bit of spring ive been bringing up bits of old iron all night doctor so i thought id better come along here but dash it man thats almost impossible are you sure look doctor he said proudly from his pocket he pulled a screwedup piece of the evening news which held several bright nuts and bolts and a small coiled spring we looked at them solemnly our eyes lifted and met i licked my lips they could have come from a surgical retractor i murmured he nodded thats what i thought doctor he went on in a low voice i know see used to be in the ramc come to think of it after my operation i heard a sort of rumour something might be missing let me have a look at your stomach i said there was a gastrectomy scar about six months old umm i said i scratched my head i looked up and down the room there was no one in sight even bingham would have been welcome this might be serious i suggested thats why i came in doctor he continued calmly mind im not one of them people that makes trouble with law courts and that but if anything happenedwell ive got a lot of relatives doctor quite i covered him with the blanket and began to walk round the couch slowly the hospital rules were clear all serious cases at night were to be referred immediately to a consultant and if the professor had somehow managed to leave a springloaded retractor inside an abdomen he certainly would want to know of it before anyone else i think well hang on for a bit i said by eight oclock i can get your notes from the registry and organize proper xrays he grabbed his stomach violently something else doctor he cried coming up the professor had a wimbledon number and after ringing a long time the telephone was answered by a cross female voice yes could i speak to the professor please whos there st swithins oh dear oh dear dont you ever leave the poor man in peace arthur when the professor reached the telephone which seemed to be several minutes walk from his bed i began im terribly sorry to bother you sir this is the house surgeon rogers erno not rogers sir gordon i heard him draw his breath wheres rogers hes out for the night sir i felt this was truthful as i had seen him carried to bed i steadfastly gave the professor a brief clinical history of the case its perfectly possible i suppose he admitted i could tell that he was worried i cant remember the case offhand but six months ago i certainly had a new theatre sisteryoure sure its bits of a retractor oh definitely sir there was a pause very well he decided grudgingly ill drive in the lord only knows how ill manage it this weather admit him to faith and get the theatre ready for an emergency laparotomy yes sir ander gordon sir it was quite right of you to phone me thank you sir i said in delight but he had already rung off i spent the next half hour organizing the operation i woke the theatre sister and her staff brought the night sisters and porters from their suppers and ordered the night nurses on faith ward to prepare a bed with hotwater bottles and electric blankets then i went back to the patient who was now lying quietly on the couch dont worry old man i said heartily slapping him on the shoulder everythings under control i glanced at my watch the professor will be here any moment and hell fix you up in no time thank you doctor he said with a sigh of gratitude he took my hand touchingly im real pleased with the way youve looked after me doctor oh its nothing just part of the service no honest i am doctor real pleased mind you ive got a soft spot for doctors especially young doctors trying to get on in the world like you thats very kind of you as a matter of fact doctor he said more cheerfully id like to meet you again when all this is over socially you know perhaps we will i said with an indulgent smile who knows id like you to come and stay with me for a weekend ive got quite a nice little place in the country down by the river its an old castle i picked up cheap theres a bit of shooting and fishing if you care for it private golf links of course so bring your clubs along doctor if you play i dont think i quite tell you what ill do ill send the rolls for you on the friday afternoon the chauffeur can pick you up here you cant miss it its solid gold all the way through even the pistonrings just looking at me now doctor he said proudly you wouldnt think i owned the bank of england would you i met bingham in the lift hello old chap he grinned sorry you didnt get the senior hs job and all that yes im sorry too you had hard cheese rather old chap didnt you about that loony i mean you ought to have had him xrayed before calling the prof or asked patients occupation as your first question id have done i suppose i ought now youre going to look for a job in the provinces arent you theres some jolly good hospitals outside london so they tell me not up to st swithins standards of course but you might do pretty well in time do you want me to say goodbye to the prof for you i dont suppose youll want to see him again will youafter that it happens ive just been to him for my testimonial any time i can be of help to you old chap just let me know thanks we reached the ground floor and i got out im going to the basement bingham explained going to have a dekko at some slides in the lab now im senior hs i thought id better run over my path and bact i slammed the gates dont expect ill see you before you go old chap got to give a talk to the new cas hsthey dont seem to know a thing you know these chaps whove just qualified toodle pip he pressed the button the lift moved six inches and stopped bingham pressed all the other buttons in turn nothing happened he rattled the gate it wouldnt open i say old chap he called after me anxiously im stuck in the lift so i see bingham absolutely bally well stuck he gave a nervous laugh and rattled the lattice again several nurses porters and patients had gathered round to watch passengers were often stuck in the st swithins lift which provided a regular diversion to the otherwise monotonous aspect of the corridors i say old chap his voice wavered get me out will you but i dont think i know how some of the nurses began to titter do you mean i ought to send for the fire brigade or something no dash it old man this is beyond a joke he rattled the gate loudly terrified that his dignity was slipping away from him be a sport old chap he implored get some help you cant leave a pal like this can you oh all right i said testily i supposed even bingham had human rights wait a minute thanks old chap i knew youd do the decent as i strolled away as slowly as possible to fetch a porter i noticed a loaded food trolley moving down the corridor with the patients lunch an idea struck me when i returned to the lift i was pleased to see the crowd had doubled and bingham was rattling the bars again ah there you are old chap he said with relief youve been pretty nippy i musthere whats the idea i slowly peeled half a bunch of bananas and poked them one after another through the bars this simple pantomime delighted the audience which had now been joined by a party of convalescents from the childrens wards and blocked the corridor bingham himself became mildly maniacal i wont forget this he spat at me i wont bally well forget it you wait and see i left him still in the lift and walked straight out of the hospital for the first time in my qualified career feeling reasonably contented on the bus i opened the professors testimonial it was short to whom it may concern dr gordon has been my casualty house surgeon for the past three months in which time he has performed his duties entirely to his satisfaction i began to open the british medical journal as the chinese open their newspapers from the back the last twenty pages are filled with advertisements for jobs and i suddenly found myself less concerned over the progress of medical science as a whole than the next source of my own bread and butter there were plenty of hospitals advertising for house surgeons in the provinces so i bought a book of stamps and wrote a dozen elegantlyphrased applications as i would receive free thirdclass tickets to attend the interviews i felt that at least i would see something of the country at the national health services expense i soon found that i was not a success at interviews first of all the waitingrooms upset me before an oral examination a group of students enjoy the deep sad comradeship of a bunch of prisoners awaiting the firing squad but when a job is being decided the atmosphere in the anteroom is more like a lifeboat with the food and water running low although none of the candidates could have wanted work more urgently than myself i always reached the empty chair at the foot of the committee table with subconscious feelings of guilt this made me always say the wrong things find difficulty in knowing what to do with my hands fiddle with my tie break pencils in two and tear the sheet of pink blottingpaper into little bits i went through several interviews though now they are as indistinguishable in my mind as different visits to the dentists they were all held in hospital boardrooms containing a fireplace crammed with coal three portraits of men in frockcoats suffering from obesity and hypertension the hospital reports since bound in red leather a bust of hippocrates in the corner and black panels of donations recording in gold leaf how ennobled local manufactured cast their bread upon waters with reliable tides in the middle of the room was a mahogany table that looked strong enough to support a tank round which sat a dozen of the most intimidating people i had seen in my life it was important to decide on entering the room which of the committee were doctors and which were lay governors in order to tune the pitch of each reply correctlythere was no point in giving a clinical examination answer to a wholesale draper in his best suit at one of my earlier interviews i was asked solemnly by a man in a clerical collar what would you do doctor if you were operating alone at midnight and suddenly produced an unstoppable haemorrhage feeling sure of myself i replied pray to god for guidance sir a small man on my right stirred dont you think young fellow he said quietly you might ring up a consultant surgeon before calling on the advice of an unqualified practitioner i didnt get the job some of the committees wanted to know if i played cricket others if i played the piano some if i were married or if i were moral one chairman asked my politics another the names of my clubs whatever answers i gave never seemed to be the right ones there was always a sharp silence a slight oh from somewhere and the chairman was thanking me very much and saying they would let me know in due course my saddest discovery of all was that an education at st swithins did not automatically waft you to the head of the profession on the sweeping bows of your colleagues we had been brought up to assume the same relationship to the graduates of other hospitals as sherlock holmes to watson and it was a shock to find someone who had never heard of the place whats your hospital lad demanded one florid fat surgeon who held the degree of a northern medical school never mentioned in our wards st swithins sir ee lad youll live it down he said and everyone roared with laughter this was too much even at an interview i might say sir i declared indignantly that i am extremely proud of the fact at least they say you can always tell a st swithins man aye lad and you cant tell him anything i didnt get that job either after a disheartening month of cold train journeys i began to feel worried i no longer faced the problem of finding a befitting start to my surgical career but of keeping myself alive and fed i had four pounds ten in the bank one suit a bag of golf clubs a roll of minor surgical instruments and a small plaster bust of lord litter i lived in a furnished room in muswell hill the weather was wet and icy all my shoes needed repairing i always seemed hungry and my depressing circumstances made me want to drink twice as much as usual my microscope had been sacrificed long ago and my skeleton lay in a pawnbrokers near st swithins whose cellars must have resembled the catacombs after a plague year the only objects of value left were my textbooks i looked at them packing my landladys cheap bookcase with their plump smooth backs and rich gold lettering like a hungry tramp eyeing a flock of geese for a week i resisted temptation then i decided that there were two or three volumes on subjects like public health and biochemistry that a rising surgeon could do without later i unashamedly took the lot one after the other to the secondhand medical bookshop in gower street saying at every meal a grace to its provider whitby and brittons disorders of the blood gave only bacon and eggs and coffee in a teashop but prices textbook of the practice of medicine was much more nutritious and ran to tomato soup steak and chips a pint of beer and apple tart i saved up grays anatomy for my birthday and when i at last carried the encyclopaedia of surgical practice downstairs i booked a table at scotts soon i had nothing left but a few students aid handbooks what to do in cases of poisoning and a table of food values which together would hardly have risen to tea and sandwiches i therefore set out to my next interview at a large hospital in northumberland determined to win the job i stood in the waitingroom staring out of the window trying to forget the other candidates i marched into the committee room clasped my hands under the table and answered all the questions like an efficient policeman in court this time i had the whole length of the table to myself with the committee in a line opposite which somehow increased my confidence i felt i was doing well particularly when the tall surgeon in the corner who had been asking most of the questions nodded after investigating my career at st swithins and said that seems all very satisfactory and you really mean to go in for surgery do you most certainly sir i answered promptly however much personal hardship it means at first thats always been my ambition excellent thats the spirit i like to see in my house surgeons dont you agree gentlemen a heartening volley of grunts came across the table very well the surgeon said now dr brycederry our chairman will ask you a few routine questions the chairman who sat immediately opposite me was a pleasantlooking youngish man in a tweed suit a check shirt and a homespun tie now dr gordon he started with a smile youre certain you really want to work in our hospital yes sir his smile vanished his lips tightened you have been qualified a little over three months i believe yes sir he paused he glared at me you are a member of the medical defence union i take it he went on slowly oh definitely sir i felt bewildered there was suddenly an odd atmosphere in the room all the committee members were either looking at the ceiling or staring hard on to their squares of blottingpaper nobody spoke and of the bma the chairman continued now scowling yyes sir this sudden malevolence was impossible to explain i felt awkward and nervous and wanted fresh air i pulled out my handkerchief to wipe my forehead and pushed back my chair then i saw opposite me under the table the edge of a tweed skirt thick fishnet stockings and a pair of sensible brogues iim terribly sorry my dear siri mean madamiioh god i jumped up and ran for the door i didnt get that job either in the train to london i pulled the latest medical journal from my overcoat pocket and sadly turned again to the advertisements which were conveniently arranged alphabetically under specialities from anaesthetics to venereology it seemed time to try my luck at a different branch of medicine bacteriology meant regular hours and no talkative patients but there was always the risk of catching something like smallpox or plague tuberculosis offered work in pleasant country surroundings with plenty of fresh butter and eggs but the drowsy routine of a sanatorium often drugs the doctors as well as the patients orthopaedics needed the instincts of a carpenter and pathology the instincts of burke and hare radiology sent you to work in unhealthy dark dripping grottoes underground and paediatrics meant children being sick over your trousers i looked gloomily through the window at the english industrial landscape thirstily soaking up an afternoons rain and tried to review my years at st swithins to find another subject for which i had shown some aptitude but my education was represented in my memory only by a series of smellsthere was the acrid smell of the firstyear chemistry class the soft smell of canada balsam used for mounting zoology slides the mixed stink of phenol and formaldehyde in the anatomy room the rich aromatic breath of the biochemistry laboratory the smell of floorpolish in the wards and ether in the operating theatre and the smell in the postmortem room like a badlykept butchers shop i sighed and reluctantly turned back the pages there was nothing left but general practice under practices executive councils was printed for vacancies except those in scotland apply on form ecia obtainable from the executive council the first breath of bureaucracy it had such a depressing effect that i turned to the less formal advertisements tucked among prospectuses for private lunatic asylums and offers of used cars and secondhand ramc uniforms in the back one on the cover itself struck me eminently suitable for recently qualified practitioner medical officer in luxury liner on world cruise america south seas west indies australia japan india leaving almost immediately all found and salary ј per annum in us dollars personal medical officer required by south african

free sixteenthcentury house fully modernized free fuel and food free car and chauffeur three months holiday a year many other similar posts apply to wilson willowick and wellbeloved medical agency the address was not far from st swithins the next morning was foggy my rent fell due and i was developing a cold but even from muswell hill the agency shone brightly with hope i made for it directly after breakfast i had never seen the office but i found it at the top of a bare sagging staircase between a hospital for chronic diseases and a pub on the door was a notice saying walk in inside was a small room lined with varnished planks containing two plain wooden benches facing each other and fixed to the wall like seats in a french railway compartment opposite was a door with a cracked frostedglass panel saying principal there was a window curtained with london grime and on the floor the small upturned face of a circular electric fire gave a wan greeting sitting on one bench was a pale thoughtful man about my age reading the journal of neurology neurosurgery and psychiatry and on the other an old untidy dirtylooking fellow with an insanitary moustache and a crumpled trilby was staring at the floor and muttering i sat next to the young man none of us spoke i waited until both of them had entered and left the inner room then i went in myself the office was smaller than the waitingroom and contained a high narrow desk at which a benevolentlooking old man with goldrimmed glasses and sidewhiskers was sitting on a stool he was wearing a wing collar a cravat and an old frockcoat a light in a pale green shade hung from the ceiling to the level of his nose mr wilson mr willowick or mr wellbeloved i asked cheerfully the sensation of applying for a job as a customer rather than a supplicant was unreasonably stimulating alas doctor i am neither he smiled goodheartedly he put down his pen and clasped his arthritic fingers and what can i do for you i came about your advertisement id like the millionaire one if its still going but if not ill take the cruise liner instead i can pack up and go any time im perfectly free alas again doctor he said still smiling kindly but those vacancies are already filled but the advert only came out yesterday the rush was very greathowever i have many equally attractive posts to offer you wish to go abroad doctor i wouldnt mind as long as its sunny then i have just the very place the acropolos oil companya greek concern but most respectablerequire a doctor in iraq most interesting the first tour of duty is five years i have the contract here i dont think i want so much sunshine as that are you a man of faith doctor you look it to my eyes a medical missionary is needed in siam the remuneration is admittedly not high but he sighedone gains ones reward in heaven i should prefer to gain my reward here i was beginning to feel disappointed i suppose you havent any ordinary practices im working for my frcs you know and taking up surgery and all that i thought id better get a bit of gp experience first of course doctor he picked up another bundle of papers i thought that you wished to leave the country for some reason or anotherof course we have many practices i wouldnt like to say how many bright young men like yourself ive set on their way its a sort of hobby really thishe indicated the officeis not my true habitat oh dear me no youd be surprised if you knew what it was i have many interests but oncehe became sadthe life of one i hold very dear to me was saved by the skill of a young doctor now it is my only pleasure in life helping such young men along their difficult path he looked as if he were about to burst into tears and i was beginning to feel it was my lucky day some might call me eccentric but he smiled faintly and dabbed beneath his spectacles with a handkerchief forgive an old mans ramblings i am always touched at the sight of a doctor at the threshold of his career he became more businesslike and continued heres just the thing for you semirural in the midlandsthe dukeries you know locum tenens i know the doctor personally a most excellent gentleman and a fine clinician a fine clinician you will learn a great deal from him and the remuneration doctor all found and ten guineas a week not to be sneezed at eh i hesitated itll be gone by lunchtime i guarantee semirural you said more than semi all right ill take it youre very wise i think now i expect youd like some money he chuckled forgive me doctor forgive me an old mans privilege i know with young doctors things are often a littlestrained youll need your books and some equipment eh he drew an old leather wallet from his pocket took out a packet of white notes and laid them on the desk a hundred pounds would perhaps be of use to you butbut you mean as a gift i said in amazement its ridiculous i couldnt take it well let us call it a loan then yes a loan i understand your embarrassment perfectly doctor i havent a scrap of security that doesnt worry me in the least not in the least just to make you feel its no more than a business transaction perhaps youll sign here i signed theres a little interest to make it less personal he admitted fifteen per cent per annum payable quarterly now perhaps youll favour me with a signature on this too doctor what is it just the usual form about the practice i take a small commission to pay for overheads so expensive these days he blotted both my signatures thatll be thirtythree and a third per cent of your salary for the first year after twelve months you wont have to pay me a cent not a cent good morning doctor heres the address of your practice go as soon as you can wont you the train service is very good dont lose touch with me now that would never do send me a postcard goodbye doctor goodbye next please i descended the stairs feeling as though i had nodded to a friend at an auction and found myself the purchaser of a large suite of chippendale furniture at the bottom i bumped absently into someone coming through the door sorry i mumbled a violent blow on the back sent me staggering richard you old bastard grimsdyke we shook hands delightedly although we were close companions in medical school i hadnt seen him since the afternoon he failed his finals what the devil are you doing in this den of thieves he demanded at once looking for work god help you is father bloodsucker up aloft i looked puzzled old pycraftthe vile criminal in a frockcoat and brass glasses i nodded damn sure it wasnt old berry tall thin character bald as a pillarbox no its pycraft all right he frowned i thought it was berrys day hes almost human sometimes but pycraftoh hell we must go and have a drink in case theres any danger of this developing into an allday session i said as we stepped out i must warn you that ive just been given a job to go to what by those people then youll need a drink come on theyre open the lights of the pub next door sent a warm yellow welcome through the fog the bar was oldfashioned and cheerful with a sprightly young fire leaping in the grate and the landlord screened away behind an arrangement of mahogany and frosted glass that afforded a cosiness contemptible to modern pub architects after several minutes conversational backslapping grimsdyke ordered the drinks and asked through the barrier have you the morning papertimes or telegraph thanks he searched for the city page and read closely through it moving his lips forgive me richard he said glancing up i was all right at the close of yesterdays business but im a bit worried about cunard and vickers however theyre holding their own pretty satisfactory all round id say my brokers are the smartest chaps in the city but i like to keep an eye on my investments ah the beer he folded the paper and poked it back to the happier days of our youth and our future prosperity after the first draught i lowered my glass and looked at him in puzzlement as a student he had more money than the rest of his companions together and had presented a smart and fashionable contrast to the remainder of the medical school now he was wearing a torn mackintosh over a baggy donegal tweed suit and a frayed yellowandgreen check waistcoat with brass buttons his shoes were worn his collar curled his cuffs were grubby one of his gayest bowties flew from his neck in jaunty defiance of the rest of his outfit there was a moment of embarrassment as he noticed my look then he put down his drink and announced im qualified qualified congratulations my dear fellow butbut how there hasnt been an exam since the one you failed he laughed not in london certainly but i take a broad view of the whole subject of examinations i am now entitled to put after my name the proud letters pcam i am a preceptor of the college of apothecaries of mayo ever heard of it i cant say i have youre far from the only one you know i never saw eye to eye with the examiners here i take an intellectual view of medicine old lad and lets face itmedicine isnt an intellectual subject any fool with a good memory and a sharp ear for squeaks and rumbles can become a doctor true i admitted sadly i heard about the mayo college from a bloke i met in a pub in fleet street apparently this useful institution is still allowed to award diplomas that put you on the british medical register and no ones tumbled to it its like not paying any income tax in jersey and all that i booked a ticket to mayo and arrived a couple of days later it was early in the morning so i walked up and down the street looking for this college but all i could find was a door with a bloody great brass knocker on it which i knocked inside was an old hag scrubbing the floor have you come to be made a doctor she said i have i told her upstairs she said and went on scrubbing upstairs was a sittingroom with a nice fire and a young fellow sitting reading the irish independent over his breakfast when i acquainted him with the nature of my business he said hed be delighted to accommodate me and if id come back after the weekend i could have the examination i told him that was ridiculousi had many pressing engagements in london on monday morning he said he was sorry but he was off playing golf in the country and there was nothing he could do about it eventually he said well the examination consists only of a viva voce and seeing that theres only one candidate we can just as well hold it in the taxi hand me my golf clubs mr grimsdyke and well be off in the back of the cab he started now tell me something about urea i asked you mean that chemical substance or are you referring to my lughole he said well we wont go into it further how would you treat an old woman of eighty who went crazy one sunday afternoon and fell down and broke both legs i thought a good bit and said i would bring about the unfortunate creatures timely demise with the soothing juices of the poppy he agreed i think thats about right im anticlerical myself he asked me a few more questions walking down the platform then took his clubs and said id passed and the examination fee was fifty guineas it happened i had fiftyodd quid on me so he stuffed them in his mackintosh pocket and wrote out the receipt on a bit of newspaper as the train left he yelled out of the window that my diploma would follow and sure enough it did damn great thing with a seal on like the magna carta i hear the governments got wind of the place now and theyre going to shut it down shall we have the other half your turn when i had ordered the drinks grimsdyke continued that was the beginning of my troubles you remember my grandmothers bequesta thousand a year during my training to be a doctor that stopped on the nail of course in short my financial affairs were unprepared for the sudden disaster of my passing as i had already got through the next three or four years allowance on tick a certain amount of retrenchment was necessary visits to the popshop the cars gone and so have the golf clubs even some of the suiting hence the appearance of having dropped off a haycart damn unpleasant but why on earth i demanded did you ever bloody well qualify at all you could have gone on failing and stayed a medical student the rest of your life at a thousand a year thats what id have done pride old lad he explained looking into his glass sadly do you know why i failed my finals in london i was doing damn well in the clinical it was one of those days when golfballs look the size of footballs and the greens as big as piccadilly circusyou know the physical signs were sprouting out of my patient like broccoli i found hed got an effusion at his left base and i spotted he was fibrillating i even heard his diastolic murmur a thing id never been able to accomplish all my years in the medical school gave me quite a start i trotted all this out to the examiner feeling pretty pleased with myself he kept nodding and saying quite so exactly excellent and i saw myself bowing out in a lofty sort of way to the applause of the assembled company then he asked anything else and i said impossible sir and do you know said grimsdyke savagely banging his glass on the bar the bloody patient had a glass eye and the old fornicator failed me that really is hard luck i said sympathetically particularly as id been out the night before with nicky nosworth from guys whos had a glass eye for years in fact he showed me the bloodshot one hes got for the morning after and the one he upsets everyone with when he gets bottled with crossed union jacks instead of a pupil we drank in silence for a few moments contemplating this tragedy all you fellows had got through grimsdyke continued so i thought to hell with the cash i can damn well be a doctor too and look where its got me theres always your investments ah yes he sighed my investments have you got a job im a sort of chronic locum tenens life really got difficult when i fell into the hands of the crooks next door you must have been pretty hard put to it ending up with those financial fiends i was the cash was running pretty low i had to get work somewhere and i was lured by their advertisements he nodded how much is the job paying ten guineas a week you ought to have stuck out for sixteen at least i suppose youve never been in practice before i shook my head then watch out its not the doctors who are the troubleits their wives remember that old lad if nothing else by the way can you lend me some money my investments take practically every penny these days of course my small resources are at your disposal i suppose wilson willowick and wellbeloved pressed a hundred quid on you a tenner will do me heres my card though i hope you wont have to remind me i may be poor but im still honest thanks old lad do you want any tips for the market no then your very good health before going to my practice i had two essential purchases to make i went to a readymade tailors in oxford street and gingerly walked through the chromium halls looking at the dummies which demonstrated that the suits fitted all right if you were in the grip of rigor mortis i was sneaking towards the door when a salesman sprang at me from a thicket of shaftesbury avenue tweed and within a minute was helping me off with my clothes in a cubicle i want something forer business pretty dark and dignified you know but you dont want to look like an undertakers clerk sir do you no i certainly dont want to look like an undertakers clerk how about this sir he said briskly producing a suit with the air of a maitre dhфtel offering something exceptionally choice from the kitchen it was a blue tweed with a pronounced herringbone a mauve check overlay and a faint red stripe wears like tin plate sir just feel lovely bit of cloth magnificent quality you wont be seeing anything like this again sir the suit certainly looked good value but the pink lights and rosy mirrors in the shop would have sold out a stock of sackcloth and ashes the sleeves are a bit long i said dubiously theyll work up in no time sir never fear all right ill take it im sure youll be very satisfied sir he said immediately wrapping it up he winked youll be cutting quite a dash with this at the palais on saturday nights eh sir my next necessity was a car a gp without a car is as useless as a postman without legs but i had less than seventy pounds left with which to buy one i looked wistfully in the manufacturers showrooms in piccadilly where brandnew cars were displayed as carefully as the cigarettecases in the jewellers next door but even the secondhand ones in euston road garages were beyond my means i finally arrived at a bombsite in camden town where a line of cars with prices whitewashed on their windscreens stood under a banner saying honest percy pick lovely job this one said percy pick kicking a tyre affectionately he managed his business without moving his hands from his pockets his hat from his head or his cigarette from his mouth good for another fifty thou easy the price is a bit steep for me im afraid he snorted garn dont expect me to give it away do yer ill come down to a undred i shook my head how about this he slapped a bonnet in a row of cars waiting pathetically to be bought like puppies in a dogs home only one owner he must have died a very old man how about a mobike if youre so broke how much is that one over there in the corner of the site was a large black heavy hearselike car which looked as immobile as a chickencoop percy pick seemed surprised to see it you can have it for fifty he said quickly does it go go of course it goes all my cars go very well i said lets see the next morning i set off to my practice wearing my new suit and driving my new car reflecting that i had already learnt much of the sordid world outside the overprotective walls of st swithins the journey north was exciting for neither the carwhich i had christened haemorrhagic hildanor i had been on the road for some time hilda was originally an expensive limousine but now she was constructed of so many spare parts that i thought of her fondly as the bastard of some noble line her vertical windscreen which opened horizontally across the middle was colourful with rainbows and bright with stars there was worm in the dashboard where all the dials pointed to zero except the engine temperature which was stuck at boiling her furnishings had been replaced by a former owner and now consisted of a pair of bucket seats from an old baby austin perched on a fruitbox in front and an ordinary small domestic horsehair sofa in the back behind the sofa were pieces of sacking some old gnawed bones a yoyo and scraps of newspaper prophesying the fall of ramsay macdonalds government the front windows would not open and the back windows would not shut birds had nested under the roof and mice under the floorboards the mechanical part of haemorrhagic hilda aroused my clinicians interest rather than my alarm the engine produced more rales sibili and rhonchi than a ward of asthmatics and the steering gear which had a wheel fit for a london bus was afflicted with a severe type of locomotor ataxia the only pleasant surprise was the horn this was a long silver trumpet creeping from the windscreen to coil comfortably over the bonnet and front mudguard which in squeezing the rubber bulb sounded like feedingtime in the seal pool hildas other surprisingly good point was her brakes which i shortly had a chance of demonstrating outside stony stratford a police car waved me to the roadside you the owner of this vehicle the policeman demanded taking my licence and proud of it i said cheerfully i suppose you know there are regulations concerning the roadworthiness of motor vehicles he said in the tone used by customs officers asking you to open the other suitcase is the vehicle equipped with an efficient braking system brakes absolutely wonderful officer she can pull up on a postage stamp i am going to test the truth of your statement proceed along the highway at a reasonable speed i will follow and when i blow my horn apply your brakes rightho i said bravely i swung the engine wondering what was going to happen if the police decided to hound hilda off the road i would not only arrive late but lose the greater part of my working capital as well after i had travelled a few hundred yards my thoughts were interrupted by the urgent blast of a horn behind me as i drove the brakepedal into the floorboards i realized that it was not the policeman but a bentley sweeping past our procession at eighty there was a crash behind and my windscreen fell on to the bonnet as haemorrhagic hilda had been built in the same spirit as the pyramids she suffered only another dent in the rear mudguard but the police car lay with its wheels turned out like flat feet bleeding oil and water on to the roadway youll hear more about this the policeman kept muttering as i dressed the small cut on his nose i gave him a lift to the next telephone box and continued my journey in an unreasonably cheerful frame of mind i began to move down the psychological slope towards depression as i entered the district where i was to work it was a small english industrial town which like many others stood as a monument to its own victorian prosperity there were long solid rows of grimy houses factories walled like prisons and chapels looking like pubs or pubs looking like chapels on every corner there was a town hall ringed by stout old gentlemen petrified as they rose to address the board the station was a smoky shrine to the railway age the football ground was a mausoleum of past champions and the streets had not yet echoed the death rattle of their trams only the main thoroughfare had been changed and consisted of cinemas multiple chemists tailors and cheap chainstores looking exactly like anywhere else in the country shortly it began to rain though from the soggy ground and the depressed aspect of the pedestrians it appeared to have been raining there continuously for several years i became gloomier as i searched for my address on the other side of the town and finally drove into a long road of gently dilapidating victorian villas behind caged gardens of small trees shivering in their seasonal nakedness on the last doorpost i spotted a brass plate the front door was opened by a cheerfullooking young blonde in overalls holding a broom is dr hockett in i asked politely raising my hat im dr gordon well fancy that now i said to the doctor this morning i said im sure he aint coming she grinned silly aint i i was delayed on the road i had to give medical attention in an accident the doctor aint in yet but give us your bags and ill show you up to your room as she climbed the dark stairs with my two suitcases the maid called over her shoulder you aint arf young well imim not exactly in the cradle you know i said wondering whether to feel flattered garn i bet you aint any older than what i am the doctors had some real old fogeys i can tell you old dr christmas was the last onecripes he must have been ninety real old dodderer then there was dr ohiggins and dr orourke and dr otoolegrandpas they were and before them there was dr solomons and dr azzis and dr wu i was alarmed theres been quite a number of assistants here undreds and undreds of em oh heres your room she said brightly opening a door at the top of the last flight of stairs it was a bedroom the size of a cell and furnished as sparsely she dropped the cases and flicked briefly at the enamel washbasin with her duster bit chilly this weather but its comfy enough in summer home from home i assure you i murmured looking round you can get a nice fug up if you keep the window shut dr wu nowhe used to burn incense and things you wont be doing that will you not very much the lights switched off at the main at eleven you pays your own laundry its extra if youve got a wireless and you can have a bath on saturday mornings she went on cheerfully thats the doctors orders he likes to keep an eye on the housekeeping i should ruddy well think he does this seemed too much to tolerate even as a junior locum far be it for me to judge a man in advance i told her but i must say he seems a bit of a mean old devil he can be a bit stingy sometimes thats straight likes to look after the pennies i sat down on a bed as unresilient as a park bench and contemplated the discouraging start to my career as a general practitioner the blonde continued to grin at me from the doorway and i wondered if she was waiting for a tip but as i felt in my pocket she went on i must say it is nice to see someone from london town again hows the old place getting along about the same i suppose i thought you werent a local girl i added not me i aint one of them provincials ow did you guess i hesitated you have a sort of sophisticated air about you go on with you i suppose you dont know the old bag o nails in ludgate circus do you i used to be behind the bar there for a bit what old harry bennetts pub i know it very well often went there with a lot of chaps from barts her face took a tender look dear old harry bennett after all these years funny you should know it aint it well have a good old pijaw about it as soon as youre settled in itll be just as good as a holiday for me have you been out here long near on four years ive got an old mum you know a door slammed the doctor she gasped cheerybye she whispered ill say youll be down in a minute i found dr hockett in the gloomy livingroom where the table was laid for high tea he was standing in a green tweed overcoat in front of the gas fire which was unlit he was a tall stooping man of about fifty with a thin lined face and a thick grey moustache his hands were clasped behind him and his gaze was fixed on his toes his only movement as i entered was turning his eyes sharply up and glaring at me beneath his eyebrows which hung across his face like a tuft of steel wool good afternoon sir i said politely good afternoon doctor i had expected you a little earlier he spoke in a soft monotone as though saying his prayers taking one hand from behind his back he shook mine flaccidly and replaced it remarkably warm for the time of year isnt it well it strikes a little chilly up here after london no i dont think it does he went on i always wear wool next to the skin doctor that is much more hygienic than filling the house with the fumes of combustible gases if that is your car outside you will have to leave it in the open overnight there is only room in the garage for mine and as it is no more than a few years old i dont intend to expose the coachwork i often do my nearer visits on bicycleit is much more healthy to take exercise in the open air you might like to follow my example though as youre paying your own petrol bills its entirely up to you we could make an arrangement by which you had part use of the bicycle and i would make the appropriate deduction from your salary as i said nothing he continued muttering youve not been in general practice before i believe no i thought not the work here is hard but the experience will be sufficient reward in itself the door opened and the blonde maid entered with a tray containing a large brown enamel teapot a loaf of bread a packet of margarine and a small tin of sardines halfempty it is much healthier for the alimentary tract not to be overloaded with a heavy meal at night dr hockett continued still looking at his feet i never take further food after this hour but if you wish to buy yourself some biscuits or suchlike for later consumption of course i have no objection shall we sit down he took off his overcoat and sat at the head of the table seeing a third place and suddenly remembering grimsdykes warning i broke the silence by asking are you married sir he gave me another glance under his eyebrows i didnt quite catch your remark doctor he muttered i thought you said are you married as the blonde took the third chair he went on pour the doctor his tea first my dear possibly he likes it weaker than we do will you take a sardine doctor i see there are one and onethird each what nothing at all perhaps after the excitement of your journey you are not very hungry well it is best in the circumstances not to overwork the metabolism the shock of finding the cockney blonde was hocketts wife did not lead to my losing much nourishment nothing followed the bread and sardines hockett maintaining that margarine was biochemically the superior of butter and weak tea had a low caffeine content which prevented eventual nervous alimentary and moral degeneration the wife whose name i gathered was jasmine said little because she ate steadily through a pile of bread and margarine but while hockett was carefully mopping up the sardine oil with his bread i was horrified to see her wink at me as we rose from the table hockett was struck by an afterthought you didnt take sugar did you doctor he muttered its all right i can do without it at a pinch im so glad doctor extremely unhealthy sugar pure carbohydrate surplus carbohydrate in the diet leads to obesity and then what we all know that obesity is a cause of arteriosclerosis arteriosclerosis causes heart failure and heart failure is fatal taking sugar in the tea is suicidal doctor i want the fire on jasmine declared do you my dear but its extremely warm i find it warm enough anyway so does dr gordon you feel warm dont you doctor a remarkably mild winter were having im frozen to the marrow i am jasmine said she clutched herself and shivered dramatically very well my dear he said with an air of solemn generosity as though reading her his will you shall have the fire doctor do you happen to have a match on you this conversation had taken place in the dark as the daylight had been fading swiftly during the meal and neither of them had thought of turning on the light very restful the twilight hockett continued stumbling over the furniture as he groped for the switch through the blackness extremely valuable for restoring the sensitivity of the retina we suffer from far too much light he lit the fire carefully turned it half down sat in a chair beside it and began reading the daily express steadily from the headlines to the printers name at the foot of the last sheet you may smoke if you wish doctor he said looking up we ourselves do not liable to give fatal disease of the lung you mean exactly if you wish for something to read there are some books on the table behind you they were left in the waitingroom by patients but i expect they are perfectly readable i started on pears cyclopaedia when i became tired of reading this i stared for a while at a stuffed duck in a glass case opposite once i had seen enough of the duck i took another dip into pears jasmine sat between us knitting and every time i looked at her she winked thus the evening passed at nine oclock jasmine yawned and said im off to get a bit of kip very wise of you my dear early to bed and early to rise is a perfectly sound motto physiologically good night one and all she said cheerfully gathering her knitting sleep tight dr gordon as soon as she had ad left the room dr hockett turned the fire out sweltering in here doctor isnt it now that my wife has retired we can have a talk on professional matters i dont like to discuss such things in front of her first of all your duties you will see the national health patients twice a day at the surgery in football ground road and take all the night calls i see the rest and the private patients such as they are in my consultingroom here i dont go out at night he gave me another look under his eyebrows i dont like leaving jasmine alone she is still very young quite understandable there was a pause a very attractive woman jasmine he added most attractive sir i agreed politely as he continued to stare at me in silence i shifted in my chair and added i mean in a sort of utterly platonic way and all that you know after gazing at me for several more seconds he suddenly produced a key on a string from his waistcoat pocket this is the duplicate key of the drug cupboard in my surgery next door there are only two keys in the house please see that the cupboard is always locked i do not think it wise for jasmine to have access to it he handed me the key and went on jasmine is in many ways somewhat childish as we are to work closely together doctor i think it best for me to confide in you now it may come as a shock to you to hear that jasmine was my daily maid before becoming my wife no really i had practised abroad for many years out east i never married marriage somehow seemed always beyond my means however when i settled herei nevertheless love jasmine very deeply doctor he continued staring hard i would not like to see anyone harm a hair of her head thats the spirit i said brightly i was now feeling badly in need of a drink after all youre her husband and all that arent you yes doctor he murmured i am her husband he then rose switched out the light and suggested we went to bed breakfast the next morning was tea and porridge dr hockett didnt believe in overloading the gastric absorption so early in the day the meal was begun in silence because hockett was attending to his morning mail the general practitioners daily postbag is filled with advertisements from the pharmaceutical firms and boxes of free samples which are passed by most of their recipients directly into the wastepaper basket but hockett carefully opened each one smoothing the envelopes for future use and reading the shiny pages of advertisements from the coloured slogans at the top to the formulae in small type at the bottom surely sir you dont believe in all that rubbish i asked i felt i had been bullied long enough in the house and i had slept sufficiently badly to have the courage of a bad temper at st swithins we were taught to chuck advertisements away unopened on the contrary doctor i find i derive a great deal of medical information from them one of the difficulties of a general practitioner is keeping up with the latest work and all the medical journals are so infernally expensive but look at the muck they send in free samples no gp in his right mind would prescribe it this for instance i picked up a large bottle of green liquid labelled dr farrers famous female fertility food careful doctor dont drop it as a matter of fact i keep all the samples i have several hundred in the cupboard in my consultingroom my private patients seem glad enough of them you charge for them i suppose sir i asked coldly naturally he replied without hesitation patients do not appreciate what they do not pay for that is surely recognized as one of the evils of the national health service now i really think you should be getting along doctoryour surgery is well over a mile away and it is bad for the practice to arrive late i drove haemorrhagic hilda through the rain towards football ground road trying to suppress my feelings if i were to be a gp i was going to be a damn good one despite hockett jasmine a bed as uncomfortable as the rack in the tower and the effects of incipient frostbite and starvation this determination wavered when i saw the surgery itself it was a shopfront with the glass painted bright green and dr hocketts surgery written across it in red like the window of a fourale bar there was already a queue of patients on the pavement as i unlocked the door inside i found a single room filled with parishhall chairs with a partitioned cubbyhole for the doctor in the corner this cubbyhole was largely filled with filing cabinets though there was an old examination couch a small stained desk a basin a bunsen burner and an oil stove which i immediately lit i washed my hands took out my fountainpen put my head round the cubbyhole door and said first patient please a fat mother accompanied by a fat adolescent schoolgirl rose from the first line of chairs and advanced on me with the expression of purposeful dislike used by women when demanding to see the manager adiposa familiars i said brightly as they entered whats that the mother asked sharply a latin expression medical terminology you wouldnt understand it i waved them towards the two chairs jammed beside the desk placed my fingertips together and began now whats the trouble wheres the doctor the mother asked i am the doctor no the real doctor i assure you i am a perfectly real doctor i said calmly surely you dont want me to produce my diploma youre hocketts new boy are you i am dr hocketts most recent assistant certainly she assessed me for some seconds well i cant say i like the idea much of you meddling with our eva she declared eva was meanwhile staring at me malevolently saying nothing and picking her nose either you want me as your daughters medical attendant or you dont i said emphatically if you dont you can take your national health card elsewhere i assure you i shall have no regrets about it whatever its the chest she said nodding towards the girl whats wrong with the chest cough cough cough all night long she does why i never get a wink of sleep i dont sometimes she added indignantly and how long have you had this cough eva i asked with my best professional smile she made no reply very well i said picking up my stethoscope id better start by examining her i suppose off with your things now what you mean take all her clothes off her chest the mother asked in horror i mean take all her clothes off her chest otherwise i shall not be able to make a diagnosis we wont be able to start treatment eva will get worse and you wont get any sleep eva said nothing as her mother peeled away several layers of cardigans blouses and vests at last her chest was exposed i laid my stethoscope over the heart winked at her pleasantly and said with a smile big breaths a look of interest at last illuminated the childs face she glanced at me and grinned yeth she said proudly and im only thixteen the morning passed quickly the patients came steadily to my cubbyhole though every time i began to think of lunch and peeped outside there seemed to be as many waiting as ever i was relieved to find that my work was reduced through most of them not needing a full diagnosis and treatment but only a sustificate doctor i signed several dozen of these certifying that people were in a state to stop work start work go to the seaside stay away from court have a baby draw their pension drink free milk and live apart from their relatives i gained confidence with every signature and was beginning to feel i had a flair for general practice when i came against the case of the cheerful old lady hallo doctor she began and how are you this fine morning im extremely well i said delighted to have a pleasant patient i hope well find that you are too im not so dusty especially considering do you know how old i am doctor not a day over fifty ill be bound go on with you doctor she looked coy im seventy next birthday thats a fact you certainly dont look it i told her briskly feeling it was time to start the professional part of the interview and whats the trouble trouble she looked startled as if i had asked her whether she wanted lean or streaky there aint no trouble doctor then whyforgive me if i ought to knowhave you come to the doctors to get another bottle of me medicine of course ah i see i put my fingertips together again and what sort of medicine is this the red medicine doctor you know i mean what do you take it for the wind she answered at once you suffer from theer wind oh no doctor she was now humouring the teasing of a precocious child havent had the wind for years i havent and how long have you had the medicine ohlet me seei first ad it the year we went to the isle of wightno it couldnt be that year because our ernie was alive then it must have been the year after except it couldnt have been because we had our geoff with us and hes been under the sod a good fifteen quite i interrupted i saw before me as clearly as the eyesight chart hanging from the wall the ministry of health circular on extravagant prescribing well im afraid you cant have any more medicine youre as sound as a bell really and you dont need it take a walk in the park every day instead good morning to you at first she didnt believe me then she said in a sad faint childish voice but i must ave me medicine doctor you really dont need it but i always ave me medicine doctoralways three times a day regular after meals then she suddenly burst into tears now please control yourself i said anxiously i began to wish i had taken the hospital secretarys advice and chosen the army its nothing to do with me its simply a ministry regulation if it was up to me you could have a dozen bottles of medicine a day but we doctors have to cut it down i want me medicine she cried dash it do you wish to unbalance the budget and ruin the country please be reasonable suddenly her grief became anger beating the desk with her umbrella she shouted i want me medicine i know me rights ive paid me national ealth like everyone else i will not stand for this i said wondering if there was anything in the hippocratic oath against losing your temper kindly leave the surgery you thief you robber thats what you are taking all them shillings every week from poor folk like me what cant afford it i know what appens to them insurance stamps i know lining the pockets of the doctors thats what i want me medicine she left the cubbyhole but repeated her demand to the patients who had been listening intently outside inciting them to riot i held my head in my hands for five years at st swithins i had probably ruined my health through overwork and deprived my parents of the last comforts of their declining yearsfor this it would have been easier to face if i had eaten a nourishing breakfast sit down i said dully hearing another patient enter name age and occupation wilkins twentyone trades union organizer a youth in a tight blue suit sat down still wearing his hat but i aint a patient at least not at the minute he spoke softly and slowly as though demanding my money and valuables in an alley on a dark night youve upset my mother you ave if that lady outside is your mother id be obliged if youd kindly take her home under the regulations for the conduct and control of the national health service he continued staring at the ceiling a patient what receives inefficient service from a doctor can state a case before the local executive council who if they shall decide the facts proved shall deduct an appropriate fine from the doctors remuneration i lost my temper get out take it easy doc take it easy he continued in the same tone im not saying nothing against youim only quoting regulations see it just happens that i know em and i suppose you go round making a damn good thing out of it picking his front teeth with a matchstick he continued id be careful what i was saying if i was you doc theres a law of libel in the land dont forget as a matter of fact ive had five cases against doctors won every one all fined im worth near a thousand quid a year to the executive council id say now look here mr watkins wilkins i dont care who the bloody hell you are or what you intend to do but if you dont get out of here at once ill kick your ruddy coccyx so hard violence wont get you nowhere he said imperturbably i could lay a complaint before the general medical council in that case that you was guilty of infamous conduct in a professional respect he rose dont forget the name doc wilkins youll be hearing more from me when i got home jasmine was laying the table for our midday dinner hello she said brightly you look like youre a bear with a sore head and no mistake at the moment id make a pack of bears with sore heads look like a basket of puppies wheres dr hockett jasmine the doctor aint in yet he had to go out to the vicar she laughed thats the first time what youve called me jasmine i threw myself into a chair and picked up my pears cyclopaedia after a while she went on didnt arf give you a start didnt it yesterday at tea she giggled didnt know i was married to the doctor did you if you must drag the incident up again mrs hockett i will tell you that i didnt and it did give me a start quite put me off my sardine she laid out the last of the plates im not blaming you she said amiably fancy me being the wife of a doctor phew i cant get over it yet sometimes as i said nothing she came nearer my chair of course he only married me to save the wages or mostly i suppose hes a mean old devil like you said still i acted for the best my dear mrs hockett call me jasmine ducks i really cannot give opinions on your strictly domestic affairs i have had an exhaustingin fact excruciatingmorning and quite enough trouble for today thank you do us a favour duckie she said no yes go on be a sport she came near enough to stand over me the doctors given you the key of the drug cupboard aint he no yes he hashe always gives it to the assistant and what of it be a gent and give us the lend of it a minute i certainly will not i turned to my cyclopaedia again with finality oh go on ill give it back dr azziz let me have it well dr gordon wont fetch us a bit of nembutal from the cupboard then i love nembutal she rubbed her stomach and rolled her eyes lovely grub it is sends you to sleep and makes you forget what a bloody old miser the doctor is that hardly seems the way for a woman to talk about her husband suddenly she made a grab for my waistcoat pocket come on give it over for gods sake woman ooo let go youre hurting she cried pleasurably damnation cant you control yourself we struggled over the chair and fell on to the floor jasmine was a sturdy girl and obviously experienced in parlour fighting i had managed to push her from above me with difficulty when dr hockett came in i scrambled up my collar had flown from its stud my face was red i was sweating and breathless hockett stood in his overcoat in the doorway with his hands behind him staring at me in the usual way weeri had lost something on the floor iexplained he nodded jasminemrs hockett that iswas helping me find it there was a long silence while jasmine smoothed down her clothes time for dinner hockett said quietly my dear it is surely not necessary to have the fire on at this hour of the morning it is really remarkably warm for the time of year none of us spoke during the meal which was sausage and mash when jasmine had cleared away the dishes and left hockett said in his usual voice surprising the numbers of doctors who have sinned isnt it sinned i looked at him uncomfortably you meaner sexually i mean who have committed murder oh yes i said faintly i suppose it is there was crippenpalmer the poisonerneil cream in london and many more do you remember the ruxton case he cut them up in the bath i suppose itssort of tempting to have all the stuff around to go murdering people with exactly ah well i said i stood up clutching the table for support i must be getting along many murderers are never detected doctor hockett observed i ran to my room and wedged the bed behind the door the evening nevertheless passed the same way as the one before dr hockett sat beside the fainthearted fire and read the express jasmine knitted and winked every time she caught my eye i looked at the duck and read my cyclopaedia we went to bed at ten parting as amiably as any trio which has shared for supper the same cod fillet i heard dr hockett turn the electricity off at the main i felt for my torch beside me and went to sleep the telephone rang at onethirty as it was my job to take all night calls i automatically climbed out of bed crept downstairs and answered it fifteen canal place a mans voice said immediately and hurry up the line went dead i pulled on my clothes started up haemorrhagic hilda looked for canal place on my new map and bounced over the deserted tramlines into the night after losing myself three or four times i found the address at the far end of a long narrow twisting street too cramped for hilda to pass i walked the rest of the way and as it was raining again i knocked on the door with my new suit soaked through to the pyjamas underneath youve taken your time i must say said the man who opened the door i shone my torch in his face wilkins the very same if this is some sort of joke i began angrily joke i dont play jokes doc some people say i aint got a sense of humour its mother whats wrong with her shes dying she is is she well well see i found mrs wilkins in bed upstairs suffering from the wind she wants to go into ospital mr wilkins announced in a threatening voice no doubt she does so do half the population of the country she needs a large glass of hot water thats all she wants to go into ospital mr wilkins insisted good night i snapped picking up my stethoscope ere he grabbed my lapel you eard what i saidshe ought to be in ospital mrs wilkins belched loudly im dying she cried now look here i dont want to threaten you with bodily violence twice in a day mr wilkins but if you dont take your hands off me this instant he stared at me tightlipped all right have it your own way im going to the executive council in the morning go to the bloody town council tonight if you want to and im going to the general medical council too you mark my words he shouted after me as i made for the street infamous conductprofessional respect the words followed me as i ran through the rain while his mother recovered sufficiently to stick her head out of the window and swear in away that would certainly have been inadvisable for a dying woman by the time i left the car outside dr hocketts house i was trembling with indignation this was really too much i had been treated worse than a man come to fix the drains already composing an outraged letter to the bma i opened the front door and flashed my torch along the hall i found jasmine standing at the bottom of the stairs in her nightie good god she giggled hello duckie the doctors out he had to go to the vicar get back to bed at once go on you sound like my old dad she came towards me ill go to bed she whispered if you come too i dropped the torch in fright have you gone insane woman are you crazy what do you think i am hell be back in a second no he wont ducks hes only just gone she grabbed me in the darkness come on nows our chancedont you want a bit of fun then she started kissing me in the spirit of a boxer limbering up on the punching bag i managed to push her away and said desperately let me go let me go havent i got enough to worry about as it is damn itif youll only leave me alone and go back to bed illill give you some nembutal she hesitated you really will yes i really will i wiped my face with my handkerchief in fact i went on breathlessly i wish i could give you the whole ruddy bottle but only if youll go to bed at once and stay there like a good girl thus preventing both of us being cut up in the bath by tomorrow morning she thought for a moment weighing up the alternative delights of me and nembutal ok she decided its a deal run along then ill get it from the surgery and bring it up as she disappeared upstairs i opened the drug cupboard and nervously flashed my torch inside it was filled with several hundred small bottles of samples which rattled like haemorrhagic hilda going downhill as they began to tumble on to the floor all round me i grabbed the nembutal bottle pushed the others back locked the cupboard and made for the stairs on the landing i hesitated jasmine had gone back to her room her door was shut was i in honour bound to keep my side of the bargain perhaps i could sneak back to bed and barricade the door she might come after me but hockett would be back before she could make much more troublei heard a creak inside the room she was impatiently getting out of bed her bare footsteps crossed the floor i grabbed the doorhandle and pulled ere she called whats the big idea the idea is that you stay inside my good woman oh is it together we pulled at the handle one on each side of the door as i had the nembutal bottle in one hand i had a struggle to keep it closed i didnt hear the front door shut and as hockett had returned to the house silently on his bicycle the first i knew of it was finding myself standing in the light of his torch lord almighty i cried immediately it struck me how the situation would appear to him its all right i said urgently your wife couldnt sleep i was just going to fix her up with some of this i waved the bottle in my hand then i saw it wasnt nembutal but dr farrers famous female fertility foods back so soon doctor asked mr pycraft yes dr hockett and i had a difference of opinion about a difficult case you did did you doctor pycraft looked different from our last interview he seemed twenty years younger his sugary benevolence had hardened like the icing on a cheap weddingcake his sidewhiskers had receded his spectacles had enlarged his clothes were cleaner and his hands were cured of their arthritis well now surely you wont let a little thing like that come between you and your career we have gone to great trouble providing you with a start in a magnificent practice magnificent practice the only thing magnificent about it is old hocketts minginess why dont you give it to one of your medical missionaries it would suit a chap who could live on a handful of rice a week and take the temptations of women in his stride i hardly find it a cause for levity doctor if youd been working there for thirtysix hours like i have youd find it even less i want another practice please and damn quick but doctor he picked up a steel pen and slowly tapped his cheek with it im afraid we have no more on our books just at the moment its a bad time for inexperienced young men like yourself your only course is to return to dr hockett immediately apologize and continue your career i banged his desk id rather work tearing up the bloody road as you well might doctor he said calmly under the agreement you signed with wilson willowick and wellbelovedwhich i have in the safe thereyou agreed to pay us thirtythree and onethird per cent of your salary monthly for twelve months or the equivalent amount should you through any reason leave your post beforehand that comes to fourteen pounds per mensem which incidentally is payable in advance we should like the first instalment now doctor and if the rest is not forthcoming i assure you we shall have no hesitation in taking out a summons then there is the interest on the loan of course the publicity doctormost undesirable dont you agree especially at the very beginning of a career the general medical council take an extremely grave view oh go to hell i said i strode from the office slammed the door and clattered down the stairs i stood in the street for a minute breathing hard and wondering what the recent floods of adrenalin were doing to my arteries then i dived into the pub for a drink over a pint i assessed my position in the medical profession i had a diploma a car a new suit shrunk in the service of mrs wilkins no spare cash a debt of a hundred pounds and the legal obligation to pay one hundred and sixtyeight pounds in the next twelve months to wilson willowick and wellbeloved i wanted a job and moneyand unless i was prepared to make haemorrhagic hilda my home i wanted them at once i was gloomily turning over these problems when i thought of grimsdyke although i gravely doubted that he could pay back my ten pounds it would be pleasant to look at someone who owed money to me the address on his card was in ladbrokes grove and i drew up haemorrhagic hilda a little later that morning before a row of tall frowsy houses by the gasworks grimsdykes apartments were in the basement i rang a bell beside a blistered brown door under the area stairs which after several minutes was gingerly opened yes said a womans voice id like to see dr grimsdyke please hes gone away im a particular friend of his tell him its dr gordon and ive just had a row with wilson willowick and wellbeloved just a minute she shut the door and returned a few seconds later to let me in i saw that she was about nineteen dressed in a dirty pink satin housecoat and wore a rather vacant look inside the door was a small hall full of rubbish and beyond that a large room with a window just below the ceiling this contained a bed a gasstove a washstand and a table covered with dirty plates and empty guinness bottles grimsdyke was in his pyjamas with his hair dangling over his face i thought youd gone up north old lad he said in surprise so i had now im back again forgive this squalor he waved a hand round the room fact is i took these roomstheres a lot more at the backto oblige some friends rather messy people i wondered if you could let me have my ten quid back grimsdyke sat on the edge of the bed suddenly surely you cant have spent the other ninety in two days thats certainly some going you must have had a hell of a good time i bought a car what that ruddy great thing thats blocking out the daylight i thought the coal had arrived a bit on the posh side isnt it i felt a big car would be a good investmentto impress the patients he nodded its the only way the blasted public chooses its doctors did i tell you about a pal of mine called rushleigh good scout he qualified right at the end of the war when you couldnt get cars for love money or blackmail unless you were a doctor of course so he filled in the forms and got a nice new little family bus for about three hundred quid hed happened to pal up with a free french bloke whod been in the orthopaedic wards and when this fellow went home with a couple of bone grafts rushleigh got an invitation to stay at his place down at nice buckshee so he set off in his car but hed only got as far as rouen when it conked out you know what cars were like after the war he went to a french garage where they mumbled a bit about spare parts and so forth and told him it would take at least a month to get anything to patch it up however the british being considered good chaps in france at the time they sportingly offered to lend him a very old aristocratic english car they had in the back which hadnt been used for seven years and then only for funerals rushleigh proceeded towards the sunny south feeling he was driving a greenhouse but he got there all right and a month later showed up at rouen this put the garage in a bit of a fix because there were apparently no spare parts anywhere so they suggested to rushleigh they did a straight swap they could fix up his little family bus some time or other and such vehicles sold like gateaux chauds hot cakes old lad i sat down on the bed myself and asked did he agree you bet he did hed quite taken to the old hearse one of the garage blokes brothers was in the customs and rushleigh wasnt averse to a spot of fiddling so off he went when he was safely back in england he thought hed send the thing up to the makers in derbyshire somewhere and have her done up a few days later he got a letter from the managing director asking him to come at once and enclosing firstclass ticket with cheque for incidental expenses and loss of valuable time rushleigh went up there preparing to be led away by the police but instead he was given a ruddy great lunch and asked what hed sell the old conservatory for apparently this firm had a museum of all its old crocks and the one hed picked up in rouen was the only model of its type ever made for some millionaire or other in cannes in fortified by the directors brandy rushleigh said he didnt see the point of selling because where would he get another car to continue his lifesaving work my dear sir said the managing director if you prefer we should be delighted to give you one of our brandnew golden sprites instead rushleigh now drives round his practice in one of these and the old devils worth an easy five thousand a year how about my tenner i said would you like a cup of tea virginia will make some virginia was standing with one foot on the table painting her toenails no thanks ive just had a pint of beer is it as late as that i must be getting a move on ive a good many appointments in the city so if youll excuse me at the moment i face bankruptcy disgrace and starvation i said if youve got any of that ten quid left id regard it as an act of charity if youd let me have it i owe lord knows how much to that agency i cant exactly give you the cash old lad because i havent got it the markets been very sluggish of late but i will tell you what ill dowould you like a job as long as it isnt like the one i got from wilson and willowick this is bona fide and real mccoy have you heard of dr erasmus potterphipps i shook my head hes about the most posh gp in englandhigh class stuff you know none of this bob on the bottle and sawdust on the waitingroom floor wheres he hang out park lane of course whats his wife like he isnt married i felt encouraged for the first time since driving out of range of dr hockett in the middle of the night the only fishy thing that strikes me isi mean ive the highest regard for your friendship and integrity but why havent you grabbed it yourself longterm planning ill tell you in confidencedont breathe it to a soul particularly anyone in the districtim leaving for the country big opening i shall settle down scratching pigs with walkingsticks is miss virginia coming too she had taken no more notice of me and was leaning on the table among the plates plucking her eyebrows no shes psychologically unsuited for the country ive found that outive been psychoanalysing her for the last few weeks thats why shes here you cant psychoanalyse anyone competently if youre not with them day and night jung and adler and all that shes got a jolly interesting little ego im sure she has grimsdyke got up and felt in his jacket pocket heres the address give me half an hour and ill speak to him on the blower first but how about references a gp like that wouldnt take an assistant out of the blue leave it to me he said confidently its all part of the grimsdyke service dr potterphipps practised in park lane from the first floor of a large modern block of flats though the only indication of this was a small silver plate with his name on the door as discreet as the single hat in a bond street milliners window downstairs i was saluted by the doorman bowed to by the porter and grinned at by the lift boy upstairs the door was opened by a butler dr potterphipps himself who sat in a consultingroom like a filmproducers office was a slim goodlooking fairhaired middleaged man wearing a grey suit with narrow trousers a red carnation in his buttonhole a fawn waistcoat a white stiff collar and an old etonian tie a frightful tragedy dear boy he said languidly offering me a gold cigarettecase my partners perforated his duodenal ulcer poor fellow operated on by old sir james last night hell be away a good three months its so terribly difficult to get a suitable man to replace him this is a rather special practice you understand he held his cigarette with his fingertips and waved it airily we have rather special patients to some people the national health service did not come quite as the crowning gift of parliamentary democracy they still like manners with their medicine id certainly be pleased to meet some of them sir i said feelingly of course youve been out of the country a good time he went on you must have found that himalayan expedition quite fascinating grimsdyke told me about it when he rang up i met him at the races last weekend and rather hoped he could help us when this disaster occurred a remarkable young man oh remarkable i must be getting old dear boy but i find most young doctors today are terribly dull and they will treat their patients like guineapigs it must be the result of this frightful slavedriving in medical schools these days when i was at st georges medicine was still acquired slowly like any other gentlemanly accomplishment but someone with the alpine temperament like yourself would be eminently suitable did you meet old charrington in the himalayas charrington no i dont think i did really he looked surprised but hes always shinning up mountains and things big place of course the himalayas oh of course i had decided to stand up draw a deep breath make a confession and go directly to the agency to throw myself at the mercy of mr pycraft then dr potter went onconsider yourself engaged whatjust like that just like that dear boy im rather conceited that i can judge my fellow men he sighed i wish i could do the same with horses so much more profitable by the way if you want any salary ask the secretary next door in my family he continued pleasantly we never discuss money its thought rather vulgar and forgive mebut perhaps youve something a little more formal to wear i looked down at my new suit i suppose you picked it up in tibet or somewhere he suggested charitably heres the name of my tailor ask him to make you something quickly and charge it to the practice its a chastening thought but good clothes are more important to the gp than a good stethoscope you neednt worry about a carwe run three rolls three we have an extra one for the electrocardiograph do you know how to use it oh yes sir i said eagerly glad at last to be able to tell the truth at st swithins they taught on the heart most thoroughly im glad terribly glad im a little hazy about all those beastly dials and wires and things myself but i must say once youve connected them up to the patient and pulled a few switches it makes them feel very much better we got it secondhand from a doctor who went abroad and i thought it worth using i take it to almost every case after all even in neuralgia and appendicitis its useful to know what the hearts up to isnt it and two cars arriving at the patients door makes so much difference when can you start tomorrow that afternoon i again found myself in a tailors but this time it was a dark dusty devout little shop in savile row where the assistants moved with a funereal tread everyone spoke in whispers and the customers were measured in cubicles of dark carved wood like choirstalls what sort of suit did you have in mind sir asked the old man who was pulling a tapemeasure shakily round my middle whats the welldressed doctor about town wearing these days you cant go wrong with the black jacket and striped trousers sir he said solemnly a lot of the younger gentlemen in the medical profession are favouring ordinary lounge suits these days sir one surgical gentleman i couldnt care to mention even goes so far ashe dropped his eyestweed sir very well black jacket and striped trousers it is i am glad sir he said i really am just like old times sir i took a bedsittingroom in bayswater and arrived for work in park lane the next morning as i was still wearing my oxford street suit even dr potterphipps good manners did not prevent a pained look crossing his face when i appeared as though i were suffering from some exuberant skin disease perhaps dear boy he suggested you should stay in the background for awhile get to know the practice would you like to wear a white coat so easy to get ones clothes messy doing clinical tests with strange apparatus for a week i spent my time in the small laboratory converted from a bathroom performing medicalstudent pathology at five guineas a go then my black jacket and striped trousers arrived and i was allowed to try my hand at park lane medicine i started at the top my first patient was a duke during the morning potterphipps hurried into the laboratory where i was preparing blood samples for the first time i saw him looking worried a terrible thing has happened dear boy he announced i prepared to hear that someone had dropped dead in the waitingroom its my morning to visit old skye and lewis and now this damn film actress has gone and got laryngitis which one shall i go to he paced the floor trying to solve this grave therapeutic problem couldnt one wait i asked dear boy he said patiently in this sort of practice no one waits after some minutes he decided ill take the actress the newspapers will be there by now yes definitely the actress i can bring the electrocardiograph tooits important to see that the heart will stand the strain in such a nervous creature you do the duke and pray dear boyhe laid a hand on my sleeveremember constantly that for all practical purposes you and i at any rate are not living in an egalitarian society i shall not fail you sir i said stoutly good fellow he made for the door whats wrong with the duke i called after him just give him his usual treatment he replied over his shoulder and disappeared i drove to the duke of skye and lewis in our number two rolls feeling as if i were again going to an examination one outstanding problem worried me what was the dukes usual treatment apart from the electrocardiograph our practice did not own much medical equipment and i had with me only a stethoscope a throat torch a gadget for measuring the gap in sparking plugs a short plastic ruler advertising a cough mixture a silverplated presentation bottleopener and a small brush for cleaning my lighter with which to effect my ministrations the car stopped outside a door in eaton square as i got out i said to the chauffeur you must have taken dr potterphipps here a good few times i dont suppose you know what the blueblooded old boys usual treatment is do you he shrugged his shoulders sorry doctor there was a duke what lived round the corner i remember and he had varicose veins there was another with prostate trouble up the roadbut come to think of it he was an earl the door was opened by a young maid the doctor i said suddenly feeling that i was delivering the groceries this way i followed her tugging at the edge of my new jacket for support could i conceivably ask this girl what the usual treatment was then it struck me that i should have to start referring to my patient in a more regular manner this was my second difficulty in the case although i had secretly bought the silvercovered book invaluable to young englishmen wanting to get ontitles and forms of address a guide to their correct usei had found the paragraphs more difficult to memorize than my anatomy and physiology i summoned the pages urgently to mind but in the perverted way that i could always remember in examinations the full structural formula of anhydrohydroxyprogesterone and forget all the signs of pneumonia i now recalled only that the wives of the younger sons of earls share their husbands titles and honorific initials never appear on visitingcards his grace will see you in a minute said the maid his grace that was it but did i call him your grace or was that only for the archbishop of canterbury and york the duke of skye and lewis was a fat redfaced man with a large moustache lying on his bed in a yellow silk dressinggown morning doctor he said amiably i had a call to say potterphipps couldnt come pity busy this time of the year i shouldnt wonder yes er youryoursir have a seat youre not rushed for a minute are you potterphipps said you knew everything about my case but i like to have a chat with my doctor i dont like being pulled about by someone i dont know its almost indecent doctorings a mantoman business whatever you cook up these days in testtubes do you play golf we argued about mashie shots for ten minutes then the duke said with a sigh of resignation well doctor i suppose its time for you to give me the usual treatment of course the usual treatment i stood up and rubbed my hands slowly together and how i asked craftily is the usual complaint about the same i see i nodded sagely there was a pause lets get on with it doctor the duke continued settling himself on the bed a brave man about to face an ordeal the sooner its started the sooner its finished what the devil could it be manipulation of the vertebrae syphonage of the sinuses something internal with irrigation hypnosis come along doctor the duke was becoming impatient potterphipps does it in a jiffy with his bare hands i blurted out now desperate perhaps you will forgive me for asking sir oh the new ones theyre in the box on the chimneypiece i shot a glance hopefully towards the fireplace but met only an unhelpful ormolu clock and some statuettes of course sir new ones they need new ones this time and no mistake the duke went on waggling his feet suddenly i sawi had been summoned to change his cornplasters at the end of the operation the duke said i suppose youll be expecting the same sort of outrageous fee as old potterphipps i really couldnt say i told him smiling with relief i never discuss the money side of it neither do i he agreed in my family its thought rather vulgar dr potterphipps ran his practice as efficiently as a motorcar factory every morning at eight three men in green overalls arrived with vacuum cleaners at eightfifteen a man dressed as a postilion called with the days supply of clean towels at eighttwenty a pageboy brought the waitingroom papers and magazines at eightthirty a girl looking like lady macbeth with pernicious anaemia came from a west end florists to change the flowers at eightforty a fat man in a frockcoat and bowler entered with dr potterphipps freshlypressed suits at eightfifty the chauffeurs the butler the secretary and the nurse appeared and at nine sharp we were open for business the nurse was needed only to show patients from the waitingroom to the consultingroom and was dressed in a white uniform so crisp and sparkling that she always appeared to have been just unwrapped from cellophane she was also one of the prettiest girls i had ever met which had spurred me to start a cosy conversation of hospital reminiscences during my first mornings work i havent actually been a nurse in hospital darling she told me of course i looked after my poor sister when she was poorly but im not what youd calf an invalids nurse razzys such a sweet he gave me the job because he said i looked the part i played a nurse once in men in white did you see it i said no after all darling its not as if anyone we saw here was ill we just dont have those sort of patients do we darling she was right most of our practice consisted of old gentlemen wondering if they could take out more life insurance young gentlemen wondering if theyd caught unfortunate diseases and young women wondering if they were pregnant anyone seriously ill was immediately sent north of oxford street to the consultants who kept in most successfully with razzy it was st swithins casualtyroom again first class but even dr hocketts practice would have been bearable with three rollsroyces everyone seemed to like razzy and i soon became as fond of him as the rest of his employees he was a shrewd clinician who had the supreme medical gift of always knowing whether a patient was really ill or not he was an equally shrewd business man whose polite patter about money always made people give him more and accept less the only faintly shady part of the practice was our electrocardiograph an instrument for taking electrical records of the heart which represented the conflict between razzy the doctor and razzy the financier he knew that as a diagnostic aid it was almost useless but he hated not seeing a return on his capital it was an old model as untidy as an experimental television set but every time he set out on a professional visit the electrocardiograph followed in its rolls the only occasion i saw razzy looking worried after the case of the dukes corn plasters was the morning he returned from an urgent call to a newspaper owner who had suffered a stroke in the bathroom a near thing dear boy he told me as he came through the door shaking his head a damn near thing what did you pull him through oh no the old boys dead but i only got the electrocardiograph there in the nick of time our most constant and most profitable patients in the practice were several dozen neurotic women all of whom were in love with razzy he had long soothing telephone conversations with them frequently during the day and they often appeared dramatically at the front door in the evening dressed up like an advertisement for cartiers yes of course theyre in love with me dear boy he stated one day speaking quite objectively its the only thing that keeps most of them from suicide what else would you expect me to do but surely razzy i protested dont you sometimes find it rather awkward not in the least dear boy i dont have to be in love with them my spell in razzys practice was delightful i soon forgot dr hockett jasmine and the wilkins family and even managed to shift wilson willowick and wellbeloved from the front of my mind although i was never allowed to treat the aristocracy again he let me try my hand at a few actors and an mp or two until i had worked my way so deeply into the practice that a reminder of my impermanence came as a shock im seeing my partner tomorrow razzy said one saturday morning when i had been with him over two months hes coming along famously absolutely famously well have him back in another few weeks im glad i lied and i expect youre simply itching to get back to the himalayas again arent you dear boy well not itching exactly im so pleased you came to help us out youve done terribly well you know all my old dears think the world of you the wife of that coal board fellow told me yesterday you were a pet ill certainly be sorry to leave ive even thought of having a go at a practice somewhere round here myself for a second razzys eyes narrowed i wouldnt advise it dear boy i really wouldnt its quite a dogs life really the struggle to get startedterrible and the competition most frightful youd be far better off in the himalayas there were no patients waiting so we stood for a while looking silently out of the window it was a brilliant spring day the buds on the trees in hyde park were straining like hatching chicks the passersby were stepping along jauntily without their overcoats and even the park lane traffic smelt warmly exciting spring dear boy said razzy with a contented sigh as if hearing that a millionaire had fallen a couple of floors down our liftshaft he stayed watching the people hurrying away for their weekends do you know dear boy i havent had an afternoon off since i met that fellow grimsdyke at the races thats the sort of practice were in always on tap its what they pay for i suppose after a pause he added i know its your free afternoon but i wondered if youd care to do a little fortholding more than delighted razzy honestly bless you dear boy then im off to sunningdale ill dine out and turn up about midnight in case there are any messages everyone will be out of town on a weekend like this anyway after lunch he changed into flannels rang up a wellknown film actress and persuaded her to keep him company picked up his clubs and set off for the links in the number one rolls alone in the flat i slipped off my shoes and sprawled on the soft curtained couch used for examining patients in the consultingroom beside me i arranged a pile of the new yorker and life recent advances in surgery a reprint of the citadel a box of chocolates id found in the secretarys desk and the bottle of cordon bleu brandy kept in the medicine cupboard i hoped that razzy had an enjoyable day off but i saw no reason for working on a saturday afternoon myself in discomfort before he had been away half an hour the doorbell rang i jumped up pulled on my shoes swiftly pushed my comforts under the couch and opened the door on the mat was a tall amiable looking man with a droopy white moustache who wore a tweed suit and carried a heavy dispatchcase embossed with the royal cypher in gold good afternoon he said pleasantly i have an appointment with dr potterphipps i looked puzzled my private secretary arranged it earlier in the week im afraid saturday afternoon is my only free time at present i hope it is not unduly inconvenient for the doctor im terribly sorry but theres been a mistake i said letting him in dr potterphipps is away at the moment im his assistant just a minute and ill look at the book thank you my name is beecham it seemed simpler to call here than to ask him to visit me he smiled and no doubt more economical but im afraid the appointment was made for next saturday oh dear how infuriating this is not the first time such a mistake has occurred and next saturday i shall be in edinburgh he assessed me perhaps i could have a consultation with you instead doctor i did rather want to be off to the country this lovely afternoon i should be very pleased i told him with a brief bow kindly come into the consultingroom you will be wanting my medical history first no doubt he went on as he sat down i have it specially tabulated in my mind age sixtyone married occupation cabinet minister usual childhood complaints im not going too fast did you say cabinet minister that was flying high even for us i am the minister of inland development he added modestly as though referring to a favourable golf handicap i suddenly remembered seeing his photograph in the papers a week ago snipping a tape and giving the country another bridge he seemed a pleasant old boy but as i had never even seen a cabinet minister before i wondered how to address him i decided to play for safety and treat him roughly like a duke of course sir i said imim terribly sorry not to have recognized you at once please forgive me now perhaps youd be so kind as to allow me to ask you a few questions he folded his arms of course doctor do exactly what you wish i place myself entirely in your hands as i was saying to the minister of health yesterday what on earths the use of seeing a doctor if you dont follow his advice disregarding entirely your own opinion of the complaint he said your own opinion of the doctor was possibly more important my patient smiled of course he was only joking he has quite a wit oh quite now whats the trouble sir as the minister seemed to be suffering from pains connected with the spinal column i pointed to the examination couch and told him to take his clothes off all my clothes doctor yes please i want a good look at you anything you say of course i had just drawn the curtains round him as he started unbuttoning his waistcoat when the bell rang again just a minute i said on the doormat i found an attractive tall dark woman with a mink cape slipping off her shoulders who clutched at her throat and cried oh god oh god im going to die all i could think of saying was here i say steady on she pushed past me threw herself on the waitingroom couch and burst into tears i quickly shut off the minister of inland development in the consultingroom if i can possibly help you dear lady i said anxiously i certainly will but if you could perhaps control yourself a little razzy she cried razzy darling where is he dr erasmus potterphipps happens to have taken the afternoon off hes playing golf hes with another woman she sobbed janet said hed asked that bitch helen well dash it only golf i murmured i began to feel i was not showing the mastery of the situation expected from the medical attendant during my two months in park lane i had learned more about handling difficult people than in five years at st swithins where most of the patients treated the doctors with the same frightened respect they gave the police but the dynamic women in dr potterphipps unilateral lovelife were beyond me the girl moaned covered her face with her hands and cried what shall i do what shall i do i want to die thats all to dieto die as i was deciding what to try next she suddenly looked up as if she had never seen me before who are you she asked im dr potterphipps assistant i said politely can i help you no one can help me her face was pale her eyeshadow was streaked down her cheeks her hat was awry with emotion suddenly she threw aside her arms and began to scream my visitor had at least no disease of the respiratory system there was nothing of the wronged womans sobs about her when she screamed she took a deep breath braced her larynx and let fly like the knockingoff whistle in a shipyard please please i shouted cant you compose yourself she immediately drew another breath and started again now pummelling her forehead with her fists and hammering her heels on the floor by now i was less worried about her clinical conditionshe was obviously well filled with the life forcethan about my reputation the most solemn piece of clinical advice we had received in st swithins was never to treat a female patient unless a nurse was present and any minute now the door would probably be broken down by the porters the police or the fire brigade all thirsting to play st george damnation i cried stop it she settled herself in a higher key and continued here was a major clinical problem the gynaecological instruction at st swithins was excellent but had included no advice on the way to treat hysterical women singlehanded fortunately i remembered from reading novels that the traditional remedy was a sharp slap across the face and overcoming the inhibitions of an english public school education i crouched down and caught her a smart smack on the left cheekbone instead of this quelling her she immediately countered with a powerful left uppercut which knocked me off my balance and started picking up all the movable pieces of furniture in the waitingroom and throwing them at me i managed to struggle to my feet from a pile of broken china and glass torn magazines and telephone directories just in time to prevent her concussing me with the standardlamp what the devil do you think youre up to i demanded angrily i gripped her arms are you trying to kill me or something you struck a woman through her redistribution of energy she had thankfully stopped screaming you cad of course i did for your own good you idiotic female why youre as hysterical as a cat stuck in a chimneypot she looked at me closely narrowing her eyes i hate you she hissed then she fell into my arms and collapsed into humble tears after some minutes of patting her on the back and murmuring consolation i said dont you think you ought to go home and lie down if you like ill give you a prescription for a sedative have a good sleepyoull feel ever so much better she blew her nose miserably ill stay here until razzy comes back but dr potterphipps may be away all night i mean he might have to go to a case somewhere after his golf i said quickly id go home now if i were you still clutching me she asked pathetically take me home please take me i couldnt face it not alone really thats asking rather a lot you know please its not far i hesitated oh all right then i had to get rid of her somehow if you promise to behave yourself on the way she nodded her head i promise she said like a penitent schoolgirl i left the flat and helped her down the stairs to the street i called a taxi and we got in together who is there to look after you i asked she shook her head havent you any relatives or friends you could get hold of i hate them all i turned and stared at the beautiful blue and gold afternoon outside and wished i had been dr potterphipps caddie the girl lived at the far end of curzon street and we drove along in silence suddenly she announced more cheerfully you know ive been a bloody fool i swung round and found her carefully doing her makeup i must say youve been acting a little oddly even for this part of the world she smiled for the first time i am a silly thing arent i fancy getting all worked up like that i suppose i did have rather a lot to drink at lunch time that always sends me off the rails a bit didnt you think i was crazy it did cross my mind to send for the strongarm squad i admit im so glad you didnt and such a heavenly day too she closed her compact with a snap here we are wont you come in for a minute and have a drink i should think you need one i really dont think i should come on ill ring the exchange and have your calls put through to my number razzy often does i wavered being alone with female patients was bad enough going to their flats afterwards for drinks would certainly raise every eyebrow on the general medical council still it was spring just a quick one then i said my names kitty she told me opening the door ive only got a very tiny flat but make yourself at home razzy does the flat would have taken my bayswater room a dozen times and was furnished with an amiable extravagance that must have taken razzys fancy kitty immediately threw open the window took a deep breath and trilled spring spring spring isnt it lovely dont you adore the spring with the primroses and the cowslips and the bluebells and things i swore id have a windowbox this year whatll you have to drink darling ive started on brandy this afternoon already im afraid so i suppose id better go on if youve got any sure my pet brandy it is the place is stiff with it she brought from the cupboard two tumblers and a bottle with a plain label bearing only a crown and the date here steady on i called as she halffilled both glasses im sure that stuffs supposed to be drunk by the thimbleful heres to life she said taking a large drink thats better then she sat on the sofa beside me tell me about yourself theres not much to tell i licked my lips savouring the brandy im dr potterphippss temporary assistant thats all youre very young to be a doctor as a matter of factand it must prove something because i wouldnt tell it to everybodyi havent been a doctor very long i could tell you hadnt much practical experience the moment i fell into your arms in your flat oh dear and i thought i was being such a commanding figure she laughed by the way i said modestly im sorry i clocked you one and im sorry i clocked you one too doctor darling we both laughed and had some more brandy after a while everything seemed to become very cosy it must be wonderful being a doctor she said dreamily curing people who are stricken there isnt all that much curing in it and fortunately most of the people arriving on our doormat arent very stricken but its lovely to have someone to sympathize with you and hold your hand and tell you youre wonderful even if youre not really ill thats where razzys so marvellous have you noticed his eyes she threw back her head hypnotic cruelly hypnotic im afraid i cant reach those heights but i can certainly sympathize with you and i held her handtell you youre wonderful youre sweet she said getting up im going to change i helped myself to another halftumbler of her brandy which had the effect of producing a pleasant conscious detachment from the world like addiction to morphia i recognized cheerfully that i was getting myself into a dangerous situation my conduct was certainly becoming infamous in a professional respect for kittys entering our waitingroom and smashing the furniture on my head had placed us henceforward in a professional relationship what should i do about it i felt in my wallet for the bma booklet on ethics and turning over the pages found a great deal of sound advice on the size of doctors doorplates feesplitting and association with the clergy but nothing on the tantalizing frontier between professional and social obligations where i was now dancing a faint fresh breeze rustled the curtains and a bird started singing on the windowledge and what the hell i thought its spring i put the book away and drank some more brandy kitty came back wearing a nйgligй hows it going she asked cheerfully im responding to treatment have some more of your brandy liquor should be quaffed not sipped heres to life doctor darling heres to you patient pet we drank with linked arms with a sigh she stretched herself on the sofa she held out her arms and smiled doctor darling she murmured invitingly i licked my lips there was a terrible risk making love to a patientbut damn it alone with a beautiful woman wasnt it worth it was i a man or a mouse anyway i couldnt possibly disappoint her come to me she breathed how lovely she looked but how much more lovely she would look lying there without any clothes on at all i jumped up get me a taxi i shouted quick and what i wondered would i now say to the minister of inland development when i dashed into the flat i found a note neatly pinned to the examination couch dear doctor i fear that some dire emergency has called you away i fully realize the trials of a doctors life and that some poor soul is in a worse state than me however lying on your couch seems to have relieved the discomfort and as i am so anxious to get away this afternoon i will go round the corner to an osteopath recommended by the minister of works with thanks for your attention yrs george beecham i had lost razzy a patient but my personal honour and probably my professional life were saved by the politician i hoped he would become prime minister and since that afternoon i have always read his speeches in the newspapers i did not tell razzy the full story until the day that i was leaving the practice really he said mildly poor kitty i wonder what on earth you did to her psychology bolting like that i really must go round and see her soon and another thing i said gazing at the carpet there arent any himalayas as far as im concerned i mean i wasnt going to let on about it butwell youve been so good to me razzy i hadnt the heart not to confess ive worked here under false pretences but im glad dear boy terribly glad frightfully uncomfortable it must be in all that snow and ice so what other plans have you i thought id stay on in london for a bit and work for my fellowship thanks to you ive got a few quid in the bank to pay the rent and i might be able to make a little by standingin for doctors at weekends you see i told him solemnly im still determined to become a surgeon and good luck to you dear boy he added indulgently as though i were a schoolboy saying i wanted to be an enginedriver ive always found surgery fascinating completely fascinating let me know if theres ever anything i can do for you would you like a bonus the secretary will fix it upyou know i loathe discussing money we shook hands and i stepped from out of the glossy picture of fashionable medicine for ever i now had saved enough to pay off my hundredpound debt to wilson willowick and wellbeloved and to maintain a modest medicalstudent standard of living until the primary fellowship examination of the royal college of surgeons in six weeks time i kept my room in bayswater took copies of grays anatomy and starlings physiology from lewiss medical lending library borrowed a box of bones from a friend at st swithins and continued my surgical career the fellowship like all british postgraduate examinations is run on the grand national principle except that the highest fence is placed immediately in front of the tapes before you can enter for the final exam you have first to pass the primary in anatomy and physiology subjects which are learnt in the second year of medical school and forgotten in the fourth i had now to reopen the pages i had sweated over on coffeedrenched nights five years ago unpleasantly aware that such traditional aidesmemoire for the student as the lingual nerve took a swerve around the hyoglossus well im mucked said whartons duct the blighters doublecrossed us were inadequate for the fellowship examiners who wanted to know the exact seventyfour relations of the lingual nerve and what it did in the monkey dog and rabbit as well i worked at my books fairly happily for three months in razzys practice had given me the feeling of being a man of the world who could deal with dukes manage cabinet ministers and chum along with beautiful women and could therefore confidently approach such prosaic individuals as the fellowship examiners this was my first mistake my second mistake was arriving for the examination in my black jacket and striped trousers i had learnt in my first year as a medical student that the correct wear for facing examiners was a wellpressed neatlydarned threadbare old suit which invited them to take a kindly attitude of superiority appearing in a savile row outfit was like arriving at the bankruptcy court in a rolls but this did not occur to me as i made my way through the crowd of candidates in queen square before the war the fellowship was a private affair in which a few dozen young men were treated to an afternoons intellectual chat with the examiners and the proceedings were said to be interrupted for tea since the national health service the examination has been run on massproduction lines but the traditional politeness of the examiners is steadfastly maintained they politely made no comment on my harley street appearance beyond smiling a little more heartily than usual in greeting they brushed aside my ignorance of the precise location of the middle meningeal artery as unimportant among friends they accepted my inability to identify the pathological specimens in glass jars as understandable between surgical gentlemen the last examiner politely handed me a pickled brain and said that sir was removed postmortem from a man of seventy what do you find of interest in it after a while i admitted i see only the usual senile changes sir they are not unusual these changes you mean sir oh no sir after all the patient was senile alas he said gently and i shall be seventysix myself next birthday thank you sir for reminding me that i am rapidly getting past it all good day to you sir politely they thanked me politely they bowed me out just as politely they failed me because i had been overconfident this depressed me more deeply than ploughing any of my student examinations once more i began opening my british medical journal from the back but i was so dispirited that all i could bring myself to read in the rest of the pages was the obituaries these are prepared on the first second or thirdclass funeral principle overworked gps succumbing in early life getting small print at the end consultants larger type wellspaced out and leaders of the profession whom everyone has thought dead long ago appearing with a photograph taken when they were twentyfour all that could be said about the majority of dead doctors seemed to be that they were kind to their patients popular with their colleagues and liked walking in ireland at the most they had a disease named after them i began to get deeply miserable about the futility of my profession and wondered if i should have gone into the church instead i found a parttime job helping a doctor in brixton and decided that if i gave up smoking i could afford to work for the next primary fellowship examination three months later after a week i began to suspect he was doing abortions on the side and i thought id better leave my money was running out again and i saw my muswell hill days returning it was a moment of gathering depression then late one evening i had a telephone call from grimsdyke where the devil have you got to old lad he said crossly as i leant on the coinbox in the hall and heard every door onthe landing creak ajar ive been trying to get you all over the place have you become a ruddy hermit or something ive been working for my primary bit of a perversion this lovely weather isnt it i take it that now youve left park lane youre not in paid employment good then perhaps you could help me out ive got an uncle who practises in the depths of the countryyou know simple rural gp beloved by all full of homespun philosophy and never washes his handswhose partners off for his months holiday when i qualified i said id help him out but unfortunately i have a pressing professional engagement elsewhere would you fill the breach i thought you were a country gp on a different sort of level cant explain now how about it i hesitated i wondered if it was wholly fair to judge grimsdykes relations by himself say you will old lad he pressed you can take your books and whistle through the work its a peaceful as a museum down there but theres a nice pub next door and a pretty little bit in the post office if you feel like relaxation as well tell meis this uncle of yours married grimsdyke laughed a widower one daughter permanently settled in australia how about it i glanced round the dirty stuffy hall of my lodgings with the greasy greenbaize board that would grow a crop of bills by next friday morning well thats the spirit ill send you directions and a map can you start on monday the old boys name is farquharson hes a funny old stick but he thinks absolutely the world of me after my first disastrous foray into general practice the prospect of playing the country gp for a month was alarming also i was a true londoner who always felt uneasy beyond the friendly grin of the lptb bus stops or in the company of cows sheep carthorses goats pigs and other animals unknown in leicester square but my confidence increased the next monday afternoon as i drove haemorrhagic hilda deeper into the countryside which wore a look of ripe and gentle peacefulness rarely captured outside brewers advertisements the village itself lay far from the main road at the end of a winding lane in which a herd of cows responding to the cowattracting substance with which all cars are seemingly secretly coated by the manufacturers licked hilda over at their leisure my new home consisted of a few houses a couple of shops the church the vicarage and the four horsehoes in the middle was a triangular green on which a horse stared at me in offended surprise across the green was dr farquharsons house shaggy with creeper its brass plate shining like a new penny in the sun its front garden brilliant with flowers among which bees and wasps buzzed as contentedly as the people lunching off expenses in the savoy grill as dr farquharson was still on his rounds i was shown into the empty consultingroom by his housekeeper this was a small dark apartment tucked into the back of the house containing a dirty sink an oldfashioned sterilizer heated with a spirit lamp like a coffee machine and an examination couch covered with white american cloth that looked as uninviting to lie upon naked as a fishmongers slab in one corner was a bookcase untidily filled with medical textbooks mostly by scottish authors and all out of date in another stood a dusty pile of old copies of the bmj and lancet i shook my head sadly looking round i could see no haemoglobinometer no erythrocytesedimentationrate apparatus no sphygmomanometer no microscope no ophthalmoscope no centrifuge no auroscope no patella hammer no spatulae no speculae no proteinometer no pipettesit seemed to me impossible for anyone to practise medicine in the room at all dr farquharson turned out to be a tall bony scot with thick white hair goldrimmed spectacles and big nobbly hands he was dressed in a pair of patched tweed trousers a black alpaca jacket a striped shirt a wing collar and a spotted bow tie afternoon gordon he said dryly as though we had parted just an hour ago so youve come to help out an old fogy in the depths of the country have you hows that rascal of a nephew of mine he seems very well sir how the good lord ever let him qualify i dont know he hasnt half a brain in his head and the rest of his cerebral space is filled up with a mixture of laziness and lubricity lets have a cup of tea tea was served under a mulberry tree in the garden by the housekeeper whom farquharson introduced as mrs bloxage whos painstakingly kept my feet dry and my socks darned since my poor wife succumbed to phthisis desperata eighteen years ago we had raspberries and cream tomato and cress sandwiches brown bread and honey buttered toast and homemade strawberry jam scones and shortbread and three kinds of cake one of the few advantages for an outofdate old man like me practising medicine in the back of beyond farquharson continued helping himself to more cream is that the patients still bring you a little something out of the goodness of their hearts theyre simple souls and havent tumbled to it that the doctors now a civil servant like the sanitary engineer what do you think of these raspberries delicious sir arent they old mrs crocketts varicose ulcer produces them year after year when he had finished eating farquharson lit his pipe pressed down the burning tobacco with a metal tongue spatula from his top pocket and went on the works pretty easy round here i suppose theres hardly enough for two especially this time of the year but im glad enough to have someone to yarn toim a bit of an old bore you know i was out in west africa a good deal of my life i settled down here because i totted up the ages on the gravestones across the way and averaged out that this village has the lowest death rate in the country i find plenty to interest myself in the natural history of the countrysidewhich includes the inhabitants and in a couple of years the governments going to chuck me out as too old and incompetent for anything except sitting on my backside and drawing my pension god knows what ill do then but im rusty all right cant understand half the words in the lancet these days he slapped me on the knee you can put me right on all that my lad i suppose you know about these drugs theyre bringing out like editions of the evening papers you must give me a lecture on em some time im just an old fogy of a country gp he pulled a large gold watch from his pocket im off to see a couple of patients before surgery settle in and ill see you for supper supper was cold salmon the squires gallstones cream cheese the postmistresss backache and to celebrate my arrival a glass of port the vicars hernia farquharson chatted entertainingly enough about west africa neatly comparing his native and his present patients but i realized that he was as out of place in modern medicine as a jar of leeches there were clearly several points on which i should be putting him right within a week i discovered that medicine in the country is wholly different from medicine practised anywhere else in the first place most of the patient suffer from diseases totally unknown to medical science at st swithins i examined my patients confident that their condition could be found somewhere between the green morocco covers of frenchs index of diagnosis but in the country i puzzled over the significance of symptoms like horseshoes pressing on the head larks in the stomach and ferrets running up and down the spine at night even dr farquharsons former diagnoses were obscured by the patients helpfully remembering the name it taking me some time to recognize for instance that the woman complaining her child had been attacked by the infant tiger meant that he was suffering from impetigo secondly the visit of the medical attendant in most households provided less relief for the sufferer than entertainment for the rest of the family the cry of coo its the doctor brought children running from their corners as powerfully as the smell of baking cakes arriving in the sickroom i found it difficult to place the fingertips together and demand with dignity and how about the bowels when half a dozen small boys and girls were staring at me as though i were the hanging scene in a punchandjudy show when i insisted on having them shooed away they continued the enjoyment by taking turns to peer round the door and my careful assessment of the pitch of a percussion note was often ruined by the awestruck whisper passing down the corridor hes punching poor mummy all over the chest in houses where there were no children the patients reflected the more leisurely life of the country by using their attack of gastritis or summer flu to give the doctor a resume of their life story and their opinions on their relatives a brisk good morning and what can i do for you as i approached the bedside generally brought a contemplative folding of hands across the abdomen a faraway look a deep sigh and the reply well doctor in the war i was standing in a trench at vimy or i havent been the same doctor since that night me usband joined the buffaloes when i mentioned these discoveries to farquharson after supper one evening he said oh folk need to unburden themselves a bit they dont like boring their friends and their relatives wont listen to em any more theyre scared of the parson so the doctors the only one left they can pour their hearts out to he began to scrape out the bowl of his pipe with a scapel he kept on the mantelpiece ive got oldfashioned ideas but that seems to me part of the doctors job thats something they never took into account when they got up this health service bloody silly isnt it ask any gp and hell tell you half his job is sympathizing with people and thats ten times as difficult as treating em did you use the thermometer i couldnttheres only one in the surgery and its broken its broken all right if i cant tell when a patients feverish im not much of a doctor but shove it under their tongue lad and youve shut em up as long as you like or you can stick your stethoscope in your earsits not much good for anything else round here because half of em think theyll drop dead if they take their vests off or you can take their pulse and scowl at em while you wonder what the devils the matter that shuts em up good and proper you dont even need a watch i couldnt afford a watch when i qualified so i used to stare at my cupped hand instead and nobody found out for eighteen months as for the audience always give em something to do the public loves to see the vomit coming up or the baby coming down but they love it even better playing the nurse get them to boil waterpots of it when there arent any saucepans left you can always start them tearing up the best sheets for bandages he lit his pipe and went on reflectively never start off by asking a patient what are you complaining of theyll say ill have you know im not the complaining type not like some i could mention and start some rigmarole about their sisterinlaw whos been living with them since christmas dont try whats wrong with you because they like scoring one over the doctor and theyll reply i thought that was what you were here to find out that starts the consultation on the wrong foot and never ask what brought you here because ten to one theyll tell you the tram or the ambulance always listen to a patients story however long it is and however much you want your dinner usually theyve come about something quite different and theyre too embarrassed or too scared to bring it out and always give em a bottle of medicine even if you and the whole pharmaceutical society know its uselesseven a straws a comfort to a drowning man never tell them theyre an interesting case patients have got enough sense to know the only interesting cases are the ones we dont know anything about you can diagnose half your patients as soon as you step through their front door with a bit of practice brass gongs on the wall and tiger skins on the floor mean high bloodpressure box of chocolates on the piano and a pekinese on the matthats obesity bills on the dresser and cigarette ash on the parlour carpet look like a duodenal ulcer upstairs ive found aspidistras and antimacassars generally go with constipation its common sense if you keep your eyes open you wont need the curates legs sticking from under the bed to spot a case of female frustration and never be squeamish asking about insanity in the relatives i always start off how many in the asylum and youd be surprised at the answers i get even in the best families but im rambling he said apologetically you talk for a change seen any good cases today there was an unusual psychiatric one a farmer came in complaining that he experienced a strong sexual sensation every time he blew his nose farquharson stared at his burning tobacco well now that is interesting what did you say nothing much im not well up in psychiatry what would you have done i should have told him said farquharson without hesitation that some people get all the luck for the first time it occurred to me that dr farquharson knew much more medicine than i did during my month in the practice i gained six pounds in weight took on a deep sunburn and learned more practical physic from farquharson than i had gained from the whole staff of st swithins the remaining gaps in my education were completed by the village constable who was the fattest policeman outside pantomime and seemed to have the single duty of supervising the nightly closing of the four horseshoes from the inside after a pint or two he would unbutton his tunic and solemnly recount the medicolegal history of the countryside it was but a year ago as i recall he would begin with the air of a surgeon discussing a grave case with a colleague that we had an indecency down at smiths farm he frowned as he took some more beer i cant remember offhand whether it was a gross indecency or just an ordinary one but youd be surprised what goes on round ere doctor why we gets at least an indecent exposure once a week he continued to describe some of his recent cases in the odd anatomical terms used only by the police force mind you its hard work doctor he added proudly youve got to be sure of your facts it was only at the last assizes there was an ell of a row because we had a case concerning a mare and the barrister got hold of the idea it was one with a gold chain round his neck what we meant a few days before i was due to leave grimsdyke paid a visit it was clear at once that he had enjoyed a change of fortune he roared up in a bright sports car he wore a new tweed coat and a clean waistcoat his shoes shone his face was plumper and better shaved his hair was tidy and he had a brandnew monocle with a fine sparkle to it he carried a pair of yellow gloves and a bulldog puppy leapt at his heels he looked like the young squire after a good day at the races although farquharson began by asking him how the devil he had got qualified and when was he going to start a decent job of work grimsdyke still seemed to imagine himself the favourite nephew only when his uncles conversation had been reduced to a string of grunts he suggested the pair of us went out to the four horseshoes the market seems to be doing well of late i observed as we entered the bar the market oh yes yes of course its bouyant by the way i believe theres a few bob i owe you care for it now dont mind taking fivers do you its all ive got cigarettei suppose you like these black russian things now lets have a drink what can i get you a pint of bitter beer nonsense well have champagne this is an occasionthe beginning of a great medical partnership you know banting and best florey and fleming orth and pettenkofer and all that ill explain in a minute landlord your best vintage the effect was lessened by the landlord of the four horseshoes having only a beer licence so we had some special christmas brew instead now what is all this i began firmly wondering what trouble grimsdyke was concocting for me and determined to stay clear of it have you had a go at the primary yet he interrupted yes the examiners were very undiscerning if you must wear a hairshirt he said chidingly you deserve to be tickled didnt you find out where they printed the examination papers some of these printer chapsll do anything for a few quid i thought id better fail honestly at least quite right ive been a great believer in professional honesty myself since old moronic maurice told me how he got through his surgical finals at about the eighth shot i might add you know those cases they got up for the examall the old chronics the harvest of every outpatients department in london maurice spent a couple of months nosing around the teaching hospitals until he was pretty confident hed seen all the old familiar faces of course he sneaked a bloody good look at their notes to see what was wrong he went into the exam room knowing hed already examined and diagnosed every case in the place which he said gave him a wonderful feeling of confidence theres nothing very honest about that but wait a minute the examiner grabbed him by the sleeve and to his horror started dragging moronic maurice towards the one patient in the place he didnt recognize maurice realized it was the moment for honesty sir he said solemnly i feel i must inform you that i have already had an opportunity to examine this particular case in the hospital very truthful of you my lad the old boy said come and have a look at one of these over here instead so he got through quite now if youll explain what new villainy youre up to by the way i forgot to mention were both out of debt to that trio of sabretoothed tigers wilson willowick and wellbeloved both i strode in there the other day to fling their filthy lucre in their faces it was such a pleasant experience i flung a bit more for you too here are the ious we might have a pretty little ceremony burning them in the piccadilly bar dont you think look here i said in alarm youre not doing anything dishonest are you i mean false certificates and abortions and things grimsdyke looked pained have you ever known me try anything underhand outside the examination hall no old lad its simple ill let you into the secret through family influence ive got myself a good job personal doctor to old lady howkinsyou know widow of the bloke that grabbed half johannesburg and has been digging up useful little bits of gold ever since she lives in a ruddy great house near gloucester shes as mean as a tax collector in the usual way but shes pretty lavish with the cash to yours truly you mean youre a sort of clinical gigolo grimsdyke slapped down his glass in annoyance damn it i pay your bloody debts im sorry but you must admit it looks fishy on the face of it even you wouldnt admit youre a second lord horder look lady howkins is ninetyfour and to my mind as crazy as a coot but fortunately like my grandmother shes crazy about doctors all i do is recite to her the miracles of modern medicine some of which i know and some of which i mug up in the readers digest and she thinks its wonderful shes fascinated by technical stuff she knows more about things like isotopes and gastroscopes than i do and shes bound to kick the bucket any day now and youll be out of a job yes and no i have it on good authority shes left and a terrific packet in her will think of it old lad thousands of quids in the kitty taxfree just like the football pools and thats where you come in i thought we might go off for a nose round the bahamas or somewhere and set up a little clinic for tired newspaper owners film stars and so forth youd do the medicine with your park lane touch and id fix the business sideyou must admit even though i may not know an appendix from an adenoid ive a sharp eye for juggling the cash what do you say say damn it this is a bit startling think it over coming to the hospital dinner next month i nodded well discuss it again then dont think youre going to use illgotten gains old lad because theyre not i dance attendance like any other gp and call in specialists to the old dear as needed if it wasnt for me she might be shared by dozens of harley street sharks lots of people leave money to their doctors anyway must be damn brave he added reflectively have another i shook my head ive got to see some patients one thing ive learned in general practice if you smell faintly of alcohol just once the word goes round by next morning that the doctors a drunkard have one of these grimsdyke said producing a tube of tablets chlorophyll removes all unpleasant odours fools patients and policemen alike dont delude yourself the goats round here eat it all day and you should have a sniff at them the st swithins reunion dinner was held every year in the moorish room of a huge banquet factory off piccadilly circus and was anticipated by most of the guests as eagerly as christmas in an orphanage the majority of st swithins graduates were hardworking gps scattered across the country who faced ruin by being seen in the local pub or having more than two small ones in the golf club the reunion dinner was their only chance to shed their inhibitions and splash for a while in the delightful anonymity of london i had arranged to meet grimsdyke in the piccadilly bar before the dinner which was five weeks later he arrived in a new dinner jacket with a red carnation in the buttonhole smoking a cigar and looking jubilant well old lad he demanded at once have you decided ive thought the matter over very carefully i told him i must admit im a bit scared of the scheme but my present system of casual employment is precarious and i see no future for myself anywhere in england as a surgeon so ill come with you capital the only snag seems to be that this patient of yours might quite easily live to be a hundred and by that time will certainly have found out that you are simply an unprincipled but havent you heard old lad havent you heard the old dear snuffed it last week frightful pity of course but who wants to live longer than ninetyfour and look at this he pulled a long letter from his pocket typed on solicitors paper it came this morningten thousand quid ten thousand think of it all for yours truly dont bother to read it all now its full of legal stuff shove it in your pocket what an evening were going to have barman champagnethe best in the house we arrived in high spirits at the dinner and found the byzantine anteroom full of prosperouslooking middleaged gentlemen in dinnerjackets all drinking like pirates the function always followed a strict ritual and at eight oclock the dean himself climbed on a table and announced that dinner was served this was a signal for the middleaged gentlemen to cry limerick limerick until the dean coughed and obliged tradition by reciting in his lectureroom voice ahthere was an old man of manchuria who had the most painful dysuria the unfortunate chap had not only got clap but haematoporphyrinuria this brought the house down grimsdyke and myself with our old friends tony benskin and taffy evans sat round the foot of one table with mr hubert cambridge who was one of the most popular of st swithins surgeons through being entertainingly eccentric while the waiter with the chronic sinusitis was serving the chemical soup grimsdyke insisted on ordering champagne for all five of us but my dear boy can you afford it mr cambridge asked i assure you that pale ale is good enough for me sir grimsdyke said solemnly it is a token of our appreciation of your tuition at st swithins within an hour the champagne will be carbon dioxide and waterbut your teaching will remain with us all our lives and the dean says the standard of our students is dropping he said rubbing his hands tell me what are the names of your excellent young men after the soup came the mummified turbot wearing its funeral wreath of shrivelled shrimps next the poor arthritic chicken the devitaminized cabbage the vulcanized potatoes then the deliquescent ice and the strange compost on toast afterwards we faced with british composure the stern british discipline which emphasizes that life is not all feasting and gaietythe speeches they were always long at the st swithins dinner because the speakers were in the habit of lecturing for a full hour at a time to their students without fear of interruption first the dean told us what jolly good chaps st swithins men were then the visiting medical lord told us what a jolly good chap the dean was then the senior surgeon told us what jolly good chaps everyone was after that we were released into the gothic smoking room to sing the old student songs while the dean played the piano and the visiting lord conducted with a loaf of french bread we sang about the unfortunate adventures of the bakers boy who to the chandlers went the honest woman and the rogue the man who went fishing with line and rod and of the wildly psychopathic evening in kerriemuir it was difficult to see anyone in the room ever gripping their lapels and declaring no starchy foods no alcohol and no smokingthe human bodys not a machine yknow but all of them would be saying it tomorrow morning sterner than ever in the excitement of the evening i had almost forgotten that i was committed to an alarming medicocommercial adventure i was paying the waiter for a round of drinks when grimsdykes letter fell from my pocket concentrating i began to read it in the light of one of the tudor walllanterns grimsdyke had just reached the top note in the st swithins version of she was poor but she was honest when i drew him carefully to one side are you sure youve read this letter through i asked of course ive read it he said crossly every word all that guff about my being a dedicated young physician and all that i nodded perhaps youd better look at the last line again last line what are you up to old lad some sort of joke he took the letter it looks absolutely straightforward to mein recognition of your devoted service bequeaths to you the sum of ten thousand pounds his voice trailed off like a man uttering his last words while suffering death in the garrotte he finished the sentence for you to donate in its entirety within six months to the hospital performing medical research you consider the most rewarding the letter fell to the floor hard luck grim i said sorrowfully i summoned a waiter youd better swallow the rest of that tube of chlorophyll the reunion dinner nevertheless ended in a gust of ill wind that blew grimsdyke and myself a little good long after we had sadly staggered back to our lodgings mike kelly a heavy young man who had captained the first fifteen for several years and was now mr hubert cambridges house surgeon found himself standing on the empty pavement in his dinner jacket with only tenpence in his pocket he resigned himself to walking back to the hospital deciding to go by way of covent garden because he had heard that the pubs opened in the early hours to slake the thirsts of the busy fruiterers unfortunately alcohol always had a confusing effect on mike kelly and after trying to buy a drink in st peters hospital for stone and stricture under the impression that it was the strand palace hotel he demonstrated his belief that the royal opera house was a gentlemens convenience when a policeman shouted at him unnecessarily ere what do you think youre doing mike kelly made what he thought at the time to be the smartest remark of his life beaming at the constable he announced benignly officer i am picking bloody gooseberries mike was then taken to nearby bow street and charged with being drunk and disorderly as his head began to clear in the sobering surroundings he remembered the only fact that had ever struck him as useful in his forensic medicine lectures if you are charged with being drunk you can choose your own doctor to come and examine you disorderly yes he said sternly to the sergeant drunk definitely no i bet my bloodalcohol isnt even point one per cent i demand my own doctor at once all right by us itll save the police surgeon getting out of bed and who is your doctor doctor mike kelly drew himself to add dignity to his wordsjohn harcourt bottle master of arts at the university of cambridge licentiate of the royal college of physicians of london member of the royal college of surgeons all right all right wheres he to be found ring the resident medical staff quarters at st swithins hospital ask for continued mike deflating slightly the assistant junior resident anaesthetist john bottle who had been continuing the party with the other residents in his room on the top floor of the staff quarters expressed himself indignant over the telephone that the police should have submitted a member of the medical profession to such shame he spoke at some length giving the sergeant his opinion on his conduct demanding an immediate apology hinting at substantial compensation and threatening to write to his mp he then declared that he would summon a taxi and appear immediately to put this regrettable matter to rights the result of his intervention was not one doctor being charged with being drunk and disorderly in bow street that night but two this was too much even for st swithins whose staff and governors showed remarkable tolerance towards purple paint on the statues carthorses in the quadrangle and camiknickers flying from the flagstaff on the morning of the lord mayors visit to avoid disproportionate damage to their careers the staff committee sent kelly and bottle on unpaid leave for the rest of their appointment leaving two gaps on the resident staff until the next batch of students qualified in three months time as mike kelly had brought himself to his confused state by sympathizing with grimsdyke at the dinner he suggested his misfortune might at least be turned to the gain of his friends grimsdyke and i hurried to st swithins to see mr cambridge and introduced ourselves as the charming young gentlemen who had been so appreciative of his teaching the night before the next day i had become his temporary senior house surgeon and grimsdyke was assistant junior resident to the hospitals anaesthetics department im only a ruddy stuffist grimsdyke complained but by george were lucky to get paid work at all in our present state its hard luck on old mike though i too was sorry for our former classmates but i was overwhelmingly delighted to be back in st swithins the disappointment of my earlier departure was wiped out i was at last a senior house surgeon if not an official one there were hopes of resuscitating my moribund surgical career and it would be a delicious affront to bingham i returned to the staff quarters the tall cold sooty building between the hospital laundry and the mortuary that had been used as the ear nose and throat wards until condemned by the governors as unfit for the housing of patients mike kellys room was next to the one allotted bingham who was hurrying down the corridor in his white coat as i struggled in with my luggage he pulled up short we had not met since the incident in the lift he seemed uncertain what to say he looked more boyish more untidy more pimply than ever and his stethoscope seemed to have increased in size until it entwined his neck like a rubbery vine hello bingham i said he swallowed hello old chap heard you were coming back look here i said dropping my suitcase and holding out my hand im sorry about that business of the bananas in the lift it was damn bad manners on my part but i was a bit upset at the time about not getting the job you know not that im saying you didnt deserve the promotion but weve got to live next door to each other for a bit so cant we forget the whole thing of course old chap bingham said awkwardly there was a short silence imer sorry if i hogged all the cases in cas and all that you deserved them too we shook if you want any tips about the work old chap bingham went on i can put you right only if you ask of course he added quickly the profs been jolly decent and letting me try quite a bit off my own bat ive done a couple of hernias and some piles already and theres a nice excision of warts on the list for me tomorrow must buzz off now old chap theres a query tib and fib just come into cas see you at supper i went to my room feeling like the head girl at st agathas making it up with the lacrosse skipper my job as a senior house surgeon in st swithins was looking after the daytoday needs of the patients in the wards assisting in the operating theatre and acting as a clinical valet to mr cambridge this was my most difficult duty because mr cambridge though an excellent surgeon who had plucked more stomachs than anyone else in the hemisphere was alarmingly absentminded his professional memory was excellent he never forgot a stomach socially he couldnt remember the day of the week whether he had come out in his overcoat what he was supposed to be doing in the afternoon and if he had already had lunch as a young surgeon he had arrived at st swithins from his lodgings one winters morning to operate as usual and was aware as he scrubbed up of a strange loneliness about the place not only was the surgeons room silent but peeping into the theatre itself he found it deserted with the table under a dustsheet at first he thought he was in the wrong operating block but there was his name on his locker as plain as ever next he wondered if it might be sunday but he was certain it was wednesday because he paid his landlady every tuesday and he remembered that he had forgotten to give her the cheque yesterday it then occurred to him that he had noticed a strangeness about the streets while driving to the hospital was there a sudden general strike perhaps sweeping up the doctors and nurses as it hurricaned upon them he padded down the corridor in his operating clothes white rubber boots and surgical mask to seek information at the ward door he stopped short it was most extraordinary there appeared to be some sort of riot inside with nurses and patients dancing round the beds clearly revolution had broken out in st swithins why hello mr cambridge called the sister from the door merry christmas my first morning on duty i waited in the quadrangle for mr cambridges arrival according to hospital tradition standing beneath the statue to its famous former surgeon sir benjamin bone the chiefs getting late i said to the registrar a tall thin serious but pleasant young man called hatrick who already had his frcs theres nothing much you can do about it he said gloomily the last time the old boy didnt turn up i found hed gone on an american lecture tour we were due to begin operating at nine but it was almost halfpast when mr cambridge came cheerily through the main gates on foot ah good morning my dear mr erer and my dear mr ahah he greeted us he could never remember the names of his assistants and i was thankful that he had managed to recall mine twelve hours after the reunion dinner sorry im late got my notes i handed him three or four envelopes addressed in his own barely legible handwriting whenever he thought of anything he ought to remember the next day he wrote it on a card and immediately posted it to himself at st swithins lets see we operate this morning dont we he continued as we marched towards the surgical block theres a most interesting gastrocolic fistula id like you to inspect mr erand of course you too mr ah there followed one of the most painful mornings since i qualified as a medical student i had occasionally been ordered to scrubup dress in a sterile gown and join the surgeons assistants but once at the operating table i only played dummy in the surgical quartet occasionally i would be given a retractor and told hang on to that boy but usually i was edged away as the surgeon became more interested in the operation and spent most of the time watching nothing more illuminating than the buckle on the back of his braces but as a house surgeon i was a necessary member of the surgical team responsible for cutting the stitches clipping off the bleeding points and fixing the dressings conscious of this i pulled on my rubber gloves with unusual determination and split them from thumb to cuff nurse the sisters voice rang across the theatre another pair of gloves for mr gordon a small nurse muffled in her theatre clothes darted across the floor and drew a white glove packet from the sterile drum with a pair of long forceps thank you i mumbled i was now so flustered that i forgot to powder my damp hands with the small gauze bag of talc and could hardly force them inside the rubber at all i seemed to have two fingers jammed in the thumb space while the end of the glove danced about like seaweed in a strong tide a case of multipollices isnt it murmured the small nurse this increased my agitation and i pulled the glove in two nurse cried the theatre sister more loudly another pair of gloves for mr gordon i pulled on the third pair intact though there was a small empty space like the teat of a babys bottle at the end of each finger i anxiously made towards the table pushing aside a surgical trolley in my way that trolley is unsterile declared the theatre sister louder than ever nurse a complete change of clothes for mr gordon when i reached the patient the operation was almost over mr cambridge merely murmured hello mr er ahwill you take the second retractor from mr aher i determined to do my best and recover from the bad start but i cut the stitches the wrong length let the retractors slip jammed my fingers in the handles of artery clips and dropped several small instruments on the floor mr cambridge seemed to take no notice i decided that he was not only the politest surgeon in the hospital but one of the cleverest in allowing for the assistance of fumbling house surgeons when planning his operating technique my only consolation that morning was watching grimsdyke out of the corner of my eye he was having a worse time than i was when i had asked him at breakfast how he felt about giving anaesthetics he had replied lightly doing dopes theres nothing to it its all done by machines these daysnone of the old ragandbottle business any more just like driving a car you twiddle a knob here twiddle a knob there and youre away possiblybut supposing you make the mixture too rich too much choke you mean he started to laugh but said sorry old lad didnt mean it at breakfast anyway its perfectly simple to a chap with a mechanical mind like myself i suppose youve read up all the stages of anaesthesia and so on old lad as far as im concerned there are only three stages of anaesthesia awake asleep and dead it was now clear that grimsdyke knew nothing about the administration of anaesthesia whatever he was sitting at the head of the table beside a large chromiumplated trolley thick with dials and though only his eye and forehead were showing i had never seen him looking so worried since one of the pretty girls in the xray department thought she was in the family way every now and then he hopefully turned a coloured tap or buried under the sterile towels to look up macintoshs essentials of anaesthesia which he had propped against the unconscious patients nose grimsdyke had come to the theatre confident that he would be expected only to assist the consultant anaesthetist a cheerful fat man with the best stock of rude stories in london but the consultant had the habit of returning to the surgeons room and solving the times crossword as soon as the patient was on the table leaving his assistant at the controls unlike most of the surgeons at st swithins mr cambridge was considerate and polite to his anaesthetist he made no remark about the grunts coming from beneath grimsdykes fingers and an unexpected paroxysm of coughing from the patient left him unperturbed towards the end of the operation i was alarmed to feel something stir beneath the sterile towels i glanced at grimsdyke but he had now given up the struggle and was leaning on the trolley with his eyes shut to my horror the patients arm came slowly into the air mr anaesthetist said mr cambridge quietly if the patient can keep awake during the operation dont you think you might too when operating on other peoples stomachs mr cambridge disregarded his own as gastrectomy followed gastrectomy my fumbling became worse and i began to long for the release of lunch after the fourth case the theatre sister announced firmly as she handed me the dressing we are stopping for an hour now sir its two oclock two oclock already how the morning flies sister and there is a detective to see you ah yes which one this time sergeant flannagan flannagan cant say i recall the name whats he like big and redfaced sir said hatrick i know him very well ill be out directly just clean up the incision will you mr aher mr cambridge was well known to the metropolitan police because he was continually losing his car as soon as he felt his feet as a surgeon he had bought the customary bentley but he either forgot where he had parked it wondered if he had come out in it at all or threw open the garage doors in the morning and found it wasnt there this time im certain its been stolen he explained to the policeman in the surgeons room as hatrick grimsdyke and i began tucking in to our cold congealed mutton stew i came in by tube this morning and i didnt have it out yesterday i dont think so anyway but the day before sergeant umum i distinctly remember i had it parked outside my rooms in harley street when i came out im absolutely certain it was gone the sergeant coughed but why didnt you inform the police at the time sir well you see when i saw it had gone i was certain i hadnt brought it with me you follow quite said the sergeant mr cambridge disappeared after lunch to remove stomachs in another part of london leaving hatrick and myself to finish the list as the consultant anaesthetist accompanied the surgeon hatrick pointedly told grimsdyke that he would do the remaining minor operations under local grimsdyke took this as a slight murmured something about any bloody fool with a sharp knife can be a surgeon and left the operating theatre in a huff as the students had drifted away with the loss of their main attraction and a milder staff nurse was substituted for the theatre sister the pair of us operated peacefully until nightfall after the mornings exhibition i was then certain that i would never become a surgeon but under hatricks gentle tuition i began to gain confidence always steady the blade of the scissors with your finger when you cut he murmured as i fumbled round the incision tuck them into the palm of your hand when youre not using them take the artery forceps with the tips of your fingers so then you wont get stuck tie a surgical knot like this and youll only have to use one hand never worry about cutaneous bleedingit always stops and use the handle of your scapel if in doubtit does less damage when we returned to the surgeons room as the last case was wheeled away we found sergeant flannagan waiting mr cambridge has left the hospital i told him is there any message yes there is weve found his car oh really and where was it in the end locked in his ruddy garage at home mr cambridge had charge of two wards at st swithinsfortitude for men and constancy for womenwhere my duties though less exciting than in the operating theatre were of more value to the hospital mr cambridge himself skipped round the beds every tuesday morning his bedside manner consisting largely of poking a patient hard in the tummy and saying cheerfully youll be much better with it out hatrick tidied up all the surgical odd jobs and i was left in charge of the more domestic side of hospitalization the patients were less concerned with the feats of surgery performed upon them under anaesthesia than the discovery that they were unable to sleep their bowels wouldnt work the fish for supper was cold and there was a draught all day from the window opposite all faults that i was expected to rectify as i was obliged to make my rounds twice daily the patients saw far more of me than the other members of the surgical firm and sometimes embarrassed me by imagining that i was the brilliant young doctor in charge which surgeon are you under i overheard one of them being asked in the xray department downstairs dr gordon i mean whos the head surgeon in your ward why dr gordon said the patient in amazement you knowthe young feller is there any other doctor the patient thought for a time theres another youngish chap called hatrick what dr gordon gets to help him sometimes yes yes yes but who else the patient tried to remember no one else except an old man dr gordon asks in every so often out of the kindness of his heart but hes past it i reckon he added confidentially as the professors wards were immediately below mine in the surgical block i saw a good deal of bingham we treated each other with aggressive politeness bingham markedly avoided the lift when we went downstairs together and i pointedly asked his advice as the senior surgeon by six months about my difficult cases whenever our professional interests conflicted we drenched each other in courtesy hello old chap he said coming to the duty operating theatre one evening just finished a case well er no actually i was just going to scrub up for a stitch abscess from the ward but if you want the theatre first not a bit old chap not a bit he said quickly we are on duty tonight i admit and we do have priority in the theatre and all that but i wouldnt dream of standing in your way its only a fb in the pop foss and that can wait no no my dear bingham after all im a septic case so you should come first well thats terribly d of you old chap but reallyi know he announced his eyes lighting up at the gentlemanly solution to this impasse you shall have our centrifuge all tomorrow afternoon really i couldnt yes old chap absolutely insist thats awfully kind of you bingham dont mench old chap a month passed like a fine april day then a strange feeling of depression began to creep over me at first it puzzled me my career was progressing splendidly but i had the vague feeling of something missing from my life i wondered if i were developing some dark psychological complaint and mentioned this to grimsdyke one evening over a pint of beer in the king george pub opposite i dont know what it is exactly i told him its a sort ofwell unsatisfied feeling lord knows why i love the work i really feel im learning a bit of surgery at last its fun living in the hospital with the boys and i havent seen bingham for two days what more could i want do you think i ought to take an interest in art or music or something grimsdyke laughed you dont want music old lad you want women or one woman at least i was surprised do you really think so absolutely certain cant miss the diagnosis were not runaround students any more however much we try and pretend we are on saturday nights were worthy citizens god help us it is a truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife jane austen a wife i cried in horror well i wouldnt go as far as that he added finishing his beer but you get the idea i thought carefully about grimsdykes diagnosis and decided that he was right fortunately the treatment would be simple since returning to st swithins as a doctor i had sensed a different relationship between myself and the hundreds of young women that the place was obliged to employ apart from the nurses there were the buxom dieticians the cheerful girls in xray the neat secretaries the occupational therapists in sandals and folkweave belts the laboratory assistants the speech therapists the childguidance workers and the statuesque physiotherapists in the massage department who were known as the slapandtickle honeys as students these ladies had treated us like wellbroughtup wrens dealing with fresh ratings but now that we were qualified and therefore pressingly marriageable the iron hand was eased a little from the velvet glove the sister of mr cambridges female ward had resigned shortly before i arrived leaving the patients in charge of the staff nurse until the matron could make another promotion this was nurse plumtree a pale thin dark snubnosed girl passably pretty except for her hair which appeared to be attended by a gardener in a spare second while occupied with the hedgeclippers from my first entrance to the ward nurse plumtree clearly looked upon me as her own property this was correct hospital etiquette for the staff nurse was always allowed first bite at the new houseman but nurse plumtree perhaps because she was in supreme authority over the others took pains to make this obvious i preferred her secondincommand a bright redheaded freckled scots girl to whom i chatted if nurse plumtree was out of the ward when she returned she would cross directly to us with an extra briskness in her step look her professional sister squarely in the eye and order her to check the laundry one afternoon nurse plumtree came back from lunch to find the pair of us giggling over a joke in the sluiceroom and afterwards rarely took any time off at all she insisted that this was through her devotion to duty but it was clear to everyone else that it was through her devotion to me have you any socks that need mending she asked one morning if youll bring them up ill darn them for you ive nothing else to do in the evenings i never go out we were sitting alone in the sisters private sittingroom a small apartment fierce with yellow chintz and brassware next to the ward every day i was invited there for a cup of milky coffee served timidly by the junior probationer while nurse plumtree took a tin of her own chocolate biscuits from the bureau put her feet up on the rushwork stool and lit a cigarette in fact she went on ive got an evening off tomorrow from five oclock i dont know what on earth to do with it really well erperhaps something may turn up i said warily who knows she sipped her coffee sorrowfully the morning after my talk with grimsdyke she threw into her conversation ive got a halfday on wednesday starting at twelve oclock and im due for a late pass till midnight but i dont expect i shall take them there just doesnt seem anything to do i already knew this having sneaked a glance at the nurses offduty book kept with the insurance certificates on her desk i had made up my mind nurse plumtree was presentable and pleasant besides there was not the faintest chance of being snubbed i coughed if youre really without plans perhaps youd like to come to the pictures or something for an instant her eyes widened im not sure if i can really leave the ward nurse macpherson isnt very experienced of course not as well as being a lot too familiar with the patients so ive noticed and anyway shes far too interested in one of the students for the good of her work really do try and come ill see you at six i said rising outside the dental department my romance with nurse plumtree caused no more surprise in the hospital than the annual blooming of the geraniums outside the secretarys office in summer my colleagues grinned more widely the more i asked them to standin for me during the evenings and nurse macpherson once winked at me over a ward screen but to most people at st swithins we were simply another staff nurse and houseman obeying the local laws of biology like many other young couples with no money in london we sat at the back in the festival hall and the empress hall we dined at lyons and we drank in the cosy saloon bars of tuckedaway pubs of which my medical education had left me with a more precise knowledge than of human anatomy often nurse plumtree paid for herself and sometimes she paid for us both she was an easy girl to entertain because she was fond of long silences during which she would stare at the opposite wall as if recalling the faces of friends long dead and her conversation when it came was almost wholly about the hospital as my few former girl friends had all been nurses this failure to throw off the cap and apron did not discourage me and i consoled myself that another companion might have talked only about ponies or proust but after a few weeks i found myself irresistibly wishing that she would stop telling me exactly what was happening to number twentytwos blood chlorides and the bright retort she had made to nurse macpherson when informed that the wards allocation of liquid paraffin had been used up in a week there was another more disheartening impediment in my relationship with nurse plumtree i confessed this late one evening to grimsdyke when he came into my room to scrounge cigarettes hows the sex life he asked cheerfully feeling more contented wellyes and no what you mean the course of true love hasnt run smooth too smoothly if anything i told him you know how it is with nurseswe go to a flick or a concert or something then i rush her back to the hospital before her late pass expires we have a quick neck among half the medical school outside the mortuary gate then i push her into the nurses home on the stroke of eleven if i kept her out another minute her good name would be ruined for ever so it seems frustrating you dont have to read freud and kinsey to know it doesnt do a chap much good but whats the alternative apart from holding hands in hyde park how about a little intramural love life in st swithins where they separate the sexes like a victorian swimmingbath theres always the fireescape ah the fireescape this ugly zigzag up the wall of the residents quarters was a monument to the victory of the insurance companys prudence over that of the matron by climbing the darkened floors of the empty outpatients block at night crossing the roof of the physiotherapy department and dodging past the night porters messroom we could smuggle a nurse into our forbidden corridors this risky adventure was rarely suggested for the nurse if discovered was regarded by the matron to be fit for nothing more but the chamber of horrors theres nothing to it old lad grimsdyke went on as i looked at him dubiously wait for a dark night lay in a bottle of courting sherry have a decent shave and youre all set for a cosy evening so much warmer than hyde park too at our next meeting i mentioned the fireescape to nurse plumtree as i expected she looked sad sniffed and said oh richard feeling i should provide some excuse i went on quickly but i mean i thought we could just have a cup of coffee and i could show you my microscope slides of gastric ulcers that ive been telling you about i mean it would be quitewell you know all right oh richard it would spoil everything what you mean just looking at my slides theyre most interesting and of course i have to borrow a microscope from one of the other residents so i cant very well show them to you elsewhere but of course if you dont want to she sighed deeply and looked away i felt that grimsdyke would have managed the invitation much better i had tempted her only with the pathological equivalent of etchings there was another of her silences then we talked about the best way of treating postoperative thrombosis our affair jogged along for several weeks there was no alternative for she now simply told me when she was next off duty and assumed that i would be waiting to take her out it was a relationship with many concrete advantages for nurse plumtree was a tenderhearted girl whose motherly instincts were not wholly absorbed by her profession from our first outing she had mended my shirts lent me books and provided currant cake with the morning coffee now she bought me ties and bars of chocolate pressed on me handfuls of vitamins from the medicine cupboard knitted me a muffler and made me wear braces instead of an old rugger club tie for keeping up my trousers which she pressed proudly every sunday with her iron in the nurses home my friends thought i had not looked so tidy or so well fed for a long time two events disturbed the placid current of this romance the first was nurse macphersons transference to night duty in the printed charge handed to him by the hospital secretary on his appointment each senior house surgeon at st swithins was enjoined to visit your wards at least once nightly before retiring to take the report from the senior night nurse and attend to the needs of the patients at whatever hour that might be this night round was the most conscientiously performed of all the house surgeons duties for night nurses who have to sleep all day and work alone all night are lonely souls who suffer from a deficiency of masculine companionship for this reason the most untidy and unromantic houseman is confident of a welcome in the darkened ward even if he has just been thrown out of the king george and arrives like my predecessor wearing the head porters hat and riding a bicycle besides all nurses are good cooks and without the ward sister counting the rations over their shoulders gladly provide peckish housemen with bacon and eggs at midnight my night rounds had so far been dull because the nurse on fortitude was a newlypromoted girl who breathlessly read me the ward report with one timid eye on the door for the visit of the surgical night sister on constancy the night nurse was a thin spectacled woman with a faint moustache who in the halflight reminded me of groucho marx one night i came up the empty corridor after seeing nurse plumtree into the nurses home as usual and found nurse macpherson frying bacon and eggs and smoking a cigarette in the small kitchen next to the ward what on earth are you doing here i asked in surprise why hello there for three months im to be queen of the night trala didnt plumtree tell you i shook my head how about some eggs and bacon or would you prefershe opened a box on the diet trolleysome egg custard and pureed spinach as a matter of fact i could do with a bite as usual they gave us a rotten supper in the residency you know that brawn stuff the patients wont eat she nodded how well i do it would pass unnoticed in a pathology exam with draw label and identify this tissue stuck on it theres a bottle of beer in the comforts cupboard she went on breaking a couple more eggs help yourself and pour me a glass arent you worried about the night sister i asked hesitating what old muggsy munson shes got her feet up in the sisters room with a nice cup of tea reading the washerwomans weekly ill bet she comes round as regularly as the hands of a clock i sat down at the ward table wondering why a nurse smoking in uniform always presented such a curiously abandoned appearance then i remembered that i had just kissed my girlfriend good night how are the patients nurse i asked trying to reestablish our professional relationship please please dont talk about them out of the ward i beg she forked bacon from the pan i cannot talk shop with my meals the nurses home is ghastlyits mastoids with the mince mumps with the macaroni membranes with the mash thats one of the things ive got against plumtree she bit her lip i shouldnt have said that i suppose not said it i tried to sound as indifferent as possible why welleveryone knows that you and plumtreei mean shes a very good sort at heart she certainly strikes me as being a decent sort of girl i must say oh yes very nice such a pity about her acne acne i recalled that nurse plumtrees face was occasionally marred by a small square of stickingplaster yes all over her back but of course she giggled you wouldnt know about that would you but shes a nice placid person i happen to dislike chattering women i said a little stiffly shes no chatterbox why sometimes she sits for hours and hours without saying anything just looking into the middle distance i find her quite an interesting companion anyway i insisted so do we in the home these days the things she tells us about you my my i want to blush sometimes did you really go as far as that on the inner circle the other night good god did she tell you that thats only half of it how many eggs i ate my bacon and eggs in silence i was disillusioned i had thought nurse plumtree above the common feminine habit of describing an evening out in the spirit of a boastful grenadier in a pub after waterloo when i met her the following evening i was more careful in my conversation and behaviour this did not seem to disturb her but as we came home i had to admit that her silences seemed longer and longer and now extended from piccadilly circus to russell square on the tube and as she turned to allow me to kiss her good night i was sure i saw incipient acne all over her cheeks i suppose you know macphersons on nights she said i murmured that i had noticed her while dashing through the ward on my night round im asking the office to get her moved nurse plumtree went on shes incompetent do you know that this morning she gave the highprotein diets to the lowproteins and she mixed up the extra vitamins with the saltdeficients oh really it doesnt seem to have done them much harm anyway she twisted the top button of my overcoat richard ive got an evening tomorrow will you come to dinner at home home i was startled i had never thought of nurse plumtree having any home except the one provided by st swithins its only down in mitcham mummy and daddy would love to see you i hesitated please richard i thought quickly dining with the parents would certainly be a trial i could see itgruff father who i believed was a retired colonel and sharpeyed mother both suspicious of my intentions towards their daughter still nurse plumtree had been a kind companion to me and i owed her some repaymentbesides i was running short of money and it would mean a free meal all right i said ill meet you at the usual place at six if i can get away the clock struck then and she disappeared through the closing doors of the nurses home hows plumtree nurse macpherson asked cheerfully as i arrived in the ward kitchen two minutes later oh all right i sat on the edge of the table lit a cigarette and swung my legs you dont sound very enthusiastic about it i must say oh dont i she put down a bowl of eggs she was beating and went on be a darling and lend me a cigarette i left mine in the home she came across to me as i pulled a packet from my jacket pocket when i lit her cigarette with the end of mine she gripped my hand tightly and said you know whats wrong with plumtree dont you shes undersexed for a moment i looked at her nurse plumtree was pale and dark nurse macpherson redheaded and freckled nurse plumtree always looked faintly ill and nurse macpherson always buoyantly healthy with a stride recalling a moor on a frosty morning and arms suggesting the tennis racket and the hockey stick nurse plumtree was introverted and nurse macpherson extroverted and if one was undersexed then the other was certainly oversexed before i realized what i was doing i had kissed her ummm she said nestling into my arms not quite the nightingale spirit but give me more what about the ward i gasped the pros looking after it i kissed her again but the night sister not due for hours besides ive got my cap on thats the important thing if they found a nurse stark naked with her cap on it would still be respectable it was late as i walked slowly up the stairs of the residents quarters i felt smugly sheikish i now had two girl friends one for companionship and comfort during the day and one for excitement at night as long as i could keep them reasonably separated and do without too much sleep i was in for an interesting time the second disturbance to my romance with nurse plumtree was the dinner at home mummy and daddy are very sweet really she said as i drove haemorrhagic hilda down to mitcham im sure they are forgive daddy if hes a little crotchety sometimes hes been rather like that since he retired from the army and mummys arthritis sometimes upsets her in weather like this but im sure youll like them very much just be yourself she advised me the plumtrees lived in a small house called blenheim that stood in a neat garden containing a row of yews shaped into horses heads with a miniature brass cannon by the steps and a notice on the door saying civil defencechief warden she rang the bell which had the effect of a bomb going off in a zoo immediately there was an outburst of barking caterwauling and human shouting from inside and i waited nervously on the mat wondering if it was a pair of lions who were scratching hungrily for me inside the door i do love animals so nurse plumtree said the door burst open and two great danes sprang at me put their paws on my shoulders and began licking my face alexander montgomery cried someone inside mind what youre doing to the doctor dont worry said nurse plumtree calmly theyre only puppies the dogs were pulled off i staggered through the hall and found myself in a sittingroom decorated with long photographs of regimental groups a pair of crossed swords a tigerskin rug and several ceremonial helmets under glass domes like forced rhubarb the room seemed to be filled with human beings and animals there were dogs in the corners cats on the cushions birds in the windows and a tank of fish over the fireplace scattered among them were a thin stooping man with a white moustache a fat dark woman in a purple dress and a young man and a girl who both looked strongly like nurse plumtree my dear dear doctor said the colonel advancing with outstretched hand how very pleased we are to see you edna has told us so much about you may i introduce ednas mother as i shook hands she said warmly ednas told me so much about you too the young man held out his hand and said hello names ian im at the bbc sweet of you to come old thing this is joan were ednas brother and sister and weve heard so much about you it isnt true joan said smashing you could come always hearing about you i began to feel annoyed i had expected the evening to be a quiet dinner and it had been turned into a gathering of the clan naughty cromwell joan said picking up a wirehaired terrier which had sprung from the hearthrug to start biting my ankles naughty naughty cromwell did you want to eat the doctor then she buried her nose in the struggling dogs neck dont you think hes got a lovely face hes getting married tomorrow ian explained which makes him rather excited now lets have a cocktail doctor said the colonel rubbing his hands he smiled at me or id better call you richard hadnt i if you like sir of course for some reason this made everyone roar with laughter before long i could not help mellowing in the warmth of my reception i had come prepared for suspicious tolerance at best and now edna plumtrees father was treating me like the man bringing the winnings from littlewoods even conversation at dinner was easier than i had feared because the plumtree family like many others believed that the only way to make a doctor feel at home was to narrate their ailments since childhood in a richness of clinical detail more suitable for the operating table than the dining table first colonel plumtree described the pelvic wound he had suffered at dunkirk starting with a short sketch of the military situation leading up to it and finishing with an account of the croquet lawn of his convalescent hospital in torquay mrs plumtree took up the surgical saga by relating all the events occurring both outside and inside her from the moment of entering hospital for a cholecystectomy joan plumtree was bursting to begin the story of the carbuncle she had as a child which had to be squeezed of pus every morning when ian put his head in his hands and groaned not your beastly boils again joan darling please they all looked at him in surprise but richards a doctor joan said i know ian shakily reached for his glass but im not it makes me go all over and over inside if you dont stop ill throw up really i will the family stared at the brother like passengers on a businessmans train watching a parson come aboard in the middle of a good story i cant even stand talking about blood ian went on to me its one of my things ive got all sorts of things ive got a thing about heights and a thing about being trapped in the underground and it filling up with water and everyone being drowned and a thing about suffocating when im asleep in fact im all things it all started when i had a nasty experience in a beastly prep school in broadstairs he went on to give a full history of his neurosis and those of several of his friends in broadcasting house for most of the meal nurse plumtree had remained silent but as the sweet arrived the family ran out of clinical material and kept the conversation going by asking her to repeat once more the story of the morning she put mr cambridge in his place or the day she settled the matrons hash in front of the whole hospital it was soon clear that colonel and mrs plumtree believed their daughter dominated the nursing staff at st swithins in the same fond way that the parents of the spottiest fourthform dunce imagine their child is the schools sparkingplug i noticed that they afforded me similar status in the surgical department and began asking my opinion on medical matters of the day so far nothing had been expected of me beyond sympathetic umms and reallys at long intervals but the colonel had provided a good bottle of burgundy and i was feeling in the mood to let myself expand a little after addressing them for some time like the president of the royal college of surgeons i ended by giving a stitchbystitch description of removing a kidney which brought ians face into his hands again but left me confident that i had been an overwhelming success with the rest of the family well said colonel plumtree as i finished that was most interesting richard absolutely fascinating and i now i expect the ladies would like to retire the three women left us followed by ian who murmured that he wanted to lie down colonel plumtree brought a decanter of port from the sideboard and said genially this is a drop ive been saving its from a the old regiment i think youll like it my boy thats very good of you sir but i hope you havent decanted it specially for me not a bit richard not a bit special occasion special port eh cigar thank you sir feeling that a medical qualification was worth the hard work if it could occasion such handsome treatment in a staff nurses home i lit my cigar and settled myself at the head of the table close to the colonel you havent known edna long really have you he asked no not very long i only started on her ward a few months ago that doesnt seem to matter he said and roared with laughter to be polite i laughed too tell me something about your career he went on by all accounts youre a rather brilliant young man oh not really you know i said feeling flattered theres nothing much to tell i got qualified did a spell in general practice and now im at st swithins again my ambition is to be a surgeon of course capital he poured me some more port if youll forgive a more personal question colonel plumtree continued aboutah how much are you making at the moment i dont mind telling you at all i enjoyed giving inside information about the national health service all we poor housemen get is about three hundred a year when theyve knocked off the board and lodging but of course it soon goes up in another four years or so i should be well inside the fourfigure bracket he nodded thoughtfully over his cigar thats pretty reasonable on the whole not too bad at all id say but youll probably find yourself a bit short of cash at the moment eh after all youve got to pay for the ring the ring what on earth was he talking about i had said nothing about amateur boxing the circus perhaps opera or bookmakers he nudged me her mother insisted on diamonds he chuckled the room spun round the port boiled in my mouth the cigar shot from my fingers like a torpedo steady on old chap steady on the colonel patted me heartily on the back something go down the wrong way it was almost a minute before i managed to speak the portperhaps a little strong of course my boy mustnt have you choke to death just now eh ha ha come along in and join the family i followed father into the sittingroom looking like ian having one of his things the rest of the evening passed in a sickly blur as though i were recovering from a bad anaesthetic joan said she hoped wed be jolly good pals and ian thought id like to meet his interesting chum lionel at the bbc father showed us his photographs from the war and mother kept pressing my hand murmuring im so glad and bursting into tears as soon as i dared i pleaded a headache lack of sleep and early duty there were disappointed cries and i bought my freedom with false pledges of returning for sunday tea to meet the aunts and dining next week at daddys club we drove away in silence poor richard said edna wrapping my muffler tenderly round me daddys regimental port is rather strong but dont worryyou made an awfully good impression on the family it really was time they knew about us wasnt it i burst into grimsdykes room as soon as i reached the hospital good god whats the matter he asked in alarm he jumped from his bed where he was lying in his crimson silk dressinggown been frightened by the ghost of a blighted patient or something a drink i fell into his armchair at once coming up right away you look so bloody awful you make me want one too he threw aside the novel he was reading and brought a bottle of gin from the commode thoughtfully provided by st swithins after we had both drunk deeply from his toothglasses he screwed his monocle into his eye and said now tell the doctor all i gave him the story of my tragic evening and he roared with laughter i cant see anything funny in it i said crossly damn it all i treat this girl with perfectly normal good manners and affability and what happens before i know whats happening im surrounded by her bloody family patting me on the back and saying how nice it will be to have grandchildren what the devil can she have been telling them all this time she must think like a story in a womans magazine ill admit youre in a bit of a fix grimsdyke said cheerfully bit of a fix i know that without your help the question is what the hell can i do about it grimsdyke took a long drink i should think the easiest way out is to go ahead and marry the girl marry her marry her are you mad too man apart from anything else have you seen her family i wouldnt share the same railway carriage with that bunch let alone marry into them have another drink grimsdyke said thanks i will lets suppose you did marry nurse plumtree he continued in a reflective tone lying down again the worst parts over of coursebeing inspected by the family think yourself lucky many fellows have gone down to the old folks busting with love and found themselves kicked into the rhododendrons before the fruit and coffee came round you were a great success i grunted then as father observed youd need a ring terribly expensive engagement rings the thing the best man loses in church is a brassy job worth a couple of quid but the one you choose together in mappin and webbs is a sort of down payment on delivery of goods youll have to put it in the times of courseyou pay for that toowhich will load your post for weeks afterwards with advertisements for photographers florists and contraceptives all your bachelor chums will slap you on the back and tell you what a lucky chap you are clearly implying what lucky chaps they are they stand you drinks i admit but you dont get much chance for drinking because you spend all your spare time sitting on the edge of the sofa in her front parlour discussing the wedding by now you may have decided that you dont want to marry the girl after all must you go on i demanded this isnt a bit funny but that wont do you the slightest good because once youve set the terrible machinery of marriage in motion you stand as much chance as a crate of eggs under a piledriver youll soon discover that marriage is nothing to do with the fusion of two souls but an excuse for women to buy lots of expensive clothes the bride is decked out to ride in triumph round the social circus to the delight of her relations the relief of her married friends and the gratifying jealousy of those still single you of course will be the horse but i anticipate rather because for several months youll be forced to listen politely to exhaustive discussions about whether the bridesmaids should wear juliet caps and if the bride can go to the altar in her usual undies incidentally the bridesmaids themselveswhom youll later have to reward handsomelywill apparently be recruited from a home for female morons while your own best man will be as socially acceptable to the bride mother and steering committee of aunts as jack the ripper your last loophole of escape is meanwhile blocked by a landslide of saucepans teaspoons eggcups gravyladles toasting forks and handembroidered teacosies for all of which you will have to write a letter extending over at least one page beginning dear uncle augustus and aunt beatrice thank you a thousand times for your delightful contribution to our new little home grimsdyke took another drink and staring at the ceiling continued brightly dawns your wedding day you have a terrible hangover as you climb into the outfit youve hired from moss bros and you still cant find your collar when the best man arrives to collect you he generally tries to cheer you up with a few funny jokes the last thing you want to do in the world is get married but before you know whats happening youre in church with your eyes on the level of the clergymans boots the reception afterwards will be upstairs in a teashop there wont be nearly enough to drink and everyone will make speechessome of the uncles twiceseveral of the aunts will be in tears and only the waiters will at all be mellowed by alcohol then the goingawayfrightfully pagan and primitive really old shoes and tin cans on the back of the car in the middle of the high street on a saturday afternoon this brings me to the honeymoon there you are arriving at st ives in a snowstorm in your best clothes trying to pretend youve been married for years and feeling that everyone is looking at you as though you were performing one of those expositions in the back streets of marseille however i will skip all that i next see you and edna plumtreethatwas strolling from your villa on a sunday morning with the pram and twopossibly threewalking along beside i smashed his glass on the floor and walked out the next morning was my most miserable since the final examinations the newspapers seemed concerned only with actions for breach of promise judges remarks about broken homes and advertisements for cheap wedding rings i could hardly eat any breakfast and hurried across the quadrangle to the surgical block feeling that every nurse in the hospital was pointing her finger at me and giggling as i scrambled into my operating trousers i wondered if nurse plumtree had already spread the news around the nurses home or was waiting for the matrons blessing and a ring in the operating theatre it was one of those mornings the sister was in a bad temper the catgut broke the artery forceps slipped the transfusion needles came adrift the scissors were blunt the swabs were lost my own assistance was so clumsy that even mild mr cambridge was moved to murmur my dear mr erer couldnt you do something more helpful to the patient than gaze at his umbilicus hatrick screwed up his eyes as he grinned and said through his mask he must be in love sir i almost wept into the wound as i grasped my retractor through the long surgical morning i glanced at grimsdyke who was sitting smugly at my right elbow and wondered if he was perhaps right should i give in and marry nurse plumtree after all i was past the facile flirtations of a penniless medical student and almost every morning the times proclaimed the virtuous love of one of my classmates nurse plumtree would at least never be a nagger or a gossip she was a tolerably good cook and genuinely anxious to look after me as the years rolled by i might be able to tolerate her brother and sister while thankfully her parents could not live for ever lunch was later colder and soggier than usual afterwards i made an excuse about discussing the next anaesthetic and managed to have a word with grimsdyke alone sorry i was rather unsympathetic last night he said cheerfully in the anaesthetic room gripping the chin of a freshlyunconscious patient but your cosy little evening chez plumtree sounded so bloody funny i couldnt spoil the joke i think i may take your advice after all i announced what marry the woman but youre not even in love with her are you i shrugged my shoulders and started fiddling with an ampoule of pentothal whats love i said it merely means that a certain system of genes in my chromosomes is about to be placed in relationship to an arrangement of genes in hers to this biological end certain endocrine cells in her and myself pour out secretions that produce our secondary sex characteristics such as the full bosom and rounded hips of nurse plumtree and the deep voice and hair on the chest of myself i dont see that theres any more to it what disgusting nonsense anyway you cant possibly marry a nurse they make your life a horror of purgatives then what the devil am i to do i asked him anxiously so far youve been as useless as a letterbox on a tombstone the answers simple old lad have a bash at another woman hadnt you thought of it before they wheeled the patient into the theatre then but i finished the operating list in a happier frame of mind in the emotional stress of the last two days i had forgotten nurse macpherson and it cheered me to think that i could choose the primrose path to escape i saw little of nurse plumtree that day for the operating list ended in a string of hernias varicose veins lipomas biopsies and cystoscopies that kept hatrick and myself in the theatre until eight at night i threw a white coat over my bloodsmudged theatre clothes and hurried down to the wards which on operating evenings resembled the french lines after agincourt outside constancy i was surprised to run into nurse plumtree in her cloak ive got a strep throat she said gazing at me sadly ive got to go off duty oh hard luck i tried not to sound delighted at least its nothing serious ill go round the ward with nurse summers instead i couldnt have met you tonight anyway not after that colossal list dont give too much responsibility to that nurse macpherson she warned me shes quite unreliable only this morning she mixed up the castor oils with the blanket baths and dont stay up too late writing your notes promise i nodded vigorously i must go off to the path lab for a swab she ended softly good night richard dear good night hope you get better in no time and all that i went into the ward praying that her throat swab would reveal as sturdy a penicillinresistant streptococcus as the bacteriologists had seen it was a selfish thought but at present complete isolation was the ideal state for nurse plumtree it was late before i left the ward with an armful of patients notes to complete in my room i ate my cold supper alone in the gloomy diningroom found a bottle of beer in grimsdykes commode and settled down at my small desk to reduce mr cambridges surgical bravura to black and white after midnight i wrote for the last time haemostasis secured and abdomen closed in layers collected the folders and began to think constructively about nurse macpherson as i walked across the quadrangle to the entrance of the surgical block i prepared my plan i would get her cosily into the corner of the ward kitchen kiss her against the breadcutting machine and ask her out next friday she would accept delightedly and the news would seep into the innermost cell of the nurses isolation block by breakfast i felt this was hardly the behaviour of a gentleman but consoled myself by remembering that desperate ills need desperate remedies i was glad to find her in the ward kitchen as usual alone my my youre late she greeted me todays victims are all doing splendidly and old muggsys sent up a couple of extras to help me cope hungry phew i waved the air in front of my face have you been fumigating the mattresses or something oh that must be jimmy binghams tobacco how many eggs i stiffened now i recognized unmistakably the foul breath of binghams pipe which he lit with the air of a clumsy father on guy fakes night after every meal bingham has been up here has he been up hes eaten me out of house and home my eyes caught the plate on the table polished clean except for a rim of egg and a few forlorn rinds of bacon and what was he doing in my ward i demanded she laughed oh jimmy comes up every night after youve gonedidnt you know i was in the professors ward before i was sent here on days we got to know each other pretty well oh i see i had not allowed for a rival in my calculations and i felt outraged that this complication should take the form of bingham deciding quickly that no sane woman could award him greater sexappeal than a fourthform schoolboy i continued my plan here whats the idea she demanded as i wedged her into a corner i only wanted to kiss you oh you did did you well you can get that out of your mind to start with but you let me yesterday i said in surprise well i wont today come out on friday no why because im going out with jimmy bingham now if youd like the ward report mr gordon you may have it i drew in my breath thank you nurse macpherson i should i rose the next morning a bitter man not only had bingham condemned me to a lifetime of living with nurse plumtree but his rivalry for the favours of nurse macpherson had the familiar psychological effect of making her wildly desirable it also brought to an end the professional honeymoon that bingham and i had enjoyed since my return to the hospital my toleration was already stretched thin because of his unendearing social habits there was only one bathroom on our floor where he came to shave every morning while i was taking my bath on my first day in the staff quarters he had greeted me heartily with good morning old chap while theres life theres soap eh which was passably funny as a beforebreakfast pleasantry but when he repeated it the next morning the morning after that and every morning for the following weeks i was ready to slit his throat with his own razor at meals bingham made a point of sitting next to me to emphasize our new chumminess and though he was too careful about money to let slip a technicality and incur a fine he found it difficult to keep his thoughts away from his work while eating perirenal fat hylum medulla and pelvis he murmured during supper one evening look out i whispered if the senior resident hears you youll be down half a crown but im not talking shop old chap he said wideeyed see this he stuck his fork into the middle of his steakandkidney pie nicest piece of dissected kidney ive seen for a long time young toolook at those lobulations shortly afterwards i pointedly offered him the bananas and i was glad to find he took the rest of his meals on the other side of the table i wondered at first if i was hypersensitive but bingham had already established his unpopularity with the rest of the residency by taking all the magazines up to his bedroom reading the lancet at breakfast and being unable to glance through a paper without leaving it fit only for wrapping chips although he glared furiously at anyone who talked in the commonroom while he was listening to the third programme he was unable to afford similar respect to his companions ideas of evening entertainment the brewer who had given the new surgical wing to the hospital had admirably topped off his donation with a supply of free beer to the resident doctors so we never found ourselves short of an excuse for a party these generally brought bingham down in his dressinggown complaining i say let a chap sleep wont you until one noisy evening he wrote to the hospital secretary saying that he would be obliged for a room elsewhere as his colleagues were apparently tearing up the commonroom immediately below the secretary hurried round the next morning to find the room looking as though it had been charged by a rhinoceros locked the door pocketed the key and angrily strode off to find the dean we had an hour of dangerous climbing round the fireescape and hard work with pails and brushes but when the secretary indignantly threw open the door the dean found the room as neat as a barracks with an aspidistra drooping from a brass pot on the piano and an open bible on the table but this did nothing to increase binghams likeability the crisis came the morning after my frustration by nurse macpherson when i strode into the ward after breakfast and found five strange faces in the beds where did those patients come from i demanded from nurse summers in astonishment they werent here last night theyre mr binghams binghams but damn it they were my only empty beds ive got five gastrectomies coming in this morning what right has he got to put his patients in my beds they were the duty firm last night theyre allowed to board out patients if theyre swamped with emergencies whats wrong with them anyway she picked up the diagnosis board from the sisters desk theyre all in for observation observation after examining all five i concluded that one was suffering from severe constipation and the rest had nothing wrong with them at all bingham i called as i spotted him in the corridor what the devil do you mean by cluttering up my ward with your cases he stiffened ive a perfect right to old chap perfect right my foot theres nothing wrong with any of them i bet you only admitted them because you couldnt decide if they had acute abdomens you were scared stiff of chucking them into the street that is a very unprofessional remark bingham hissed he stepped into the lift and slammed the gates unfortunately this time it worked its so damnably irritating i told grimsdyke in his room that evening heres this blasted bingham whos a walking disgrace to the medical profession and heres this firstrate girl squandering her precious nights off duty at his feet i cant believe it no accounting for the taste of women old lad he stretched himself thoughtfully on his bed frightful gargoyles and crooks they fall for sometimes youve only got to look through the wedding photos in the tatler but thisthis caliban bingham what on earth can she see in him grimsdyke screwed his monocle into his eye and stared at the ceiling let us not lose sight of the object of the treatment you wish to purge yourself of the hookworm plumtree right you intend to administer macpherson for this purpose but why not try some other anthelmintic the hospitals full of nurses ready to quiver at a housemans smile i was silent for a second as a matter of fact im rather fond of nan macpherson balderdash simple psychologyyou wish to assert your superiority over bingham by nabbing his mate its happening to chaps all the time you dont understand shes a terrific girl really tremendous vitality and good looks with a wonderful sense of humour delusions delusions delusions grimsdyke murmured putting his fingertips together anyway what do you know about psychology all your patients are asleep if you dont believe me try the experiment in reverse dangle plumtree in front of macpherson make her think shes wrecking the home i guarantee shell act like a thirsty cat with a saucer of milk although i had no faith in grimsdykes ability as a psychiatrist i decided to take his advice because he was a more experienced man of the world than myself unfortunately the next day was friday and nurse macpherson was placed beyond reach by her official three nights off duty she had clearly hinted to bingham of my rejection in his favour because he met me in the quadrangle at lunchtime with a broad grin slapped me on the back and said by the way old chap do you think youll need me for anything tomorrow night i mean to give you a hand with a drip for a perf or something why should i i asked coldly i never have done no but just in case i mean to say duckworths hs is standing in for me im going out he added as though announcing he was about to swim the channel i hope you enjoy yourself he giggled i shall old chap dont go out much you know but this is something special he slapped his thigh grinned again and winked eh old chap if you make your intentions as obvious to nurse macpherson as you do to me i said sourly you wont get her out of the nurses home good afternoon i strode angrily into the nearest doorway feeling sick my determination to win nurse macpherson was fanned by binghams grinning at me rubbing his hands and declaring lovely life eh every time i met him the next day meanwhile i was glad to hear from the junior pathology demonstrator that nurse plumtree was richly infected with streptococcus pyogenes and would be off duty for at least a week i sent her a letter of sympathy and a bunch of flowers and patiently waited for the return of her rival the campaign was easier than i had expected i apologized for my behaviour at our last meeting and explained that her overwhelming attraction had swept me away from nurse plumtree where my thoughts must henceforward dutifully repose i murmured that of course nurse plumtree was a delightful girl but if only nurse macpherson had been the staff nurse insteadi passed on all the remarks that nurse plumtree had made about her and prepared to sit in the ward kitchen every night and wait that was on monday by wednesday she had agreed to come out to dinner on her night offas long as i breathed not a word to binghamand by friday she was inviting me to help her look for lost teacloths in the small dark cosy linen cupboard behind the ward on sunday i decided that i was in love with her and on monday more exciting ideas began to take shape in my mind you know ive been getting on damn well with nan macpherson thanks to your advice i said to grimsdyke do you think thati mean what would you say the chances were of herwell being as cooperative on a grander scale as it were pretty good i should think he replied thoughtfully she has what the nurses call a reputation though that might merely mean she paints her toenails red and uses mascara do you think i dare ask why not at the worst she can only kick your teeth in after a brief and breathless spell in the linen cupboard that night i began nan about next week instead of just dinner how about i swallowed i had dismissed the fireescape as impracticable because of bingham how about nipping out to the country somewhere you know and well you know there was a surprised pause doctor doctor she said playfully is that an indecent proposal its a pretty decent one as far as i can see i said brightly im sorry i didnt mean to be funny about it but if youd feel inclined youll have to go night sisterll be here in a minute but about next week ill see she said laying her finger on my lips i promise i wouldnt tell a soul especially bingham he hasnt done the same sort of thing has he i asked with sudden horror she laughed jimmy isnt out of the mistletoe stage do say yes i implored i cant stand suspense you must go richard night sisters due any second i wont go till you tell me oh welli suppose i was going to buy a new tooth brush anyway nan darling how wonderful shhh and remembernot a soul how could you think id breathe a word i immediately woke up grimsdyke can you imagine it grim i said excitedly what luck shes agreed were nipping off for a dirty weekend or a dirty night anyway i corrected myself youve woken me up to tell me this disgusting piece of news i want your advice you see i havent had any experience ofof this sort of thing where do we go for instance brighton what do we sign in the visitors book smith or jones supposing they ask for our marriage licence or something theres a sort of country hotel called the judges arms on the way north which is very romantic ive heard you could try that now for gods sake let me get some sleep the judges arms thanks a million times old fellow i suppose youre going to these lengths to unload miss plumtree he asked sleepily turning over good lord id completely forgotten about her i dont like it grimsdyke muttered dropping off i dont like it a bit for the next few days bingham and i both slapped each other on the back like brothers what the psychology was behind it i didnt dare to work out the stubborn streptococcus in nurse plumtrees throat refused to budge she soon felt well again but as no nurse could be let loose to spray penicillinresistant organisms over the patients second opinions were summoned the senior ear nose and throat surgeon recommended that he remove her tonsils excise her nasal septum scrape out her sinuses and extract all her teeth the professor of bacteriology a simplerminded man advised a weeks holiday this was thought to be the most convenient course for everybody and the next day she left the hospital for mitcham with an armful of homebuilding magazines well announce it when i get back she declared as i saw her off so far i havent told a soulexcept my best friends of course itll be nice to have the date fixed for the wedding wont it now dont forgetno late nights while im away a couple of afternoons later in a state of devilish excitement i started haemorrhagic hilda and drove from the hospital car park to pick up nurse macpherson our plans had been laid the night before over a cup of ovaltine i had left my junior house surgeon on duty for me asking mr cambridge for permission to spend the night away from the hospital she had told bingham that duty to her parents demanded a visit to allay suspicion i arranged to meet her outside the zoo she was waiting with her attachйcase by the main gates hello hello hello i called drawing up and unhooking the loop of string that restrained the nearside door what a cad i am fancy keeping a girl waiting on an occasion like this i noticed that she was staring at me in amazement whats the matter i asked in alarm is my suit all right its my second best my god am i supposed to travel in that i remembered that she hadnt seen haemorrhagic hilda before its a remarkably good motor car i told her stoutly as reliable as a london bus and with a lot of charm about it you wait till we get going oh its charming all right like one of emetts railway engines how do i get aboarddo you let down a pair of steps i helped her into the car and she settled in the windsor chair i had lashed specially to the floorboards beside me i felt nettled i was proud of haemorrhagic hilda and even if she looked as startling on the road as george stevensons rocket such mockery hurt but refusing to allow the start of a great adventure to be marred by the petty pride of ownership i called cheerfully hang on and performed the rapid manipulation of the choke ignition throttle brake gearlever and hand petrol pump necessary to put haemorrhagic hilda in motion off we go to the wide open spaces by the way she said lighting a cigarette ive got to go to oxford street first oxford street but thats miles out of our way what on earth do you want to go there for i simply must do my shopping ive got to get a length of curtain material for my roomi cant stand the hospital stuff any longerand a birthday present for cissy jenkins and some kirbigrips and some linen buttons for my uniform and a teapot and some soap but couldnt you do it another time i mean to sayapart from anything else id like to get there in daylight the headlamps arent terribly efficient what other time you seem to forget im a working girl my dear young man oh sorry no offence of course she left me for an hour and a quarter in oxford street though the time passed quickly enough because i spent it driving through sidestreets looking for somewhere to park and anxiously peering out for policemen as though i were about to hold up a bank she rejoined me with a christmas eve load of parcels which she threw on to the sofa in the back and said phew what a bloody tussle drive on james are you sure youve got everything i asked stiffly except some cigarettes but that doesnt matter i can smoke yours my spirits had dropped badly since leaving st swithins and now it occurred to me that i had never seen nurse macpherson out of uniform before indeed i had never seen her in daylight at all for several weeks she was unfortunately one of those nurses who are flattered by the starched severity of their dress and she had chosen for our escapade an odd orange knitted outfit that recalled the woollen suits worn at one period by mr bernard shaw her face too suffered away from the nightclub dimness of a sleeping ward her makeup was careless the freckles that had enchanted me across the night report book now reminded me of a dozen skin diseases and i reflected that she must have begun her nursing training comparatively late because she was clearly several years older than i was my mood was darkened further by the weather which had turned from a lunchtime of brittle blue sky and sharpedged sun to an afternoon in which the clouds and the twilight were already conspiring to make me confess hildas deficient headlights on top of this i was getting a sore throat nurse plumtrees streptococcus breathed into our farewell kiss was already breeding generations of grandchildren across the mucous membrane of my pharynx i had left the hospital with a halfperceived tickling in the back of my throat and now i felt like a fireeater after a bad performance fortunately nurse macpherson became more romantic as we left the outskirts of london and began stroking my arm against the steeringwheel while murmuring that she felt deliciously abandoned she even managed a few flattering words about hilda expressing surprise that the car had managed to travel so far without stopping or coming off the road this was encouraging but i was too busy to listen attentively through contending with the traffic on the great north road which that afternoon was composed only of cars driven by men late for important interviews bicycles propelled by blind imbeciles and lorries carrying boilers for ocean liners but we progressed without breakdown or accident and when darkness fell i was delighted to find that the headlights shone more brightly than before sometimes both of them at once by the time the judges arms appeared in front of us i began to feel more cheerful and more appreciative of the unusual treat in store for me here we are nan i said as i pulled up at the front door she peered through the cracked window are you sure it looks like a municipal lunatic asylum to me its very romantic inside andaccording to a friend of mine who ought to knowtheyre very broadminded my heart was beginning to beat more quickly sure youve got the ring on the right finger i asked nervously of course i have put these parcels in your case will you i cant possibly get them in mine we got out of the car when i had asked grimsdyke more about the judges arms he had murmured that it was a coaching inn in the best english tradition it was in the english innkeeping tradition right enough but the most widespread rather than the best the walls of the hall sprouted thickly the heads of deer otters badgers foxes ferrets stoats and weasels among the glazed bodies of pike salmon trout perch and bream in generous glass coffins in the corner a pair of rigid snipe huddled beneath a glass dome and over the stairs was impaled the horned skull of a buffalo the place was so dark empty and musty that it immediately reminded me of a corner in the natural history museum in cromwell road on one side of the hall was a door with a cracked frostedglass panel embossed with the words coffee room in curly letters opposite was a similar door marked lounge in the corner carefully hidden by a spiky palm leaning in a large brass pot was a hatch with a panel inviting inquiries in front of the hatch was a ledge bearing a small brass handbell secured to the wall by a length of chain cosy place murmured nurse macpherson its bound to be rather quiet i said feeling i ought to defend the hotel as well as haemorrhagic hilda were in the country you know she made no reply so i set down our cases picked up the bell and gave a timid tinkle she began to make up her face and i read a large notice in a black frame explaining that it was your own fault if anyone walked off with your valuables as no one appeared i rang the bell again not a sound came from the hotel i suppose they havent all been scared away said nurse macpherson snapping her compact closed you know like the marie celeste its just a sleepy part of the world i told her testily for my throat was beginning to hurt badly were not in piccadilly circus you know i can see it now she went on gazing at the sooty ceiling where it was gathered round the root of the tarnished chandelier we shall find every room empty meals halfeaten on the tables baths filled beds turned down fires burning in the grates some awful thing came through the front door perhaps from mars everyone has fled except for one corpse in the garden with its features twisted into an expression of spinechilling terror what a wonderful story for the newspapers well phone the daily express and in no time therell be reporters and photographers and these tedious little men from television saying now doctor will you explain how you happened to be here with a trained nurse please be quiet for a minute im doing my best i rang the bell again as though vending muffins with the other hand i rapped the frosted glass and nurse macpherson tapped a large and greasy gong with her foot yes the coffeeroom door had opened through it poked the head of an old man in no collar and a railwayporters waistcoat we want a room ill fetch mrs digby he said disappearing we waited in silence for some minutes i was beginning to wonder whether it would be less trouble to bundle nurse macpherson into haemorrhagic hilda and turn her out at the nurses home when the glass suddenly shot up beside me yes i turned to meet one of the most disagreeablelooking women i had seen in my life she had a thin peaky face cropped hair a gold pincenez on a chain and a dress apparently made from an old schoolmasters gown oh er good evening youre mrs digby yes good well you see i wanted a room yes you have a room yes i was now plainly nervous for we had reached the point in our adventure that i had rehearsed the most in the secrecy of my room it all seemed so easy in novels and the sunday papers once the initial difficulty of persuading the girl was overcome the rest of the trip was sheer enjoyment i had hoped at least for a genial boniface at the reception desk but now i felt more confident of seducing a hundred women than convincing this sharpeyed shrew that we were married what name she demanded opening as ledger like the domesday book phillimore i said i had decided that was the most naturalsounding alias i could imagine sign here she handed me a pen and spattering ink freely over the page i anxiously filled in the name address and nationality i noticed that the last column left a space for remarks the manageress blotted the book which of yous framleigh she asked frowning eh oh yes of course i am im framleigh mr framleigh the young ladys phillimore miss phillimore i cursed myself framleigh had been my second choice of nom damour and in my agitation i had scrawled it over the visitors book mrs digby was now looking at me like hamlet sizing up his uncle i tried to smile we want two rooms i said and i should think so too i put my hands in my pockets took them out and scratched the back of my head the young lady must register mrs digby handed the pen to nurse macpherson who coolly wrote across the page hortense phillimore park lane london manx feeling i should offer some innocent explanation of a young unmarried couple arriving for a single night in an unfrequented hotel in midwinter i said we happened to be travelling north were cousins you see were going to our uncles funeral charming old gentleman in the brass business you may have heard of him we both work in london and to save the expense we decided to come up together by car and we asked a man on the road for a good hotel ernest mrs digby poked her head out of the hatch like a cuckooclock ernest where are you ernest the head reappeared from the coffeeroom yes ernest take up the baggage ernest who looked unfit to carry anything heavier than a letter creaked arthritically across the floor the ladys in number three said mrs digby taking from the rack behind her a key secured to a steel flag nine inches long and the gentleman she carefully went to the far end of the rack is in number ninetyfour right said ernest picking up our cases foller me we happen to be cousins i told him as he stumbled up the stairs were going north for our uncles funeral he used to be in the brass business poor fellow we happen to work in london so miss phillimore and i decided to come up together on the road we met a man and i asked him to recommend a good hotel he said you cant beat the judges arms number three ernest interrupted as though announcing the winner of a raffle he threw open the door and switched on the light we found ourselves in an apartment the size of a billiardroom lined with darkbrown wallpaper and containing a pair of marbletopped tables a bowl of waxed fruit a dressingtable ornamented with cherubs a washstand with a mauve jug and basin and sufficient solid wardrobes to lock up a gang of burglars in the centre of the room was a large knobgarnished brass bedstead nurse macpherson who had said nothing since signing the register drew in her breath i dont believe it she muttered foller me ernest repeated ill see you downstairs in five minutes for a drink i said hope youll be comfortable oh ill be comfortable all right im used to sleeping in the middle of st pauls foller me ernest insisted number three was on the first floor but my room appeared to be at the far end of the latest extension to the building several of which had been added with floors at different levels dont know why she put you up here ernest grumbled pausing for breath halfway up a narrow staircase there aint been no one in ninetyfour since the farmers union number ninetyfour was immediately under the roof a narrow cold low damp room with a bed a commode and a washstand topped with a marble slab that reminded me of the postmortem room i gave ernest a shilling which he looked at carefully before saying goodnight and disappearing i sat heavily on the bed if this was romance i could understand why casanovas flourished only in warm climates i reached the ground floor before nurse macpherson as the hotel had resumed the sullen silence with which it had greeted us i decided to explore the door marked lounge this led to a small room with some furniture arranged haphazardly like the bodies of mountaineers frozen to death where they stood there were three or four more palms and in the corner was an iron grate bare of fire irons in which a tiny fire blushed with shame i was now feeling really ill and i needed a drink desperately there was a bell by the fireplace labelled service but knowing the hotel i supplemented a ring on this by opening the door and shouting hoy several times loudly from the coffeeroom which was now lighted as a preparation for dinner came a thin dark short young man in a tailsuit that stretched almost to his heels whatll you be wanting he asked with the amiability of citizens of the irish republic i want a drink sure you can have a drink if you want to what have you got oh anything at all he told me expansively theres gin whisky rum guinness crиme de menthe port egg nogg ill have whisky two doubles in one glass and have you any aspirin wouldnt you be feeling well id be feeling bloody awful and please hurry up by the time nurse macpherson appeared i had downed my quadruple whisky and twenty grains of aspirin while the waiter found some coal and brought the poker from the office we have to be careful over the fires he explained to me some of them commercial gentlemen pile it up as though they were stoking the queen mary nan my dear i greeted her more cheerfully youre looking very beautiful my god i could do with a drink too that room up theres absolutely freezing that would be number three asked the waiter sympathetically oh thats a terrible room that is its a wonder they put humans in it at all id rather sleep in the tent of a circus that i would we want some more drinks would the lady like a cocktail now i could do her a good cocktail and very reasonable two large whiskies will do as he left and we sat down on each side of the fire i began to feel better its a pity about the single rooms i said looking shiftily to see if the door was shut that old buzzard in the office quite put me off my stride it doesnt matter she said lighting a cigarette you can creep down as soon as everyone goes to bed it saves a lot of bother in the long run youve had some experience of thisthis sort of thing i asked really darling i wasnt born yesterday she glanced round her what a bloody hole youve taken me to if you dont mind my saying so this place looks like a waitingroom got up for the wake of a dead stationmaster im sorry really i am i reached for her hand but ive never done anything like this before andand i did so much want to do it with you nan she smiled and squeezed my fingers youre really very very sweet the waiter then returned with the drinks i was looking you up in the visitors book and i see youre from london he said what sort of line of business would you be in now im a doctor i bit my lip it was my second idiotic slip apart from the danger of discovery by confessing my profession i was now the target for everyones intimacies are you now and thats very interesting the waiter settled himself leaning on his upended tray ive a great admiration for the medical profession myself doctor it must be a great work a great work i had a brother now and he started off to be a doctor but he had some sort of trouble with the authorities now hes an oysteropener in one of the big hotels in oconnell street oh he would have been a fine doctor he would a lovely pair of hands he had on him and the lady wouldnt be a nurse would she it happens that we are cousins i told him firmly our uncle who was in the brass business has unfortunately died suddenly we are attending his funeral the reason we are travelling together is that we both work in london and it is obviously more convenient for us to share the same car the reason we are in this hotel is that we met a man on the road now its a very convenient thing that you should have come tonight doctor because i was having a lot of trouble with my feet you see and i was meaning to go to a doctor tomorrow but now youre here itll save me the journey i think that the arches must be dropped or something but i get a sort of burning pain along here which sort of moves round and round ill hear about your feet later if you really want me to will you please get us two more drinks but youve only just started those i know but we shall have finished them before you can turn round ive had some trouble with my kidneys too id like to talk to you about doctor yes yes later if you like but drinks now just as you please doctor i dont mind at all we had several more drinks after which nurse macpherson became more romantic the waiter fortunately had to go and serve dinner how about some food i suggested ummm im ravenous and theres a good three hours to kill before we can decently disappear i kissed her and she began to laugh i wonder how old plumtree is she asked both laughing we entered the coffeeroom i later decided that the decline of the evening really started with dinner the coffeeroom itself instantly damped our spirits it was a long cold place decorated only with pictures of horses in heavy gilt frames most of the tables were bare those laid for dinner being huddled round a small fire in a large grate at one end our fellow diners were a pair of old ladies at a table thickly covered with patentmedicine bottles an elderly couple a redfaced fat man with a ginger moustache and a thin whitehaired man who was drinking soup and reading the paper propped against a bottle of beer everyone was silent and eating steadily as though they were anxious to get back to the unknown corners of the hotel where they lurked if you please doctor over here doctor said the waiter loudly interrupting his service and clattering a vegetable dish on the table ive put you nice and near the fire doctor he crossed to a small table almost in the hearth and began beating the seat of a chair violently with his napkin there you are doctor and the young lady too now doctor nice and cosy would it be coming from a land where only the church and the medical profession are venerated the waiter had automatically made us his favourities this was good for the service but it immediately made everyone in the room fix us with their fiercest attention and what would you be having doctor he continued as we sat down i looked at the menu ill have some of the potage dubarry i said trying to appear unaware of the spectators oh i wouldnt have any of that doctor very well i glanced at nurse macpherson well try the steamed plaice with pommes vapeur and cabbage the waiter who had his orderpad in one hand scratched his head with the butt of his pencil i wouldnt touch the fish if i was you doctor mind its not a thing id tell anybody but even the cats downstairs are refusing the fish how about the casserole de mouton and well have some wine he looked blank so i added you have some wine sure weve got wine ill bring you a bottle red wine i insisted id like to choose a burgundy if youve got one ready at room temperature you just leave it to me doctor did i understand sir said the man with the ginger moustache that you are a medical man i nodded my name is major porter he continued if i may effect an introduction to your good self and your lady wife im a lady but no wife nurse macpherson said tartly were cousins as it happens i explained we have an uncle in the lead business in scotland who died and weve been to his funeral so we came together because we both work in london i mean were going to his funeral poor fellow i felt that my whisky before dinner had made the story mildly confused so to clarify it i added he wasnt in the lead business i mean the brass business i noticed nurse macphersons mouth harden i hope you wont mind my saying so major porter continued but i dont believe in doctors ive nothing against doctors individually mindnot a thing some of my best friends are doctors ive no faith in the medical profession as a whole neither have i said nurse macpherson with the frankness of the slightly tipsy really madam im interested to hear it are youforgive me if i askat all connected with medical work yes im a member of a sisterhood of druids we use a good deal of mistletoe and arent past sacrifice at sunrise can i do anything for your warts major porter seemed surprised but continued im sure youll be interested in my case doctor in fact id like your opinion on it not that i expect you to approve of my treatment he looked at me slyly you fellows stick together eh theres no closed shop like the doctors shop i often say i mean no offence of course now would you believe it doctor he said drawing back his coat and protruding his abdomen proudly at the age of five i was given only six months to live i recognized wearily the doctors second social blight worse than the men who insist on telling you about their orthodox illnesses are the people cured by faith herbs and osteopathy major porter addressed the coffeeroom about his miraculous lease of life while we ate our mutton stew and drank our wine boiling hot from under the stillroom tap by the time the waiter reverently bore us the porcelain slab with the remains of the cheese the major was tugging up his trousers and pointing to the scar of his old tibial osteomyelitis the whitehaired man who like the major was a commercial traveller joined in with the story of the remarkable cure effected by a man in catford on his sisterinlaw who came out all over when she ate strawberries then the waiter made himself comfortable leaning against the fireplace and began talking about his kidneys what you need for your kidneys declared nurse macpherson with slight slurring is pure water flush them drink waterseveral gallons a day thats a damn silly remark i said i was beginning to have a hangover my throat was raw and i was starting to shiver that treatment went out with pneumonia jackets and icebags you restrict fluids and give em a high protein intake she looked at me steadily have you ever nursed a case of nephritis she demanded you dont have to know any medicine to be a nurse my dear any more than you have to know dietetics to be a good cook she was about to reply when the old gentleman said doctor and nurse eh what brings you to this part of the world we met a man on the road who recommended the hotel you see were cousins were going to the funeral of our uncle in the brass business for gods sake shouted nurse macpherson not again she stood up im going to bed bed i suddenly remembered what we were there for im going in a minute too i said as she stalked from the room it isnt ten yet said the major lets have a drink no thanks i turned to the waiter who was rubbing his loins thoughtfully under his coat bring me whats left in the whisky bottle ill take it to my room i sat on the edge of my bed feeling miserable i wished i were tucked up in a ward at st swithins with someone bringing me throat lozenges every halfhour but i would have to go through with it nurse macpherson the unruffled heroine of a dozen such adventures would roast me in her contempt if i didnt after waiting for the hotel to become silent i slowly undressed and put on my dressinggown carefully i opened the door i began to creep down the stairs towards the first floor the effect of fever excitement and alcohol raised my pulse rate alarmingly as i felt my way along the darkened corridor towards room number three i had carefully memorized my landmarks before dinner and i remembered that you turned left by the fireextinguisher went down three steep stairs and reached the firstfloor landing i was checking my position by feeling for a marble statuette of britannia when the light went on yes mrs digby in hairnet and dressinggown stood at her bedroom door i tried to smile again good evening she said nothing i was looking for the bathroom theres a bathroom on your floor oh really is there i didnt notice it it is opposite your room there is bath written on the door in large white letters thank you thank you very much stupid of me coming all this way should have seen it all conveniences what good hotel capital she made no reply so i made my way back along the passage she waited at her open door until i had disappeared then put the light out i tried to creep back after shivering on the upper landing for ten minutes but she opened her door again before i had reached the foot of the stairs did you say opposite my room i asked with bath on it yes well thanks good night to you a very good night to you i went back to my bedroom and drank the rest of the whisky it was then eleventhirty clearly i should have to wait another hour or even two before operating my risky sortie i lay down on top of my bed and picked up the lancet which i had somehow included in my packing when i woke up it was eightthirty in the morning god almighty i said i already saw myself the laughingstock of st swithins i dressed quickly dashed downstairs and threw open the door of nurse macphersons room it was empty with her pink nightie rumpled on the bed so was the hall below and the coffeeroom if youre looking for the lady said the waiter shes gone out for a walk with the major nurse macpherson and i said little on the journey home when we were nearing the zoo again she began to laugh i dont really see theres anything very funny in it i told her sourly ive been extremely unwell all the time ive got a roaring temperature and how did i know what the bloody place was like im not blaming you about the hotel i was just thinking what a laugh the girls will get in the nurses home you wouldnt tell them i asked anxiously why not a nurses life is a dull one it can always do with brightening up if you breathe a word about this to your friends i said savagely ill spill it all round the residency she laughed again you wouldnt dare i damn well would but i knew she was right nurse plumtree never spoke to me again two weeks later nurse macpherson became engaged to bingham it was hard luck old lad grimsdyke said sympathetically still it might have been worse there was one fellow i knew who took a girl away for a weekend to torquay best hotel no expense spared and so on theyd just got to their room and hed opened the windows to have a breath of sea air when what do you think he saw her whole bloody family arriving for their summer holidays at the front door ma pa and several small sisters and brothers phew we were sitting in his room some time later i stared gloomily at my drink in his toothglass my throat was better but my pride would wear its scars for a lifetime my trouble i said solemnly is women come come richard a less flighty citizen than you would be hard to discover disregarding the pocket harem you were running until this disaster ive never thought of you as one of natures bottompinchers i dont go chasing women right and left i admit but ever since i qualified i seem to keep getting involved with them just the same first it was the shocking female married to hockett then there was that smooth piece of goods in park lane next plumtree then that frightful nympho macpherson personally im all for getting in the clutches of unscrupulous women now and then grimsdyke said cheerfully rather fun but it was never like this when we were students you underestimate the fatal allure of a medical qualification old lad in a quiet way its about ten times as powerful as any uniform you think so sure of it look at all these chaps that get hauled in front of the gmc why do you suppose every textbook starts by telling you to have a nurse handy when examining any female from nine to ninety then look at the medical profession as a whole a more pugugly collection of badlydressed social misfits would be difficult to find true i admitted allure old lad remember it have another drink the unpleasant truth i said is that ive shirked the responsibility of my ambitions im not saying ive been a goodtime charlie but now its a year since i qualified and i havent gone far towards becoming a surgeon youve learnt a lot about men and women as opposed to male and female patients though unfortunately that cuts no ice with the fellowship examiners theres no easy way out ill have to buckle down to the books again how about a job i sighed my appointment at st swithins had only another week to run ill have to start on those beastly interviews again i suppose this time ill address the committee dear sir or madam the next few days were sad ones i would be sorry to lose the companionship of the residency and to leave at last the hospital that had been the centre of my life for seven years but there was no alternative under the hospital rules i had to make way for the junior men just qualified and i could never gain promotion to become a registrar like hatrick without my fellowship i could only say goodbye to st swithins as cheerfully as possible turn again to the back pages of the bmj and mark the date of the next reunion dinner in my diary then hope appeared outlandishly embodied in the professor of surgery i had gone to his laboratory behind the surgical block to fetch the notes of one of our patients when he unexpectedly appeared from his office gordon sir will you step inside a minute licking my lips nervously i followed him into his tiny room which was filled with ungainly physiological apparatus pickled things in pots piles of textbooks journals in several languages and the forbidding photographs of his predecessors in the chair sit down he commanded i gingerly took the edge of a packingcase marked radioactive material while he sat in his swivel chair and pulled his white coat tightly round him i wondered what was coming i had carefully avoided the professor since my return but every time i caught his eye i had felt him mentally signing my certificate of lunacy i had lunch with my friend mr justice hopcroft today he began i said nothing we recalled that incident when you were my casualty hs i had hoped sir he might have forgotten it on the contrary we laughed about it heartily most amusing in retrospect hopcroft has a lively sense of humour you know some of his remarks when passing sentence have caused many a chuckle in the bar im sure they have sir there was silence while the professor stared hard at a pair of kidneys mounted in a glass jar i was perhaps rather hasty with you gordon he confessed its kind of you to say so sir unfair even not at all sir the interview was developing more comfortably than i had imagined i deserved it i added indulgently i might say it has worried me somewhat since if ones judgement once becomes clouded by ones emotions theres no telling where it will end there was another silence bingham said the professor yes sir a friend of yours hardly a close one sir i will confess gordonin confidencethat bingham has been something of a disappointment to me the young man has ability im not denying it but i sometimes have a little difficulty in the operating theatre deciding which of us is the professor of surgery quite so sir i said i gather he is not one of the most popular members of the residency not the most popular sir a job on the unit here has come up unexpectedly the professor went on the resident pathologistshiradeehas had to return to bombay its a fairly leisurely job which would give a man plenty of time to work for his fellowship some minor research would be expected of course the appointment will be made with the others at the committee on wednesday eveningnaturally its my duty to support bingham for the job but i cant answer for the rest of the committee and in the present state of my relations with bingham i assure you it would not take a great deal to make me change my mind in short gordon if you agree id like to make up for my somewhat highhanded treatment of you earlier in your career by at least offering you a chance of the job will you apply on the usual form i was so excited that i was almost unable to sleep for the rest of the week in the operating theatre where i now approached the table with the confidence of robert liston in his prime i began fumbling so badly that hatrick declared wearily that i was again in love every time i saw bingham approaching i avoided him indeed i had hardly spoken to him at all since his engagement apart from stumbling out my congratulations with the rest but on the evening before the meeting i was forced to seek his company i was sitting in my room after dinner writing up my case notes when i became aware of an unpleasant smell as i sniffed it grew stronger from a whiff of the southend mudflats it rapidly turned into the odour of a faulty sewage farm and within a few minutes it appeared that some large animal was decomposing in the room next door holding my handkerchief over my nose i banged on binghams door come in bingham was in his shirtsleeves boiling something in a glass beaker over a spiritlamp good god man i exclaimed what the devil are you cooking what this oh its manure old chap he said calmly manure yes old chap ordinary horse manure you see the profs very interested in the enzymes present in the manure of different animals pure research you know ive studied it a bit and it might easily throw a good bit of light on the old human guts interesting eh he blew out the lamp ive collected specimens of all sorts of animal manure he continued proudly picking up a row of small testtubes this ones dog thats cat thats pigeon and the end ones ferret i just caught the horse when i saw a carters van stop outside casualty and what may i ask is all this in aid of bingham if you can keep a secret old chap ill tell you fact is ive put in for the path job on the unit knowing the profs interested in this line of research i had a go at it ive had one or two interesting ideas which ive put to him already as a matter of fact and you think youll get this job do you dont want to boast old chap said bingham rubbing his hands but i fancy my chances a bit it happens that the prof of bacteriology and a few of the consultant surgeons have heard of this research im doing off my own bat and it seems to have impressed them as for the prof hes tickled pink for some reason he particularly wanted to study the elephants manure and was talking about cabling to africa when i said whats wrong with the zoo ive asked them to send a specimen round to him he sat down on his bed and pulled out his pipe by the way old chap he continued with a sheepish grin best man win and all that eh he nudged me know what i mean old chap dont you dont worry im as broadminded as the next about nan you were a bit sweet on her yourself eh when she went on nights i mean you couldnt blind me to it still no hard feelings only one of us could be chosen couldnt he old chap i hope the fact that you didnt make any headway doesnt prevent our shaking hands it certainly doesnt i said shaking she tells me you tried to kiss her once he added nudging me again but no ill will old chap one of us bingham is a very very lucky man i told him laying a hand on his shoulder very decent of you old chap not a bit i said old chap the next twentyfour hours were worrying knowing binghams ability to worm his way into the estimation of his seniors i was increasingly despondent about my chances of stealing the pathology job from under his nose as the morning of wednesday passed i felt that i was again waiting for the result of an examination with the recollection of having made one certain boner in the middle of the fourth question its no good worrying grimsdyke said as we sat in my room before supper the old boys will gather for the meeting in about an hours time and youll either be in or you wont and anyone with half an eye can tell that binghams a firstclass tapeworm but hes a damn clever tapeworm i insisted look how he bamboozled the prof in the first place now hes playing mothers little helpmeet over this research business oh blast bingham i said with sudden bad temper he did me out of the first job and now hell dish me with this one i wouldnt mind if he was a decent human being but of all the nasty grovelling slimy the telephone began ringing in the room next door as it continued i yelled and now i have to answer his bloody phone for him when i came back i was grinning i think im going to get that job i told grimsdyke you do and why that was the prof the zoo have sent him his specimen of elephants manure all right seven tons of it theyve unloaded it in his front garden i was appointed resident pathologist to the surgical professional unit and at the same meeting grimsdyke was promoted to senior resident anaesthetist very gratifying he said as we strolled contentedly into the residency after the pubs had shut that night very very gratifying virtue triumphant vice confounded and all that i cant believe it i said i just cant believe it it means weve got another whole year to enjoy the hospitality of dear old st swithins we will grow old together old lad but i didnt know you were putting in for the anaesthetics job you never told me didnt i he screwed in his monocle must have forgotten to mention it the fact isand far be it from a grimsdyke to express any liking for the toil that earns his daily breadbut im getting quite interested in doing dopes alsoi fancy myselfim getting the hang of it right and left did you notice that endotracheal tube i passed this morning very pretty youre as bad as bingham i said laughing ah bingham i might add that in case my sterling qualities as an anaesthetist were overlooked at tonights meeting yesterday i handed that old trouts cheque for ten thousand quid to the senior anaesthetist to buy himself some research i fancied that might strengthen the old boys determination if voices were raised against me youre worse than bingham i found bingham in his room starting to pack well old chap he said trying to look pleasant you got the better of me this time eh im afraid so bingham no ill will i hope oh no not a bit old chap weve always been chums havent we besides i have something which you can never have deciding that he was referring to nurse macpherson i said too true i think ill have a go at general practice bingham went on just for a spell of course before i get my fellowship does a chap good have you anywhere in mind not exactly he continued folding his trousers but theres a jolly smart agency im going to tomorrow called wilson willowick and wellbeloved theyll fix me up yes theyll fix you up all right theres just one thing he continued he grinned sheepishly fact is not getting this jobs a blessing in disguise in gp i can afford to get married a bit earlier andwell nan and i will probably be man and wife by the end of next week its jolly good and im jolly pleased of course but its a bit of a rush hasnt given me time to arrange anything thing is old chap wheres a good and fairly inexpensive place to spend theah honeymoon do you know of anywhere the judges arms i said immediately its a hotel on the way north very romantic thanks old chap ill remember that theres just one thing id make a surprise of itkeep it quiet where youre going until you actually arrive a chum of mine did and claims it gives you something to talk about in the painful journey from the reception by jove old chap what a terrif idea ill certainly do that well thanks a lot old chap dont mench old chap i said my happiness was complete
