eoin colfer artemis fowl prologue how does one describe artemis fowl various psychiatrists have tried and failed the main problem is artemiss own intelligence he bamboozles every test thrown at him he has puzzled the greatest medical minds and sent many of them gibbering to their own hospitals there is no doubt that artemis is a child prodigy but why does someone of such brilliance dedicate himself to criminal activities this is a question that can be answered by only one person and he delights in not talking perhaps the best way to create an accurate picture of artemis is to tell the by now famous account of his first villainous venture i have put together this report from firsthand interviews with the victims and as the tale unfolds you will realize that this was not easy the story began several years ago at the dawn of the twentyfirst century artemis fowl had devised a plan to restore his familys fortune a plan that could topple civilizations and plunge the planet into a crossspecies war he was twelve years old at the time chapter the book ho chi minh city in the summer sweltering by anyones standards needless to say artemis fowl would not have been willing to put up with such discomfort if something extremely important had not been at stake important to the plan sun did not suit artemis he did not look well in it long hours indoors in front of the monitor had bleached the glow from his skin he was white as a vampire and almost as testy in the light of day i hope this isnt another wildgoose chase butler he said his voice soft and clipped especially after cairo it was a gentle rebuke they had travelled to egypt on the word of butlers informant no sir im certain this time nguyen is a good man hmm droned artemis unconvinced passersby would have been amazed to hear the large eurasian refer to the boy as sir this was after all the third millennium but this was no ordinary relationship and these were no ordinary tourists they were sitting outside a kerbside cafe on dong khai street watching the local teenagers circle the square on mopeds nguyen was late and the pathetic patch of shade provided by the umbrella was doing little to improve artemiss mood but this was just his daily pessimism beneath the sulk was a spark of hope could this trip actually yield results would they find the book it was too much to hope for a waiter scurried to their table more tea sirs he asked head bobbing furiously artemis sighed spare me the theatrics and sit down the waiter turned instinctively to butler who was after all the adult but sir i am the waiter artemis tapped the table for attention you are wearing handmade loafers a silk shirt and three gold signet rings your english has a tinge of oxford about it and your nails have the soft sheen of the recently manicured you are not a waiter you are our contact nguyen xuan and you have adopted this pathetic disguise to discreetly check for weaponry nguyens shoulders sagged it is true amazing hardly a ragged apron does not a waiter make nguyen sat pouring some mint tea into a tiny china cup let me fill you in on the weapons status continued artemis i am unarmed but butler here myahbutler has a sig sauer in his shoulder holster two shrike throwing knives in his boots a derringer twoshot up his sleeve garrotte wire in his watch and three stun grenades concealed in various pockets anything else butler the cosh sir oh yes a good old ballbearing cosh stuffed down his shirt nguyen brought the cup trembling to his lips dont be alarmed mister xuan smiled artemis the weapons will not be used on you nguyen didnt seem reassured no continued artemis butler could kill you a hundred different ways without the use of his armoury though im sure one would be quite sufficient nguyen was by now thoroughly spooked artemis generally had that effect on people a pale adolescent speaking with the authority and vocabulary of a powerful adult nguyen had heard the name fowl before who hadnt in the international underworld but hed assumed hed be dealing with artemis senior not this boy though the word boy hardly seemed to do this gaunt individual justice and the giant butler it was obvious that he could snap a mans backbone like a twig with those mammoth hands nguyen was starting to think that no amount of money was worth another minute in this strange company and now to business said artemis placing a micro recorder on the table you answered our web advertisement nguyen nodded suddenly praying his information was accurate yes mistermaster fowl what youre looking fori know where it is really and am i supposed to take your word for this you could be walking me straight into an ambush my family is not without enemies butler snatched a mosquito out of the air beside his employers ear no no said nguyen reaching for his wallet here look artemis studied the polaroid he willed his heart to maintain a calm beat it seemed promising but anything could be faked these days with a pc and flatbed scanner the picture showed a hand reaching from layered shadows a mottled green hand hmm he murmured explain this woman she is a healer near tu do street she works in exchange for rice wine all the time drunk artemis nodded it made sense the drinking one of the few consistent facts his research had unearthed he stood smoothing the creases from his white polo shirt very well lead on mister nguyen nguyen wiped the sweat from his stringy moustache information only that was the agreement i dont want any curses on my head butler expertly gripped the informant behind the neck im sorry mister nguyen but the time when you had a choice in matters is long past butler steered the protesting vietnamese to a rented fourwheel drive that was hardly necessary on the flat streets of ho chi minh city or saigon as the locals still called it but artemis preferred to be as insulated from civilians as possible the jeep inched forward at a painfully slow rate made all the more excruciating by the anticipation building in artemiss chest he could suppress it no longer could they at last be at the end of their quest after six false alarms across three continents could this winesodden healer be the gold at the end of the rainbow artemis almost chuckled gold at the end of the rainbow hed made a joke now theres something that didnt happen every day the mopeds parted like fish in a giant shoal there seemed to be no end to the crowds even the alleyways were full to bursting with vendors and hagglers cooks dropped fish heads into woks of hissing oil and urchins threaded their way underfoot searching for unguarded valuables others sat in the shade wearing out their thumbs on gameboys nguyen was sweating right through his khaki top it wasnt the humidity he was used to that it was this whole cursed situation he should have known better than to mix magic and crime he made a silent promise that if he got out of this he would change his ways no more answering shady internet requests and certainly no more consorting with the sons of european crime lords the jeep could go only so far eventually the side streets grew too narrow for the fourwheel drive artemis turned to nguyen it seems we must proceed on foot mister nguyen run if you like but expect a sharp and fatal pain between your shoulder blades nguyen glanced into butlers eyes they were a deep blue almost black there was no mercy in those eyes dont worry he said i wont run they climbed down from the vehicle a thousand suspicious eyes followed their progress along the steaming alley an unfortunate pickpocket attempted to steal butlers wallet the manservant broke the mans fingers without looking down they were given a wide berth after that the alley narrowed to a rutted lane sewage and drainpipes fed directly on to the muddy surface cripples and beggars huddled on ricemat islands most of the residents of this lane had nothing to spare with the exception of three well demanded artemis where is she nguyen jabbed a finger towards a black triangle beneath a rusted fire escape there under there she never comes out even to buy rice spirits she sends a runner now can i go artemis didnt bother answering instead he picked his way across the puddled lane to the lee of the fire escape he could discern furtive movements in the shadows butler could you hand me the goggles butler plucked a set of nightvision glasses from his belt and placed them in artemiss outstretched hand the focus motor buzzed to suit the light artemis fixed the glasses to his face everything became radioactive greentaking a deep breath he turned his gaze to the squirming shadows something squatted on a raffia mat shifting uneasily in the almost nonexistent light artemis finetuned the focus the figure was small abnormally so and wrapped in a filthy shawl empty spirit jugs were halfburied in the mud around her one forearm poked from the material it seemed green but then so did everything else madam he said i have a proposition for you the figures head wobbled sleepily wine she rasped her voice like nails on a school board wine english artemis smiled the gift of tongues aversion to light check check irish actually now about my proposition the healer shook a bony finger craftily wine first then talk butler the bodyguard reached into a pocket and drew out a halfpint of the finest irish whiskey artemis took the bottle and held it teasingly beyond the shadows he barely had time to remove his goggles when the clawlike hand darted from the gloom to snatch the whiskey a mottled green hand there was no doubt artemis swallowed a triumphant grin pay our friend butler in full remember mister nguyen this is between us you dont want butler to come back do you no no master fowl my lips are sealed they had better be or butler will seal them permanently nguyen skipped off down the alley so relieved to be alive that he didnt even bother counting the sheaf of us currency most unlike him in any event it was all there all twenty thousand dollars not bad for half an hours work artemis turned back to the healer now madam you have something that i want the healers tongue caught a drop of alcohol at the corner of her mouth yes irish sore head bad tooth i heal artemis replaced the nightvision goggles and squatted to her level i am perfectly healthy madam apart from a slight dustmite allergy and i dont think even you can do anything about that no what i want from you is your book the hag froze bright eyes glinted from beneath the shawl book she said cautiously i dont know about no book i am healer you want book go to library artemis sighed with exaggerated patience you are no healer you are a sprite pshуg fairy kadalun whichever language you prefer to use and i want your book for a long moment the creature said nothing then she threw back the shawl from her forehead in the green glow of the nightvision goggles her features leaped at artemis like a halloween mask the fairys nose was long and hooked under two slitted golden eyes her ears were pointed and the alcohol addiction had melted her skin like putty if you know about the book human she said slowly fighting the numbing effects of the whiskey then you know about the magic i have in my fist i can kill you with a snap of my fingers artemis shrugged i think not look at you you are near dead the rice wine has dulled your senses reduced to healing warts pathetic i am here to save you in return for the book what could a human want with our book that is no concern of yours all you need to know are your options the sprites pointed ears quivered options one you refuse to give us the book and we go home leaving you to rot in this sewer yes said the fairy i choose this option ah no dont be so eager if we leave without the book you will be dead in a day a day a daythe healer laughed i will outlive you by a century even fairies tethered to the human realm can survive the ages not with half a pint of holy water inside them said artemis tapping the now empty whiskey bottle the fairy blanched then screamed a high keening horrible sound holy water you have murdered me human true admitted artemis it should start to burn any minute now the fairy poked her stomach tentatively the second option listening now are we very well then option two you give me the book for thirty minutes only then i return your magic to you the sprites jaw dropped return my magic not possible oh but it is i have in my possession two ampoules one a vial of spring water from the fairy well sixty metres below the ring of tara possibly the most magical place on earth this will counteract the holy water and the other the other is a little shot of manmade magic a virus that feeds on alcohol mixed with a growth reagent it will flush every drop of rice wine from your body remove the dependence and even bolster your failing liver itll be messy but after a day youll be zipping around as though you were a thousand years old again the sprite licked her lips to be able to rejoin the people tempting how do i know to trust you human you have tricked me once already good point heres the deal i give you the water on faith then after ive had a look at the book you get the booster take it or leave it the fairy considered the pain was already curling around her abdomen she thrust out her wrist i take it i thought you might butler the giant manservant unwrapped a soft velcroed case containing a syringe gun and two vials he loaded the clear one shooting it into the sprites clammy arm the fairy stiffened momentarily and then relaxed strong magic she breathed yes but not as strong as your own will be when i give you the second injection now the book the sprite reached into the folds of her filthy robe rummaging for an age artemis held his breath this was it soon the fowls would be great again a new empire would rise with artemis fowl the second at its head the fairy woman withdrew a closed fist no use to you anyway written in the old tongue artemis nodded not trusting himself to speak she opened her knobbly fingers lying in her palm was a tiny golden volume the size of a matchbox here human thirty of your minutes no more butler took the tiny tome reverentially the bodyguard activated a compact digital camera and began photographing each waferthin page of the book the process took several minutes when he was finished the entire volume was stored on the cameras chip artemis preferred not to take chances with information airport security equipment had been known to wipe many a vital disk so he instructed his aide to transfer the file to his portable phone and from there email it to fowl manor in dublin before the thirty minutes were up the file containing every symbol in the fairy book was sitting safely in the fowl server artemis returned the tiny volume to its owner nice doing business with you the sprite lurched to her knees the other potion human artemis smiled oh yes the restoring booster i suppose i did promise yes human promised very well but before we administer it i must warn you that purging is not pleasant youre not going to enjoy this one bit the fairy gestured around her at the squalid filth you think i enjoy this i want to fly again butler loaded the second vial shooting this one straight into the carotid artery the sprite immediately collapsed on the mat her entire frame quivering violently time to leave commented artemis a hundred years of alcohol leaving a body by any means possible is not a pretty sight the butlers had been serving the fowls for centuries it had always been the way indeed there were several eminent linguists of the opinion that this was how the noun originated the first record of this unusual arrangement was when virgil butler had been contracted as servant bodyguard and cook to lord hugo de pole for one of the first great norman crusades at the age of ten butler children were sent to a private training centre in israel where they were taught the specialized skills necessary to guard the latest in the fowl line these skills included cordon bleu cooking marksmanship a customized blend of martial arts emergency medicine and information technology if at the end of their training there was not a fowl to guard then the butlers were eagerly snapped up as bodyguards for various royal personages generally in monaco or saudi arabia once a fowl and a butler were put together they were paired for life it was a demanding job and lonely but the rewards were handsome if you survived to enjoy them if not then your family received a sixfigure settlement plus a monthly pension the current butler had been guarding young master artemis for twelve years since the moment of his birth and though they adhered to the ageold formalities they were much more than master and servant artemis was the closest thing butler had to a friend and butler was the closest artemis had to a father albeit one who obeyed orders butler held his tongue until they were aboard the heathrow connection from bangkok then he had to ask artemis artemis looked up from the screen of his powerbook he was getting a head start on the translation yes the sprite why didnt we simply keep the book and leave her to die a corpse is evidence butler my way the people will have no reason to be suspicious but the sprite i hardly think she will confess to showing humans the book in any case i mixed a slight amnesiac into her second injection when she finally wakes up the last week will be a blur butler nodded appreciatively always two steps ahead that was master artemis people said he was a chip off the old block they were wrong master artemis was a brandnew block the likes of which had never been seen before doubts assuaged butler returned to his copy of guns and ammo leaving his employer to unravel the secrets of the universe cchapter translation by now you must have guessed just how far artemis fowl was prepared to go in order to achieve his goal but what exactly was this goal what outlandish scheme would involve the blackmailing of an alcoholaddicted sprite the answer was gold artemiss search had begun two years previously when he first became interested in surfing the internet he quickly found the more arcane sites alien abduction ufo sightings and the supernatural but most specifically the existence of the people trawling through gigabytes of data he found hundreds of references to fairies from nearly every country in the world each civilization had its own term for the people but they were undoubtedly members of the same hidden family several stories mentioned a book carried by each fairy it was their bible containing as it allegedly did the history of their race and the commandments that governed their extended lives of course this book was written in gnommish the fairy text and would be of no use to any human artemis believed that with todays technology the book could be translated and with this translation you could begin to exploit a whole new group of creatures know thine enemy was artemiss motto so he immersed himself in the lore of the people until he had compiled a huge database on their characteristics but it wasnt enough so artemis put out a call on the web irish businessman will pay large amount of us dollars to meet a fairy sprite leprechaun pixie the responses had been mostly fraudulent but ho chi minh city had paid off artemis was perhaps the only person alive who could take full advantage of his recent acquisition he still retained a childlike belief in magic tempered by an adult determination to exploit it if there was anybody capable of relieving the fairies of some of their magical gold it was artemis fowl the second it was early morning before they reached fowl manor artemis was anxious to bring up the file on his computer but first he decided to call in on mother angeline fowl was bedridden she had been since her husbands disappearance nervous tension the physicians said nothing for it but rest and sleeping pills that was almost a year ago butlers little sister juliet was sitting at the foot of the stairs her gaze was boring a hole in the wall even the glitter mascara couldnt soften her expression artemis had seen that look already just before juliet had suplexed a particularly cheeky pizza boy the suplex artemis gathered was a wrestling move an unusual obsession for a teenage girl but then again she was after all a butler problems juliet juliet straightened hurriedly my own fault artemis apparently i left a gap in the curtains mrs fowl couldnt sleep hmm muttered artemis scaling the oak staircase slowly he worried about his mothers condition she hadnt seen the light of day in a long time now then again should she miraculously recover emerging revitalized from her bedchamber it would signal the end of artemiss own extraordinary freedom it would be back off to school and no more spearheading criminal enterprises for you my lad he knocked gently on the arched double doors mother are you awake something smashed against the other side of the door it sounded expensive of course im awake how can i sleep in this blinding glare artemis ventured inside an antique fourposter bed threw shadowy spires in the darkness and a pale sliver of light poked through a gap in the velvet curtains angeline fowl sat hunched on the bed her pale limbs glowing white in the gloom artemis darling where have you been artemis sighed she recognized him that was a good sign school trip mother skiing in austria ah skiing crooned angeline how i miss it maybe when your father returns artemis felt a lump in his throat most uncharacteristic yes perhaps when father returns darling could you close those wretched curtains the light is intolerable of course mother artemis felt his way across the room wary of the lowlevel clothes chests scattered about the floor finally his fingers curled around the velvet drapes for a moment he was tempted to throw them wide open then he sighed and closed the gap thank you darling by the way we really have to get rid of that maid she is good for absolutely nothing artemis held his tongue juliet had been a hardworking and loyal member of the fowl household for the past three years time to use mothers absentmindedness to his advantage youre right of course mother ive been meaning to do it for some time butler has a sister i believe would be perfect for the position i think ive mentioned her juliet angeline frowned juliet yes the name does seem familiar well anyone would be better than that silly girl we have now when can she start straight away ill have butler fetch her from the lodge youre a good boy artemis now give mummy a hug artemis stepped into the shadowy folds of his mothers robe she smelled perfumed like petals in water but her arms were cold and weak oh darling she whispered and the sound sent goosebumps popping down artemiss neck i hear things at night they crawl along the pillows and into my ears artemis felt that lump in his throat again perhaps we should open the curtains mother no his mother sobbed releasing him from her grasp no because then i could see them too mother please but it was no use angeline was gone she crawled to the far corner of the bed pulling the quilt under her chin send the new girl yes mother send her with cucumber slices and water yes mother angeline glared at him with crafty eyes and stop calling me mother i dont know who you are but youre certainly not my little arty artemis blinked back a few rebellious tears of course sorry moth sorry hmm dont come back here again or ill have my husband take care of you hes a very important man you know very well mrs fowl this is the last youll see of me it had better be angeline froze suddenly do you hear them artemis shook his head no i dont hear any theyre coming for me theyre everywhere angeline dived for cover beneath the bedclothes artemis could still hear her terrified sobs as he descended the marble staircase the book was proving far more stubborn than artemis had anticipated it seemed to be almost actively resisting him no matter which program he ran it through the computer came up blank artemis hardcopied every page tacking them to the walls of his study sometimes it helped to have things on paper the script was like nothing hed seen before and yet it was strangely familiar obviously a mixture of symbolic and characterbased language the text meandered around the page in no apparent order what the program needed was some frame of reference some central point on which to build he separated all the characters and ran comparisons with english chinese greek arabic and cyrillic texts even with ogham nothing moody with frustration artemis sent juliet scurrying when she interrupted with sandwiches and moved on to symbols the most frequently recurring pictogram was a small male figure male he presumed though with the limited knowledge of the fairy anatomy he supposed it could be female a thought struck him artemis opened the ancient languages file on his power translator and selected egyptian at last a hit the male symbol was remarkably similar to the anubis god representation on tutankhamens innerchamber hieroglyphics this was consistent with his other findings the first written human stories were about fairies suggesting that their civilization predated mans own it would seem that the egyptians had simply adapted an existing scripture to suit their needs there were other resemblances but the characters were just dissimilar enough to slip through the computers net this would have to be done manually each gnommish figure had to be enlarged printed and then compared with the hieroglyphs artemis felt the excitement of success thumping inside his ribcage almost every fairy pictogram or letter had an egyptian counterpart most were universal such as the sun or birds but some seemed exclusively supernatural and had to be tailored to fit the anubis figure for example would make no sense as a dog god so artemis altered it to read king of the fairies by midnight artemis had successfully fed his findings into the macintosh all he had to do now was press decode he did so what emerged was a long intricate string of meaningless gibberish a normal child would have abandoned the task long since the average adult would probably have been reduced to slapping the keyboard but not artemis this book was testing him and he would not allow it to win the letters were right he was certain of it it was just the order that was wrong rubbing the sleep from his eyes artemis glared at the pages again each segment was bordered by a solid line this could represent paragraphs or chapters but they were not meant to be read in the usual left to right top to bottom fashion artemis experimented he tried the arabic right to left and the chinese columns nothing worked then he noticed that each page had one thing in common a central section the other pictograms were arranged around this pivotal area so a central starting point perhaps but where to go from there artemis scanned the pages for some other common factor after several minutes he found it there was on each page a tiny spearhead in the corner of one section could this be an arrow a direction go this way so the theory would be start in the middle then follow the arrow reading in spirals the computer program wasnt built to handle something like this so artemis had to improvise with a craft knife and ruler he dissected the first page of the book and reassembled it in the traditional western languages order left to right parallel rows then he rescanned the page and fed it through the modified egyptian translator the computer hummed and whirred converting all the information to binary several times it stopped to ask for confirmation of a character or symbol this happened less and less as the machine learned the new language eventually two words flashed on the screen file converted fingers shaking from exhaustion and excitement artemis clicked print a single page scrolled from the laserwriter it was in english now yes there were mistakes some finetuning needed but it was perfectly legible and more importantly perfectly understandable fully aware that he was probably the first human in several thousand years to decode the magical words artemis switched on his desk light and began to read the booke of the people being instructions to our magicks and life rules carry me always carry me well i am thy teacher of herb and spell i am thy link to power arcane forget me and thy magick shall wane ten times ten commandments there be they will answer every mystery cures curses alchemy these secrets shall be thine through me but fairy remember this above all i am not for those in mud that crawl and forever doomed shall be the one who betrays my secrets one by one artemis could hear the blood pumping in his ears he had them they would be as ants beneath his feet their every secret would be laid bare by technology suddenly the exhaustion claimed him and he sank back in his chair there was so much yet to complete fortythree pages to be translated for a start he pressed the intercom button that linked him to speakers all over the house butler get juliet and come up here there are some jigsaws i need you to assemble perhaps a little family history would be useful at this point the fowls were indeed legendary criminals for generations they had skirmished on the wrong side of the law hoarding enough funds to become legitimate of course once they were legitimate they found it not to their liking and returned almost immediately to crime it was artemis the first our subjects father who had thrown the family fortune into jeopardy with the breakup of communist russia artemis senior had decided to invest a huge chunk of the fowl fortune in establishing new shipping lines to the vast continent new consumers he reasoned would need new consumer goods the russian mafia did not take too kindly to a westerner muscling in on their market and so decided to send a little message this message took the form of a stolen stinger missile launched at the fowl star on her way past murmansk artemis senior was on board the ship along with butlers uncle and cans of cola it was quite an explosion the fowls were not left destitute far from it but billionaire status was no longer theirs artemis the second vowed to remedy this he would restore the family fortune and he would do it in his own unique fashion once the book was translated artemis could begin planning in earnest he already knew what the ultimate goal was now he could figure out how to achieve it gold of course was the objective the acquisition of gold it seemed that the people were almost as fond of the precious metal as humans each fairy had its own cache but not for much longer if artemis had his way there would be at least one of the fairy folk wandering around with empty pockets by the time hed finished after eighteen solid hours of sleep and a light continental breakfast artemis climbed to the study that he had inherited from his father it was a traditional enough room dark oak and floortoceiling shelving but artemis had jammed it with the latest computer technology a series of networked apple macs whirred from various corners of the room one was running cnns web site through a dat projector throwing oversized currentaffairs images against the back wall butler was there already firing up the hard drives shut them all down except the book i need quiet for this the manservant started the cnn site had been running for almost a year artemis was convinced that news of his fathers rescue would come from there shutting it down meant that he was finally letting go all of them artemis glanced at the back wall for a moment yes he said finally all of them butler took the liberty of patting his employer gently on the shoulder just once before returning to work artemis cracked his knuckles time to do what he did best plot dastardly acts chapter holly holly short was lying in bed having a silent fume nothing unusual about this leprechauns in general were not known for their geniality but holly was in an exceptionally bad mood even for a fairy technically she was an elf fairy being a general term she was a leprechaun too but that was just a job perhaps a description would be more helpful than a lecture on fairy genealogy holly short had nutbrown skin cropped auburn hair and hazel eyes her nose had a hook and her mouth was plump and cherubic which was appropriate considering that cupid was her greatgrandfather her mother was a european elf with a fiery temper and a willowy figure holly too had a slim frame with long tapered fingers perfect for wrapping around a buzz baton her ears of course were pointed at exactly one metre in height holly was only a centimetre below the fairy average but even one centimetre can make an awful lot of difference when you dont have many to spare commander root was the cause of hollys distress root had been on hollys case since day one the commander had decided to take offence at the fact that the first female officer in recons history had been assigned to his squad recon was a notoriously dangerous posting with a high fatality rate and root didnt think it was any place for a girlie well he was just going to have to get used to the idea because holly short had no intention of quitting for him or anybody else though shed never admit it another possible cause for hollys irritability was the ritual shed been meaning to perform it for several moons now but somehow there just never seemed to be time and if root found out she was running low on magic shed be transferred to traffic for sure holly rolled off her futon and stumbled into the shower that was one advantage of living near the earths core the water was always hot no natural light of course but that was a small price to pay for privacy underground the last humanfree zone there was nothing like coming home after a long day on the job switching off your shield and sinking into a bubbling slime pool bliss the fairy suited up zipping the dullgreen jumpsuit up to her chin and strapping on her helmet leprecon uniforms were smart these days not like that topothemorning costume the force had had to wear back in the old days buckled shoes and knickerbockers honestly no wonder leprechauns were such ridiculous figures in human folklore still probably better that way if the mud people knew that the word leprechaun actually originated from leprecon an elite branch of the lower elements police theyd probably take steps to stamp them out better to stay inconspicuous and let the humans have their stereotypes with the moon already rising on the surface there was no time for a proper breakfast holly grabbed the remains of a nettle smoothie from the cooler and drank it in the tunnels as usual there was chaos in the main thoroughfare airborne sprites jammed the avenue like stones in a bottle the gnomes werent helping either lumbering along with their big swinging behinds blocking two lanes swear toads infested every damp patch cursing like sailors that particular breed began as a joke but had multiplied into an epidemic someone lost their wand over that one holly battled through the crowds to the police station there was already a riot outside spuds spud emporium lep corporal newt was trying to sort it out good luck to him nightmare at least holly got the chance to work above ground the lep station doors were crammed with protesters the goblindwarf turf war had flared up again and every morning hordes of angry parents showed up demanding the release of their innocent offspring holly snorted if there actually was an innocent goblin holly short had yet to meet him they were clogging up the cells now howling gang chants and hurling fireballs at each other holly shouldered her way into the throng coming through she grunted police business they were on her like flies on a stinkworm my grumpo is innocent police brutality officer could you take my baby in his blanky he cant sleep without it holly set her visor to reflect and ignored them all once upon a time the uniform would have earned you some respect not any more now you were a target excuse me officer but i seem to have misplaced my jar of warts pardon me young elf but my cats climbed a stalactite or if you have a minute captain could you tell me how to get to the fountain of youth holly shuddered tourists she had troubles of her own more than she knew as she was about to find out in the station lobby a kleptomaniac dwarf was busy picking the pockets of everyone else in the booking line including the officer he was handcuffed to holly gave him a swipe in the backside with her buzz baton the electric charge singed the seat of his leather trousers whatcha doing there mulch mulch started contraband dropping from his sleeves officer short he whined his face a mask of regret i cant help myself its my nature i know that mulch and its our nature to throw you in a cell for a couple of centuries she winked at the dwarfs arresting officer nice to see youre staying alert the elf blushed kneeling to pick up his wallet and badge holly forged past roots office hoping she would make it to her cubicle before short get in here holly sighed ah well here we go again stowing her helmet under her arm holly smoothed the creases from her uniform and stepped into commander roots office roots face was purple with rage this was more or less his general state of existence a fact that had earned him the nickname beetroot there was an office pool running on how long he had before his heart exploded the smart money was on half a century at the outside commander root was tapping the moonometer on his wrist well he demanded what time do you call this holly could feel her own face colouring she was barely a minute late there were at least a dozen officers on this shift who hadnt even reported in yet but root always singled her out for persecution the thoroughfare she mumbled lamely there were four lanes down dont insult me with your excuses roared the commander you know what the city centre is like get up a few minutes earlier it was true she did know what haven was like holly short was a city elf born and bred since the humans began experimenting with mineral drilling more and more fairies had been driven out of the shallow forts and into the depth and security of haven city the metropolis was overcrowded and underserviced and now there was a lobby to allow automobiles in the pedestrianized city centre as if the place wasnt smelly enough already with all those country gnomes lumbering around the place root was right she should get up a bit earlier but she wouldnt not until everybody else was forced to i know what youre thinking said root why am i picking on you every day why dont i ever bawl out those other layabouts holly said nothing but agreement was written all over her face ill tell you why shall i holly risked a nod its because youre a girl holly felt her fingers curl into fists she knew it but not for the reasons you think continued root you are the first girl in recon ever you are a test case a beacon there are a million fairies out there watching your every move there are a lot of hopes riding on you but there is a lot of prejudice against you too the future of law enforcement is in your hands and at the moment id say it was a little heavy holly blinked root had never said anything like this before usually it was just fix your helmet stand up straight blah blah blah you have to be the best you can be short and that has to be better than anybody else root sighed sinking into his swivel chair i dont know holly ever since that hamburg affair holly winced the hamburg affair had been a total disaster one of her perps had skipped out to the surface and tried to bargain with the mud people for asylum root had to stop time call in the retrieval squad and do four memory wipes a lot of police time wasted all her fault the commander took a form from his desk its no use ive made up my mind im putting you on traffic and bringing in corporal frond frond exploded holly shes a bimbo an airhead you cant make her the test case roots face turned an even deeper shade of purple i can and i will why shouldnt i you have never given me your besteither that or your best just isnt good enough sorry short you had your chance the commander turned back to his paperwork the meeting was over holly could only stand there aghast shed blown it the best career opportunity she was ever likely to get and shed tossed it in the gutter one mistake and her future was past it wasnt fair holly felt an uncharacteristic anger take hold of her but she swallowed it this was no time to lose her temper commander root sir i feel i deserve one more chance root didnt even look up from the paperwork and whys that holly took a deep breath because of my record sir it speaks for itself apart from the hamburg thing ten successful recons not a single memory wipe or timestop apart from the hamburg thing completed root holly took a chance if i were a male one of your precious sprites we wouldnt even be having this conversation root glanced up sharply now just a minute captain short he was interrupted by the bleeping of one of the phones on his desk then two then three a giant viewscreen crackled into life on the wall behind him root jabbed the speaker button putting all the callers on conference yes weve got a runner root nodded anything on scopes scopes was the shop name for the shrouded trackers attached to american communications satellites yep said caller two big blip in europe southern italy no shield root cursed an unshielded fairy could be seen by mortal eyes that wasnt so bad if the perp was humanoid classification bad news commander said the third caller we got us a rogue troll root rubbed his eyes why did these things always happen on his watch holly could understand his frustration trolls were the meanest of the deeptunnel creatures they wandered the labyrinth preying on anything unlucky enough to cross their path their tiny brains had no room for rules or restraint occasionally one found its way into the shaft of a pressure elevator usually the concentrated air current fried them but sometimes one survived and was blasted to the surface driven crazy by pain and even the tiniest amount of light they would generally proceed to destroy everything in their path root shook his head rapidly recovering himself ok captain short looks like you get your chance youre running hot i take it yes sir lied holly all too aware that root would suspend her immediately if he knew shed neglected the ritual good then sign yourself out a sidearm and proceed to the target area holly glanced at the viewscreen scopes were sending highres shots of an italian fortified town a red dot was moving rapidly through the countryside towards the human population do a thorough reconnaissance and report in do not attempt a retrieval is that understood yessir we lost six men to troll attacks last quarter six men that was below ground in familiar territory i understand sir root pursed his lips doubtfully do you understand short do you really i think so sir have you ever seen what a troll can do to flesh and bone no sir not up close good lets not make today your first time understood root glared at her i dont know why it is captain short but whenever you start agreeing with me i get decidedly nervous root was right to be nervous if hed known how this straightforward recon assignment was going to turn out he would probably have retired there and then tonight history was going to be made and it wasnt the discoveryofradium firstmanonthemoon happy kind of history it was the spanishinquisition herecomesthehindenburg bad kind of history bad for humans and fairies bad for everyone holly proceeded directly to the chutes her normally chatty mouth was a grim slash of determination one chance that was it she would allow nothing to break her concentration there was the usual queue of holiday visa hopefuls stretching to the corner of elevator plaza but holly bypassed it by waving her badge at the waiting line a truculent gnome refused to yield how come you lep guys get to go topside whats so special about you holly breathed deeply through her nose courtesy at all times police business sir now if you could just excuse me the gnome scratched his massive behind i hear you lep guys make up your police business just to get a look at some moonlight thats what i hear holly attempted an amused smile what actually formed on her lips resembled a lemonsucking grimace whoever told you that is an idiotsir recon venture only above ground when absolutely necessary the gnome frowned obviously he had made up the rumour himself and suspected that holly might have just called him an idiot by the time hed figured it out she had skipped through the double doors foaly was waiting for her in ops foaly was a paranoid centaur convinced that human intelligence agencies were monitoring his transport and surveillance network to prevent them reading his mind he wore a tinfoil hat at all times he glanced up sharply when holly entered through the pneumatic double doors anybody see you come in here holly thought about it the fbi cia nsa dea mi oh and the eib foaly frowned the eib everyone in the building smirked holly foaly rose from his swivel chair and clipclopped over to her oh youre very funny short a regular riot i thought the hamburg affair might have knocked some of the cockiness out of you if i were you id concentrate on the job in hand holly composed herself he was right ok foaly fill me in the centaur pointed to a live feed from the eurosat which was displayed on a large plasma screen this red dot is the troll hes moving towards martina franca a fortified town near the city of brindisi as far as we can tell he stumbled into vent e it was on cooldown after a surface shot thats why the troll isnt crispy barbecue right now holly grimaced charming she thought weve been lucky in that our target has bumped into some food along the way he chewed on a couple of cows for an hour or two so that bought us a bit of time a couple of cows exclaimed holly just how big is this fellow foaly adjusted his foil bonnet bull troll fully grown one hundred and eighty kilos with tusks like a wild boar a really wild boar holly swallowed suddenly recon seemed a much better job than retrieval right what have you got for me foaly cantered across to the equipment table he selected what looked like a rectangular wristwatch locator you find him we find you routine stuff video the centaur clipped a small cylinder into the accommodating groove on hollys helmet live feed nuclear battery no time limit the mike is voiceactivated good said holly root said i should take a weapon on this one just in case way ahead of you said foaly he picked a platinum handgun from the pile a neutrino the latest model even the tunnel gangs dont have these three settings if you dont mind scorched well done and crisped to a cinder nuclear power source too so plug away this baby will outlive you by a thousand years holly strapped the lightweight weapon into her shoulder holster im readyi think foaly chuckled i doubt it no ones ever really ready for a troll thanks for the confidence booster confidence is ignorance advised the centaur if youre feeling cocky its because theres something you dont know holly thought about arguing but didnt maybe it was because she had a sneaking suspicion that foaly was right the pressure elevators were powered by gaseous columns vented from the earths core the lep tech boys under foalys guidance had fashioned titanium eggs that could ride on the currents they had their own independent motors but for an express ride to the surface there was nothing like the blast from a tidal flare foaly led her past a long line of chute bays to e the pod sat in its clamp looking very fragile to be rocketing about on magma streams its underside was charred black and pockmarked from shrapnel the centaur slapped it fondly on a fender this babys been in service for fifty years oldest model still in the chutes holly swallowedthe chutes made her nervous enough without riding in an antique when does it come offline foaly scratched his hairy belly with funding the way it is not until we have us a fatality holly cranked open the heavy door the rubber seal yielding with a hiss the pod was not built for comfort there was barely enough space for a restraining seat among the jumble of electronics whats that asked holly pointing at a greyish stain on the seats headrest foaly shuffled uncomfortably ermbrain fluid i think we had a pressure leak on the last mission but thats plugged now and the officer lived down a few iq points but alive and he can still take liquids well thats all right then quipped holly threading her way through the mass of wires foaly strapped the harness on to her checking the restraints thoroughly all set holly nodded foaly tapped her helmet mike keep in touch he said pulling the door behind him dont think about it holly told herself dont think about the whitehot magma flow thats going to engulf this tiny craft dont think about hurtling towards the surface with a mach force trying to turn you insideout and certainly dont think about the bloodcrazed troll ready to disembowel you with his tusks nope dont think about any of that stufftoo late minus twenty he said were on a secure channel in case the mud people have s foalys voice sounded in her earpiece t tarted underground monitoring you never know an oil tanker from the middle east intercepted a transmission one time what a mess that was holly adjusted her helmet mike focus foaly my life is in your hands here uhok sorry were going to use the rail to drop you into es main shaft theres a surge due any minute that should see you past the first hundred klicks then youre on your own holly nodded curling her fingers around the twin joysticks all systems check fire it up there was a whoosh as the pods engines ignited the tiny craft jostled in its housing shaking holly like a bead in a rattle she could barely hear foaly speaking into her ear youre in the secondary shaft now get ready to fly short holly pulled a rubber cylinder from the dash and slipped it between her teeth no good having a radio if youve swallowed your tongue she activated the external cameras and put the view on screen the entrance to e was creeping towards her the air was shimmering in the landinglight glow whitehot sparks tumbled into the secondary shaft holly couldnt hear the roar but she could imagine it a raw skinning wind like a million trolls howling her fingers tightened around the joysticks the pod shuddered to a halt at the lip the chute stretched above and below massive boundless like dropping an ant down a drainpipe righto crackled foaly hold on to your breakfast rollercoasters aint got nothing on this holly nodded she couldnt speak not with the rubber in her mouth the centaur would be able to see her in the podcam anyway sayonara sweetheart said foaly and pressed the button the pods clamp tilted rolling holly into the abyss her stomach tightened as gforce took hold dragging her to the centre of the earth the seismology section had a million probes down here with a success rate at predicting the magma flares but there was always that point two per cent the fall seemed to last for an eternity and just when holly had mentally consigned herself to the scrap heap she felt it that unforgettable vibration the feeling that outside her tiny sphere the whole world was being shaken apart here it comes fins she said spitting the word around the cylinder foaly may have replied she couldnt hear him any more holly couldnt even hear herself but she did see the stabilization fins slide out on the monitor the flare caught her like a hurricane spinning the pod at first until the fins caught halfmelted rocks pelted the crafts underside jolting it towards the chute walls holly compensated with bursts from the joysticks the heat was tremendous in the confined space enough to fry a human but fairy lungs are made of stronger stuff the acceleration dragged at her body with invisible hands stretching the flesh over her arms and face holly blinked salty sweat from her eyes and concentrated on the monitor the flare had totally engulfed her pod and it was a big one too force seven at the very least a good metre girth orangestriped magma swirled and hissed around her searching for a weak point in the metal casing the pod groaned and complained fiftyyearold rivets threatening to pop holly shook her head the first thing she was going to do on her return was kick foaly straight in the hairy behind she felt like a nut inside a shell between a gnomes molars doomed a bow plate buckled popped in as though punched by a giant fist the pressure light blinked on holly could feel her head being squeezed the eyes would be first to go popping like ripe berries she checked the dials twenty more seconds before she rode out the flare and was running on thermals those twenty seconds seemed like an age holly sealed the helmet to protect her eyes riding out the final barrage of rocks and suddenly they were clear sailing upwards on the comparatively gentle spirals of hot air holly added her own thrusters to the upward force no time to waste floating around on the wind above her a circle of neon lights marked the docking zone holly swivelled horizontal and pointed the docking nodes at the lights this was delicate many recon pilots had made it this far only to miss the port and lose valuable time not holly she was a natural first in the academy she gave the thrusters one final squeeze and coasted the last hundred metres using the rudders beneath her feet she teased the pod through the circle of light and into its clamp on the landing pad the nodes revolved settling into their grooves safe holly smacked herself on the chest releasing the safety harness once the door seal was open sweet surface air flooded the cabin there was nothing like that first breath after a ride in the chutes she breathed deeply purging the stale pod air from her lungs how had the people ever left the surface sometimes she wished that her ancestors had stayed to fight it out with the mud people but there were too many of them unlike fairies who could produce only a single child every twenty years mud people bred like rodents numbers would subdue even magic although she was enjoying the night air holly could taste traces of pollutants the mud people destroyed everything they came into contact with of course they didnt live in the mud any more not in this country at least oh no big fancy dwellings with rooms for everything rooms for sleeping rooms for eating even a room to go to the toilet indoors holly shuddered imagine going to the toilet inside your own house disgusting the only good thing about going to the toilet was the minerals being returned to the earth but the mud people had even managed to botch that up by treating thestuffwith bottles of blue chemicals if anyone had told her a hundred years ago that humans would be taking the fertile out of fertilizer she would have told them to get some air holes drilled in their skull holly unhooked a set of wings from their bracket they were double ovals with a clunky motor she moaned dragonflies she hated that model petrol engine if you dont mind and heavier than a pig dipped in mud now the hummingbird z that was transport whisper silent with a satellitebounced solar battery that would fly you twice around the world but there were budget cuts again on her wrist the locator began to beep she was in range holly stepped out of the pod and on to the landing bay she was inside a camouflaged mound of earth commonly known as a fairy fort indeed the people used to live in these until they were driven deeper underground there wasnt much technology just a few external monitors and a selfdestruct device should the bay be discovered there was nothing on the screens all clear the pneumatic doors were slightly askew where the troll had barged through but otherwise everything seemed operational holly strapped on the wings stepping into the outside world the italian night sky was crisp and brisk infused with olives and vine crickets clicked in the rough grass and moths fluttered in the starlight holly couldnt stop herself smiling it was worth the risk every bit of it speaking of riskshe checked the locator the bip was much stronger now the troll was almost at the town walls she could appreciate nature after the mission was over now it was time for action holly primed the wings motor pulling the starter cord over her shoulder nothing she fumed silently every spoilt kid in haven had a hummingbird for their wilderness holidays and here were the lep with wings that were junk when they were new she yanked the cord again and then again on the third wrench it caught spewing a stream of smoke and fumes into the night about time she grunted flicking the throttle wide open the wings flapped their way up to a steady beat and with not a little effort lifted captain holly short into the night sky even without the locator the troll would have been easy to follow it had left a trail of destruction wider than a tunnel excavator holly flew low skipping between mist hazes and trees matching the trolls course the crazed creature had cut a swathe through the middle of a vineyard turned a stone wall to rubble and left a guard dog gibbering under a hedge then she flew over the cows it was not a pretty sight without going into details lets just say that there wasnt much left besides horns and hooves the red bip was louder now louder meant closer she could see the town below her nestled on top of a low hill surrounded by a crenellated wall from the middle ages lights still burned in most windows time for a little magic a lot of the magic attributed to the people is just superstition but they do have certain powers healing the mesmer and shielding being among them shielding is really a misnomer what fairies actually do is to vibrate at such a high frequency that they are never in one place long enough to be seen humans may notice a slight shimmer in the air if they are paying close attention which they rarely are and even then the shimmer is generally attributed to evaporation typical of mud people to invent a complicated explanation for a simple phenomenon holly switched on her shield it took a bit more out of her than usual she could feel the strain in the beads of sweat on her forehead i really should complete the ritual she thought the sooner the better some commotion below broke into her thoughts something that didnt gel with the nighttime noises holly adjusted the trim on her backpack and flew in for a closer look look only she reminded herself that was her job a recon officer was sent up the chutes to pinpoint the target while the retrieval boys took a nice cushy shuttle the troll was directly below her pounding against the towns outer wall which was coming away in chunks beneath his powerful fingers holly sucked in a startled gasp this guy was a monster big as an elephant and ten times as mean but this particular beast was worse than mean he was scared control said holly into her mike runner located situation critical topside root himself was on the other end of the comlink clarify captain holly pointed her video link at the troll runner is going through the town wall contact imminent how far away are retrieval eta five minutes minimum were still in the shuttle holly bit her lip root was in the shuttle thats too long commander this whole town is going to explode in ten secondsim going in negative hollycaptain short you dont have an invite you know the law hold your position but commander root cut her off no no buts captain hang back thats an order hollys entire body felt like a heartbeat petrol fumes were addling her brain what could she do what was the right decision to make lives or orders then the troll broke through the wall and a childs voice split the night aiuto it screamed help an invitation at a stretch sorry commander the troll is lightcrazy and there are children in there she could imagine roots face purple with rage as he spat into the mike ill have your stripes short youll spend the next hundred years on drain duty but it was no use holly had disconnected her mike and swooped in after the troll streamlining her body captain short ducked into the hole she appeared to be in a restaurant a packed restaurant the troll had been temporarily blinded by the electric light and was thrashing about in the centre of the floor the patrons were stunned even the childs plea had petered out they sat gaping party hats perched comically on their heads waiters froze huge trays of pasta quivering on their splayed fingers chubby italian infants covered their eyes with chubby fingers it was always like this in the beginning the shocked silence then came the screaming a wine bottle crashed to the floor it broke the spell the pandemonium started holly winced trolls hated noise almost as much as light the troll lifted massive shaggy shoulders its retractable claws sliding out with an ominous schiiick classic predator behaviour the beast was about to strike holly drew her weapon and flicked it up to the second setting she couldnt kill the troll under any circumstances not to save humans but she could certainly put him out until retrieval arrived aiming for the weak point at the base of the skull she let the troll have a long burst of the concentrated ion ray the beast staggered stumbled a few steps then got very angry its ok thought holly im shielded invisible to any onlookers it would seem as though the pulsing blue beam emanated from thin air the troll rounded on her its muddy dreadlocks swinging like candles no panic it cant see me the troll picked up a table invisible totally invisible he pulled back a shaggy arm and let fly just a slight shimmer in the air the table tumbled straight towards her head holly moved a second too late the table clipped her backpack knocking the petrol tank clean off it span through the air trailing flammable fluid italian restaurants wouldnt you know it full of candles the tank twirled right through an elaborate candelabrum it burst into flames like some deadly firework most of the petrol landed on the troll so did holly the troll could see her there was no doubt about it it squinted at her through the hated light its brow a rictus of pain and fear her shield was off her magic had gone holly twisted in the trolls grip but it was useless the creatures fingers were the size of bananas but nowhere near as pliant they were squashing the breath from her ribcage with savage ease needlelike claws were scraping at the toughened material of her uniform any second now they would punch through and that would be that holly couldnt think the restaurant was a carousel of chaos the troll was gnashing its tusks greasy molars trying to grip her helmet holly could smell its fetid breath through her filters she could smell the odour of burning fur too as the fire spread along the trolls back the beasts green tongue rasped across her visor sliming the lower section the visor that was it her only chance holly wormed her free hand to the helmet controls the tunnel lights high beams she depressed the sunken button and watts of unfiltered light blasted from the twin spotlights above her eyes the troll reared back a penetrating scream exploding from between rows of teeth dozens of glasses and bottles shattered where they stood it was too much for the poor beast stunned set on fire and now blinded the shock and pain made their way through to its tiny brain ordering it to shut down the troll complied keeling over with almost comical stiffness holly rolled to avoid a scything tusk there was complete silence but for tinkling glass crackling fur and the sudden release of breath holly climbed shakily to her feet there were a lot of eyes following her human eyes she was per cent visible and these humans wouldnt stay complacent for long this breed never did containment was the issue she raised her empty palms a gesture of peace scusatemi tutti she said the language flowing easily from her tongue the italians ever graceful muttered that it was nothing holly reached slowly into her pocket and withdrew a small sphere she placed it in the middle of the floor guardate she said look the restaurants patrons complied leaning in to see the small silver ball it was ticking faster and faster almost like a countdown holly turned her back to the sphere three two one boom flash mass unconsciousness nothing fatal but headaches all around in about forty minutes holly sighed safe for the moment she ran to the door and slid the latch across nobody was going in or out except through the big gaping hole in the wall next she doused the smouldering troll with the contents of the restaurants fire extinguisher hoping the icy powder wouldnt revive the sleeping behemoth holly surveyed the mess she had created there was no doubt it was a shambles worse than hamburg root would skin her alive shed rather face the troll any day this was the end of her career for sure but suddenly that didnt seem so important because her ribs were aching and she had a blinder of a pressure headache coming on perhaps a rest just for a second so she could pull herself together before retrieval showed up holly didnt even bother looking for a chair she simply allowed her legs to buckle beneath her sinking to the chessboard lino floor waking up to commander roots bulging features is the stuff of nightmares hollys eyes flickered open and for a second she could have sworn that there was concern in those eyes but then it was gone replaced by the customary veinpopping fury captain short he roared mindless of her headache what in the name of sanity happened here holly rose shakily to her feet ithat isthere was the sentences just wouldnt come you disobeyed a direct order i told you to hang back you know its forbidden to enter a human building without an invitation hollv shook the shadows from her vision i got invited in a child called for help youre on shaky ground there short there is precedent sir corporal rowe versus the state the jury ruled that the trapped womans cry for help could be accepted as an invitation into the building anyway youre all here now that means you accepted the invitation too hmm said root doubtfully i suppose you were lucky things could have been worse holly looked around things couldnt have been a lot worse the establishment was pretty trashed and there were forty humans out for the count the tech boys were attaching mindwipe electrodes to the temples of unconscious diners we managed to secure the area in spite of half the town hammering on the door what about the hole root smirked see for yourself holly glanced over retrieval had jimmied a hologram lead into the existing electricity sockets and were projecting an unbattered wall over the hole the holograms were handy for quick patches but no good under scrutiny anyone who examined the wall too closely would have noticed that the slightly transparent patch was exactly the same as the stretch beside it in this case there were two identical patches of spiderweb cracks and two reproductions of the same rembrandt but the people inside the pizzeria were in no condition to examine walls and by the time they woke up the wall would have been repaired by the telekinetic division and the entire paranormal experience would be removed from their memories a retrieval officer bolted from the restroom commander yes sergeant theres a human in here sir the concusser didnt reach him hes coming sir right now sir shields barked root everyone holly tried she really did but it wouldnt come her magic was gone a toddler waddled out of the bathroom his eyes heavy with sleep he pointed a pudgy finger directly at holly ciao folletta he said before climbing into his fathers lap to continue his snooze root shimmered back into the visible spectrum he was if possible even angrier than before what happened to your shield short holly swallowed stress commander she offered hopefully root wasnt having any of it you lied to me captain youre not running hot at all are you holly shook her head mutely how long since you completed the ritual holly chewed her lip id say about four years sir root nearly popped a vein fourfour years its a wonder you lasted this long do it nowtonight youre not coming below ground again without your powers youre a danger to yourself and your fellow officers yessir get a set of hummingbirds from retrieval and zip across to the old country theres a full moon tonight yessir and dont think ive forgotten about this shambles well talk about it when you get back yessir very good sir holly turned to go but root cleared his throat for attention oh and captain short yessir roots face had lost its purple tinge and he almost seemed embarrassed well done on the lifesaving thing could have been worse an awful lot worse holly beamed behind her visor perhaps she wouldnt be kicked out of recon after all thank you sir root grunted his complexion returning to its normal ruddy hue now get out of here and dont come back until youre full to the tips of your ears with magic holly sighed so much for gratitude yes sir on my way sir chapter abduction artemiss main problem was one of location how to locate a leprechaun this was one sly bunch of fairies hanging around for god knows how many millennia and still not one photo not one frame of video not even a lochnesstype hoax they werent exactly a sociable group and they were smart too no one had ever got his hands on fairy gold but no one had ever had access to the book either and puzzles were so simple when you had the key artemis had summoned the butlers to his study and spoke to them now from behind a minilectern there are certain rituals every fairy must complete to renew his magic explained artemis butler and juliet nodded as though this were a normal briefing artemis flicked through his hard copy of the book and selected a passage from the earth thine power flows given through courtesy so thanks are owed pluck thou the magick seed where full moon ancient oak and twisted water meet and bury it far from where it was found so return your gift into the ground artemis closed the text do you see butler and juliet kept nodding while still looking thoroughly mystified artemis sighed the leprechaun is bound by certain rituals very specific rituals i might add we can use them to track one down juliet raised a hand even though she herself was four years artemiss senior yes well the thing is artemis she said hesitantly twisting a strand of blonde hair in a way that several of the local louts considered extremely attractive the bit about leprechauns artemis frowned it was a bad sign your point juliet well leprechauns you know theyre not real dont you butler winced it was his fault really hed never got around to filling in his sister on the mission parameters artemis scowled reprovingly at him butler hasnt already talked to you about this no was he supposed to yes he certainly was perhaps he thought youd laugh at him butler squirmed that was exactly what hed thought juliet was the only person alive who laughed at him with embarrassing regularity most other people did it once just once artemis cleared his throat let us proceed under the assumption that the fairy folk do exist and that i am not a gibbering moron butler nodded weakly juliet was unconvinced very well now as i was saying the people have to fulfil a specific ritual to renew their powers according to my interpretation they must pick a seed from an ancient oak tree by the bend in a river and they must do this during the full moon the light began to dawn in butlers eyes so all we have to do is run a crossreference through the weather satellites which i already have believe it or not there arent that many ancient oaks left if you take ancient to be a hundred years plus when you factor in the river bend and full moon there are precisely one hundred and twentynine sites to be surveyed in this country butler grinned stakeout now the master was talking his language there are preparations to be made for our guests arrival said artemis handing a typewritten sheet of a to juliet these alterations must be made to the cellar see to it juliet to the letter yes arty artemis frowned but only slightly for reasons that he couldnt quite fathom he didnt mind terribly when juliet called him by the pet name his mother had for him butler scratched his chin thoughtfully artemis noticed the gesture query well artemis the sprite in ho chi minh city artemis nodded i know why didnt we simply abduct her yes sir according to chi luns almanac of the people a seventhcentury manuscript recovered from the lost city of shshamo once a fairy has taken spirits with the mud people thats us by the way they are forever dead to their brothers and sisters so there was no guarantee that that particular fairy was worth even an ounce of gold no my old friend we need fresh blood all clear butler nodded good now there are several items you will need to procure for our moonlight jaunts butler scanned the sheet basic field equipment a few eyebrow raisers nothing too puzzling until sunglasses at night when artemis smiled as he did now one almost expected vampire fangs to sprout from his gums yes butler sunglasses trust me and butler did implicitly holly activated the thermal coil in her suit and climbed to metres the hummingbird wings were top of the range the battery readout showed four red bars more than enough for a quick jaunt through mainland europe and across the british isles of course the regulations said always travel over water if possible but holly could never resist knocking the snowcap from the highest alp on her way past the suit protected holly from the worst of the elements but she could still feel the chill sinking into her bones the moon seemed huge from this altitude the craters on its surface easily distinguishable tonight it was a perfect sphere a magical full moon immigration would have their hands full as thousands of surfacesick fairies were drawn irresistibly overground a large percentage would make it probably causing mayhem in their revelry the earths mantle was riddled with illegal tunnels and it was impossible to police them all holly followed the italian coast up to monaco and from there across the alps to france she loved flying all fairies did according to the book they had once been equipped with wings of their own but evolution had stripped them of this power all but the sprites one school of thought believed that the people were descended from airborne dinosaurs possibly pterodactyls much of the upperbody skeletal structure was the same this theory would certainly explain the tiny nub of bone on each shoulder blade holly toyed with the idea of visiting disneyland paris the lep had several undercover operatives stationed there most of them working in the snow white exhibit it was one of the few places on earth that the people could pass unnoticed but if some tourist got a photo of her and it ended up on the internet root would have her badge for sure with a sigh of regret she passed over the shower of multicoloured fireworks below once over the channel holly flew low skipping over the whitecrested waves she called out to the dolphins and they rose to the surface leaping from the water to match her pace she could see the pollution in them bleaching their skin white and causing red sores on their backs and although she smiled her heart was breaking mud people had a lot to answer for finally the coast loomed ahead of her the old country eiriu the land where time began the most magical place on the planet it was here years ago that the ancient fairy race the de danann had battled against the demon fomorians carving the famous giants causeway with the strength of their magical blasts it was here that the lia fáil stood the rock at the centre of the universe where the fairy kings and later the human ard rн were crowned and it was also here unfortunately that the mud people were most in tune with magic which resulted in a far higher peoplesighting rate than you got anywhere else on the planet thankfully the rest of the world assumed that the irish were crazy a theory that the irish themselves did nothing to debunk they had somehow got it into their heads that each fairy lugged around a pot of gold with them wherever they went while it was true that lep had a ransom fund because of its officers highrisk occupation no human had ever taken a chunk of it yet this didnt stop the irish population in general from skulking around rainbows hoping to win the supernatural lottery but in spite of all that if there was one race the people felt an affinity for it was the irish perhaps it was their eccentricity perhaps their dedication to the craic as they called it and if the people were actually related to humans as another theory had it odds on it was the emerald isle where it started holly punched up a map on her wrist locator and set it to sweep for magical hotspots the best site would obviously be tara near the lia fáil but on a night like tonight every traditionalist fairy with an overground pass would be dancing around the holy scene so best to give it a miss there was a secondary site not far from here just off the southeast coast easy access from the air but remote and desolate for landbound humans holly reined in the throttle and descended to eighty metres she skipped over a bristling evergreen forest emerging in a moonlit meadow a silver thread of river bisected the field and there nestling in the fold of a meander loop was the proud oak holly checked her locator for life forms once she judged the cow two fields over not to be a threat she cut her engines and glided to the foot of the mighty tree four months of stakeout even butler the consummate professional was beginning to dread the long nights of damp and insect bites thankfully the moon was not full every night it was always the same they would crouch in their foillined hide in complete silence butler repeatedly checking his equipment while artemis stared unblinking through the eye of the scope at times like these nature seemed deafening in their confined space butler longed to whistle to make conversation anything to break the unnatural silence but artemiss concentration was absolute he would brook no interference or lapse of focus this was business tonight they were in the southeast the most inaccessible site yet butler had been forced to make three trips to the jeep in order to hump the equipment across a stile a bog and two fields his boots and trousers were ruined and now he would have to sit in the hide with ditchwater soaking into the seat of his trousers artemis had somehow contrived to remain spotless the hide was ingenious in design and interest had already been expressed in the manufacturing rights mostly by military representatives but artemis had resolved to sell the patent to a sportinggoods multinational it was constructed of an elasticated foil polymer on a multihinged fibreglass skeleton the foil similar to that used by nasa trapped the heat inside the structure while preventing the camouflaged outside surface from overheating this ensured that any animals sensitive to heat would be unaware of its presence the hinges meant that the hide would move almost like a liquid filling whatever depression it was dropped into instant shelter and vantage point you simply placed the velcroed bag in a hole and pulled the string but all the cleverness in the world couldnt improve the atmosphere something was troubling artemis it was plain in the web of premature lines that spread from the corners of his deepblue eyes after several nights of fruitless surveillance butler plucked up enough courage to ask artemis he began hesitantly i realize its not my place but i know theres something wrong and if theres anything i can do to help artemis didnt speak for several moments and for those few moments butler saw the face of a young boy the boy artemis might have been its my mother butler he said at last im beginning to wonder if shell ever then the proximity alarm flashed red holly hooked the wings over a low branch unstrapping the helmet to give her ears some air you had to be careful with elfin ears a few hours in the helmet and they started to flake she gave the tips a massage no dry skin there that was because she had a daily moisturizing regime not like some of the male lep officers when they took off their helmets youd swear it had just started to snow holly paused for a minute to admire the view ireland certainly was picturesque even the mud people hadnt been able to destroy that not yet anywaygive them another century or two the river was folding gently before her like a silver snake hissing as the water tumbled across a stony bed the oak tree crackled overhead its branches rasping together in the bracing breeze now to work she could do the tourist thing all night once her business was complete a seed she needed a seed holly bent to the ground brushing the dried leaves and twigs from the clays surface her fingers closed around a smooth acorn that wasnt hard now was it she thought all that remained for her to do was plant it somewhere else and her powers would come rushing back butler checked the portaradar muting the volume in case the equipment betrayed their position the red arm swept the screen with agonizing lethargy and thenflash an upright figure by the tree too small for an adult the wrong proportions for a child he gave artemis the thumbsup possible match artemis nodded strapping the mirrored sunglasses across his brow butler followed his lead popping the cap on his weapons starlight scope this was no ordinary dart rifle it had been specially tooled for a kenyan ivory hunter and had the range and rapidfire capacity of a kalashnikov butler had picked it up for a song from a government official after the ivory poachers execution they crept into the night with practised silence the diminutive figure before them unhooked a contraption from around its shoulders and lifted a fullface helmet from a definitely nonhuman head butler wrapped the rifle strap twice around his wrist pulling the stock into his shoulder he activated the scope and a red dot appeared in the centre of the figures back artemis nodded and his manservant squeezed the trigger in spite of a million to one odds it was at that precise moment that the figure bent low to the earth something whizzed over hollys head something that glinted in the starlight holly had enough onthejob experience to realize that she was under fire and immediately curled her elfin frame into a ball minimizing the target she drew her pistol rolling towards the shelter of the tree trunk her brain scrambled for possibilities who could be shooting at her and why something was waiting beside the tree something roughly the size of a mountain but considerably more mobile nice peashooter grinned the figure smothering hollys gun hand in a turnipsized fist holly managed to extricate her fingers a nanosecond before they snapped like brittle spaghetti i dont suppose you would consider peaceful surrender said a cold voice behind her holly turned elbows raised for combat no sighed the boy melodramatically i suppose not holly put on her best brave face stay back human you dont know what youre dealing with the boy laughed i believe fairy that you are the one unfamiliar with the facts fairy he knew she was a fairy i have magic mudworm enough to turn you and your gorilla into pig droppings the boy took a step closer brave words miss but lies nonetheless if as you say you had magic you would have no doubt used it by now no i suspect that you have gone too long without the ritual and you are here to replenish your powers holly was dumbfounded there was a human before her casually spouting sacred secrets this was disastrous catastrophic it could mean the end of generations of peace if the humans were aware of a fairy subculture it was only a matter of time before the two species went to war she must do something and there was only one weapon left in her arsenal the mesmer is the lowest form of magic and requires only a trickle of power there are even certain humans with a bent for the talent it is within the ability of even the most drained fairy to put a complete mind kibosh on any human alive holly summoned the final dribble of magic from the base of her skull human she intoned her voice suddenly resonating with bass tones your will is mine artemis smiled safe behind his mirrored lenses i doubt it he said and nodded curtly holly felt the dart puncture the suits toughened material depositing its load of curare and succinylcholine chloridebased tranquillizer into her shoulder the world instantly dissolved into a series of technicoloured bubbles and try as she might holly couldnt seem to hold on to more than one thought and that thought was how did they know it spiralled around her head as she sank into unconsciousness how did they know how did they know how did they artemis saw the pain in the creatures eyes as the hollow hypodermic plunged into her body and for a moment he experienced misgivings a female he hadnt expected that a female like juliet or mother then the moment passed and he was himself again good shooting he said bending to study their prisoner definitely a girl pretty too in a pointy sort of way sir hmm butler was pointing to the creatures helmet it was halfburied in a drift of leaves where the fairy had dropped it a buzzing noise was coming from the crown artemis picked up the contraption by the straps searching for the source ah here we are he plucked the viewcam from its slot careful to point the lens away from him fairy technology most impressive he muttered popping the battery from its groove the camera whined and died nuclear power source if im not mistaken we must be careful not to underestimate our opponents butler nodded sliding their captive into an oversized duffel bag something else to be lugged across two fields a bog and a stile chapter missing in action commander root was sucking on a particularly noxious fungus cigar several of the retrieval squad had nearly passed out in the shuttle even the pong from the manacled troll seemed mild in comparison of course no one said anything their boss being touchier than a septic bum boil foaly on the other hand delighted in antagonizing his superior none of your rancid stogies in here commander he brayed the moment root made it back to ops the computers dont like smoke root scowled certain that foaly was making this up nevertheless the commander was not prepared to risk a computer crash in the middle of an alert and so doused his cigar in the coffee cup of a passing gremlin now foaly whats this socalled alert and it better be good this time the centaur had a tendency to go completely hyper over trivialities hed once gone to defcon two because his human satellite stations were out its good all right foaly assured him or should i say bad very bad root felt the ulcer in his gut begin to bubble like a volcano how bad foaly punched up ireland on the eurosat we lost contact with captain short why am i not surprised groaned root burying his face in his hands we had her all the way over the alps the alps she took a land route foaly nodded against regulations i know but everyone does it the commander agreed grudgingly who could resist a view like that as a rookie hed been placed on report himself for that exact offence ok move on when did we lose her foaly opened a vt box on the screen this is the feed from hollys helmet unit here we are over disneyland paris the centaur pressed the fastforward now dolphins blah blah blah the irish coastline still no worries look her locator comes into shot captain short is scanning for magic hotspots site fiftyseven shows up red so she heads for that one why not tara foaly snorted tara every fairy hippie in the northern hemisphere will be dancing around the lia fáil at the full moon therell be so many shields on itll look like the whole place is under water fine grunted root through gritted teeth just get on with it will you all right dont get your ears in a knot foaly skipped several minutes of tape now heres the interesting bit nice smooth landing hangs up the wings holly takes off the helmet against regulations interjected root lep officers must never remove lep officers must never remove their headgear above ground unless said headgear is defective completed foaly yes commander we all know what the handbook says but are you trying to tell me that you never sneaked a breath of air after a few hours in the sky no admitted root what are you her fairy godmother or something get to the important bit foaly smirked behind his hand driving up roots blood pressure was one of the few perks of the job no one else would dare to do it that was because everybody else was replaceable not foaly hed built the system from scratch and if anyone else even tried to boot it up a hidden virus would bring it crashing about their pointy ears the important bit here we are look suddenly holly drops the helmet it must land lens down because we lose picture weve still got sound though so ill bring that up foaly boosted the audio signal filtering out background noise not great quality the mike is in the camera so that was nose down in the dirt too nice peashooter said a voice definitely human deep too that usually meant big root raised an eyebrow peashooter slang for gun oh then the importance of that simple statement struck him she drew her weapon just wait it gets worse i dont suppose you would consider peaceful surrender said a second voice just listening to it gave the commander shivers no continued the voice i suppose not this is bad said root his face uncharacteristically pale this feels like a setup these two goons were waiting how is that possible hollys voice came through the speaker then typically brazen in the face of danger the commander sighed at least she was alive it was more bad news though as the parties exchanged threats and the second human displayed an uncommon knowledge of fairy affairs he knows about the ritual heres the worst bit roots jaw dropped the worst bit hollys voice again this time layered with the mesmer now she has them crowed root but apparently not not only did the mesmer prove ineffective but the mysterious pair seemed to find it amusing thats all there is from holly noted foaly one of the mud people messes around with the camera for a bit and then we lose everything root rubbed the creases between his eyes not much to go on no visual not even a name we cant really be a hundred per cent sure that we have a situation you want proof asked foaly rewinding the tape ill give you proof he ran the available video now watch this im going to slow it right down one frame per second root leaned in close to the screen close enough to see the pixels captain short comes in for a landing she takes off her helmet bends down presumably to pick up an acorn andthere foaly jabbed the pause button freezing the picture completely see anything unusual the commander felt his ulcer churn into overdrive something had appeared in the top righthand corner of the frame at first glance it seemed like a shaft of light but light from what or reflected from what can you blow that up no problem foaly cut to the relevant area increasing it by per cent the light expanded to fill the screen oh no breathed root there on the monitor before them in frozen suspension was a hypodermic dart there could be no doubt captain holly short was missing in action most probably dead but at the very least held captive by a hostile force tell me we still have the locator yep strong signal moving north at about eighty klicks an hour root was silent for a moment formulating his strategy go to full alert and get retrieval out of their bunks and back down here prep them for a surface shot i want full tactical and a couple of techiesyou too foaly we may have to stop time on this one ten four commander you want recon in on this root nodded you bet ill call in captain vein hes our number one oh no said root for a job like this we need our very best and thats me im reactivating myself foaly was so amazed he couldnt even formulate a smart comment youreyoure yes foaly dont act so surprised i have more successful recons under my belt than any officer in history plus i did my basic training in ireland back in the top hat and shillelagh days yes but that was five hundred years ago and you were no spring bud then not to put too fine a point on it root smiled dangerously dont worry foaly im still running red hot and ill make up for my age with a really big gun now get a pod ready im leaving on the next flare foaly did what he was told without a single quip when the commander got that glint in his eyes you hopped to and kept your mouth shut but there was another reason for foalys silent compliance it had just hit him that holly could be in real trouble centaurs dont make many friends and foaly was worried he might lose one of the few he had artemis had anticipated some technological advances but nothing like the treasure trove of fairy hardware spread out on the fourwheel drives dashboard impressive he murmured we could abort this mission right now and still make a fortune in patents artemis ran a handheld scanner bar over the unconscious elfs wristband he then fed the fairy characters into his powerbook translator this is a locator of some kind no doubt this leprechauns comrades are tracking us right now butler swallowed right now sir it would seem so or at any rate theyre tracking the locator artemis stopped speaking suddenly his eyes losing focus as the electricity in his cranium sparked off another brainwave butler the manservant felt his pulse quicken he knew that tone something was afoot yes artemis that japanese whaler the one seized by the port authorities is she still tied up at the docks butler nodded yes i believe so artemis twirled the locators band around his index finger good take us down there i believe its time to let our diminutive friends know exactly who theyre dealing with root rubberstamped his own reactivation with remarkable speed very unusual for lep upper management generally it took months and several mindcrushingly dull meetings to approve any application to the recon squad luckily root had a bit of influence with the commander it felt good to be back in a field uniform and root even managed to convince himself that the jumpsuit was no tighter around the middle than it used to be the bulge he rationalized was caused by all the new equipment they jammed into these things personally root had no time for gadgetry the only items the commander was interested in were the wings on his back and the multiphase watercooled tribarrelled blaster strapped to his hip the most powerful production handgun under the world old to be sure but it had seen root through a dozen fire fights and it made him feel like a field officer again the nearest chute to hollys position was etara not exactly an ideal location for a stealth mission but with barely two hours of moon time left there was no time for an overground jaunt if there was to be any chance of sorting out this mess before sunrise speed was of the essence he commandeered the el shuttle for his team bumping a tour group who had apparently been queuing for two years tough nuggets root growled at the holiday rep and whats more im shutting down all nonessential flights until the present crisis is past and when might that be squeaked the irate gnome brandishing a notebook as though she were prepared to make a complaint of some kind root spat out the butt of his cigar squashing it comprehensively beneath his boot heel the symbolism was all too obvious the chutes will be opened madam when i feel like it growled the commander and if you and your fluorescent uniform dont get out of my way ill yank your operating licence and have you thrown into the cells for obstructing an lep officer the holiday rep wilted before him and slunk back into line wishing her uniform wasnt quite so pink foaly was waiting at the pod serious though the moment was he couldnt resist an amused whinny at the sight of roots belly wobbling ever so slightly in his clinging jumpsuit are you sure about this commander generally we allow only one passenger per pod what do you mean snarled root there is only one then he caught foalys meaningful glance at his stomach oh ha ha very amusing keep it up foaly i have my limit you know but it was a hollow threat and they both knew it not only had foaly built their communications network from scratch but he was also a pioneer in the field of flare prediction without him human technology could very easily catch up with the fairy brand root strapped himself into the pod no halfcenturyold crafts for the commander this baby was fresh off the assembly line all silver and shiny with the new jagged fin stabilizers that were supposed to read the magma currents automatically foalys innovation of course for a century or so his pod designs had leaned towards the futuristic plenty of neon and rubber lately however his sensibilities had become more retrospective replacing the gadgetry with walnut dashes and leather upholstery root found this oldstyle decor strangely comforting he wrapped his fingers around the joysticks and suddenly realized just how long it was since he had ridden the hotshots foaly noticed his discomfort dont worry chief he said without the usual cynicism its like riding a unicorn you never forget root grunted unconvinced lets get the show on the road he muttered before i change my mind foaly hauled the door across until the suction ring took hold sealing the portal with a pneumatic hiss roots face took on a green hue through the quartz pane he didnt look too scary any more quite the opposite in fact artemis was performing a little field surgery on the fairy locator it was no mean feat to alter some of the dimensions without destroying the mechanisms the technologies were most definitely incompatible imagine trying to perform openheart surgery with a sledgehammer the first problem was opening the cursed thing the screwheads defied both flathead and phillips screwdrivers even artemiss extensive set of allen keys were unable to find purchase in the tiny grooves think futuristic artemis told himself think advanced technology it came to him after a few moments silent contemplation magnetic bolts obvious really but how to construct a revolving magnetic field in the back of a fourwheel drive impossible the only thing for it was to chase the screws around manually with a domestic magnet artemis hunted the small magnet from its niche in the toolbox and applied both poles to the tiny screws the negative side wiggled them slightly it was enough to give artemis some purchase with needlenose pliers and he soon had the locators panel disassembled before him the circuitry was minute and not a sign of a solder bead they must use another form of binder perhaps if he had time the principles of this device could be unravelled but for now he would have to improvise he would have to rely on the inattention of others and if the people were anything like humans they saw what they wanted to see artemis held the locators face up to the cabs light it was translucent slightly polarized but good enough he nudged a slew of tiny shimmering wires aside inserting a buttonhole camera in the space he secured the peasized transmitter with a dab of silicone crude but effective hopefully the magnetic screws refused to be coaxed back into their grooves without the proper tool so artemis was forced to glue them too messy but it should suffice provided the locator wasnt examined too closely and if it was well he would only lose an advantage that he never expected to have in the first place butler knocked off his high beams as they entered the city limits docks coming up artemis he said over his shoulder theres bound to be a customs and excise crew around somewhere artemis nodded it made sense the port was a thriving artery of illegal activity over fifty per cent of the countrys contraband made it ashore somewhere along this halfmile stretch a diversion then butler two minutes are all i need the manservant nodded thoughtfully the usual i dont see why not knock yourself outor rather dont artemis blinked that was his second joke in recent times and his first aloud better take care this was no time for frivolity the dockers were rolling cigarettes it wasnt easy with fingers the size of lead bars but they managed and if a few strands of brown tobacco dropped to the rough flagstones what of it the pouches were available by the carton from a little man who didnt bother adding government tax to his prices butler strolled over to the men his eyes shadowed beneath the brim of a watch cap cold night he said to the assembled group no one replied policemen came in all shapes and sizes the big stranger persevered even work is better than standing around on a frosty one like tonight one of the workmen a bit soft in the head couldnt help nodding in agreement a comrade drove an elbow into his ribs still though continued the newcomer i dont suppose you girls ever did a decent days work in your lives again there was no reply but this time it was because the dockers mouths were hanging open in amazement yep youre a patheticlooking bunch right enough went on butler blithely oh ive no doubt you would have passed as men during the famine but by todays standards youre little more than a pack of blousewearing weaklings arrrrgh said one of the dock hands it was all he could manage butler raised an eyebrow argh pathetic and inarticulate nice combination your mothers must be so proud the stranger had crossed a sacred line he had mentioned the mens mothers nothing could get him out of a beating now even the fact that he was obviously a simpleton albeit a simpleton with a good vocabulary the men stamped out their cigarettes and spread slowly into a semicircle it was six against one you had to feel sorry for them butler wasnt finished yet now before we get into anything ladies no scratching no spitting and no tattling to mummy it was the last straw the men howled and attacked as one if they had been paying any attention to their adversary in that moment before contact they might have noticed that he shifted his weight to lower his centre of gravity they might also have seen that the hands he drew out of his pockets were the size and approximate shape of spades but no one was paying attention to butler too busy watching their comrades making sure they werent alone in the assault the thing about a diversion is that it has to be diverting big crude not butlers style at all he would have preferred to take these gentlemen out from metres with a dart rifle failing that if contact was absolutely necessary a series of thumb jabs to the nerve cluster at the base of the neck would be his chosen modus operandi quiet as a whisper but that would be defeating the purpose of the exercise and so butler went against his training screaming like a demon and utilizing the most vulgar combat actions vulgar they may have been but thats not to say they werent effective perhaps a shao lin priest could have anticipated some of the more exaggerated movements but these men were hardly trained adversaries in fairness they werent even completely sober butler dropped the first with a roundhouse punch two more had their heads clapped together cartoon style the fourth was to butlers eternal shame dispatched with a spinning kick but the most ostentatious was saved for the last pair the manservant rolled on to his back caught them by the collars of their donkey jackets and flipped them into dublin harbour big splashes plenty of wailing perfect two headlights poked from the black shadow of a cargo container and a government saloon screeched along the quay as anticipated a customs and excise team on stakeout butler grinned with grim satisfaction and ducked around the corner he was long gone before the agents had flipped their badges or begun inquiries not that their interrogations would yield much big as a house was hardly an adequate description to track him down by the time butler reached the car artemis had already returned from his mission well done old friend he commented although im certain your martialarts sensei is turning in his grave a spinning kick how could you butler bit his tongue reversing the fourwheel drive off the wooden works as they crossed the overpass he couldnt resist glancing down at the chaos he had created the government men were hauling a sodden docker from the polluted waters artemis had needed this diversion for something but butler knew there was no point in asking what his employer did not share his plans with anyone until he thought the time was right and if artemis fowl thought the time was right then it usually was root emerged shaking from the pod he didnt remember it being like this in his time although truth be told it had probably been an awful lot worse back in the shillelagh days there were no fancy polymer harnesses no auto thrusters and certainly no external monitors it was just gut instinct and a touch of enchantment in some ways root preferred it like that science was taking the magic out of everything he stumbled down the tunnel into the terminal as the numberone preferred destination tara had a fully fledged passenger lounge six shuttles a week came in from haven city alone not on the flares of course paying tourists didnt like to be jostled around quite that much unless of course they were on an illegal jaunt to disneyland the fairy fort was crammed with fullmoon overnighters complaining about the shuttle suspensions a beleaguered sprite was sheltering behind her ticket desk besieged by angry gremlins theres no point hexing me squealed the sprite theres the elf you want right there she pointed a quivering green finger at the approaching commander the gremlin mob turned on root and when they saw the triplebarrelled blaster on his hip they kept right on turning root grabbed the pa stand from behind the desk and hauled it out to the extent of its cable now hear this he growled his gravelly tones echoing around the terminal this is commander root of the lep we have a serious situation above ground and i would appreciate cooperation from all you civilians first i would like you all to stop your yapping so i can hear myself think root paused to make certain his wishes were being respected they were secondly i would like every single one of you including those squawling infants to sit down on the courtesy benches until i have gone on my way then you can get back to griping or stuffing your faces or whatever else it is civilians do no one had ever accused root of political correctness no one was ever likely to either and i want whoevers in charge to get over here now root tossed the stand on to the desk a blare of whistling feedback grated on every eardrum in the building within fractions of a second an outofbreath elfgoblin hybrid was bobbing at his elbow anything we can do commander root nodded twisting a thick cigar into the hole beneath his nose i want you to open a tunnel straight through this place i dont want to be bothered by customs or immigration start moving everybody below after my boys get here the shuttle port director swallowed everybody yes that includes terminal personnel and take everything you can carry full evacuation he stopped and glared into the directors mauve eyes this is not a drill you mean yes said root continuing down the access ramp the mud people have committed an overtly hostile act who knows where this is going the elfgoblin combo watched as root disappeared in a cloud of cigar smoke an overtly hostile act it could mean war he punched in his accountants number on his mobile bark yes this is nimbus i want you to sell all my shares in the shuttle port yes all of them i have a hunch the price is about to take a severe dive captain holly short felt as though a sucker slug was drawing her brain out through her earhole she tried to figure out what could possibly have caused such agony but her faculties didnt stretch to memory just yet breathing and lying down were about all she could manage time to attempt a word something short and pertinent help she decided would be the one to go for she took a trembling breath and opened her mouth mummlp said her treacherous lips no good incomprehensible even by a drunken gnomes standards what was going on here she was flat on her back with no more strength in her body than a damp tunnel root what could have done this to her holly concentrated skirting the edge of blinding pain the troll was that it had the troll mauled her in that restaurant that would explain a lot but no she seemed to remember something about the old country and the ritual and there was something digging into her ankle hello a voice not hers not even elfin you awake then one of the european languages latin no english she was in england i thought the dart might have killed you aliens insides are different from ours i saw that on television gibberish aliens insides what was the creature talking about you look fit like muchacho maria shes a mexican midget wrestler holly groaned her gift of tongues must be on the blink time to see exactly what kind of craziness she was dealing with here focusing all her strength at the front of her head holly cracked open one eye she closed it again almost immediately there appeared to be a giant blonde fly staring down at her dont be scared said the fly just sunglasses holly opened both eyes this time the creature was tapping a silver eye no not an eye a lens a mirrored lens like the lenses worn by the other twoit all came back in a jolt rushing to fill the hole in her memory like a combination lock clicking into place she had been abducted by two humans during the ritual two humans with an extraordinary knowledge of fairy affairs holly tried speaking again wherewhere am i the human giggled delightedly clapping her hands together holly noticed her nails long and painted you can speak english what sort of accent is that sounds like a little bit of everything holly frowned the girls voice was corkscrewing right to the middle of her headache she lifted her arm no locator where are my things the girl wagged her finger as one might at a naughty child artemis had to take your little gun away and all those other toys couldnt have you hurting yourself artemis artemis fowl this was all his idea everything is always his idea holly frowned artemis fowl for some reason even the name made her shiver it was a bad omen fairy intuition was never wrong theyll come for me you know she said her voice rasping through dry lips you dont know what youve done the girl frowned youre absolutely right i have no clue whats going on so theres no future in trying to psych me out holly frowned it was obviously pointless playing mind games with this human the mesmer was her only hope but that couldnt penetrate reflective surfaces how the devil did these humans know that that could be worked out later for now she had to figure a way to separate this vacuous girl from her mirrored sunglasses you are a pretty human she said voice dripping with honeyed flattery why thank you holly why thank you holly i was in the local paper once i won a competition miss sugar beet fair nineteenninetynine i knew it natural beauty ill bet your eyes are spectacular so everyone tells me juliet nodded lashes like clock springs holly sighed if only i could see them whyever not juliets fingers curled around the glasses arm then she hesitated maybe i shouldnt why not just for a second i dont know artemis told me never to take these off hed never know juliet pointed to a viewcam mounted on the wall oh hed find out artemis finds out about everything she leaned in close to the fairy sometimes i think he can see inside my head too holly frowned foiled again by this artemis creature come on one second what harm could it do juliet pretended to think about it none i suppose unless of course youre hoping to nail me with the mesmer just how stupid do you think i am i have another idea said holly her tone altogether more serious why dont i get up knock you out and take those stupid glasses off juliet laughed delightedly as if this was the most ridiculous thing she had ever heard good one fairy girl im deadly serious human well if youre serious sighed juliet reaching a delicate finger behind her lenses to wipe away a tear two reasons one artemis said that while youre in a human dwelling you have to do what we want and i want you to stay on that cot holly closed her eyes right again where did this group get their information and two juliet smiled again but this time there was a hint of her brother in those teeth two because i went through the same training as butler and ive been dying for somebody to practise my piledriver on well see about that human thought holly captain short wasnt a hundred per cent yet and there was also the small matter of the thing digging into her ankle she thought she knew what it could be and if she was right then it could be the beginnings of a plan commander root had hollys locator frequency keyed into his helmet face screen it took root longer than expected to reach dublin the modern wing rigs were more complicated than he was used to plus hed neglected to take refresher courses at the right altitude he could almost superimpose the luminous map on his visor over the actual dublin streets below him almost foaly you pompous centaur he barked into his mouthpiece problem bossman came the tinny reply problem you can say that again when was the last time you updated the dublin files root could hear sucking noises in his ear it sounded as though foaly was having lunch sorry commander just finishing off this carrot ahmdublin lets see seventyfiveeighteen seventyfive i thought so this place is completely different the humans have even managed to change the shape of the coastline foaly was silent for a moment root could just imagine him wrestling with the problem the centaur did not like to be told that any part of his system was out of date ok he said at last heres what im going to do we have a scope on a satellite tv bird with a footprint in ireland i see muttered root which was basically a lie im going to email last weeks sweep direct to your visor luckily theres a video card in all the new helmets luckily the tricky bit will be to coordinate your flight pattern with the video feed root had had enough how long foaly ahmtwo minutes give or take give or take what about ten years if my calculations are off theyd better not be off then ill hover until we know one hundred and twentyfour seconds later roots black and white blueprints faded out to be replaced by fullcolour daylight imaging when root moved it moved and hollys locator beacon dot moved too impressive said root what was that commander i said impressive shouted root no need to get a swollen head the commander heard the sound of a roomful of laughter and realized that foaly had him on the speakers everyone had heard him complimenting the centaurs work thered be no talking to him for at least a month but it was worth it the video he was receiving now was bang up to date if captain short was being held in a building the computer would be able to give him d blueprints instantaneously it was foolproof except foaly the beacons gone off shore whats going on boat or ship sir id say at a guess root cursed himself for not thinking of it theyd be having a right old giggle in the situation room of course it was a ship root dropped down a few hundred metres until its shadowy outline loomed through the mist a whaler by the looks of it technology may have changed over the centuries but there was still nothing like a harpoon to slaughter the worlds largest mammal captain short is in there somewhere foaly below decks what can you give me nothing sir its not a permanent fixture by the time weve run down her registration itd be way too late what about thermal imaging no commander that hull must be at least fifty years old very high lead content we cant even penetrate the first layer im afraid youre on your own root shook his head after all the billions weve poured into your department remind me to slash your budget when i get back yes sir came the reply sullen for once foaly did not like budget jokes just have the retrieval squad on full alert i may need them at a moments notice i will sir youd better over and out root was on his own truth be told that was the way he liked it no science no uppity centaur whinnying in his ear just a fairy his wits and maybe a touch of magic root tilted his polymer wings hugging the underside of a fogbank there was no need to be careful with his shield activated he was invisible to the human eye even on stealthsensitive radar he would be no more than a barely perceptible distortion the commander swooped low to the gunwales it was an ugly craft this one the smell of death and pain lingered in the bloodswabbed decks many noble creatures had died here died and been dissected for a few bars of soap and some heating oil root shook his head humans were such barbarians hollys beeper was flashing urgently now she was close by very close somewhere within a metre radius was the hopefully stillbreathing form of captain short but without blueprints he would have to navigate the belly of this ship unaided root alighted gently on the deck his boots adhering slightly to the mixture of dried soap and blubber coating the steel surface the craft appeared to be deserted no sentry on the gangplank no bosun on the bridge not a light anywhere still no reason to abandon caution root knew from bitter experience that humans popped up when you least expected them once when he was helping the retrieval boys scrape some pod wreckage off a tunnel wall they were spotted by a group of potholing humans what a mess that had been mass hysteria highspeed chases group mindwipes the whole nine yards root shuddered nights like that could put decades on a fairy keeping himself fully shielded the commander stowed his wings in their sheath advancing on foot across the deck there were no other life forms showing up on his screen but like foaly said the hull had a high lead content even the paint was leadbased the entire boat was a floating ecohazard the point being that there could be an entire battalion of stormtroopers concealed below decks and his helmetcam would never pick them up very reassuring even hollys beacon was a few shades below par and that had a micro nuclear battery sending out the pulses root didnt like this not one bit keep calm he derided himself youre shielded theres not a human alive that can see you now root hauled open the first hatch it swung easily enough the commander sniffed the mud people had greased the hinges with whale blubber was there no end to their depravity the corridor was steeped in viscous darkness so root flicked down his infrared filter ok so sometimes technology did come in handy but he wouldnt be telling foaly that the maze of pipes and grilling before him was immediately illuminated with an unnatural red light minutes later he was regretting even thinking something nice about the centaurs technology the infrared filter was messing with his depth perception and hed whacked his head on two protruding ubends so far still no sign of life human or fairy plenty of animal mostly rodents and when youre just topping a metre in height yourself a goodsized rat can be a real threat especially since rats are one of the few breeds that can see straight through a fairy shield root unstrapped his blaster and set it to level three or medium rare as the elves in the locker room called it he sent one of the rats scurrying away with a smoking behind as a warning to the rest nothing fatal just enough to teach him not to look sideways at a fairy again in a hurry root picked up his pace this place was ideal for an ambush he was virtually blind with his back to the only exit a recon nightmare if one of his own men had pulled a stunt like this hed have their stripes for it but desperate times required judicious risktaking that was the essence of command he ignored several doors to either side following the beacon ten metres now a steel hatch sealed the corridor and captain short or her corpse lay on the other side of it root put his shoulder to the door it swung open without protest bad news if a live creature was being held captive the hatch would be locked the commander flicked the blasters power level to five and advanced through the hole his weapon hummed softly there was enough power on tap now to vaporize a bull elephant with a single blast no sign of holly no sign of anything much he was in a refrigerated storage bay glittering stalactites hung from a maze of piping roots breath fanned before him in icy clouds how would that look to a human disembodied breathing ah said a familiar voice we have a visitor root dropped to one knee levelling the handgun at the voices source come to rescue your missing officer no doubt the commander blinked a bead of sweat from his eye sweat at this temperature well im afraid youve come to the wrong place the voice was tinny artificial amplified root checked his locator for life signs there were none not in this chamber at any rate he was being monitored somehow was there a camera here somewhere concealed in the maze of overhead plumbing that could penetrate the fairy shield where are you show yourself the human chuckled it echoed unnaturally around the vast hold oh no not yet my fairy friend but soon enough and believe me when i do youll wish i hadnt root followed the voice keep the human talking what do you want hmm what do i want again you will know soon enough there was a low crate in the centre of the hold on it sat an attachй case the case was open why bring me here at all root poked the case with his pistol nothing happened i brought you here for a demonstration the commander leaned over the open container inside in snug foam packing were a flat vacuumpacked package and a tripleband vhp transmitter resting on top was hollys locator root groaned holly wouldnt willingly give up her equipment no lep officer would what sort of demonstration you demented freak again that cold chuckle a demonstration of my utter commitment to my goals root should have started to worry about his own health then but he was too busy worrying about hollys if youve harmed one tip of my officers pointy ears your officer oh we have management how privileged all the better to make my point alarm bells went off in roots head your point the voice emanating from the aluminium speaker grid was as serious as nuclear winter my point little fairy man is that i am not someone to be trifled with now if you would please observe the package the commander duly observed it was a nondescript enough shape flat like a slab of putty oroh no beneath the sealant a red light flicked on fly little fairy said the voice and tell your friends artemis fowl the second says hello beside the red light green symbols began to click through a routine root recognized them from his human studies class back in the academy they werenumbers going backwards a countdown darvit growled rootthere is no point translating that word as it would have to be censored he turned and fled up the corridor artemis fowls mocking tones carrying down the metal funnel three said the human two darvit repeated root the corridor seemed much longer now a sliver of starry sky peeked through a wedge of open door root activated his wings this would take some fancy flying the hummingbirds span was barely narrower than the ships corridor one sparks flew as the electronic wings scraped a protruding pipe root cartwheeled righting himself at mach zero said the voice boom inside the vacuumpacked package a detonator sparked igniting a kilogram of pure semtex the whitehot reaction devoured the surrounding oxygen in a nanosecond and surged down the path of least resistance which was of course immediately after lep commander root root dropped his visor opening the throttle to maximum the door was metres away now it was just a matter of what reached it first the fairy or the fireball he made it barely he could feel the explosion rattling his torso as he threw himself into a reverse loop flames latched on to his jumpsuit licking along his legs root continued his manoeuvre crashing directly into the icy water he broke the surface swearing above him the whaler had been totally consumed by noxious flames commander came a voice in his earpiece it was foaly he was back in range commander whats your status root lifted free of the waters grip my status foaly is extremely annoyed get on your computers i want to know everything there is to know about one artemis fowl and i want to know it before i get back to base yessir commander right away no wisecrack even foaly realized that this was not the time root hovered at metres below him the blazing whaler drew emergency vehicles like moths to a light he dusted charred threads from his elbows there will be a reckoning for this artemis fowl he vowed count on it chapter siege artemis leaned back in the studys leather swivel chair smiling over steepled fingers perfect that little explosion should cure those fairies of their cavalier attitude plus there was one less whaler in the world artemis fowl did not like whalers there were less objectionable ways to produce oil byproducts the pinhole camera concealed in the locator had worked perfectly with its highresolution images he had picked out the fairys telltale breath crystals artemis consulted the basement surveillance monitor his captive was sitting on the cot now head in hands artemis frowned he hadnt expected the fairy to appear sohuman until now they had merely been quarry animals to be hunted but now seeing one like this in obvious discomfort it changed things artemis put the computer to sleep and crossed to the main doors time for a little chat with their guest just as his fingers alighted on the brass handles the door flew open before him juliet appeared in the doorway cheeks flushed from haste artemis she gasped your mother she artemis felt a lead ball drop in his stomach yes well she says artemisartemis that your yes juliet for heavens sake what is it juliet placed both hands over her mouth composing herself after several seconds she parted spangled nails speaking through her nfingers its your father sir artemis senior madam fowl says hes come back for a split second artemis could have sworn his heart had stopped father back was it possible of course hed always believed his father was alive but lately since hed hatched this fairy scheme it was almost as if his father had shifted to the back of his mind artemis felt guilt churn his stomach he had given up given up on his own father did you see him juliet with your own eyes the girl shook her head no artemis sir i just heard voices in the bedroom but she wont let me through the door not for anything not even with a hot drink artemis calculated they had returned barely an hour since his father could have slipped past juliet it was possible just possible he glanced at his watch synchronized with greenwich mean time by constantly updated radio signals three am time was ticking on his entire plan depended on the fairies making their next move before daylight artemis started he was doing it again pushing family to one side what was he becoming his father was the priority here not some moneymaking scheme juliet was still in the doorway watching him with those enormous blue eyes she was waiting for him to make a decision as he always did and for once there was indecision scrawled across his pale features very well he mumbled eventually i had better go up there immediately artemis brushed past the girl taking the steps two at a time his mothers room was two flights up a converted attic space he hesitated at the door what would he say if it was his father miraculously returned what would he do it was ridiculous dithering about it impossible to predict he knocked lightly mother no response but he thought he heard a giggle and was instantly transported into the past initially this room had been his parents lounge they would sit on the chaise longue for hours tittering like school children feeding the pigeons or watching the ships sailing past on dublin sound when artemis senior had disappeared angeline fowl had become more and more attached to the space eventually refusing to leave altogether mother are you all right muffled voices from within conspiratorial whispers mother im coming in wait a moment timmy stop it you beast we have company timmy artemiss heart thumped like a snare drum in his chest timmy her pet name for his father timmy and arty the two men in her life he could wait no longer artemis burst through the double doors his first impression was light mother had the lamps on a good sign surely artemis knew where his mother would be he knew exactly where to look but he couldnt what ifwhat if yes can we help you artemis turned his eyes still downcast its me his mother laughed airy and carefree i can see its you papa cant you even give your boy one night off it is our honeymoon after all artemis knew then it was just an escalation of her madness papa angeline thought artemis was his own grandfather dead over ten years he raised his gaze slowly his mother was seated on the chaise longue resplendent in her own wedding dress face clumsily coated with makeup but that wasnt the worst of it beside her was a facsimile of his father constructed from the morning suit hed worn on that glorious day in christchurch cathedral fourteen years ago the clothes were padded with tissue and atop the dress shirt was a stuffed pillowcase with lipstick features it was almost funny artemis choked back a sob his hopes vanishing like a summer rainbow what do you say papa said angeline in a deep bass nodding the pillow like a ventriloquist manipulating her dummy one night off for your boy eh artemis nodded what else could he do one night then take tomorrow too be happy angelines face radiated honest joy she sprang from the couch embracing her unrecognized son thank you papa thank you artemis returned the embrace though it felt like cheating youre welcome mo angeline now i must be off business to attend to his mother settled beside her imitation husband yes papa you go dont worry we can keep ourselves amused artemis left he didnt look back there were things to be done fairies to be extorted he had no time for his mothers fantasy world captain holly short was holding her head in her hands one hand to be precise the other was scrabbling down the side of her boot on the cameras blindside in actuality her head was crystal clear but it would do no harm for the enemy to believe her still out of action perhaps they would underestimate her and that would be the last mistake they ever made hollys fingers closed around the object that had been digging into her ankle she knew immediately by its contours what was concealed there the acorn it must have slipped into her boot during all the commotion by the oak this could be a vital development all she needed was a small patch of earth then her powers would be restored holly glanced surreptitiously around the cell fresh concrete by the looks of it not a single crack or flaky corner nowhere to bury her secret weapon holly stood tentatively trying out her legs for stability not too bad a bit shaky around the knees but otherwise sound enough she crossed to the wall pressing her cheek and palms to the smooth surface the concrete was fresh all right very recent still damp in patches obviously her prison had been specially prepared looking for something said a voice a cold heartless voice holly reared back from the wall the human boy was standing not two metres from her his eyes hidden behind mirrored glasses he had entered the room without a sound extraordinary sit please holly did not want to sit please what she wanted to do was incapacitate this insolent pup with her elbow and use his miserable hide for leverage artemis could see it in her eyes it amused him getting ideas are we captain short holly bared her teeth it was answer enough we are both fully aware of the rules here captain this is my house you must abide by my wishes your laws not mine obviously my wishes do not include bodily harm to myself or you attempting to leave this house it hit holly then how do you know my your name your rank artemis smiled though there was no joy in it if you will wear a name tag hollys hand unconsciously covered the silver tag on her suit but thats written in gnommish i know i happen to be fluent as is everyone in my network holly was silent for a moment processing this momentous revelation fowl she said with feeling you have no idea what youve done bringing the worlds together like this could mean disaster for us all artemis shrugged i am not concerned with us all just myself and believe me i shall be perfectly fine now sit please holly sat never taking her hazel eyes from the diminutive monster before her so what is this master plan fowl let me guess world domination nothing so melodramatic chuckled artemis just riches a thief spat holly youre just a thief annoyance flashed across artemiss features only to be replaced by his customary sardonic grin yes a thief if you like hardly just a thief though the worlds first crossspecies thief captain short snorted first crossspecies thief mud people have been stealing from us for millennia why do you think we live underground true but i will be first to successfully separate a fairy from its gold gold gold human idiot you dont honestly believe that crockofgold nonsense some things arent true you know holly threw her head back and laughed artemis checked his nails patiently waiting for her to finish when the gales had finally subsided he shook his index finger you are right to laugh captain short for a while there i did believe in all that undertherainbow crockofgold blarney but now i know better now i know about the hostage fund holly struggled to keep her face under control what hostage fund oh come now captain why bother with the charade you told me about it yourself ii told you stammered holly ridiculous look at your arm holly rolled up her right sleeve there was a small cotton pad taped to the vein thats where we administered the sodium pentathol commonly known as truth serum you sang like a bird holly knew it was true how else could he know youre mad artemis nodded indulgently if i win im a prodigy if i lose then im mad thats the way history is written of course there had been no sodium pentathol just a harmless prick with a sterilized needle artemis would not risk causing brain damage to his meal ticket but nor could he afford to reveal the book as the source of his information better to let the hostage believe that she had betrayed her own people it would lower her morale making her more susceptible to his mind games still the ruse disturbed him it was undeniably cruel how far was he prepared to go for this gold he didnt know and wouldnt until the time came holly slumped momentarily defeated by this latest development she had talked revealed sacred secrets even if she did manage to escape she would be banished to some freezing tunnel under the arctic circle this isnt over fowl she said at last we have powers you cant possibly know about it would take days to describe them all the infuriating boy laughed again how long do you think youve been here holly groaned she knew what was coming a few hours artemis shook his head three days he lied weve had you on a drip for over sixty hoursuntil you told us everything we needed to know even as the words came out artemis felt guilty these mind games were having an obvious effect on holly destroying her from the inside out was there really a need for this three days you could have killed me what kind of and it was that speechless quality that sent the doubt shooting through artemiss brain the fairy thought him so evil she couldnt even find the words holly pulled herself together well then master fowl she spat heavy on the contempt if you know so much about us then you know what happens when they locate me artemis nodded absently oh yes i know in fact im counting on it it was hollys turn to grin oh really tell me boy have you ever met a troll for the first time the humans confidence dropped a notch no never a troll holly showed more teeth you will fowl you will and i hope im there to see it the lep had established a surface ops hq at etara well said root slapping at a paramedic gremlin who was applying burn salve to his forehead leave it the magic will sort me out soon enough well what replied foaly dont give me any of your lip today foaly because today is not one of those ohimsoimpressedwiththeponystechnology days tell me what you found on the human foaly scowled securing his foil hat on his head he flipped the top on a waferthin laptop i hacked into interpol not too difficult i can tell you they might as well have put out a welcome mat root drummed his fingers on the conference table get on with it right fowl tengigabyte file in paper terms thats half a library the commander whistled thats one busy human family corrected foaly the fowls have been subverting justice for generations racketeering smuggling armed robbery mostly corporate crime last century so do we have a location that was the easy bit fowl manor on a twohundredacre estate on the outskirts of dublin fowl manor is only about twenty klicks from our current location root chewed his bottom lip only twenty that means we could make it before first light yep sort out this whole mess before it gets out of hand in the rays of the sun the commander nodded this was their first break fairies had not operated in natural light for centuries even when they had lived above ground they were essentially night creatures the sun diluted their magic like bleaching a photograph if they had to wait another day before sending in a strike force who knew what damage fowl could achieve it was even possible that this whole affair was mediaoriented and by tomorrow evening captain shorts face would be on the cover of every publication on the planet root shuddered that would spell the end of everything unless the mud people had learned to coexist with other species and if history had taught him any lessons it was that humans couldnt get along with anyone even themselves right everyone lock and load v flight pattern establish a perimeter inside the manor grounds the retrieval squad roared militarytype affirmatives coaxing as many metallic noises from their weapons as possible foaly round up the techies follow us in the shuttle and bring the big dishes well shut down the entire estate give ourselves a bit of breathing room one thing commander mused foaly yes said root impatiently why did this human tell us who he was he must have known we could find him root shrugged maybe hes not as clever as he thinks he is no i dont think thats it i dont think thats it at all i think hes been one step ahead of us all the way and this is no different i dont have time for theorizing now foaly first light is approaching one more thing commander is this important yes i think it is well foaly tapped a key on his laptop scrolling through artemiss vital statistics this criminal mastermind the one behind this elaborate scheme yes what about him foaly looked up an almost admiring look in his golden eyes well hes only twelve years old and thats young even for a human root snorted jacking a new battery into his tribarrelled blaster too much damned tv thinks hes sherlock holmes thats professor moriarty corrected foaly holmes moriarty they both look the same with the flesh scorched off their skulls and with that elegant parting riposte root followed his squad into the night air the retrieval squad adopted the v goose formation with root on point they flew southwest following the video feed emailed to their helmets foaly had even marked fowl manor with a red dot idiotproof hed muttered into his mouthpiece just loud enough for the commander to hear him the centrepiece of the fowl estate was a renovated latemedievalearlymodern castle built by lord hugh fowl in the fifteenth century the fowls had held on to fowl manor over the years surviving war civil unrest and several tax audits artemis did not intend to be the one to lose it the estate was ringed by a fivemetre crenellated stone wall complete with the original guard towers and walkways the retrieval squad put down just inside the boundary and began an immediate scan for possible hostiles twenty metres apart instructed root sweep the area check in every sixty seconds clear retrieval nodded of course it was clear they were professionals lieutenant gudgeon retrieval squads leader climbed a guard tower you know what we should do julius he and root had been in the academy together brought up in the same tunnel gudgeon was one of perhaps five fairies who called root by his first name i know what you think we should do we should blast the whole place what a surprise the cleanest way one blue rinse and our losses are minimum blue rinse was the slang term for the devastating biological bomb used on rare occasions by the force the clever thing about a biobomb was that it destroyed only living tissue the landscape was unchanged that minimum loss youre talking about happens to be one of my officers oh yes tutted gudgeon a female recon officer the test case well i dont think youll have any problem justifying a tactical solution roots face took on that familiar purple hue the best thing you can do right now is stay out of my way or else i may be forced to ram that blue rinse straight into that morass you call a brain gudgeon was unperturbed insulting me doesnt change the facts julius you know what the book says we cannot under any circumstances allow the lower elements to be compromised one timestop is all you get after that the lieutenant didnt finish his statement he didnt have to i know what the book says snapped root i just wish you werent so gungho about it if i didnt know you better id say there was some human blood in you theres no call for that pouted gudgeon im only doing my job point taken conceded the commander im sorry you didnt often hear root apologizing but then it had been a deeply offensive insult butler was on monitors anything asked artemis butler started he hadnt heard the young master come in no nothing once or twice i thought i saw a flicker but it turned out to be nothing nothing is nothing commented artemis cryptically use the new camera butler nodded only last month master fowl had purchased a cinecamera over the internet two thousand frames a second recently developed by industrial light and magic for specialized nature shoots hummingbird wings and such it processed images faster than the human eye could artemis had had it installed behind a cherub over the main entrance butler activated the joypad where try the avenue i have a feeling visitors are on the way the manservant manipulated the toothpicksized stick with his massive fingers a live image sprang into life on the digital monitor nothing muttered butler quiet as the grave artemis pointed to the control desk freeze it butler nearly queried the order nearly instead he held his tongue and pressed the pad on screen the cherry trees froze blossoms trapped in midair more importantly a dozen or so blackclad figures suddenly appeared on the avenue what exclaimed butler where did they spring from theyre shielded explained artemis vibrating at high speed too fast for the human eye to follow but not for the camera nodded butler master artemis always two steps ahead if only i could carry it around with me if only but we do have the next best thing artemis lifted a headset gingerly from the workbench it was the remains of hollys helmet obviously trying to cram butlers head into the original helmet would be like trying to fit a potato into a thimble only the visor and control buttons were intact straps from a hard hat had been juryrigged to fit the manservants cranium this thing is equipped with several filters it stands to reason that one of them is antishield lets try it out shall we artemis placed the set over butlers ears obviously with your eye span there are going to be blind spots but that shouldnt hamper you unduly now run the camera butler set the camera rolling again while artemis slotted down one filter after another now no now everythings gone red ultraviolet no fairies now no polaroid i think last one butler smiled a shark thats spotted a bare behind gottem butler was seeing the world as it was complete with lepretrieval team sweeping the avenue hmm said artemis strobe variation i would guess very high frequency i see fibbed butler metaphorically or literally smiled his employer exactly artemis shook himself more jokes next thing hed be wearing clown shoes and turning cartwheels in the main hall very well butler time for you to do what you do best we appear to have intruders in the grounds butler stood no further instructions were necessary he tightened the hardhat straps striding brusquely to the door oh and butler yes artemis i prefer scared to dead if possible butler nodded if possible lepretrieval one were the best and the brightest it was every little fairys dream that one day he would grow up to don the stealthblack jumpsuit of the retrieval commandos these were the elite trouble was their middle name in the case of captain kelp trouble was actually his first name hed insisted on it at his manhood ceremony having just been accepted into the academy trouble led his team down the sweeping avenue as usual he took the point position himself determined to be the first into the fray if as he fervently hoped a fray developed check in he whispered into the mike that wound snakelike from his helmet negative on one nothing captain a big negatori trouble captain kelp winced were in the field corporal follow procedure but mummy said i dont care what mummy said corporal rank is rank you will refer to me as captain kelp yessir captain sulked the corporal but dont ask me to iron your tunic any more trouble zeroed in on his brothers channel shutting out the rest of the squad shut up about mummy will you and the ironing youre only on this mission because i requested you now start acting like a professional or get back to the perimeter ok trubs trouble shouted captain kelp its trouble not trubs or trub trouble ok ok trouble mummys right youre only a baby swearing very unprofessionally captain kelp switched his headset back to the open channel he was just in time to hear an unusual sound arrkk what was that what dunno nothing captain but trouble had done a sound recognition inservice for his captains exam and he was pretty sure the arrkk had been caused by someone getting a chop across the windpipe more than likely his brother had walked into a shrub grub are you all right thats corporal grub to you kelp viciously kicked a daisy check in sound off in sequence one ok two fine three bored but alive five approaching west wing kelp froze wait four you there four whats your situation nothing except static right four is down possibly an equipment malfunction still we cant afford to take any chances regroup by the main door retrieval one crept together making slightly less noise than a silk spider kelp did a quick head count eleven one short of a full complement four was probably wandering around the rose bushes wondering why nobody was talking to him then trouble noticed two things one a pair of black boots was sticking out of a shrub beside the door and two there was a massive human standing in the doorway the figure was cradling a very nastylooking gun in the crook of his arm go silent whispered kelp and immediately eleven fullface visors slid down to seal in the sounds of his squads breathing and communications now nobody panic i think i can trace the sequence of events here four is skulking around outside the door the mud man opens it four gets a whack on the noggin and lands in the bushes no problem our cover is intact repeat intact so no itchy fingers please grubsorry corporal kelp check fours vitals the rest of you make a hole and keep it quiet the squad stepped back carefully until they were standing on the manicured grassy verge the figure before them was indeed impressive without doubt the biggest human any of them had ever seen darvit breathed two maintain radio silence except in emergencies ordered kelp swearing is hardly an emergency secretly however he concurred with the sentiment this was one time he was glad to be shielded that man looked as if he could squash half a dozen fairies in one massive fist grub returned to his slot four is stable concussed id guess but otherwise ok his shields off though so i stuffed him in the bushes well done corporal good thinking the last thing they needed was for fours boots to be spotted the man moved lumbering casually along the path he may have glanced left or right it was difficult to tell beneath the hood pulled over his eyes odd for a human to wear a hood on such a fine night safety catches off ordered trouble he imagined his men rolling their eyes like they hadnt had their safeties off for the last half an hour still you had to go by the book in case of a tribunal later on there was a time when retrieval blasted first and answered questions never but not any more now there was always some dogooder civilian banging on about civil rights even for humans would you believe it the man mountain stopped right in the middle of the squad if he had been able to see them it would be the perfect tactical position their own firearms were virtually useless as they would probably do more damage to each other than the human fortunately the entire squad was invisible with the exception of four who was safely secreted in what appeared to be a rhododendron buzz batons fire em up just in case no harm in being cautious and when the lep officers were switching weapons right at that moment when their hands were fumbling with holsters thats when the mud man spoke evening gentlemen he said sweeping back his hood funny that thought trouble it was almost as ifthen he saw the makeshift goggles cover he screamed cover but it was too late no option but to stand and fight and that was no option at all butler could have taken them from the parapet one at a time with the ivory hunters rifle but that wasnt the plan this was all about making an impression sending a message it was standard procedure with any police force in the world to send in the cannon fodder first before opening negotiations it was almost expected that they would meet with resistance and butler was happy to oblige he peeked out through the letter box and oh happy coincidence there was a pair of goggled eyes peeking right back at him it was just too fortuitous to pass up bed time said butler heaving the door with a mighty shoulder the fairy flew several metres before alighting in the shrubbery juliet would be devastated she loved rhododendrons one down several to go butler pulled up the peaked hood on his field jacket stepping into the porch there they were spread out like a squadron of action men if not for the array of very proficientlooking weaponry hanging from each belt it would have been almost comical sliding his finger casually under the trigger guard butler strode into their midst the bulky one at two oclock was giving the orders you could tell from the heads angled his way the leader gave a command and the squad switched to closequarters weapons it made sense theyd only cut themselves to pieces with firearms time for action evening gentlemen butler said he couldnt help it and it was worth it for that one moment of consternation then his gun was up and blazing captain kelp was the first casualty a titaniumtipped dart puncturing the neck of his suit he went down sluggishly as though the air had turned to water two more of the squad were dropped before they had any idea what was going on it must be quite traumatic thought butler dispassionately to lose an advantage that youve held for centuries by now the remains of retrieval one had their buzz batons fired up and raised but they made the mistake of hanging back waiting for a command that was not forthcoming this gave butler an opportunity to take the fight to them as if he needed another advantage even so for a second the manservant hesitated these beings were so small like children then grub clipped him on the elbow with his buzz baton and volts spread across butlers chest all sympathy for the little people vanished instantly butler grabbed the offending baton swinging weapon and bearer like a set of bolas grub squealed as he was released his newfound momentum carrying him directly into three of his comrades butler continued the swinging motion driving punishing punches into the chests of two more fairies another clambered on to his back stinging him repeatedly with the baton butler fell on him something cracked and the stinging stopped suddenly there was a barrel under his chin one of retrieval had managed to get his weapon cocked freeze mud boy droned a helmetfiltered voice it was a seriouslooking gun liquid coolant bubbled along its length just give me a reason butler rolled his eyes different race same macho clichйs he slapped the fairy openhanded to the little man it must have been like the sky falling on his head that reason enough for you butler scrambled to his feet fairy bodies were scattered around him in various stages of shock and unconsciousness scared definitely dead probably not mission accomplished one little chap was faking though you could tell by the way his tiny knees knocked together butler picked him up by the neck finger and thumb easily meeting around the back name ggruber i mean corporal kelp well corporal you tell your commander that the next time i see armed forces coming in here theyll be picked off by sniper fire no darts either armourpiercing bullets yessir sniper fire got it seems fair good you are however permitted to remove your injured most generous of you but if i see so much as the twinkle of a weapon on any of the medics i might be tempted to detonate a few of the mines i have planted in the grounds grub swallowed his pallor increasing behind the visor unarmed medics crystal clear butler set the fairy down brushing his tunic with massive fingers now final thing listening furious nods i want a negotiator someone who can make decisions not some noranker who has to run off back to base after every demand understood fine that is im sure it will be fine unfortunately im one of those norankers so you see i cant actually guarantee it will be fine butler was sorely tempted to dropkick this little fellow back to his camp very well i understand justshut up grub almost agreed then he clamped his mouth shut and nodded good now before you go collect all weapons and helmets and make a little pile right there grub took a deep breath ah well may as well go out a hero i cant do that oh really and why not grub drew himself up to his full height an lep officer never relinquishes his weapon butler nodded fair enough thought id ask off you go then hardly able to believe his luck grub scurried back towards the command tower he was the last fairy standing trouble was snoring in the gravel but he grub kelp had faced down the mud monster wait until mummy heard about this holly sat on the edge of her bed fingers curled around the metal base she lifted slowly taking the weight on her arms the strain threatened to pop her elbows from their sockets she held it for a second and then slammed the frame into the concrete a satisfying cloud of dust and splinters swirled around her knees good she grunted holly eyed the camera doubtless they were watching her no time to waste she flexed her fingers repeating the manoeuvre again and again until the steel base left deep weals in her finger joints with each impact more and more splinters popped from the fresh floor after several moments the cell door burst open and juliet fell into the room what are you doing she panted trying to knock the house down im hungry shouted holly and im fed up waving at that stupid camera dont you feed your prisoners around here i want some food juliets fingers curled into a fist artemis had warned her to be civil but there was a limit no need to get your knickor whatever in a twist so what do you fairies eat got any dolphin holly asked sarcastically juliet shuddered no i dont you beast fruit then or vegetables make sure theyre washed i dont want any of your chemical poisons in my blood ha ha youre a riot you are dont worry all our produce is grown naturally juliet paused on her way to the door and dont you go forgetting the rules no trying to escape from the house and theres no need to break up the furniture either dont make me demonstrate my full nelson as soon as juliets footsteps had faded holly began smashing the bed into the concrete that was the thing about fairy bonds the instructions had to be given eye to eye and they had to be very precise just saying there was no need to do a thing wasnt specifically forbidding an elf to do it and another thing holly had no intention of escaping from the house that wasnt to say that she didnt mean to get out of her cell artemis had added yet another monitor to the bank this one was linked to a camera in angeline fowls attic room he spared a moment to check on his mother sometimes it bothered him having a camera in her room it seemed almost like spying but it was for her own good there was always the danger that she could hurt herself at the moment she was sleeping peacefully having swallowed the sleeping pill that juliet had left on her tray all part of the plan a vital part as it happened butler entered the control room he was clutching a fistful of fairy hardware and rubbing his neck tricky little blighters artemis looked up from the monitor bank any problems nothing major these little batons pack quite a punch though hows our prisoner fine juliet is getting her something to eat im afraid captain short is going a bit stircrazy on the screen holly was smashing her cot into the concrete its understandable noted the manservant imagine her frustration its not as if she can tunnel her way out artemis smiled no the entire estate is built on a bed of limestone not even a dwarf could tunnel his way out of here or in wrong as it happened dead wrong a landmark moment for artemis fowl the lep had procedures for emergencies like this one admittedly these did not include the retrieval squad getting hammered by a lone enemy still that just made the next step all the more urgent especially with the faintest of orange tinges creeping into the sky are we good to go roared root into his mike as though it wasnt whispersensitive good to go thought foaly busy wiring the last dish on a watchtower these military types and their catchphrases good to go lock and load i dont know but ive been told so insecure aloud he said no need to shout commander these headsets could pick up a spider scratching in madagascar and is there a spider scratching in madagascar welli dont know they cant really well stop changing the subject foaly and answer the question the centaur scowled the commander took everything so literally he plugged the dishs modem lead into his laptop ok weregood to go about time too right flip the switch for the third time in as many moments foaly gritted his horsy teeth he was indeed the stereotypical unappreciated genius flick the switch if you dont mind root didnt have the cranial capacity to appreciate what he was trying to do here stopping time wasnt just a matter of pressing the on button there was a series of delicate procedures that had to be performed with utmost precision otherwise the stop zone could end up as just so much ash and radioactive slop while it was true that fairies had been stopping time for millennia these days with satellite communication and the internet humans were liable to notice if a zone just dropped out of time for a couple of hours there was an age when you could throw a blanket stoppage over a whole country and the mud people would simply think the gods were angry but not any more nowadays the humans had instruments for measuring anything so if there was any timestopping to be done it had better be finetuned and precise in the old days five elfin warlocks would form a pentagram around the target and spread a magic shield over it temporarily stopping time inside the enchanted enclosure this was fine as far as it went provided the warlocks didnt have to use the bathroom many a siege was lost because an elf had one glass of wine too many warlocks tire quickly too and their arms get sore on a good day you had maybe an hour and a half which was hardly worth the trouble in the first place it was foalys idea to mechanize the whole procedure he had the warlocks do their thing into lithium batteries and then he set up a network of receiver dishes around the designated area sounds simple well it wasnt but there were definite advantages for one thing there were no more power surges batteries didnt try to show off to each other you could calculate exactly how many power cells were needed and sieges could be extended for up to eight hours as it happened the fowl estate was the perfect location for a timestop isolated with a definite boundary it even had elevated towers for the dishes for heavens sake it was almost as if artemis fowl wanted time stoppedfoalys finger hesitated over the button could it be possible after all the human youth had been one step ahead throughout this whole affair commander are we online yet not exactly theres something roots reaction nearly blew out the woofers in foalys earpiece no foaly there isnt something none of your bright ideas thank you very much captain shorts life is in danger so push the button before i climb that tower and push it with your face touchy muttered foaly and pushed the button lieutenant gudgeon checked his moonometer you have eight hours i know how much time i have growled root and stop following me dont you have work to do actually now that you mention it i have a biobomb to arm root rounded on him dont annoy me lieutenant having you pass comments at every turn is not improving my concentration just do whatever it is you feel you have to do but be prepared to back it up at tribunal if this one goes wrong heads are going to roll indeed muttered gudgeon under his breath but mine is not going to be one of them root checked the sky a shimmering azure field had descended over the fowl estate good they were in limbo outside the walls life continued at an exaggerated pace but if anyone were to somehow gain access to the manor in spite of the fortified walls and high gate they would find it deserted all occupants trapped in the past so for the next eight hours it would be twilight on the fowl estate after that root could not guarantee hollys safety given the gravity of the situation it was more than likely that gudgeon would get the goahead to biobomb the whole place root had seen a blue rinse before no living thing escaped not even the rats root caught up with foaly at the base of the north tower the centaur had parked a shuttle by the metrethick wall already the work area was a mess of tangled wires and pulsating fibre optics foaly are you in here the centaurs foilcapped head emerged from the belly of a disembowelled hard drive over here commander youve come to push a button with my face i presume root almost laughed dont tell me youre looking for an apology foaly ive already used my quota for today and that was to a lifelong friend gudgeon forgive me commander but i wouldnt waste my apologies on the lieutenant he wont be wasting any on you when he stabs you in the back youre wrong about him gudgeon is a good officer a bit eager certainly but hell do the right thing when the time comes the right thing for himself maybe i dont think holly is at the top of his priority list root didnt answer he couldnt and another thing i have a sneaking suspicion that young artemis fowl wanted us to stop time after all everything else weve tried has played straight into his hands root rubbed his temples thats impossible how could a human know about timestoppage anyway this is no time for theorizing foaly i have less than eight hours to clean up this mess so what have you got for me foaly clopped over to an equipment rack clamped to the wall no heavy armament thats for sure not after what happened to retrieval one no helmet either that beast of a mud man seems to collect them no to show good faith were going to send you in unarmed and unarmoured root snorted what manual did you get this from its standard operating procedure fostering trust speeds communication oh stop quoting and give me something to shoot suit yourself sighed foaly selecting what looked like a finger from the rack whats that its a finger what does it look like a finger admitted root yes but not any ordinary finger he glanced around to make sure that no one else was watching the tip contains a pressurized dart one shot only you tap the knuckle with your thumb and someone goes sleepybye why havent i seen this before its a covert kinda thing and said root suspiciously well there have been accidents tell me foaly our agents keep forgetting they have it on meaning they shoot themselves foaly nodded miserably one of our best sprites was picking his nose at the time three days on the critical list root rolled the memory latex on to his index finger where it immediately assumed the shape and flesh tone of the host digit dont worry foaly im not a complete idiot anything else foaly unhooked what appeared to be a false bottom from the equipment rack youre not serious what does that do nothing admitted the centaur but it gets a great laugh at parties root chuckled twice that was a major lapse for him ok levity over are you going to wire me naturally one iriscam what colour he peered into the commanders eyes hmm mud brown he selected a small vial from the shelf and removed the electronic contact lens from a fluid capsule plucking roots eyelid with thumb and forefinger he slotted in the iriscam that might irritate you try not to rub or it could end up in the back of your eye then wed be looking into your head and theres nothing interesting in there heaven knows root blinked resisting the urge to knead his watering eye thats it foaly nodded thats all we dare risk the commander agreed reluctantly his hip felt very light without a tribarrelled blaster dangling from it ok i suppose this amazing dart finger will have to do honestly foaly if this blows up in my face youll be on the next shuttle back to haven the centaur snickered just be careful in the toilet root didnt laugh there were some things you didnt joke about artemiss watch had stopped it was as though greenwich wasnt there any more or perhaps mused artemis were the ones who have disappeared he checked cnn it had frozen a picture of riz khan jittered slightly on the screen artemis could not hold back a satisfied smile they had done it just like the book said the lep had stopped time all according to plan time to check out a theory artemis wheeled over to the monitor bank and punched up the mam cam on the seventycentimetre main monitor angeline fowl was no longer on the chaise longue artemis panned around the room it was empty his mother had gone disappeared his smile widened perfect just as hed suspected artemis switched his attention to holly short she was banging the bed again occasionally she would rise from the mattress pounding the wall with her bare fists maybe it was more than frustration could there be method in her madness he tapped the monitor with a slim finger what are you up to captain whats your little plan he was distracted by a movement on the avenue monitor at last he breathed the games begin a figure was advancing down the avenue small but imposing nonetheless unshielded too finished playacting then artemis punched the intercom button butler we have a guest ill show him in you get back here and police the surveillance cameras butlers voice came back tinny through the speaker ten four artemis on my way artemis buttoned his designer jacket pausing at the mirror to straighten his tie the trick to negotiation was to hold all the cards going in and even if you didnt to try to look as though you did artemis put on his best sinister face evil he told himself evil but highly intelligent and determined dont forget determined he put a hand on the doorknob steady now deep breaths and try not to think about the possibility that you have misjudged this situation and are about to be shot dead one two threehe opened the door good evening he said every inch the gracious host albeit a sinister evil intelligent and determined one root stood on the doorstep palms up the universal gesture for look im not carrying a big murderous weapon youre fowl artemis fowl at your service and you are lep commander root right we know each others names so could we get on with this certainly root decided to chance his arm step outside then where i can see you artemiss face hardened have you learned nothing from my demonstrations the ship your commandos do i need to kill someone no said root hurriedly i only you only meant to lure me outside where i could be snatched and used to trade please commander root raise your game or send someone intelligent root felt the blood pump through his cheeks now you just listen to me you young artemis smiled in command again not very good negotiation techniques commander to lose your cool before we even get to the table root took several deep breaths fine whatever you say where would you prefer to conduct our talks inside of course you have my permission to enter but remember captain shorts life is in your hands be careful with it root followed his host down the vaulted hallway generations of fowls glared down at him from classical portraits they passed through a stainedoak doorway to a long conference room there were two places set at a round table complete with pads ashtrays and water jugs root was delighted to see the ashtrays and immediately pulled a halfchewed cigar from his vest maybe youre not such a barbarian after all he grunted exhaling a huge cloud of green smoke the commander ignored the water jugs instead pouring himself a shot of something purple from a hip flask he drank deeply belched and sat ready artemis shuffled his notes like a newsreader here is the situation as i see it i have the means to expose your subterranean existence and you are powerless to stop me so basically whatever i ask for is a small price to pay root spat out a shred of fungus tobacco you think you can just put all this information out over the internet well not immediately not with the timestop in effect root choked on a lungful of smoke their ace in the hole rumbled well if you know about the timestop you must also know that you are completely cut off from the outside world you are in effect powerless artemis jotted a note on the pad lets save some time here i grow weary of your clumsy bluffs in the case of an abduction the lep will first send a crack retrieval team to get back what has been lost you have done so excuse me while i titter crack team honestly a cubscout patrol armed with water pistols could have defeated them root fumed silently taking out his anger on the cigar butt the next official step is negotiation and finally when the eighthours time limit is about to run out and if no solution can be reached a biobomb is detonated contained by the timefield you appear to know an awful lot about us master fowl i dont suppose youll tell me how correct root mashed the remains of his cigar into the crystal ashtray so lets have it what are your demands one demand singular artemis slid his notepad across the polished table root read what was written there one tonne of twentyfourcarat gold small unmarked ingots only you cant be serious oh but i am root sat forward in his chair dont you see your position is untenable either you give us back captain short or we will be forced to kill you all there is no middle ground we dont negotiate not really im just here to explain the facts to you artemis smiled his vampire smile oh but you will negotiate with me commander oh really and what makes you so special i am special because i know how to escape the timefield impossible snorted root cant be done oh yes it can trust me i havent been wrong yet root tore off the top page folding it into his pocket ill have to think about this take your time we have eight hoursexcuse me seven and a half hours then times up for everybody root said nothing for a long while tapping his nails on the tabletop he took a breath to speak then changed his mind and stood abruptly well be in touch dont worry ill see myself out artemis pushed his chair back you do that but remember this none of your race has permission to enter here while im alive root stalked down the hallway glaring back at the oil paintings better to leave now and process this new information the fowl boy was indeed a slippery opponent but he was making one basic mistake the assumption that root would play by the rules however julius root hadnt got his commanders bars by following any rule book time for a bit of unorthodox action the videotape from roots iriscam was being reviewed by experts you see there said professor cumulus a behavioural specialist that twitch hes lying nonsense huffed doctor argon a psychologist from below the united states hes itchy thats all hes itchy so he scratches nothing sinister in it cumulus turned to foaly listen to him how can i be expected to work with this charlatan witch doctor countered argon foaly raised his hairy palms gentlemen please we need agreement here a concrete profile its no use said argon i cant work in these conditions cumulus folded his arms if he cant work neither can i root strode through the shuttle double doors his trademark purple complexion was even rosier than usual that human is toying with us i will not have it now what did our experts make of the tape foaly moved slightly to the side allowing the commander a clear run at the socalled experts apparently they cant work in these conditions roots eyes narrowed to slits bringing his prey into sharp focus excuse me the good doctor is a halfwit said cumulus unfamiliar with the commanders temper iim a halfwit stuttered argon equally ignorant what about you you cave fairy plastering your absurd interpretations on to the most innocent of gestures innocent the boy is a bag of nerves obviously lying its textbook root slammed a clenched fist on to the table sending a spiders web of cracks scurrying across the surface silence and silence there was instantly now you two experts are on handsome retainers for your profiling work correct the pair nodded afraid to speak in case that broke the silence rule this is probably the case of your lives so i want you to concentrate very hard understood more nods root popped the camera out of his weeping eye fastforward it foaly towards the end the tape hopped forward erratically on screen root followed the human into his conference room there stop it there can you zoom in on his face can i zoom in on his face snorted foaly can a dwarf steal the web from under a spider yes replied root that was a rhetorical question actually i dont need a grammar lesson foaly just zoom in would you foaly ground his tombstone teeth ok boss will do the centaurs fingers prodded the keyboard with lightning speed artemiss visage grew to fill the plasma screen id advise you to listen said root squeezing the experts shoulders this is a pivotal moment in your careers i am special said the mouth on the screen because i can escape the timefield now tell me said root is he lying run it again said cumulus show me the eyes argon nodded yes just the eyes foaly tapped a few more keys and artemiss deep blue eyes expanded to the width of the screen i am special boomed the human voice because i can escape the timefield well is he lying cumulus and argon looked at each other all traces of antagonism gone no they said simultaneously hes telling the truth added the behaviourist or clarified the psychologist at least he thinks he is root swabbed his eye with a cleansing solution thats what i thought when i looked that human in the face i figured he was either a genius or crazy artemiss cool eyes glared at them from the screen so which is it asked foaly a genius or crazy root grabbed his tribarrelled blaster from the gun rack whats the difference he snapped strapping his trusty weapon to his hip get me an outside line to e this fowl person seems to know all of our rules so its time to break a few chapter mulch time to introduce a new character to our otherworldly pageant well not strictly speaking a new character we have encountered him before in the lep booking line on remand for numerous larcenies mulch diggums the kleptomaniac dwarf a dubious individual even by artemis fowls standards as if this account didnt already suffer from an overdose of amoral individuals born to a typical dwarf caverndwelling family mulch had decided early that mining was not for him and resolved to put his talents to another use namely digging and entering generally entering mud peoples property of course this meant forfeiting his magic dwellings were sacred if you broke that rule you had to be prepared to accept the consequences mulch didnt mind he didnt care much for magic anyway there had never been much use for it down the mines things had gone pretty well for a few centuries and hed built up quite a lucrative aboveground memorabilia business that was until hed tried to sell the jules rimet cup to an undercover lep operative from then on his luck had turned and hed been arrested over twenty times to date a total of years in and out of prison mulch had a prodigious appetite for tunnelling and that unfortunately is a literal translation for those unfamiliar with the mechanics of dwarf tunnelling i shall endeavour to explain them as tastefully as possible like some members of the reptile family dwarf males can unhinge their jaws allowing them to ingest several kilos of earth a second this material is processed by a superefficient metabolism stripped of any useful minerals andejected at the other end as it were charming at present mulch was languishing in a stonewalled cell in lep central at least he was trying to project an image of a languishing unperturbed kind of dwarf actually he was quaking in his steeltoecapped boots the goblindwarf turf war was flaring up at the moment and some bright spark lep elf had seen fit to put him in a cell with a gang of psychedup goblins an oversight perhaps more likely a spot of revenge for trying to pick his arresting officers pocket in the booking line so dwarf sneered the headhoncho goblin a wartfaced fellow covered in tattoos how come you dont chew your way outta here mulch rapped on the walls solid rock the goblin laughed so what cant be any harder than your dwarf skull his cronies laughed so did mulch he thought it might be wise wrong you laughin at me dwarf mulch stopped laughing with you he corrected im laughing with you that skull joke was pretty funny the goblin advanced until his slimy nose was a centimetre from mulchs own you paytronizin me dwarf mulch swallowed calculating if he unhinged now he could probably swallow the leader before the others reacted still goblins were murder on the digestion very bony the goblin conjured up a fireball around his fist i asked you a question stumpy mulch could feel every sweat gland on his body pop into instant overdrive dwarfs did not like fire they didnt even like thinking about flames unlike the rest of the fairy races dwarfs had no desire to live above ground too close to the sun ironic for someone in the mud people possession liberation business nno need for that he stammered i was just trying to be friendly friendly scoffed wartface your kind dont know the meanin of the word cowardly backstabbers the lot of you mulch nodded diplomatically we have been known to be a bit treacherous a bit treacherous a bit treacherous my brother phlegm was ambushed by a crowd of dwarfs disguised as dung heaps hes still in traction mulch nodded sympathetically the old dung heap ruse disgraceful one of the reasons i dont associate with the brotherhood wartface twirled the fireball between his fingers there are two things under this world that i really despise mulch had a feeling that he was about to find out what they were one is a stinkin dwarf no surprises there and the other is a traitor to his own kind and from what i hear you fall neatly into both categories mulch smiled weakly just my luck luck aint got nothin to do with it fortune delivered you into my hands on another day mulch might have pointed out that luck and fortune were basically the same thing not today you like fire dwarf mulch shook his head wartface grinned now aint that a shame cause any second now im going to ram this here fireball down your throat the dwarf swallowed drily wasnt it just typical of the dwarf brotherhood what do dwarfs hate fire who are the only creatures with the ability to conjure fireballs goblins so who did the dwarfs pick a fight with what a real nobrainer mulch backed up to the wall careful there we could all go up not us grinned wartface snorting the fireball up two elongated nostrils completely fireproof mulch was perfectly aware what would happen next hed seen it too many times in the back alleys a group of goblins would corner a stray brother dwarf pin him down and then the leader would give him the double barrels straight in the face wartfaces nostrils quivered as he prepared to vent the inhaled fireball mulch quailed there was only one chance the goblins had made a basic mistake theyd forgotten to pin his arms the goblin drew a breath through his mouth then closed it more exhalation pressure for the fire stream he tilted his head back pointing his nose at the dwarf and let fly quick as a flash mulch jammed his thumbs up wartfaces nostrils disgusting yes but definitely better than being dwarf kebab the fireball had nowhere to go it rebounded on the balls of mulchs thumbs and ricocheted back into the goblins head the tear ducts provided the path of least resistance so the flames compressed into pressurized streams erupting just below the goblins eyes a sea of flame spread across the cell roof mulch withdrew his thumbs and after a quick wipe thrust them in his mouth allowing the natural balm in his saliva to begin the healing process of course if hed still had his magic he could have ust wished the scorched digits better but that was the price you paid for a life of crime wartface didnt look so good smoke was leaking from every orifice in his head flameproof goblins may be but the errant fireball had given his tubes a good scouring he swayed like a strand of seaweed then collapsed face down on the concrete floor something crunched probably a big goblin nose the other gang members did not react favourably look what he did to the boss that stinkin stump lets fry im mulch backed up even further hed been hoping the remaining goblins would lose their nerve once their leader was out of commission apparently not even though it was most definitely not in his nature mulch had no option but to attack he unhinged his jaw and leaped forward clamping his teeth around the foremost goblins head ow bagg off he shouted around the obstruction in his mouth bagg off or ur briend gedds it the others froze uncertain of their next move of course theyd all seen what dwarf molars could do to a goblin head not a pretty sight each one popped a fireball in his fist im warnih ooh you cant get us all stumpy mulch resisted the impulse to bite down it is the strongest of dwarf urges a genetic memory born from millennia spent tunnelling the fact that the goblin was wriggling slimily didnt help his options were running out the gang was advancing and he was powerless as long as his mouth was full it was crunch time pardon the pun suddenly the cell door clanked open and what seemed like an entire squadron of lep officers flooded the confined space mulch felt the cold steel of a gun barrel against his temple spit out the prisoner ordered a voice mulch was delighted to comply a thoroughly slimed goblin collapsed retching on the floor you goblins put em out one by one the fireballs were extinguished thats not my fault whined mulch pointing to the spasming wartface he blew himself up the officer holstered his weapon drawing out a set of cuffs i couldnt care less what you do to each other he said spinning mulch and snapping the cuffs on if it was up to me id put the whole lot of you in a big room and come back a week later to sluice it out but commander root wants to see you above ground asap asap now if not sooner mulch knew root the commander was responsible for several of his government hotel visits if julius wanted to see him it probably wasnt for drinks and a movie now but its daylight now ill burn the lep officer laughed it aint daylight where youre going pal where youre going it aint anything root was waiting for the dwarf inside the timefield portal the portal was yet another of foalys inventions fairies could be introduced to and leave the timefield without affecting the altered flow inside the field this effectively meant that even though it took nearly six hours to get mulch to the surface he was injected into the field only moments after root had the notion to send for him it was mulchs first time in a field he stood watching life proceed at an exaggerated rate outside the shimmering corona cars zipped by at impossible speeds and clouds tumbled across the skyline as though driven by forceten gales mulch you little reprobate roared root you can take off that suit now the field is uvfiltered or so im told the dwarf had been issued a blackout suit at e even though dwarfs had thick skins they were extremely sensitive to sunlight and had a burn time of less than three minutes mulch peeled off the skintight suit nice to see you julius thats commander root to you commander now i heard that clerical error was it roots teeth ground his cigar to a pulp i dont have time for this impudence convict and the only reason that my boot is not up your behind right now is that i have a job for you mulch frowned convict i have a name you know julius root squatted to the dwarfs level i dont know what dreamworld you live in convict but in the real world you are a criminal and it is my job to ensure your life is as unpleasant as possible so if youre expecting civility just because ive testified against you some fifteen times forget it mulch rubbed his wrists where the handcuffs had left red welts fine commander no need to blow a gasket im not a murderer you know just a petty criminal from what i hear you nearly made the transformation below in the cells not my fault they attacked me root screwed a fresh cigar into his mouth fine whatever just follow me and dont steal anything yessir commander said mulch innocently he didnt need to steal anything else hed already palmed roots fieldaccess card when the commander had made the mistake of leaning over they crossed the retrieval perimeter to the avenue do you see that manor what manor root rounded on him i dont have time for this convict nearly half my timestop has elapsed another few hours and one of my best officers will be bluerinsed mulch shrugged none of my concern im just a criminal remember and by the way i know what you want me to do and the answer is no i havent even asked you yet its obvious im a housebreaker thats a house you cant go in because youll lose your magic but my magic is already gone two and two root spat out the cigar dont you have any civic pride our entire way of life is on the line here not my way of life fairy prison human prison its all the same to me the commander thought about it ok you slime fifty years off your sentence i want amnesty in your dreams mulch take it or leave it seventyfive years in minimum security you take it or leave it mulch pretended to think it was all academic seeing as he intended escaping anyway single cell yes yes single cell now will you do it very well julius only because its you foaly was searching for a matching iriscam hazel i think or perhaps tawny you really do have stunning eyes mister mulch thank you foaly my mother always said they were my most attractive feature root was pacing the shuttle floor you two do realize were on a deadline here dont you never mind matching the colour just give him a camera foaly plucked a lens from its solution with tweezers this is not just vanity commander the closer the match the less interference from the actual eye whatever whatever just get on with it foaly grabbed mulchs chin holding him still there you are were with you all the way foaly twisted a tiny cylinder into the thick tufts of hair growing from mulchs ear wired for sound now too in case you need to call for assistance the dwarf smiled wryly forgive me for not swelling with confidence i find ive always done better on my own if you can call seventeen convictions doing better chuckled root oh we have time for jokes now do we root grabbed him by the shoulder youre right we dont lets go he dragged mulch across a grassy verge to a cluster of cherry trees i want you to tunnel in there and find out how this fowl person knows so much about us probably some surveillance device whatever it is destroy it find captain short if possible and see what you can do for her if she is dead at least it will clear the way for a biobomb mulch squinted across the landscape i dont like it what dont you like the lie of the land i smell limestone solidrock foundation there might not be a way in foaly trotted across ive done a scan the original structure is based totally on rock but some of the later extensions stray on to clay the wine cellar in the south wing appears to have a wooden floor it should be no problem for someone with a mouth like yours mulch decided to take that as a statement of fact rather than an insult he opened the bumflap on his tunnelling trousers right stand back root and the surrounding lep officers rushed for cover but foaly who had never actually seen a dwarf tunnelling decided to stay for a peek good luck mulch the dwarf unhinged his jaw ank oo he mumbled bending over for launch the centaur looked around wheres everyone he never finished that statement because a blob of recently swallowed and even more recently recycled clay whacked him in the face by the time hed cleared his eyes mulch had disappeared down a vibrating hole and there was the sound of hearty laughter shaking the cherry trees mulch followed a loamy vein through a volcanic fold in the rock nice consistency not too many loose stones plenty of insect life too vital for strong healthy teeth a dwarfs most important attribute the first thing a prospective mate looked at mulch went low to the limestone his belly almost scraping the rock the deeper the tunnel the less chance of subsidence on the surface you couldnt be too careful these days not with motion sensors and landmines mud people went to extraordinary lengths to protect their valuables with good reason as it happened mulch felt a vibration cluster to his left rabbits the dwarf fixed the location in his internal compass always useful to know where the local wildlife hung out he skirted the warren following the manor foundations around in a long northwesterly loop wine cellars were easy to locate over the centuries residue seeped through the floor infusing the land beneath with the wines personality this one was sombre nothing cheeky here a touch of fruit but not enough to lighten the flavour definitely an occasion wine on the bottom rack mulch burped that was good clay the dwarf aimed his scything jaws skywards punching through the floorboards he hauled himself through the jagged hole shaking the last of the recycled mud from his trousers he was in a blessedly dark room perfect for dwarf vision his sonar had guided him to an uncovered spot in the floor one metre to the left and he would have emerged in a huge barrel of italian red mulch rehinged his jaw and padded across to the wall he flattened a conchlike ear to the red brickwork for a moment he was absolutely still absorbing the houses vibrations a lot of lowfrequency humming there was a generator somewhere and plenty of juice running through the wires footsteps too way up maybe on the third floor and close by a crashing sound metal on concrete there it was again someone was building something or breaking something down something skittered past his foot mulch squashed it instinctively it was a spider just a spider sorry little friend he said to the grey smear im a bit on the jittery side the steps were wooden of course more than a century old too by the smell of them steps like that creaked as soon as you looked at them better than any pressure pads for giving away intruders mulch climbed along the edges one foot in front of the other right in by the wall was where the wood had most support and was less likely to creak this was not as simple as it sounds dwarf feet are designed for spadework not for the delicate intricacies of ballet dancing or balancing on wooden steps nonetheless mulch reached the door without incident a couple of minor squeaks but nothing that would be detectable by human ears or hardware the door was locked naturally but it may as well not have been for all the challenge it presented to a kleptomaniac dwarf mulch reached into his beard plucking out a sturdy hair dwarf hair is radically different from the human variety mulchs beard and head hair were actually a matrix of antennae that helped him to navigate and avoid danger below ground once removed from its pore the hair immediately stiffened in rapid rigor mortis mulch twisted the end in the seconds before it became completely rigid a perfect pick one quick jiggle and the lock yielded only two tumblers terrible security typical of humans they never expected an attack from below mulch stepped on to a parquet corridor the whole place smelled of money he could make a fortune here if only he had the time there were cameras just below the architrave tastefully done nestling in the natural shadows but vigilant none the less mulch stood for a moment calculating the systems blindspot three cameras on the corridor ninetysecond sweep no way through you could ask for help said a voice in his ear foaly mulch pointed his wired eyeball at the nearest camera can you do anything about those he whispered the dwarf heard the sound of a keyboard being manipulated and suddenly his right eye zoomed like a camera lens handy breathed mulch ive got to get me one of these roots voice crackled through the tiny speaker no chance convict government issue anyway what would you do with one in prison get a closeup of the other side of your cell youre such a charmer julius whats the matter are you jealous because im succeeding where you failed roots foul swearing was drowned out by foaly ok ive got it simple video network not even digital im going to broadcast a loop of the last ten seconds to every camera through our dishes that should give you a few minutes mulch shuffled uncomfortably how long will that take im a bit exposed here you know its already started replied foaly so get moving are you sure of course im sure elementary electronics ive been messing with human surveillance since kindergarten youll just have to trust me id rather trust a bunch of humans not to hunt a species to extinction than trust an lep consultant thought mulch but aloud he said ok im away over and out he sneaked down the hall even his hands were sneaky padding the air as if he could somehow make himself lighter whatever that centaur did must have worked because there were no agitated mud people racing down the stairs waving primitive gunpowder weapons stairs ah stairs mulch had a thing for stairs they were like predug shafts he found that inevitably the best booty lay at their summit and what a stairway stained oak with the intricate carvings generally associated with either the eighteenth century or the obscenely rich mulch rubbed his finger along an ornate banister in this case probably both still no time to moon about stairways did not tend to remain deserted for long especially during a siege who could tell how many bloodthirsty troopers waited behind each door eager for a fairy head to add to their stuffed trophy wall mulch climbed carefully taking nothing for granted even solid oak creaked he stuck to the borders avoiding the carpet inlay the dwarf knew from conviction number eight how easy it was to conceal a pressure pad beneath the deep shag of some antique weave he reached the landing with his head still attached to his shoulders but there was another problem quite literally brewing dwarf digestion due to its accelerated rate can be quite explosive the loosely packed soil on the fowl estate was very well aerated and a lot of that air had entered mulchs tubes along with the soil and minerals now the air wanted to get out dwarf etiquette dictated that gas be passed while still in the tunnel but mulch didnt have time for manners now he regretted not taking a moment to get rid of the gas while he was in the cellar the problem with dwarf gas was that it couldnt go up only down imagine if you will the catastrophic effects of burping while digesting a mouthful of clay total system backup not a pretty sight thus dwarf anatomy ensured that all gas was passed below actually aiding in the expulsion of unwanted clay of course theres a simpler way of putting this but that version can only be read in the adult book mulch wrapped his arms around his stomach hed better get out of the open a blowout on a landing like this could take out the windows he shuffled along the corridor skipping through the first doorway he encountered more cameras quite a lot of them in fact mulch studied the lenses sweep four were surveying the general floorspace but another three were fixed foaly you there whispered the dwarf no the typical sarcastic reply i have much better things to do than worry about the collapse of civilization as we know it yes thank you dont let my life being in danger interrupt your merriment ill try not to i have a challenge for you foaly was instantly interested really go on mulch pointed his gaze at the recessed cameras half hidden in the swirling architrave i need to know where those three cameras are pointing exactly foaly laughed thats not a challenge those old video systems emit faint ion beams invisible to the naked eye of course but not with your iriscam the hardware in mulchs eye flickered and sparked oww sorry small charge you could have warned me ill give you a big kiss later you baby i thought dwarfs were tough we are tough ill show you just how tough when i get back roots voice interrupted the posturing you wont be showing anyone anything convict except perhaps where the toilet is in your cell now what do you see mulch looked at the room again through his ionsensitive eye each camera was emitting a faint beam like the last evening sunrays the rays pooled on a portrait of artemis fowl senior not behind the picture oh please mulch placed his ear against the picture glass nothing electrical not alarmed then just to be sure he sniffed the frames edge no plastic or copper wood steel and glass some lead in the paint he curled a nail behind the frame and pulled the picture came away smoothly hinged on the side and behind it a safe its a safe said foaly i know that you idiot im trying to concentrate here if you want to help tell me the combination no problem oh by the way theres another little shock coming maybe the big baby would like to suck his thumb for comfort foaly im going toowww there thats the xray on mulch squinted at the safe it was incredible he could see right into the works tumblers and catches stood out in shadowy relief he blew on his hairy fingers and twisted the combination dial in seconds the safe lay open before him oh he said disappointed what is it nothing just human currency nothing of value leave it ordered root try another room get going mulch nodded another room before his time ran out but something was niggling at him if this guy was so clever why did he put the safe behind a painting such a clichй totally against form no something wasnt right here they were being duped somehow mulch closed the safe swinging the portrait back into position it swung smoothly weightless on the hinges weightless he swung the picture out again and back in convict what are you doing shut up julius i mean quiet a moment commander mulch squinted at the frames profile a bit thicker than normal quite a bit thicker even taking the box frame into account five centimetres he ran a nail down the heavy cartridge backing and stripped it away to reveal another safe a smaller one custommade obviously foaly i cant see through this leadlined youre on your own burglar boy do what you do best typical muttered mulch flattening his ear to the cold steel he twirled the dial experimentally nice action the clicks were muted by the lead he would have to concentrate the upside was that something this thin could have only three tumblers at the most mulch held his breath and twisted the dial one cog at a time to the normal ear even with amplification the clicks would have seemed uniform but to mulch each cog had a distinctive signature and when a ratchet caught it was so loud as to be deafening one he breathed hurry it up convict your time is running out you interrupted to tell me that i can see now how you made commander julius convict im going to but it was no use mulch had removed his earpiece slipping it into his pocket now he could devote his full attention to the task at hand two there was noise outside in the hall someone was coming about the size of an elephant by the size of it no doubt this was the man mountain that had made mincemeat of the retrieval squad mulch blinked a bead of sweat from his eye concentrate concentrate the cogs clicked by millimetre by millimetre nothing was catching the floor seemed to be hopping gently though he could be imagining it click click come on come on his fingers were slick with perspiration the dial slipping between them mulch wiped them on his jerkin now baby come on talk to me click thunk yes mulch twisted the handle nothing still an obstruction he ran a fingertip over the metal face there a small irregularity a micro keyhole too small for your average lock pick time for a little trick hed learned in prison quickly though his stomach was bubbling like stew in the oven and the footsteps were getting closer selecting a sturdy chin hair mulch fed it gently into the tiny hole when the tip reappeared he pulled the root from his chin the hair immediately stiffened retaining the shape of the locks interior mulch held his breath and twisted smooth as a goblins lie the lock opened beautiful at moments like these it was almost worth all the jail time the kleptomaniac dwarf swung back the little door beautiful work almost worthy of a fairy forge light as a wafer inside was a small chamber and in the chamber was oh gods above breathed mulch then things came to a head rather rapidly the shock that mulch had experienced communicated itself to his bowels and they decided the excess air had got to go mulch knew the symptoms jelly legs bubbling cramps wobbly behind in the seconds remaining to him he snatched the object from the safe and leaning over he clasped his knees for support the constrained wind had built itself up to minicyclone intensity and could not be constrained and so it exited rather abrasively blowing open mulchs bumflap and slamming into the rather large gentleman who had been sneaking up behind him artemis was glued to the monitors this was the time when things traditionally went wrong for kidnappers the third quarter of operations having been successful thus far the abductors tended to relax light up a few cigarettes get chatty with their hostages next thing they knew they were flat on their faces with a dozen guns pointed at the backs of their heads not artemis fowl he didnt make mistakes no doubt the fairies were reviewing the tapes of their first negotiating session searching for anything that would give them a way in well it was there all right all they had to do was look buried just deep enough to make it look accidental it was possible that commander root would try another ruse he was a wily one no doubt about it one who would not take kindly to being bested by a child he would bear watching the mere thought of root gave artemis the shivers he decided to check in again he inspected the monitors juliet was still in the kitchen scrubbing at the sink washing the vegetables captain short was on her bunk quiet as the grave no more bed banging perhaps he had been wrong about her perhaps there was no plan butler stood at his post outside hollys cell odd he should have been on his rounds by now artemis grabbed a walkietalkie butler roger base receiving shouldnt you be on your rounds there was a pause i am artemis patrolling the main landing coming up on the safe room im waving at you right now artemis glanced at the landing cameras deserted from every angle definitely no waving manservant he studied the monitors counting under his breath there every ten seconds a slight jump on every screen a loop he cried jumping from his chair theyre feeding us a loop over the speaker he could hear butlers pace quickening to a run the safe room artemiss stomach dropped into queasy hell duped he artemis fowl had been duped even though hed known it was coming inconceivable it was arrogance that had done it his own blinding arrogance and now the entire plan could collapse around his ears he switched the walkietalkie to juliets band it was a pity now that hed taken the houses intercom offline but it didnt operate on a secure frequency juliet receiving where are you right now in the kitchen wrecking my nails on this grater leave it juliet check on the prisoner but artemis the carrot sticks will dry out leave it juliet shouted artemis drop everything and check on the prisoner juliet obediently dropped everything including the walkietalkie shed sulk for days now never mind there was no time to worry about a teenage girls bruised ego he had more important matters to tend to artemis depressed the master switch on the computerized surveillance system his only chance of purging the loop was a complete reboot after several agonizing moments of screen snow the monitors jumped and settled things were not as they had seemed only seconds before there was a grotesque thing in the safe room it had apparently discovered the secret compartment not only that but it had managed to open the whisper lock amazing butler had it covered though he was sneaking up behind the creature and any moment now the intruder would find itself nose down in the carpet artemis switched his attention to holly the elf was back to bed banging slamming the frame down over and over again as though she could it hit artemis then like a blast from a water cannon if holly had somehow smuggled an acorn in here then one square centimetre of ground would be enough if juliet left that door open juliet he shouted into the walkietalkie juliet dont go in there but it was useless the girls walkietalkie lay buzzing on the kitchen floor and artemis could only watch helplessly as butlers sister strode towards the cell door muttering about carrots the safe room exclaimed butler quickening his pace his instinct was to go in all guns blazing but training took over fairy hardware was most definitely superior to his own and who knew how many barrels were aimed at the other side of that door right now no caution was most definitely the best part of valour in this particular situation he placed a palm against the wood feeling for vibration nothing no machinery then butler curled his fingers around the knob twisting gently with his other hand he drew a sig sauer automatic from his shoulder holster no time to fetch the dart rifle it would have to be shoot to kill the door swung open noiselessly as butler knew it would having oiled every hinge in the house himself before him waswell to be honest butler wasnt quite sure what it was if he didnt know better that is at first glance he could have sworn that the thing resembled nothing more than an enormous quivering and then the thing exploded jettisoning an amazing amount of tunnel waste directly at the unfortunate manservant it was like being battered with a hundred sledgehammers simultaneously butler was lifted bodily and flung against the wall and as he lay there consciousness slipping away from him he prayed that master artemis hadnt managed to capture the moment on video holly was weakening the bedframe was nearly twice her body weight and the ridges were tearing cruel welts in her palms but she couldnt stop now not when she was so close she slammed the post into the concrete again a cloud of grey dust spiralled around her legs any second now fowl would tumble to her plan and shed get the hypodermic treatment again but until then she gritted her teeth against the pain heaving the bedframe to knee height then she saw it a sliver of brown among the grey could it be true pain forgotten captain short dropped the bed sinking quickly to her knees there was indeed a small patch of earth poking through the cement holly fumbled the acorn from her boot clasping it tightly in bloody fingers i return you to the earth she whispered worming her fist into the tiny space and claim the gift that is my right nothing happened for a heartbeat perhaps two then holly felt the magic rush up her arm like a jolt from an electrified troll fence the shock sent her spinning across the room for a moment the world swirled in a disconcerting kaleidoscope of colour but when it settled holly was no longer the defeated elf she had been right master fowl she grinned watching the blue sparks of fairy magic seal her wounds lets see what i have to do to get your permission to leave this place drop everything sulked juliet drop everything and check the prisoner she flicked blonde tresses expertly over a shoulder he must think im his maid or something she hammered on the cell door with the flat of her hand im coming in now fairy girl so if youre doing anything embarrassing please stop juliet punched the combination into the keypad and no i dont have your vegetables or your washed fruit but its not my fault artemis insisted i come right down juliet stopped talking because there was nobody listening she was preaching to an empty room she waited for her brain to pass on an explanation nothing came eventually the notion to take another look filtered down she took a tentative step into the concrete cube nothing only a slight shimmering in the shadows like a mist it was probably these stupid glasses how were you supposed to see anything wearing mirrored sunglasses underground and they were so nineties they werent even retro yet juliet glanced guiltily at the monitor just a quick peek what harm could it do she whipped up the frames sending her eyeballs spinning around the room in that instant a figure materialized before her just stepped out of the air it was holly she was smiling oh its you how did you the fairy interrupted with a wave of her hand why dont you take off those glasses juliet they really dont suit you shes right thought juliet and what a lovely voice like a choir all on its own how could you argue with a voice like that sure caveman glasses off cool voice by the way doh ray me and all that holly decided not to try deciphering juliets comments it was hard enough when the girl was in full control of her brain now a simple question no problem what a great idea how many people in the house juliet thought one and one and one and another one no mrs fowl wasnt there three she said finally me and butler and of course artemis mrs fowl was here but she went byebye then she went byebye juliet giggled shed made a joke a good one too holly drew a breath to ask for clarification then thought better of it a mistake as it turned out has anyone else been here anyone like me juliet chewed her lip there was one little man in a uniform like yours not cute though not one bit just shouted and smoked a smelly cigar terrible complexion red as a tomato holly almost smiled root had come himself no doubt the negotiations had been disastrous no one else not that i know of if you see that man again tell him to lay off the red meat hes just a coronary waiting to happen holly swallowed a grin juliet was the only human she knew who was probably more lucid under the mesmer ok ill tell him now juliet i want you to stay in my room and no matter what you hear dont come out juliet frowned this room its so boring no tv or anything cant i go up to the lounge no you have to stay here anyway theyve just installed a wall television cinema size wrestling twentyfour hours a day juliet almost fainted with pleasure she ran into the cell gasping as her imagination supplied the pictures holly shook her head well she thought at least one of us is happy mulch gave his rear end a shake to dislodge any clumps of earth if only his mother could see him now spraying mud on the mud people that was irony or something like it mulch had never been big on grammar in school that or poetry hed never seen the point down the mines there were only two phrases of any importance look gold and cave in everybody out no hidden meanings there or rhymes the dwarf buttoned his bumflap which had been blasted open by the gale emanating from his nether regions time to make a run for it whatever hope hed had of escaping undiscovered had been blown literally mulch retrieved his earpiece screwing it firmly into his ear well you never knew even the lep might prove useful and when i get my hands on you convict youll wish you stayed down those mines mulch sighed ah well nothing new there then clasping the safes treasure tightly in his fist the dwarf turned to retrace his steps to his utter amazement there was a human entangled in the banisters mulch was not one bit surprised that his recyclings had managed to hurl the elephantine mud man several metres through the air dwarf gas had been known to cause avalanches in the alps what did surprise him was the fact that the man had managed to get so close to him in the first place youre good said mulch wagging a finger at the unconscious bodyguard but nobody takes a body blow from mulch diggums and stays on their feet the mud man stirred the whites of his eyes showing beneath fluttering lids roots voice crackled in the dwarfs ears get a move on mulch diggums before that mud man gets up and rearranges your innards he took out an entire retrieval team you know mulch swallowed his bravado suddenly deserting him an entire retrieval team maybe i should get back undergroundfor the good of the mission skipping hurriedly around the groaning bodyguard mulch took the steps two at a time no point in worrying about creaking stairs when youve just sent the intestinal equivalent of hurricane hal scurrying around the corridors hed almost reached the cellar door when a figure shimmered into focus before him mulch recognized it as his arresting officer from the renaissance masters smuggling case captain short mulch i wasnt expecting to see you the dwarf shrugged julius had a dirty job someone had to do it i get it said holly nodding youve already lost your magic smart what did you find out mulch showed holly his find this was in his safe a copy of the book gasped holly no wonder were in this fix we were playing into his hands all along mulch opened the cellar door shall we i cant im under eyeball orders not to leave the house you magical types and your rituals you have no idea how liberating it is to be rid of all that mumbojumbo a series of sharp noises drifted down from the upper landing it sounded like a troll thrashing around in a crystal emporium we can debate ethics at a later date right now i suggest we make ourselves scarce mulch nodded agreed this guy took out an entire retrieval squad apparently holly paused half shielded an entire squad hmm fully equipped i wonder she continued her fadeout and the last thing to go was her widening grin mulch was tempted to hang around there werent many things more fun to watch than a heavily armed recon officer going to town on a bunch of unsuspecting humans by the time captain short got through with this fowl character hed be begging her to get out of his manor the fowl character in question was watching it all from the surveillance room there was no denying it things were not good not good at all but certainly not irredeemable there was still hope artemis catalogued the events of the last few minutes the manors security had been compromised the safe room was in a shambles blown apart by some sort of fairy flatulence butler lay unconscious possibly paralysed by the same gaseous anomaly his hostage was loose in the house her fairy powers restored to her there was an unsightly creature in leather chaps burrowing holes beneath the foundations with no apparent regard for the fairy commandments and the people had retrieved a copy of the book one of several copies as it happened including one on disk in a swiss vault artemiss finger combed an errant strand of dark hair he would have to dig very deep to uncover the good in this particular scenario he took several deep breaths finding his chi as butler had taught him after several moments contemplation he realized that these factors meant little to the overall strategies of both sides captain short was still trapped in the manor and the timestoppage period was running out soon the lep would have no option but to launch their biobomb and that was when artemis fowl would unveil his coup de grace of course the whole thing depended on commander root if root was as intellectually challenged as he looked it was quite possible the entire scheme would collapse around his ears artemis hoped fervently that someone on the fairy team had the wit to spot the blunder hed made during the negotiation session mulch unbuttoned his bumflap time to suck some dirt as they said down the mines the trouble with dwarf tunnels was that they were selfsealing so that if you had to go back the way you came there was a whole new burrow to be excavated some dwarfs retraced their steps exactly chewing through the less compact and predigested dirt mulch preferred to dig a fresh tunnel for some reason eating the same dirt twice didnt appeal to him unhinging his jaw the dwarf pointed himself torpedolike through the hole in the floorboards his heart calmed immediately as the scent of minerals filled his nostrils safe he was safe nothing could catch a dwarf underground not even a skaylian rock worm that was of course if he managed to get underground ten very powerful fingers gripped mulch by the ankles this just wasnt the dwarfs day first wartface now this homicidal human some people never learn usually mud people egg go he mumbled unhinged jaw flapping uselessly not a chance came the reply the only way youre leaving this house is in a body bag mulch could feel himself being dragged backwards this human was strong there werent many creatures that could dislodge a dwarf with a grip on something he scrabbled in the dirt cramming handfuls of wineimpregnated clay into his cavernous mouth there was only one chance come on you little goblin out of there goblin mulch would have been indignant had he not been busy chewing clay to eject at his enemy the human stopped talking possibly he had noticed the bumflap and probably the bum no doubt what had happened in the safe room was coming back to him oh what would have followed the oh is anyones guess but id be willing to bet that it wouldnt have been dearie me as it happened butler never had time to finish his expletive because he wisely chose that moment to relinquish his grip a wise choice indeed because it coincided with the instant mulch decided to launch his earthen offensive a lump of compacted clay sped like a cannonball directly at the spot where butlers head had been barely a second previously had it still occupied that space the impact would have separated it from butlers shoulders an ignoble end for a bodyguard of his calibre as it was the soggy missile barely grazed his ear nevertheless the force was sufficient to spin butler like an ice skater landing him on his rump for the second time in as many minutes by the time his vision had settled the dwarf had disappeared into a maelstrom of churning muck butler decided not to attempt pursuit dying below ground was not very high on his things to do list but there will be another day fairy he thought grimly and there was to be but thats another story mulchs momentum propelled him underground hed gone several metres along the loamy vein before he realized no one was following once the taste of earth had settled his heart rate he decided it was time to implement his escape plan the dwarf altered his course chewing his way towards the rabbit warren hed noted earlier with any luck the centaur hadnt run a seismology test on the manor grounds or his ruse might be discovered hed just have to bank on the fact that they had more important things to worry about than a missing prisoner there shouldnt be any problem deceiving julius but the centaur he was a smart one mulchs internal compass steered him true and within minutes he could feel the gentle vibrations of the rabbits loping along their tunnels from here on timing was crucial if the illusion was to be effective he slowed his digging rate poking the soft clay gently until his fingers breached the tunnel wall mulch was careful to look the other way because whatever he saw would be showing up on the viewscreen back in lep hq laying his fingers on the tunnel floor like an upturned spider mulch waited it didnt take long in seconds he felt the rhythmic thump of an approaching rabbit the instant the animals hind legs brushed the trap he tightened his powerful digits around its neck the poor animal never had a chance sorry friend thought the dwarf if there was any other waypulling the rabbits body through the hole mulch rehinged his jaw and began screaming cave in cave in help help now for the tricky bit with one hand he agitated the surrounding earth bringing showers of it crumbling around his own head with the other hand he popped the iriscam out of his left eye and slid it into the rabbits given the almost total darkness and the landfall confusion it should be almost impossible to spot the switch julius please help me mulch whats happening whats your status whats my status thought the dwarf incredulously even in times of supposed crisis the commander couldnt abandon his precious protocol iargh the dwarf dragged his final scream out petering off to a gargling rattle a bit melodramatic perhaps but mulch never could resist theatrics with a last regretful glance at the dying animal he unhinged his jaw and finned off to the southeast freedom beckoned chapter troll root leaned forward roaring into the microphone mulch whats happening whats your status foaly was tapping a keyboard furiously weve lost audio motion too mulch talk to me dammit im running a scan on his vitals woah what what is it his heart has gone crazy beating like a rabbit a rabbit no wait its what breathed the commander terribly afraid that he already knew foaly leaned back in his chair its stopped his heartbeat has stopped are you sure the monitors dont lie all vitals can be read through the iriscam not a peep hes gone root couldnt believe it mulch diggums one of lifes constants gone it couldnt be true he did it too you know foaly recovered a copy of the book no less and he confirmed short was alive foalys wide brow creased for an instant its just that what said root suspicion aroused well for a moment there just before the end his heart rate seemed abnormally fast maybe it was a malfunction the centaur was unconvinced i doubt it my bugs dont have bugs what other explanation could there be you still have visuals dont you yep through dead eyes no doubt about it not a spark of electricity in that brain the camera is running on its own battery well thats it then no other explanation foaly nodded it would seem that way unless no its too fantastic this is mulch diggums were talking about here nothing is too fantastic foaly opened his mouth to voice his incredible theory but before he could speak the shuttles bay door slid open we have him said a triumphant voice yes agreed a second fowl has made a mistake root swivelled on his chair it was argon and cumulus the socalled behavioural analysts oh weve finally decided to earn our retainers have we but the professors were not so easily intimidated united by excitement cumulus even had the temerity to wave roots sarcasm aside this more than anything else made the commander sit up and take notice argon brushed past foaly pressing a laser disk into the consoles player artemis fowls face appeared as seen through roots iriscam well be in touch said the commanders recorded voice dont worry ill see myself out fowls face disappeared momentarily as he rose from his chair root lifted his gaze in time for the next chilling statement you do that but remember this none of your race has permission to enter here while im alive argon pressed the pause button triumphantly there you see roots complexion lost any final traces of pallor there there what what do i see cumulus tutted as one would at a slow child a mistake in retrospect the commander had him by the pointy beard in under a second now he said his voice deceptively calm pretend were pushed for time here and just explain it to me without any attitude or comments the human said we couldnt enter while he was alive squeaked cumulus so argon took up the account so if we cant go in while hes alive root drew a sharp breath then we go in when hes dead cumulus and argon beamed exactly they said in perfect unison root scratched his chin i dont know were on shaky ground here legally not at all argued cumulus its elementary grammar the human specifically stated that entry was forbidden as long as he was alive thats tantamount to an invitation when hes dead the commander wasnt convinced the invitation is implied at best no interrupted foaly theyre right its a strong case once fowl is dead the door is wide open he said it himself maybe maybe nothing blurted foaly for heavens sake julius how much more do you need we have a crisis here in case you hadnt noticed root nodded slowly one youre right two im going to run with it three well done you two and four if you ever call me julius again foaly youll be eating your own hooves now get me a line to the council i need to get approval for that gold right away commander root your worship foaly grinned letting the hoofeating comment slide for hollys sake so we send in the gold muttered root thinking aloud they send out holly we bluerinse the place and stroll in to reclaim the ransom simple so simple its brilliant enthused argon quite a coup for our profession wouldnt you say doctor cumulus cumuluss head was spinning with possibilities lecture tours book deals why the movie rights alone will be worth a fortune let those sociologists stuff this in their collective pipe puts the kibosh on the deprivationbreedsantisocialbehaviour chestnut this fowl character has never gone hungry in his life theres more than one kind of hunger noted argon very true hunger to succeed hunger to dominate hunger to root snapped get out get out before i strangle the pair of you and if i ever hear a word of this repeated on an afternoon talk show ill know where it came from the consultants retreated warily resolving not to call their agents until they were out of earshot i dont know if the council will go for this admitted root when theyd departed its a lot of gold foaly looked up from the console how much exactly the commander slid a piece of paper across the console that much that is a lot foaly whistled a tonne small unmarked ingots twentyfour carat only well at least its a nice round weight very comforting ill be sure to mention that to the council have you got that line yet the centaur grunted a negative grunt very cheeky really grunting at a superior officer root didnt have the energy to discipline him but he made a mental note when this is over dock foalys pay for a few decades he rubbed his eyes exhaustedly time lag was beginning to set in even though his brain wouldnt let him sleep because hed been awake when the timestop was initiated his body was crying out for rest he rose from the chair swinging the door wide to let in some air stale timestop air not even molecules could escape the timefield much less a human boy there was activity by the portal lots of it a swarm of troops gathered around a hovercage gudgeon stood at the head of the procession and the entire bunch was heading his way root stepped down to meet them whats this he inquired none too pleasantly a circus gudgeons face was pale but determined no julius its the end of the circus root nodded i see and these are the clowns foalys head poked through the doorway pardon me for interrupting your extended circus metaphor but what the hell is that yes lieutenant said root nodding at the floating hovercage what the hell is that gudgeon bolstered his courage with a few deep breaths ive taken a leaf from your book julius is that a fact yes it is you opted to send in a lapsed creature so now im going to root smiled dangerously you dont opt to do anything lieutenant not without my say so gudgeon took an unconscious step backwards ive been to the council julius i have their full backing the commander turned to foaly is this true apparently it just came through on the outside line this is gudgeons party now he told the council about the ransom demand and you springing mister diggums you know what the elders are like when it comes to parting with gold root folded his arms people told me about you gudgeon they said youd stab me in the back i didnt believe them i was a fool this is not about us julius its about the mission whats inside this cage is our best chance of success so whats in the cage no dont tell me the only other nonmagical creature in the lower elements and the first troll weve managed to take alive in over a century exactly the perfect creature to flush out our adversary roots cheeks glowed with the effort of restraining his anger i dont believe youre even considering this face it julius its the same basic idea as yours no it isnt mulch diggums made his own choices he knew the risks diggums is dead root rubbed his eyes again yes it would seem so a cavein that just proves im right a troll wont be so easily dispatched its a dumb animal for heavens sake how can a troll follow instructions gudgeon smiled newborn confidence peeping through his apprehension what instructions we just point it at the house and get out of the way i guarantee you those humans will be begging us to come in and rescue them and what about my officer well have the troll back under lock and key long before captain short is in any danger you can guarantee that can you gudgeon paused thats a chance im willing the council is willing to take politics spat root this is all politics to you gudgeon a nice feather in your cap on the way to a council seat you make me sick be that as it may we are proceeding with this strategy the council have appointed me acting commander so if you cant put our personal history aside get the hell out of my way root stepped aside dont worry commander i dont want anything to do with this butchery the credit is all yours gudgeon put on his best sincere face julius despite what you think i have only the interests of the people at heart one person in particular snorted root gudgeon decided to go for the high moral ground i dont have to stand here listening to this every second talking to you is a second wasted root looked him straight in the eye thats about six hundred years wasted altogether eh friend gudgeon didnt answer what could he say ambition had a price and that price was friendship gudgeon turned to his squad a group of handpicked sprites loyal only to him get the hovercage over to the avenue we dont greenlight until i give the word he brushed past root eyes looking anywhere except at his erstwhile friend foaly wouldnt let him go without a comment hey gudgeon the acting commander couldnt tolerate that tone not on his first day you watch your mouth foaly no one is indispensable the centaur chuckled very true thats the thing about politics you get one shot gudgeon was semiinterested in spite of himself i know if it was me continued foaly and i had one chance just one chance to book my behind a seat on that council i certainly wouldnt entrust my future to a troll and suddenly gudgeons newfound confidence evaporated replaced by a shiny pallor he wiped his brow hurrying after the departing hovercage see you tomorrow foaly called after him youll be taking out my trash root laughed possibly the first time one of foalys comments had amused him good man foaly he grinned hit that backstabber where it hurts right in the ambition thanks julius the grin disappeared faster than a deepfried pit slug in the lep canteen ive warned you about the julius thing foaly now get that outside line open again i want that gold ready when gudgeons plan goes awry lobby all my supporters on the council im pretty sure lopes one of mine and cahartez possibly vinyaya shes always had a thing for me devilishly attractive as i am youre joking of course i never joke said root and he said it with a straight face holly had a plan of sorts sneak around shielded reclaim some fairy weaponry then cause havoc until fowl was forced to release her and if several million irish pounds worth of property damage happened to ensue well that was just a bonus holly hadnt felt so good in years her eyes blazed with power and there were sparks sizzling below every centimetre of skin she had forgotten just how good running hot felt captain short felt in control now on the hunt this was what she was trained to do when this affair had started the advantage had been with the mud people but now the boot was on the other foot she was the hunter and they were the prey holly scaled the great staircase ever vigilant for the giant manservant that was one individual she wasnt taking any chances with if those fingers closed around her skull she was history helmet or not assuming she managed to find a helmet the vast house was like a mausoleum without a single sign of life inside its vaulted rooms spooky portraits though each one with fowl eyes suspicious and glittering holly determined to torch the lot of them when she recovered her neutrino vindictive perhaps but totally justified considering what artemis fowl had put her through she scaled the steps swiftly following the curve around to the upper landing a slot of pale light peeped from under the last door on the corridor holly placed her palm against the wood feeling for vibration activity all right shouting and footsteps thundering this way holly jumped back flattening herself against the velveteen wallpaper not a moment too soon a hulking shape burst through the doorway and hurtled down the corridor leaving a maelstrom of air currents in his wake juliet he shouted his sisters name hanging in the air long after he had disappeared down the stairs dont worry butler thought holly shes having the time of her life glued to wrestlemania but the open door presented a welcome opportunity she slipped through before the mechanical arm could close it again artemis fowl was waiting antishield filters cobbled on to his sunglasses good evening captain short he began confidence apparently intact at the risk of sounding clichйd ive been expecting you holly didnt respond didnt even look her jailer in the eye instead she utilized her training to scan the room her gaze resting briefly on each surface you are of course still bound by the promises made earlier tonight but holly wasnt listening she was sprinting towards a stainlesssteel workbench bolted to the far wall so basically our situation hasnt changed you are still my hostage yeah yeah yeah muttered holly running her fingers over the rows of confiscated retrieval equipment she selected a stealthcoated helmet slipping it over her pointed ears the pneumatic pads pumped to cradle her crown she was safe now any further commands given by fowl meant nothing through the reflective visor a wire mike slotted down automatically contact was immediate on revolving frequencies broadcasting on revolving frequencies holly if you can hear me take cover holly recognized foalys voice something familiar in a crazy situation repeattake cover gudgeon is sending in a something i should know said artemis quiet hissed holly worried by the tone of foalys usually flippant voice i say again they are sending in a troll to secure your release holly started gudgeon was calling the shots now not good news at all fowl interrupted again its not polite you know ignoring your host holly snarled enough is enough she pulled back her fist fingers curled in a tight bunch artemis didnt flinch why would he butler always intervened before punches landed but then something caught his eye a large figure running down the stairway on the firstfloor monitor it was butler thats right rich boy said holly nastily youre on your own this time and before artemiss eyes had time to widen holly put an extra few kilos of spring in her elbow and whacked her abductor right on the nose oof he said collapsing on to his rear end oh yes that felt good holly focused on the voice buzzing in her ear weve been feeding a loop to the outside cameras so the humans wont see anything come up the avenue but its on the way trust me foaly foaly come in holly is that you the one and only foaly there is no loop i can see everything thats going on around here the cunning little he must have rebooted the system the avenue was a hive of fairy activity gudgeon was there haughtily directing his team of sprites and in the centre of the melee stood a fivemetretall hovercage floating on a cushion of air the cage was directly before the manor door and the techies were securing a concussor seal to the surrounding wall when activated several alloy rods in the seals collar would be detonated simultaneously effectively disintegrating the door when the dust settled the troll would have only one place to go into the manor holly checked the other monitors butler had managed to drag juliet from the cell they had ascended from the cellar level and were just crossing the lobby right in the line of fire darvit she swore crossing to the work surface artemis was propped on his elbows you hit me he said in disbelief holly strapped on a set of hummingbirds thats right fowl and theres plenty more where that came from so stay right where you are if you know whats good for you for once in his life artemis realized that he didnt have a snappy answer he opened his mouth waiting for his brain to supply the customary pithy comeback but nothing arrived holly slipped the neutrino into its holster thats right mud boy playtimes over time for the professionals to take over if youre a good boy ill buy you a lolly when i come back and when holly was long gone soaring beneath the hallways ancient oak beams artemis said i dont like lollipops it was a woefully inadequate response and artemis was instantly appalled with himself pathetic really i dont like lollipops no selfrespecting criminal mastermind would be caught dead even using the word lollipops he really would have to put together a database of witty responses for occasions such as this it was quite possible that artemis would have sat like that for some time totally detached from the situation at hand had not the front door imploded shaking the manor to its foundations a thing like that is enough to knock the daydreams from anyones head a sprite alighted before acting commander gudgeon the collar is in place sir gudgeon nodded are you sure its tight captain i dont want that troll coming out the wrong way tighter n a goblins wallet theres not a bubble of air getting through that seal tighter n a stinkworms very well captain interrupted gudgeon hurriedly before the sprite could complete his graphic analogy beside them the hovercage shook violently almost toppling the container from its air cushion we better blow that sucker commander if we dont let him outta there soon my boysre gonna spend the next week scraping fine captain fine blow it blow it for goodness sake gudgeon hurried behind the blast shield scribbling a note on his palmtops lcd screen memo remind the sprites to watch their language after all i am a commander now the foulmouthed captain in question turned to the hovercages cab driver blow er chix blow the door off its damn hinges yessir off its damn hinges thats a roger gudgeon winced thered be a general meeting tomorrow first thing by then hed have the commanders icon on his lapel even a sprite might be less likely to curse with the triple acorn logo winking in his face chix pulled down his shrapnel goggles even though the cab had a quartz windscreen the goggles were cool girls loved them or so the driver thought in his minds eye he saw himself as a grimfaced daredevil sprites were like that give a fairy a pair of wings and he thinks hes gods gift to women but chix verbils illfated quest to impress the dames is once again another story in this particular tale he serves only one purpose and that is to melodramatically push the detonate button which he does with great aplomb two dozen controlled charges detonated in their chambers driving two dozen alloy cylinders out of their mounts at over a thousand miles per hour upon impact each bar pulverized the contact area plus the surrounding fifteen centimetres effectively blowing the door off its damn hinges as the captain would say when the dust settled the handlers winched back the containment wall inside the cage and began hammering the side panels with the flats of their hands gudgeon peeped out from behind the blast shield all clear captain just a damn second commander chix howre we doin chix checked the cabs monitor hes movin the hammerin is spookin him the claws are comin out my hes a big sucker i wouldnt wanna be that recon babe if she gets in the way of this gudgeon felt a momentary pang of guilt which he dispelled with his favourite daydream a vision of himself sinking into a beigevelour council seat the cage heaved violently almost dislodging chix from his seat he held on like a rodeo rider woah hes on the move lock and load boys i have a feeling that any second were going to be gettin a cry for help gudgeon didnt bother locking and loading he preferred to leave that sort of thing to the foot soldiers the acting commander considered himself too important to be risked in an insecure situation for the good of the people in general it was better he remain outside the op zone butler took the stairs four at a time it was possibly the first time he had ever abandoned master artemis in a crisis but juliet was family and there was obviously something seriously wrong with his baby sister that fairy had said something to her and now she was just sitting in the cell giggling butler feared the worst if anything were to happen to juliet he didnt know how hed live with himself he felt a dribble of sweat slide down the crown of his shaven head this whole situation was shooting off in bizarre directions fairies magic and now a hostage loose in the manor how could he be expected to control things it took a fourman team to guard the lowliest politician but he was expected to contain this impossible situation on his own butler sprinted down the corridor into what had until recently been captain shorts cell juliet was sprawled on the cot enraptured by a concrete wall what are you doing he gasped drawing the sig sauer ninemillimetre with practised ease his sister barely spared him a glance quiet you big ape louie the love machine is on he aint so tough i could take him butler blinked she was talking gibberish obviously drugged lets go artemis wants us upstairs in the situations room juliet pointed a manicured finger at the wall artemis can wait this is for the intercontinental title and its a grudge match louie ate the hogmans pet piggie the manservant studied the wall it was definitely blank he didnt have time for this right lets go he growled slinging his sister over a broad shoulder nooo you big bully she protested hammering his back with tiny fists not now hogman hogmaaaan butler ignored the objections settling into a loping run who the hell was this hogman person one of her boyfriends no doubt he was going to keep closer tabs on callers to the lodge in future butler pick up it was artemis on the handheld butler jiggled his sister up a foot so he could reach his belt lollipops barked his employer say again i thought you said eh i mean get out of there take cover take cover take cover the military term didnt sound right coming out of master artemiss mouth like a diamond ring in a lucky bag take cover yes butler cover i thought speaking in primal terms would be the quickest route to your cognitive functions obviously i was mistaken that was more like it butler scanned the hall for a nook to duck into not much choice the only shelter was provided by the suits of medieval armour punctuating the walls the manservant ducked into the alcove behind a fourteenthcentury knight complete with lance and mace juliet tapped the breastplate you think youre mean i could take you with one hand quiet hissed butler he held his breath and listened something was approaching the main door something big butler leaned out far enough to get one eye on the lobby then you could say that the doorway exploded but that particular verb doesnt do the action justice rather it shattered into infinitesimal pieces butler had seen something like this once before when a forceseven earthquake had rippled through a colombian drug lords estate seconds before he had been scheduled to blow it up this was slightly different more localized very professional it was classic antiterrorist tactics hit em with smoke and sonics then go in while the targets were disoriented whatever was coming it would be bad he was certain of it he was absolutely right dust clouds settled slowly depositing a pale sheet on the tunisian rug madam fowl would have been furious if she ever put so much as a toe outside the attic door butlers instincts told him to move zigzag across the ground floor make for the higher ground stay low to minimize the target this would be the perfect time to do it before visibility cleared any second now a hail of bullets would be whistling through the archway and the last place he wanted to be was pinned down on a lower level and on any other day butler would have moved he wouldve been halfway up that stairway before his brain had time for second thoughts but today he had his baby sister over his shoulder spouting gibberish and the last thing he wanted to do was expose her to murderous assault fire with juliet in the state she was in shed probably challenge the fairy commandos to a tagwrestling match and though his sister talked tough she was just a kid really no match for trained military personnel so butler hunkered down propped juliet against a tapestry behind a suit of armour and checked his safety catch off good come and get me fairy boys something moved in the dust haze it was immediately obvious to butler that the something wasnt human the manservant had been on too many safaris not to recognize an animal when he saw it he studied the creatures gait possibly simian similar upperbody structure to an ape but bigger than any primate butler had ever seen if it was an ape then his handgun wasnt going to be of much use you could put five rounds in the skull of a bull ape and hed still have time to eat you before his brain realized he was dead but it wasnt an ape apes didnt have night eyes this creature did glowing crimson pupils halfhidden behind shaggy forelocks tusks too but not elephantine these were curved with serrated edges gutting weapons butler felt a tingle low in his stomach hed had the feeling once before on his first day at the swiss academy it was fear the creature stepped clear of the dust haze butler gasped again his first since the academy this was like no adversary hed ever faced before the manservant realized instantly what the fairies had done they had sent in a primal hunter a creature with no interest in magic or rules a thing that would simply kill anything in its way regardless of species this was the perfect predator that much was clear from the meatripping points on its teeth from the dried gore crusted beneath its claws and from the distilled hatred spilling from its eyes the troll shambled forwards squinting through the chandelier light yellowed claws scraped along the marble tiling throwing up sparks in their wake it was sniffing now snorting curious breaths head cocked to one side butler had seen that pose before on the snouts of starved pit bulls just before their russian handlers set them loose on a bear hunt the shaggy head froze its snout pointed directly at butlers hiding place it was no coincidence the manservant peeked out between the chainmail fingers of a gauntlet now came the stalk once a scent had been acquired the predator would attempt a slow silent approach before the lightning strike but apparently the troll had not read the predators handbook because it didnt bother with the stealth approach jumping directly to the lightning strike moving faster than butler would have believed possible the troll sprang across the lobby brushing the medieval armour aside as though it were a shop mannequin juliet blinked ooh she gasped its bigfoot bob canadian champion nineteen ninetyeight i thought you were in the andes looking for your relatives butler didnt bother to correct her his sister wasnt lucid at least she would die happy while his brain was contemplating this morbid observation butlers gun hand was coming up he squeezed the trigger as rapidly as the sig sauers mechanism would allow two in the chest three between the eyes that was the plan he got the chest shots in but the troll interfered before butler could complete the formation the interference took the form of scything tusks that ducked below butlers guard they coiled around his trunk slicing through his kevlar reinforced jacket like a razor through rice paper butler felt a cold pain as the serrated ivory pierced his chest he knew immediately that the wound was fatal his breath came hard that was a lung gone and gouts of blood were matting the trolls fur his blood no one could lose that amount and live nevertheless the pain was instantly replaced by a curious euphoria some form of natural anaesthetic injected through channels in the beasts tusks more dangerous than the deadliest poison in minutes butler would not only stop struggling but go giggling to his grave the manservant fought against the narcotics in his system struggling furiously in the trolls grip but it was no use his fight was over almost before it had begun the troll grunted flipping the limp human body over his head butlers burly frame collided with the wall at a speed human bones were never meant to withstand the bricks cracked from floor to ceiling butlers spine went too now even if the blood loss didnt get him paralysis would juliet was still enthralled by the mesmer come on brother get off the canvas we all know youre faking the troll paused some basic curiosity piqued by the lack of fear he would have suspected a trick if he could have formulated such a complicated thought but in the end appetite won out this creature smelled flesh fresh and tender flesh from above ground was different laced with surface smells once youve had openair meat its hard to go back the troll ran a tongue over his incisors and reached out a shaggy hand holly tucked the hummingbirds close to her torso dropping into a controlled dive she skimmed the banisters emerging into the portico below a stainedglass dome the timestop light filtered unnaturally splitting into thick azure shafts light thought holly the helmet highbeams worked before there was no reason why they wouldnt work again it was too late for the male he was a bag of broken bones but the female she still had a few seconds left before the troll split her open holly spiralled down through the faux light searching her helmet console for the sonix button sonix were generally used on canines but in this case it might provide a moments distraction enough to get her to ground level the troll was reaching in towards juliet underhand it was a move generally reserved for the defenceless the claws would curl in below the ribs rupturing the heart minimum damage to the flesh and no lastminute tension to toughen the meat holly activated her sonix and nothing happened not good generally your average troll would be at the very least irritated by the ultrahighfrequency tone but this particular beast didnt even shake his shaggy head there were a couple of possibilities one the helmet was malfunctioning two this troll was deaf as the proverbial post unfortunately holly had no way of knowing as the tones were inaudible to fairy ears whatever the problem it forced holly to adopt a strategy she would rather not have resorted to direct contact all to save a humans life shed gone section eight without a doubt holly jerked the throttle straight from fourth to reverse not very good for the gears shed get a dressingdown from the mechanics for that in the unlikely event she actually survived this neverending nightmare the effect of this gearcrunching was to flip her around in midair so that her boot heels were pointed directly at the trolls head holly winced two entanglements with the same troll unbelievable her heels caught the beast square on the crown of its head at that speed there was at least half a tonne of gforce behind the contact only the reinforced ribbing in her suit prevented hollys leg bones from shattering even so she heard her knee pop the pain clawed its way to her forehead ruined her recovery manoeuvre too instead of repelling herself to a safe altitude holly crumpled on to the trolls back becoming instantly entangled in the ropy fur the troll was suitably annoyed not only had something distracted it from dinner but now that something was nestled in its fur along with the cleaner slugs the beast straightened reaching a clawed hand over its own shoulder the curved nails raked hollys helmet scoring parallel grooves in the alloy juliet was safe for the moment but holly had taken her place on the endangeredindividuals list the troll squeezed tighter somehow securing a grip on the helmets antifriction coating which according to foaly was impossible to grip serious words would be had if not in this life then definitely the next captain short found herself being hoisted aloft to face her old enemy holly struggled to concentrate through the pain and confusion her leg was swinging like a pendulum and the trolls breath was breaking over her face in rancid waves there had been a plan hadnt there surely she didnt fly down here just to curl up and die there must have been a strategy all those years in the academy must have taught her something whatever her plan had been it floated just out of reach somewhere between pain and shock out of reach the lights holly a voice in her head probably talking to herself an outofhead experience ha ha she must remember to tell foaly about this foaly hit the lights holly if those tusks get to work youll be dead before the magic can kick in foaly is that you holly may have said this aloud or she may just have thought it she wasnt sure the tunnel high beams captain a different voice not so cuddly hit the button now thats an order oops it was root she was falling down on the job again first hamburg then martina franca now this yessir she mumbled trying to sound professional press it now captain short holly looked the troll straight in its merciless eyes and pressed the button very melodramatic or it would have been if the lights had worked unfortunately for holly in her haste shed grabbed one of the helmets cannibalized by artemis fowl hence no sonix no filters and no tunnel beams the halogen bulbs were still installed but the wires had come loose during artemiss investigations oh dear breathed holly oh dear barked root whats that supposed to mean the beams are offline explained foaly oh roots voice trailed off what more was there to say holly squinted at the troll if you didnt know trolls were dumb animals youd swear the beast was grinning standing there with blood dripping from various chest wounds grinning captain short didnt like being grinned at laugh this off she said and butted the troll with the only weapon available to her her helmeted head valiant undoubtedly but about as effective as trying to cut down a tree with a feather luckily the illadvised blow had a side effect for a split second two strands of conductor filament connected sending power flooding to one of the tunnel beams fourhundred watts of white light blasted through the trolls crimson eyes dispatching lightning rods of agony to the brain heh heh mumbled holly in the second before the troll convulsed involuntarily its spasms sent her spinning across the parquet floor leg jittering along behind her the wall was approaching at an alarming speed maybe thought holly hopefully this will be one of those impacts where you dont feel any pain until later no replied her pessimistic side afraid not she slammed into a norman narrative tapestry bringing it tumbling down on top of her pain was immediate and overwhelming ooof grunted foaly i felt that visuals are shot pain sensors went right off the scale your lungs are busted captain were going to lose you for a while but dont worry holly your magic should be kicking in already holly felt the blue tingle of magic scurrying to her various injuries thank the gods for acorns but it was too little too late the pain was way beyond her threshold just before unconsciousness claimed her hollys hand flopped from beneath the tapestry it landed on butlers arm touching the bare skin amazingly the human wasnt dead a dogged pulse forced the blood through smashed limbs heal thought holly and the magic scurried down her fingers the troll faced a dilemma which female to eat first choices choices this decision was not made any easier by the lingering agony buzzing around its shaggy head or the cluster of bullets lodged in the fatty chest tissue eventually it settled on the surface dweller soft human meat no dense fairy muscle to chew through the beast squatted low tilting the girls chin with one yellowed talon a pulsing jugular looped lazily down the length of her neck the heart or the neck the troll wondered the neck it was closer it turned the talon sideways so that the edge pressed against soft human flesh one sharp swipe and the girls own heartbeat would drive the blood from her body butler woke up which was a surprise in itself he knew immediately that he was alive because of the searing pain permeating every cubic centimetre of his body this was not good alive he may have been but considering the fact that his neck had a oneeighty twist on it hed never so much as walk the dog again not to mention rescue his sister the manservant twiddled his fingers hurt like hell but at least there was movement it was amazing that he had any motor functions at all considering the trauma his spinal column had suffered his toes seemed all right too but that could have been phantom response given that he couldnt actually see them the bleeding from his chest wound appeared to have stopped and he was thinking straight all in all he was in much better shape than he had any right to be what in heavens name was going on here butler noticed something there were blue sparks dancing along his torso he must be hallucinating creating pleasant images to distract himself from the inevitable a very realistic hallucination it must be said the sparks congregated at trauma points sinking into the skin butler shuddered this was no hallucination something extraordinary was happening here magical magic that rang a bell in his recently reassembled cranium fairy magic something was healing his wounds he twisted his head wincing at the grate of sliding vertebrae there was a hand resting on his forearm sparks flowed from the slim elfin fingers intuitively targeting bruises breaks or ruptures there were a lot of injuries to be dealt with but the tiny sparks handled it all quickly and effectively like an army of mystical beavers repairing storm damage butler could actually feel his bones knitting and the blood retreating from semicongealed scabs his head twisted involuntarily as his vertebrae slid into their niches and strength returned in a rush as magic reproduced the three litres of blood lost through his chest wound butler jumped to his feet actually jumped he was himself again no it was more than that he was as strong as he had ever been strong enough to have another crack at that beast hunkered over his baby sister he felt his rejuvenated heart speed up like the stroke of an outboard motor calm butler told himself passion is the enemy of efficiency but calm or no the situation was desperate this beast had already effectively killed him once and this time round he didnt even have the sig sauer his own skills aside it would be nice to have a weapon something with a bit of weight to it his boot clin ked on a metallic object butler glanced down at the debris strewn in the trolls wake perfect there was nothing but snow on the viewscreen come on urged root hurry up foaly elbowed past his superior maybe if you didnt insist on blocking all the circuit boards root shuffled out of the way grudgingly in his mind it was the circuit boards fault for being behind him the centaurs head disappeared into an access panel anything nothing just interference root slapped the screen not a good idea first because there was not one chance in a million that it would actually help and second because plasma screens grow extremely hot after prolonged use darvit dont touch that screen by the way oh ha ha we have time for jokes now do we no actually anything the snow settled into recognizable shapes thats it hold it there weve got a signal ive activated the secondary camera plain old video im afraid but itll have to do root didnt comment he was watching the screen this must be a movie it couldnt be real life so whats going on in there anything interesting root tried to answer but his soldiers vocabulary just didnt have the superlatives what what is it the commander made an attempt its the human ive never oh forget it foalyyoure going to have to see this for yourself holly watched the entire episode through a gap in the tapestry folds if she hadnt seen it she wouldnt have believed it in fact it wasnt until shed reviewed the vt for her report that she was certain the whole thing wasnt a hallucination brought on by a neardeath experience as it was the video sequence became something of a legend initially doing the rounds on the amateur home movies cable shows and ending up on the lep academy handtohand curriculum the human butler was strapping on a medieval suit of armour incredible as it seemed he apparently intended going toe to toe with the troll holly tried to warn him tried to make some sound but the magic hadnt yet reinflated her crushed lungs butler closed his visor hefting a vicious mace now he grunted through the grille ill show you what happens when someone lays a hand on my sister the human twirled the mace as though it were a cheerleaders baton ramming it home between the trolls shoulder blades a blow like that while not fatal certainly distracted the troll from its intended victim butler planted his foot just above the creatures haunches and tugged the weapon free it relinquished its grip with a sickly sucking sound he skipped backwards settling into a defensive stance the troll rounded on him all ten talons sliding out to their full extent drops of venom glistened from the tip of each tusk playtime was over but there would be no lightning strike this time the beast was wary it had been hurt this latest attacker would be afforded the same respect as another male of the species as far as the troll was concerned his territory was being encroached on and there was only one way of solving a dispute of this nature the same way that trolls solved every dispute i must warn you said butler straightfaced i am armed and prepared to use deadly force if necessary holly would have groaned if she could banter the human was trying to engage a troll in macho repartee then captain short realized her mistake the words werent important it was the tone he employed calm soothing like a trainer with a spooked unicorn step away from the female easy now the troll ballooned its cheeks and howled scare tactics testing the waters butler didnt flinch yeah yeah real scary now just back out of the door and i wont have to cut you into little pieces the troll snorted miffed by this reaction generally his roar sent whatever creature was facing it scurrying down the tunnel one step at a time nice and slow easy there big fellow you could almost see it in the trolls eyes a flicker of uncertainty maybe this human was and that was when butler struck he danced under the tusks hammering home a devastating uppercut with his medieval weapon the troll staggered backwards talons flailing wildly but it was too late butler had stepped out of reach scooting across to the other side of the corridor the troll lumbered after him spitting dislodged teeth from pulped gums butler sank to his knees sliding and turning the polished floor bearing him like an ice skater he ducked and pirouetted facing his pursuer guess what i found he said raising the sig sauer no chest shots this time butler laid in the rest of the automatics clip in a tencentimetre diameter between the trolls eyes unfortunately for butler due to millennia spent butting each other trolls have developed a thick ridge of bone covering their brows so his textbook spread failed to penetrate the skull in spite of the tefloncoated load however ten devastator slugs cant be ignored by any creature on the planet and the troll was no exception the bullets beat a sledgehammer tattoo on its cranium causing instant concussion the animal staggered backwards slapping at its own forehead butler was after it in a heartbeat pinning one shaggy foot beneath the mace spikes the troll was concussed blinded by blood and lame a normal person would feel a shard of remorse but not butler hed seen too many men gored by injured animals now was the dangerous time it was no time for mercy it was time to terminate with extreme prejudice holly could only watch helplessly as the human took careful aim and delivered a series of crippling blows to the stricken creature first he took out the tendons bringing the troll to its knees then he abandoned the mace and went to work with gauntleted hands perhaps deadlier than the mace had been the unfortunate troll fought back pathetically even managing to land a few glancing blows but they failed to penetrate the antique armour meanwhile butler toiled like a surgeon working on the assumption that the troll and human physiques were basically the same he rained blow after blow on the dumb creature reducing it to a heap of quivering fur in so many seconds it was pitiful to watch and the manservant wasnt finished yet he stripped off the bloodied gauntlets loading a fresh clip into the handgun lets see how much bone you have under your chin no gasped holly with the first breath in her body dont butler ignored her jamming the barrel beneath the trolls jaw dont do ityou owe me butler paused juliet was alive it was true confused certainly but alive he thumbed the hammer on his pistol every brain cell in his head screamed for him to pull the trigger but juliet was alive you owe me human butler sighed hed regret this later very well captain the beast lives to fight another day lucky for him im in a good mood holly made a noise it was somewhere between a whimper and a chuckle now lets get rid of our hairy friend butler rolled the unconscious troll on to an armour trolley dragging it to the devastated doorway with a huge heave he jettisoned the lot into the suspended night and dont come back he shouted amazing said root tell me about it agreed foaly chapter ace in the hole artemis tried the doorknob and got a scorched palm for his trouble sealed the fairy must have blasted it with her weapon very astute one less variable in the equation it was exactly what he himself would have done artemis did not waste any time attempting to force open the door it was reinforced steel and he was twelve you didnt have to be a genius to figure it out even though he was instead the fowl heir apparent crossed to the monitor wall and followed developments from there he knew immediately what the lep were up to send in the troll to secure a cry for help interpret it as an invitation and next thing you know a brigade of goblin stormtroopers were taking the manor clever and unanticipated it was the second time hed underestimated his opponents one way or another there wouldnt be a third as the drama below unfolded on the monitors artemiss emotions jumped from terror to pride butler had done it defeated the troll and without a single plea for aid passing his lips watching the display artemis appreciated fully perhaps for the first time the service provided by the butler family artemis activated the triband radio broadcasting on revolving frequencies commander root you are monitoring all channels i presume for a few moments nothing but white noise emanated from the micro speakers then artemis heard the sharp click of a mike button i hear you human what can i do for you is that the commander a noise filtered through the black gauze it sounded like a whinny no this is not the commander this is foaly the centaur is that the kidnapping lowlife human it took artemis a moment to process the fact that hed been insulted mister ah foaly you have obviously not studied your psych texts it is not wise to antagonize the hostagetaker i may be unstable may be unstable theres no may about it not that it matters soon youll be no more than a cloud of radioactive molecules artemis chuckled thats where you are mistaken my quadrupedal friend by the time that biobomb is detonated i will be long gone from this timestop it was foalys turn to chuckle youre bluffing human if there was a way to escape the field i would have found it i think youre talking through your thankfully it was at that moment root took over at the microphone fowl this is commander root what do you want i would just like to inform you commander that in spite of your attempted betrayal i am still willing to negotiate that troll had nothing to do with me protested root it was done against my wishes the fact is that it was done and by the lep whatever trust we had is gone so here is my ultimatum you have thirty minutes to send in the gold or else i will refuse to release captain short furthermore i will not take her with me when i leave the timefield leaving her to be disintegrated by the biobomb dont be a fool human youre deluding yourself mud technology is aeons behind ours there is no way to escape the timefield artemis leaned in close to the mike smiling his wolfish smile theres only one way to find out root are you willing to bet captain shorts life on your hunch roots hesitation was highlighted by the hiss of interference his reply when it came was tinged with just the right note of defeat no he sighed im not youll have your gold fowl a tonne twentyfour carat artemis smirked quite the actor our commander root thirty minutes commander count the seconds if your clocks stopped im waiting but not for long artemis terminated the contact settling back in the swivel chair it would seem as though the bait had been taken no doubt the lep analysts had discovered his accidental invitation the fairies would pay up because they believed the gold would be theirs again as soon as he was dead vaporized by the biobomb which of course he wouldnt be in theory butler put three rounds into the door frame the door itself was steel and would have sent the devastator slugs ricocheting straight back at him but the frame was the original porous stone used to build the manor it crumbled like chalk a very basic security flaw and one that would have to be remedied once this business was over master artemis was waiting calmly in his chair by the monitor bank nice work butler thank you artemis we were in trouble for a moment there if it hadnt been for the captain artemis nodded yes i saw healing one of the fairy arts i wonder why she did it i wonder too said butler softly we certainly didnt deserve it artemis glanced up sharply keep the faith old friend the end is in sight butler nodded he even attempted a smile but though there were plenty of teeth in the grin there was no heart in less than an hour captain short will be back with her people and we will have sufficient funds to relaunch some of our more tasteful enterprises i know its just artemis didnt have to ask he knew exactly what butler was feeling the fairy had saved both their lives and yet he insisted on holding her to ransom to a man of honour like butler this was almost more than he could bear the negotiations are over one way or another she will be returned to her kind no harm will befall captain short you have my word and juliet yes is there any danger to my sister no no danger the fairies are just going to give us this gold and walk away artemis snorted gently no not exactly theyre going to biobomb fowl manor the second captain short is clear butler took a breath to speak but hesitated obviously there was more to the plan master fowl would tell him when he needed to know so instead of quizzing his employer he made a simple tatement i trust you artemis yes replied the boy the weight of that trust etched on his brow i know gudgeon was doing what politicians did best trying to duck responsibility your officer helped the humans he blurted mustering as much indignation as possible the entire operation was proceeding exactly as planned until your female attacked our deputy deputy chortled foaly now the trolls a deputy yes he is and that human made mincemeat of him this entire situation could be wrapped up if it wasnt for your departments incompetence ordinarily root would have blown his top at this point but he knew that gudgeon was grasping at straws desperately trying to save his career so the commander just smiled hey foaly yes commander did we get the troll assault on disk the centaur heaved a dramatic sigh no sir we ran out of disks just before the troll went in what a pity a real shame those disks could have been invaluable to acting commander gudgeon at his hearing gudgeons cool went out the window give me those disks julius i know theyre in there this is blatant obstruction youre the only one guilty of obstruction around here gudgeon using this affair to further your own career gudgeons face took on a hue to match roots own the situation was slipping away from him and he knew it even chix verbil and the other sprites were sidling out from behind their leader i am still in charge here julius so hand over those disks or i will have you detained oh really you and whose army for a second gudgeons face glowed with the old pomposity it evaporated the moment he noticed the conspicuous lack of officers at his shoulders thats right snickered foaly you aint acting commander any more the call came through from below youve got an appointment with the council and i dont think its to offer you a seat it was probably foalys grin that drove gudgeon over the edge give me those disks he roared pinning foaly to the operations shuttle root was tempted to let them wrestle for a while but now wasnt the time to indulge himself naughty naughty he said pointing his index finger at gudgeon no one beats foaly but me foaly paled careful with that finger youre still wearing the roots thumb accidentally brushed his knuckle opening a tiny gas valve the released gas propelled a tranquillizer dart through the latex fingertip and straight into gudgeons neck the acting commander soon to be private sank like a stone foaly rubbed his neck nice shot commander i dont know what youre talking about total accident i forgot all about the fake finger there are several precedents i believe oh absolutely unfortunately gudgeon will be unconscious for several hours by the time he awakens all the excitement will be over shame root allowed himself a fleeting grin then it was back to business is the gold here yep they just inserted it good he called to gudgeons sheepish troops get it loaded on a hover trolley and send it in any trouble and ill feed you your wings understood no one actually replied but it was understood no doubt about it good now hop to it root disappeared into the operations shuttle foaly clopping behind him the commander shut the door firmly is it armed the centaur flicked a few importantlooking switches on the main console it is now i want it launched as soon as possible he glanced through the laserproof refractor glass were down to minutes here i see sunlight poking through foaly bent to his keyboard in earnest the magic is breaking up in fifteen minutes were going to be in the middle of overground daytime the neutrino streams are losing their integrity i see said root which was basically a lie again ok i dont see but i do get the fifteen minutes bit that gives you ten minutes to get captain short out of there after that were going to be sitting ducks for the entire human race foaly activated yet another camera this one was linked to the hovertrolley he ran a finger experimentally across a trackpad the trolley shot forward almost decapitating chix verbil nice driving muttered root will it get up the steps foaly didnt even look up from his computers automatic clearance compensator onepointfive metre collar no problems root speared him with a glare you do that just to annoy me dont you foaly shrugged his shoulders i might do yes well count yourself lucky my other fingers arent loaded get my meaning yessir good now lets bring captain short home holly hovered beneath the portico orange shards of light striped the blue the timestop was breaking up there were only minutes left before root bluerinsed the whole place foalys voice buzzed in her earpiece ok captain short the gold is on the way be ready to move we dont bargain with kidnappers said holly surprised whats going on here nothing replied foaly casually straightforward exchange the gold goes in you come out we send in the missile big blue bang and its all over does fowl know about the biobomb yep knows all about it claims he can escape the timefield thats impossible correct but theyll all be killed big deal retorted foaly and holly could almost see him shrug thats what you get when you mess with the people holly was torn there was no doubt that fowl was a danger to the civilized underworld very few tears would be shed over his body but the girl juliet she was an innocent she deserved a chance holly descended to an altitude of two metres head height for butler the humans had congregated in the wreckage that used to be a hallway there was disunity between them the lep officer could sense it holly glared accusingly at artemis have you told them artemis returned her stare told them what yes fairy told us what echoed juliet belligerently still a bit miffed over the mesmerizing dont play dumb fowl you know what im talking about artemis never could play dumb for very long yes captain short i do the biobomb your concern would be touching if it extended to myself nevertheless do not upset yourself everything is proceeding according to plan according to plan gasped holly pointing to the devastation surrounding them was this part of the plan and butler almost getting killed all part of the plan no artemis admitted the troll was a slight blip but irrelevant to the overall scheme holly resisted the urge to punch the pale human again turning instead to butler listen to reason for heavens sake you cannot escape the timefield it has never been done butlers features could have been etched in stone if artemis says it can be done then it can but your sister are you willing to risk her life out of loyalty to a felon artemis is no felon miss he is a genius now please remove yourself from my sightline i am monitoring the main entrance holly buzzed up to six metres youre crazy all of you in five minutes youll all be dust dont you realize artemis sighed youve had your answer captain now please this is a delicate stage in the proceedings proceedings its a kidnapping at least have the guts to call it what it is artemiss patience was beginning to fray butler do we have any tranquillizer hypodermics left the giant manservant nodded but didnt speak at that precise moment if the order came to sedate he wasnt sure if he would or could luckily artemiss attention was diverted by activity in the avenue ah it would seem the lep have capitulated butler supervise the delivery but stay alert our fairy friends are not above trickery youre a fine one to talk muttered holly butler hurried to the demolished doorway checking the load and catch on his sig sauer ninemillimetre he was almost grateful for some military activity to distract him from his dilemma in situations like these training took over there was no room for sentiment a fine haze of dust still hung in the air butler squinted through it into the avenue beyond the fairy filters rigged over his eyes revealed that there were no warm bodies approaching there was however a large trolley seemingly driving itself up to the front door it was floating on a cushion of shimmering air doubtless master artemis would have understood the physics of this machine all butler cared about was whether or not he could disable it the trolley bumped into the first step automatic compensator my foot snorted root yeah yeah yeah replied foaly im working on it its the ransom shouted butler artemis tried to quell the excitement rising in his chest this was not the time to allow emotions to enter the equation check for booby traps butler stepped cautiously on to the porch shards of disintegrated gargoyle lay scattered beneath his feet no hostiles seems to be selfpropelled the trolley lurched over the steps i dont know whos driving this thing but he could do with a few lessons butler bent low to the ground scanning the trolleys underside no explosive devices visible he extracted a sweeper from his pocket extending the telescopic aerial no bugs either nothing detectable at any rate but what do we have here uh oh said foaly its a camera butler reached in pulling the fisheye lens out by the cable nightynight gentlemen in spite of the load it carried the trolley responded easily to butlers touch gliding across the threshold into the lobby it stood there humming softly as though waiting to be unloaded now that the moment had come artemis was almost afraid to seize it it was hard to believe that after all these months his wicked scheme was minutes away from fruition of course these last few minutes were the vital ones and the most dangerous open it he said at last surprised at the tremble in his own voice it was an irresistible instant juliet approached tentatively spangled eyes wide even holly closed the throttle a notch dropping until her feet brushed the marble tiling butler unzipped the black tarpaulin dragging it back across the cargo nobody said a thing artemis imagined that somewhere the overture was playing the gold sat there stacked in shining rows it seemed to have an aura a warmth but also an inherent danger there were a lot of people willing to die or kill for the unimaginable wealth this gold could bring holly was mesmerized fairies have an affinity for minerals they are of the earth but gold was their favourite its lustre its allure they paid she breathed i cant believe it neither can i murmured artemis butler is it real butler hefted a bar from the stack he dug the tip of a throwing knife into the ingot gouging out a small sliver its real all right he said holding the scraping up to the light this one at any rate good very good begin unloading it would you well send the trolley back out with captain short hearing her name dispelled hollys gold fever artemis give it up no human has ever succeeded in keeping fairy gold and theyve been trying for centuries the lep will do anything to protect their property artemis shook his head amused ive told you holly took him by the shoulders you cannot escape dont you understand the boy returned her gaze coolly i can escape holly look in my eyes and tell me that i cant so she did captain holly short gazed into her captors blueblack eyes and she saw the truth in there and for a moment she believed it theres still time she said desperately there must be something i have magic a crease of annoyance wrinkled the boys brow i hate to disappoint you captain but there is absolutely nothing artemis paused his gaze tugged momentarily upstairs to the converted loft perhaps he thought do i really need all this gold and was his conscience not pricking him leeching the sweetness from his victory he shook himself stick to the plan stick to the plan no emotion artemis felt a familiar hand on his shoulder everything all right yes butler keep unloading get juliet to help i need to talk to captain short are you sure theres nothing wrong artemis sighed no old friend im not sure but its too late now butler nodded returning to his task juliet toddled along behind him like a terrier now captain about your magic what about it hollys eyes were hooded with suspicion what would i have to do to buy a wish holly glanced at the trolley well that depends what do you have to bargain with root was not what youd call relaxed increasingly wide bands of yellow light were poking through the blue minutes left minutes his migraine was not helped by the pungent cigar feeding toxins into his system have all nonessential personnel been evacuated unless theyve sneaked back in since the last time you asked me not now foaly believe me now is not the time anything from captain short nope we lost video after the troll thing id guess the battery is ruptured wed better get that helmet off her asap or the radiation will fry her brain thatd be a pity after all this work foaly returned to his console a red light began pulsing gently wait motion sensor weve got activity by the main entrance root crossed to the screens can you enhance it no problem foaly punched in the coordinates blowing it up per cent root sat down on the nearest chair am i seeing what i think im seeing you sure are foaly chuckled this is even better than the suit of armour holly was coming out with the gold retrieval were on her in half a second lets get you out of the danger zone captain urged a sprite catching holly by the elbow another ran a radsensor over her helmet weve got a power source breach here captain we need to get your head sprayed immediately holly opened her mouth to protest and had it instantly filled with radsuppressant foam cant this wait she spluttered sorry captain time is of the essence the commander wants a debriefing before we detonate holly was rushed towards the mobile ops unit her feet barely touching the ground all around her retrieval cleaners scanned the grounds for any trace of the siege techies dismantled the field dishes making ready to pull the plug grunts steered the trolley towards the portal it was imperative that everything be relocated to a safe distance before the biobomb went in root was waiting on the steps holly he blurted i mean captain you made it yessir thank you sir and the gold too this is a real feather in your cap well not all commander about half i think root nodded no matter well have the rest soon enough holly wiped radfoam from her brow ive been thinking about that sir fowl made another mistake he never ordered me not to reenter the house and seeing as he brought me in there in the first place the invitation still stands i could go in and mindwipe the occupants we could hide the gold in the walls and do another timestop tomorrow night no captain but sir roots features regained whatever tension theyd lost no captain the council is not about to hold off for some kidnapping mud man its just not going to happen i have my orders and believe me theyre written in stone holly trailed root into the mobile but the girl sir shes an innocent casualty of war she threw her lot in with the wrong side nothing can be done for her now holly was incredulous a casualty of war how can you say that a life is a life root spun sharply grasping her by the shoulders you did what you could holly he said no one could have done more you even retrieved most of the ransom youre suffering from what humans call stockholm syndrome you have bonded with your captors dont worry it will pass but those people in there they know about us nothing can save them now foaly looked up from his calculations not true technically welcome back by the way holly couldnt spare even a second to return the greeting what do you mean not true im fine seeing as you asked foaly shouted root and holly in unison well like the book says if the mud man gold can gather in spite of magick or fairy glamour then that gold is his to keep until he lies in eternal sleep so if he lives he wins its that simple not even the council will go against the book root scratched his chin should i be worried foaly laughed mirthlessly no those guys are as good as dead as good as isnt good enough is that an order affirmative soldier im not a soldier said foaly and pressed the button butler was more than a little surprised you gave it back artemis nodded about half we still have quite a nest egg about fifteen million dollars at todays market prices butler usually wouldnt ask but this time he had to why artemis can you tell me i suppose so the boy smiled i felt we owed the captain something for services rendered is that all artemis nodded no need to talk about the wish it could be perceived as weakness hmm said butler smarter than he looked now we should celebrate enthused artemis deftly changing the subject some champagne i think the boy strode to the kitchen before butlers gaze could dissect him by the time the others caught up artemis had already filled three glasses with dom perignon im a minor i know but im sure mother wouldnt mind just this once butler felt that something was afoot nevertheless he took the crystal flute offered to him juliet looked at her big brother is this ok i suppose so he took a breath you know i love you dont you sis juliet scowled something else that the local louts found very endearing she smacked her brother on the shoulder youre so emotional for a bodyguard butler looked his employer straight in the eye you want us to drink this dont you artemis artemis met his gaze squarely yes butler i do without another word butler drained his glass juliet followed suit the manservant tasted the tranquillizer immediately and although he would have had ample time to snap artemis fowls neck he didnt no need for juliet to be distressed in her final moments artemis watched his friends sink to the floor a pity to deceive them but if they had been alerted to the plan their anxiety could have counteracted the sedative he gazed at the bubbles swirling in his own glass time for the most audacious step in his scheme with only the barest hint of hesitation he swallowed the tranquillizerlaced champagne artemis waited calmly for the drug to take hold of his system he didnt have to wait long for each dose had been calculated according to body weight as his thoughts began to swirl it occurred to him that he might never awaken again its a bit late for doubts he chided himself and sank into unconsciousness shes away said foaly leaning back from the console its out of my hands now they followed the missiles progress through polarized windows it really was a remarkable piece of equipment because its main weapon was light the fallout could be focused to an exact radius the radioactive element used in the core was solinium which had a halflife of fourteen seconds this effectively meant that foaly could tune the biobomb to bluerinse only fowl manor and not one blade of grass more plus the building would be radiationfree in under a minute in the event that a few solinium flares refused to be focused they would be contained by the timefield murder made easy the flight path is preprogrammed explained foaly though no one was paying a blind bit of attention shell sail into the lobby and detonate the casing and firing mechanism are plastic alloy and will completely disintegrate clean as a whistle root and holly followed the bombs arc as predicted it swooped through the decimated doorway without knocking so much as a sliver of stone from the medieval walls holly switched her attention to the missiles nosecam for a moment she caught a glimpse of the grand hallway where she had until recently been a prisoner it was empty not a human in sight maybe she thought just maybe then she looked at foaly and the technology at his fingertips and she realized that the humans were as good as dead the biobomb detonated a blue orb of condensed light crackled and spread filling every corner of the manor with its deadly rays flowers withered insects shrivelled and fish died in their tanks not one cubic millimetre was spared artemis fowl and his cohorts could not have escaped it was impossible holly sighed turning away from the already dwindling bluerinse for all his grand designs artemis had been a mere mortal in the end and for some reason she mourned his passing root was more pragmatic ok suit up full blackout gear its perfectly safe said foaly didnt you ever listen in school the commander snorted i trust science about as far as i could throw you foaly radiation has a habit of hanging around when certain scientists have assured us it has dissipated no one steps outside the unit without blackout gear so that counts you out foaly only bipedal suits anyway i want you on monitors just in case in case of what wondered foaly but he didnt comment save it for an i told you so later root turned to holly are you ready captain going back in the idea of identifying three cadavers didnt appeal to holly but she knew it was her duty she was the only one with firsthand knowledge of the interior yessir on my way holly selected a blackout suit from the rack pulling it on over her jumpsuit as per training she checked the gauge before tugging the vulcanized cowl a dip in pressure would indicate a rip which could prove fatal in the long term root lined up the insertion team at the perimeter the remains of retrieval one were about as eager to insert themselves into the manor as they would be to juggle atlantean stink balloons youre certain the big one is gone yes captain kelp hes gone one way or another trouble wasnt convinced because thats one mean human i think he has magic of his own corporal grub giggled and got an immediate clip on the ear for himself he muttered something about telling mummy and quickly strapped on his helmet root felt his complexion redden lets move out your mission is to locate and recover the bullion watch for booby traps i didnt trust fowl when he was alive and i definitely dont trust him now that hes dead the phrase booby traps got everyones attention the idea of a bouncing betty antipersonnel mine exploding at head height was enough to dispel any nonchalance in the troops no one built weapons of cruelty like the mud men as the junior recon officer holly was on point and even though there werent supposed to be any hostiles in the manor she found her gun hand automatically straying to the neutrino the mansion was eerily quiet with only the fizzle of the last few solinium flares to alleviate the stillness death was there too in the silence the manor was a cradle of death holly could smell it behind those medieval walls lay the bodies of a million insects and under its floors the cooling corpses of spiders and mice they approached the doorway tentatively holly swept the area with an xray scanner nothing under the flagstones but dirt and a nest of dead moneyspiders clear she said into her microphone im going in foaly have you got your ears on im right there with you darlin replied the centaur unless you step on a landmine in which case im way back in the operations room are you getting any thermals not after a bluerinse we have residual heat signatures all over the place mostly solinium flares it wont calm down for a couple of days but no radiation right thats right root snorted in disbelief over the headsets it sounded like an elephant sneezing it looks like were going to have to sweep this house the oldfashioned way he grumbled make it quick advised foaly i give it five minutes tops before fowl manor rejoins the world at large holly stepped through what used to be the doorway the chandelier swung gently from the concussive force of the missiles detonation but otherwise everything was as she remembered it the gold is downstairs in my cell nobody answered not in words someone did manage a retch right into the microphone holly spun around trouble was doubled over clutching his stomach i don feel so good he groaned a tad unnecessarily considering the pool of vomit all over his boots corporal grub took a breath possibly to utter a sentence containing the word mummy what came out was a jet of concentrated bile unfortunately grub didnt have the opportunity to open his visor before the illness struck it was not a pretty sight ugh said holly pressing the corporals visorrelease button a tsunami of regurgitated rations flooded over grubs blackout suit oh for heavens sake muttered root elbowing past the brothers he didnt get very far one step over the threshold and he was throwing up with the rest of them holly pointed her helmetcam at the stricken officers what the hell is going on here foaly tm searching hold on holly could hear computer keys being punched furiously ok sudden vomiting spatial nausea oh no what asked holly but she already knew maybe she always had its the magic blurted foaly words barely decipherable in his excitement they cant enter the house until fowl is dead its like an extreme allergic reaction that means unbelievable that means they made it completed holly hes alive artemis fowl is alive darvit groaned root and heaved another quart of vomit on to the terracotta tiles holly went on alone she had to see for herself if fowls corpse was here it would be with the gold of that she was certain the same family portraits glared down at her but now they seemed smug rather than austere holly was tempted to loose a few blasts into them from the neutrino but that would be against the rules if artemis fowl had beaten them then that was it there would be no recriminations she descended the stairway to her cell the door was still swinging slightly from the biobomb concussion a solinium flare ricocheted around the room like a trapped bolt of blue lightning holly stepped inside halfafraid of what she might or might not see there was nothing nothing dead at any rate just gold two hundred ingots approximately piled on the mattress of her cot nice neat military rows good old butler the only human ever to take on a troll and win commander are you receiving over affirmative captain body count negative on the bodies sir i found the rest of the ransom there was along silence leave it holly you know the rules were pulling out but sir there must be a way foaly broke in on the conversation but nothing captain im counting down the seconds until daylight here and i dont like our odds if we have to exit at high noon holly sighed it made sense the people could chose their exit time as long as they left before the field disintegrated it just galled her to think theyd been beaten by a human an adolescent human at that she took a last look around the cell a big ball of hatred had been born here she realized and it would have to be dealt with sooner or later holly jammed her pistol back into its holster preferably sooner fowl was the winner this time but someone like him wouldnt be able to rest on his laurels he would be back with some other moneymaking scheme and when he arrived he would find holly short waiting for him waiting with a big gun and a smile the ground was soft by the timestop perimeter half a millenniums bad drainage from the medieval walls had transformed the foundations into a virtual bog so that was where mulch surfaced the soft ground wasnt the only reason for choosing that exact spot the other reason was the smell a good tunnel dwarf can pick up the scent of gold through half a kilometre of granite bedrock mulch diggums had one of the best noses in the business the hover trolley floated virtually unguarded two of retrievals finest were stationed beside the recovered ransom but at the moment they were having a little giggle at their stricken commander e cant half chuck it cant e chix chix nodded mimicking roots spewing technique chix verbils pantomime antics provided the perfect cover for a spot of pilfering mulch gave his tubes a clearing before clambering from the tunnel the last thing he needed was for a sudden burst of gas to alert the lep to his presence he neednt have worried he could have slapped chix verbil in the face with a wet stinkworm and the sprite wouldnt have noticed in a matter of seconds he had transferred two dozen ingots into the tunnel it was the easiest job he had ever pulled mulch had to stifle a giggle as he dropped the last two bars down the hole julius had really done him a favour getting him involved in this whole affair things couldnt have worked out much better he was free as a bird rich and best of all presumed dead by the time the lep realized that the gold was missing mulch diggums would be half a continent away if they realized at all the dwarf lowered himself into the ground it would take several trips to move his treasure trove but it would be worth the delay with this kind of money he could take early retirement he would have to completely disappear of course but a plan was already forming in his devious mind he would live above ground for a spell masquerade as a human dwarf with an aversion to light perhaps buy a penthouse with thick blinds in manhattan perhaps or monte carlo it might seem odd of course a dwarf shutting himself away from the sun but then again he would be an obscenely rich dwarf and humans will accept any story however outlandish when theres something in it for them preferably something green that folds artemis could hear a voice calling his name there was a face behind the voice but it was blurred hard to make out his father perhaps father the word was strange in his mouth unused rusty artemis opened his eyes butler was leaning over him artemis you re awake ah butler its you artemis got to his feet head spinning with the effort he expected butlers hand at his elbow to steady him it didnt come juliet was lying on a chaise longue dribbling on to the cushions obviously the draft hadnt worn off yet it was just sleeping pills butler harmless the manservants eyes had a dangerous glint explain yourself artemis rubbed his eyes later butler im feeling a bit butler stepped into his path artemis my sister is lying drugged on that couch she was almost killed so explain yourself now artemis realized that hed been given an order he considered being offended then decided that perhaps butler was right he had gone too far i didnt tell you about the sleeping pills because youd fight them its only natural and it was imperative to the plan that we all go to sleep immediately the plan artemis lowered himself into a comfortable chair the timefield was the key to this whole affair its the leps ace in the hole its what has made them unbeatable for all these years any incident can be contained that and the biobomb make a formidable combination so why did we have to be drugged artemis smiled look out of the window dont you see theyre gone its over butler glanced through the net curtains the light was bright and clear not a hint of blue nevertheless the manservant was unimpressed theyre gone for now theyll be back tonight i guarantee it no thats against the rules we beat them thats it game over butler raised an eyebrow the sleeping pills artemis not to be distracted i see butlers answer was an implacable silence the sleeping pills very well i had to think of a way to escape the timefield i trawled through the book but there was nothing not a clue the people themselves have not yet developed a way so i went back to their old testament back to when their lives and ours were intertwined you know the stories elves that made shoes during the night sprites that cleaned houses back when we coexisted to a certain extent magical favours in exchange for their fairy forts the big one of course was santa claus butlers eyebrows nearly jumped off the front of his face santa claus artemis raised his palms i know i know i was a tad sceptical myself but apparently our little corporateimage santa claus is not descended from a turkish saint he is a shadow of san dklass the third king of the frond elfin dynasty he is known as san the deluded not a great title as titles go admittedly dklass thought that the greed of the mud people in his kingdom could be assuaged by distributing lavish gifts he would marshal all the great wizards once a year and have them throw up a great timestop over vast regions flocks of sprites would be sent out to deliver the presents while the humans were asleep of course it didnt work human greed can never be assuaged especially not by gifts butler frowned what if the humans we that is what if we had woken up ah yes excellent question the heart of the matter we wouldnt wake up that is the nature of the timestop whatever your state of consciousness going in thats how you stay you can neither wake up nor fall asleep you must have noticed the fatigue in your bones these last few hours yet your mind would not let you sleep butler nodded things were getting clearer in a roundabout sort of way so my theory was that the only way to escape the timefield was to simply fall asleep our own consciousness was all that kept us imprisoned you risked an awful lot on a theory artemis not just a theory we did have a test subject who ah angeline yes my mother because of her narcoticinduced slumber she moved with the natural order of time unhindered by the timefield if she had not i would have simply surrendered to the lep and submitted to their mind wipe butler snorted he doubted it so because we could not fall asleep naturally i simply administered us all a dose of mothers pills simple you cut it pretty fine though another minute agreed the boy nodded things were tense there at the end it was necessary in order to doublebluff the lep he paused so that butler could process the information well am i forgiven butler sighed on the chaise lounge juliet snored like a drunken sailor he smiled suddenly yes artemis all is forgiven just one thing yes never again fairies are too human youre right said artemis the crows feet deepening around his eyes never again we shall restrict ourselves to more tasteful ventures in the future legal i cant promise butler nodded it was close enough now young master shouldnt we check on your mother artemis grew paler if that were possible could the captain have reneged on her promise she would certainly be entitled to yes i suppose we should let juliet rest shes earned it he cast his eyes upwards along the stairs it had been too much to hope for that he could trust the fairy after all he had held her captive against her will he berated himself silently imagine parting with all those millions for the promise of a wish oh the gullibility then the loft door opened butler drew his weapon instantly artemis behind me intruders the boy waved him away no butler i dont think so his heart pounded in his ears blood pulsed in his fingertips could it be could it possibly be a figure appeared on the stairs wraithlike in a towelled robe her hair wet from the shower arty she called arty are you there artemis wanted to answer he wanted to race up the grand stairway arms outstretched but he couldnt his cerebral functions had deserted him angeline fowl descended one hand resting lightly on the banister artemis had forgotten how graceful his mother was her bare feet skipped over the carpeted steps and soon she was standing before him morning darling she said brightly as though it were just another day mmother stammered artemis well give me a hug artemis stepped into his mothers embrace it was warm and strong she was wearing perfume he felt like the boy he was im sorry arty she whispered into his ear sorry for what for everything for the last few months i havent been myself but things are going to change time to stop living in the past artemis felt a tear on his cheek he wasnt sure whose tear it was and i dont have a present for you a present said artemis of course sang his mother spinning him around dont you know what day it is day its christmas day you silly boy christmas day presents are traditional are they not yes thought artemis traditional san dklass and look at this place drab as a mausoleum butler the manservant hurriedly pocketed his sig sauer yes maam get on the phone to brown thomas the platinum set number reopen my account tell helene i want a yuletide makeover theworks yes maam the works oh and wake up juliet i want my things moved into the main bedroom that attic is far too dusty yes maam right away maam angeline fowl linked her sons arm now arty i want to know everything first of all what happened here remodelling said artemis the old doorway was riddled with damp angeline frowned completely unconvinced i see and how about school have you decided on a career while his mouth answered these everyday questions artemiss mind was in turmoil he was a boy again his life was going to change utterly his plans would have to be much more devious than usual if they were to escape his mothers attention but it would be worth it angeline fowl was wrong she had brought him a christmas present epilogue now that you have reviewed the case file you must realize what a dangerous creature this fowl is there is a tendency to romanticize artemis to attribute to him qualities that he does not possess the fact that he used his wish to heal his mother is not a sign of affection he did it simply because the social services were already investigating his case and it was only a matter of time before he was put into care he kept the existence of the people quiet only so that he could continue to exploit them over the years which he did on several occasions his one mistake was leaving captain short alive holly became the leps foremost expert in the artemis fowl cases and was invaluable in the fight against the peoples most feared enemy this fight was to continue across several decades ironically the greatest triumph for both protagonists was the time they were forced to cooperate during the goblin insurgence but thats another story report compiled by doctor j argon bpsych for the lep academy files details are per cent accurate per cent unavoidable extrapolation year
