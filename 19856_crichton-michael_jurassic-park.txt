michael crichton jurassic park for am and t reptiles are abhorrent because of their cold body pale color cartilaginous skeleton filthy skin fierce aspect calculating eye offensive smell harsh voice squalid habitation and terrible venom wherefore their creator has not exerted his powers to make many of them linnaeus you cannot recall a new form of life erwin chargaff introduction the ingen incident the late twentieth century has witnessed a scientific gold rush of astonishing proportions the headlong and furious haste to commercialize genetic engineering this enterprise has proceeded so rapidlywith so little outside commentarythat its dimensions and implications are hardly understood at all biotechnology promises the greatest revolution in human history by the end of this decade it will have outdistanced atomic power and computers in its effect on our everyday lives in the words of one observer biotechnology is going to transform every aspect of human life our medical care our food our health our entertainment our very bodies nothing will ever be the same again its literally going to change the face of the planet but the biotechnology revolution differs in three important respects from past scientific transformations first it is broadbased america entered the atomic age through the work of a single research institution at los alamos it entered the computer age through the efforts of about a dozen companies but biotecbnology research is now carried out in more than two thousand laboratories in america alone five hundred corporations spend five billion dollars a year on this technology second much of the research is thoughtless or frivolous efforts to engineer paler trout for better visibility in the stream square trees for easier lumbering and injectable scent cells so youll always smell of your favorite perfume may seem like a joke but they are not indeed the fact that biotechnology can be applied to the industries traditionally subject to the vagaries of fashion such as cosmetics and leisure activities heightens concern about the whimsical use of this powerful new technology third the work is uncontrolled no one supervises it no federal laws regulate it there is no coherent government policy in america or anywhere else in the world and because the products of biotechnology range from drugs to farm crops to artificial snow an intelligent policy is difficult but most disturbing is the fact that no watchdogs are found among scientists themselves it is remarkable that nearly every scientist in genetics research is also engaged in the commerce of biotechnology there are no detached observers everybody has a stake the commercialization of molecular biology is the most stunning ethical event in the history of science and it has happened with astonishing speed for four hundred years since galileo science has always proceeded as a free and open inquiry into the workings of nature scientists have always ignored national boundaries holding themselves above the transitory concerns of politics and even wars scientists have always rebelled against secrecy in research and have even frowned on the idea of patenting their discoveries seeing themselves as working to the benefit of all mankind and for many generations the discoveries of scientists did indeed have a peculiarly selfless quality when in two young researchers in england james watson and francis crick deciphered the structure of dna their work was bailed as a triumph of the human spirit of the centuriesold quest to understand the universe in a scientific way it was confidently expected that their discovery would be selflessly extended to the greater benefit of mankind yet that did not happen thirty years later nearly all of watson and cricks scientific colleagues were engaged in another sort of enterprise entirely research in molecular genetics had become a vast multibillion dollar commercial undertaking and its origins can be traced not to but to april that was the date of a now famous meeting in which robert swanson a venture capitalist approached herbert boyer a biochemist at the university of california the two men agreed to found a commercial company to exploit boyers genesplicing techniques their new company genentech quickly became the largest and most successful of the genetic engineering startups suddenly it seemed as if everyone wanted to become rich new companies were announced almost weekly and scientists flocked to exploit genetic research by at least scientists including in the national academy sat on the advisory boards of biotech firms the number of those who held equity positions or consultancies was several times greater it is necessary to emphasize how significant this shift in attitude actually was in the past pure scientists took a snobbish view of business they saw the pursuit of money as intellectually uninteresting suited only to shopkeepers and to do research for industry even at the prestigious bell or ibm labs was only for those who couldnt get a university appointment thus the attitude of pure scientists was fundamentally critical toward the work of applied scientists and to industry in general their longstanding antagonism kept university scientists free of contaminating industry ties and whenever debate arose about technological matters disinterested scientists were available to discuss the issues at the highest levels but that is no longer true there are very few molecular biologists and very few research institutions without commercial affiliations the old days are gone genetic research continues at a more furious pace than ever but it is done in secret and in haste and for profit in this commercial climate it is probably inevitable that a company as ambitious as international genetic technologies inc of palo alto would arise it is equally unsurprising that the genetic crisis it created should go unreported after all ingens research was conducted in secret the actual incident occurred in the most remote region of central america and fewer than twenty people were there to witness it of those only a handful survived even at the end when international genetic technologies filed for chapter protection in san francisco superior court on october the proceedings drew little press attention it appeared so ordinary ingen was the third small american bioengineering company to fail that year and the seventh since few court documents were made public since the creditors were japanese investment consortia such as hamaguri and densaka companies which traditionally shun publicity to avoid unnecessary disclosure daniel ross of cowan swain and ross counsel for ingen also represented the japanese investors and the rather unusual petition of the vice consul of costa rica was heard behind closed doors thus it is not surprising that within a month the problems of ingen were quietly and amicably settled parties to that settlement including the distinguished scientific board of advisers signed a nondisclosure agreement and none will speak about what happenedbut many of the principal figures in the ingen incident are not signatories and were willing to discuss the remarkable events leading up to those final two days in august on a remote island off the west coast of costa rica prologue the bite of the raptor the tropical rain fell in drenching sheets hammering the corrugated roof of the clinic building roaring down the metal gutters splashing on the ground in a torrent roberta carter sighed and stared out the window from the clinic she could hardly see the beach or the ocean beyond cloaked in low fog this wasnt what she had expected when she had come to the fishing village of bahia anasco on the west coast of costa rica to spend two months as a visiting physician bobbie carter had expected sun and relaxation after two grueling years of residency in emergency medicine at michael reese in chicago she had been in bahia anasco now for three weeks and it had rained every day everything else was fine she liked the isolation of bahia anasco and the friendliness of its people costa rica had one of the twenty best medical systems in the world and even in this remote coastal village the clinic was well maintained amply supplied her paramedic manuel aragn was intelligent and well trained bobbie was able to practice a level of medicine equal to what she had practiced in chicago but the rain the constant unending rain across the examining room manuel cocked his head listen he said believe me i hear it bobbie said no listen and then she caught it another sound blended with the rain a deeper rumble that built and emerged until it was clear the rhythmic thumping of a helicopter she thought they cant be flying in weather like this but the sound built steadily and then the helicopter burst low through the ocean fog and roared overhead circled and came back she saw the helicopter swing back over the water near the fishing boats then case sideways to the rickety wooden dock and back toward the beach it was looking for a place to land it was a bigbellied sikorsky with a blue stripe on the side with the words ingen construction that was the name of the construction company building a new resort on one of the offshore islands the resort was said to be spectacular and very complicated many of the local people were employed in the construction which had been going on for more than two years bobbie could imagine itone of those huge american resorts with swimming pools and tennis courts where guests could play and drink their daiquiris without having any contact with the real life of the country bobbie wondered what was so urgent on that island that the helicopter would fly in this weather through the windshield she saw the pilot exhale in relief as the helicopter settled onto the wet sand of the beach uniformed men jumped out and flung open the big side door she heard frantic shouts in spanish and manuel nudged her they were calling for a doctor two black crewmen carried a limp body toward her while a white man barked orders the white man had a yellow slicker red hair appeared around the edges of his mets baseball cap is there a doctor here he called to her as she ran up im dr carter she said the rain fell in heavy drops pounding her head and shoulders the redhalted man frowned at her she was wearing cutoff jeans and a tank top she had a stethoscope over her shoulder the bell already rusted from the salt air ed regis weve got a very sick man here doctor then you better take him to san jose she said san jose was the capital just twenty minutes away by air we would but we cant get over the mountains in this weather you have to treat him here bobbie trotted alongside the injured man as they carried him to the clinic he was a kid no older than eighteen lifting away the bloodsoaked shirt she saw a big slashing rip along his shoulder and another on the leg what happened to him construction accident ed shouted he fell one of the backhoes ran over him the kid was pale shivering unconscious manuel stood by the bright green door of the clinic waving his arm the men brought the body through and set it on the table in the center of the room manuel started an intravenous line and bobbie swung the light over the kid and bent to examine the wounds immediately she could see that it did not look good the kid would almost certainly die a big tearing laceration ran from his shoulder down his torso at the edge of the wound the flesh was shredded at the center the shoulder was dislocated pale bones exposed a second slash cut through the heavy muscles of the thigh deep enough to reveal the pulse of the femoral artery below her first impression was that his leg had been ripped open tell me again about this injury she said i didnt see it ed said they say the backhoe dragged him because it almost looks as if he was mauled bobbie carter said probing the wound like most emergency room physicians she could remember in detail patients she had seen even years before she had seen two maulings one was a twoyearold child who had been attacked by a rottweiler dog the other was a drunken circus attendant who had had an encounter with a bengal tiger both injuries were similar there was a characteristic look to an animal attack mauled ed said no no it was a backhoe believe me ed licked his lips as he spoke he was edgy acting as if he had done something wrong bobbie wondered why if they were using inexperienced local workmen on the resort construction they must have accidents all the time manuel said do you want lavage yes she said after you block him she bent lower probed the wound with her fingertips if an earth mover had rolled over him dirt would be forced deep into the wound but there wasnt any dirt just a slippery slimy foam and the wound had a strange odor a kind of rotten stench a smell of death and decay she had never smelled anything like it before how long ago did this happen an hour again she noticed how tense ed regis was he was one of those eager nervous types and he didnt look like a construction foreman more like an executive he was obviously out of his depth bobbie carter turned back to the injuries somehow she didnt think she was seeing mechanical trauma it just didnt look right no soil contamination of the wound site and no crushinjury component mechanical trauma of any sortan auto injury a factory accidentalmost always had some component of crushing but here there was none instead the mans skin was shredded rippedacross his shoulder and again across his thigh it really did look like a maul on the other hand most of the body was unmarked which was unusual for an animal attack she looked again at the head the arms the hands the hands she felt a chill when she looked at the kids bands there were short slashing cuts on both palms and bruises on the wrists and forearms she had worked in chicago long enough to know what that meant all right she said wait outside why ed said alarmed he didnt like that do you want me to help him or not she said and pushed him out the door and closed it on his face she didnt know what was going on but she didnt like it manuel hesitated i continue to wash yes she said she reached for her little olympus pointandshoot she took several snapshots of the injury shifting her light for a better view it really did look like bites she thought then the kid groaned and she put her camera aside and bent toward him his lips moved his tongue thick raptor he said lo sa raptor at those words manuel froze stepped back in horror what does it mean bobbie said manuel shook his head i do not know doctor lo sa raptorno es espanol no it sounded to her like spanish then please continue to wash him no doctor he wrinkled his nose bad smell and he crossed himself bobbie looked again at the slippery foam streaked across the wound she touched it rubbing it between her fingers it seemed almost like saliva the injured boys lips moved raptor he whispered in a tone of horror manuel said it bit him what bit him raptor whats a raptor it means hupia bobbie frowned the costa ricans were not especially superstitious but she had heard the hupia mentioned in the village before they were said to be night ghosts faceless vampires who kidnapped small children according to the belief the hupia had once lived in the mountains of costa rica but now inhabited the islands offshore manuel was backing away murmuring and crossing himself it is not normal this smell he said it is the hupia bobbie was about to order him back to work when the injured youth opened his eyes and sat straight up on the table manuel shrieked in terror the injured boy moaned and twisted his head looking left and right with wide staring eyes and then he explosively vomited blood he went immediately into convulsions his body vibrating and bobbie grabbed for him but he shuddered off the table onto the concrete floor he vomited again there was blood everywhere ed opened the door saying what the hells happening and when he saw the blood he turned away his hand to his mouth bobbie was grabbing for a stick to put in the boys clenched jaws but even as she did it she knew it was hopeless and with a final spastic jerk he relaxed and lay still she bent to perform mouthtomouth but manuel grabbed her shoulder fiercely pulling her back no he said the hupia will cross over manuel for gods sake no he stared at her fiercely no you do not understand these things bobbie looked at the body on the ground and realized that it didnt matter there was no possibility of resuscitating him manuel called for the men who came back into the room and took the body away ed appeared wiping his mouth with the back of his hand muttering im sure you did all you could and then she watched as the men took the body away back to the helicopter and it lifted thunderously up into the sky it is better manuel said bobbie was thinking about the boys hands they had been covered with cuts and bruises in the characteristic pattern of defense wounds she was quite sure he had not died in a construction accident he had been attacked and he had held up his bands against his attacker where is this island theyve come from she asked in the ocean perhaps a hundred hundred and twenty miles offshore pretty far for a resort she said manuel watched the helicopter i hope they never come back well she thought at least she had pictures but when she turned back to the table she saw that her camera was gone the rain finally stopped later that night alone in the bedroom behind the clinic bobbie thumbed through her tattered paperback spanish dictionary the boy had said raptor and despite manuels protests she suspected it was a spanish word sure enough she found it in her dictionary it meant ravisher or abductor that gave her pause the sense of the word was suspiciously close to the meaning of hupia of course she did not believe in the superstition and no ghost had cut those hands what had the boy been trying to tell her from the next room she heard groans one of the village women was in the first stage of labor and elena morales the local midwife was attending her bobbie went into the clinic room and gestured to elena to step outside for a moment elena si doctor do you know what is a raptor elena was grayhaired and sixty a strong woman with a practical nononsense air in the night beneath the stars she frowned and said raptor yes you know this word si elena nodded it means a person who comes in the night and takes away a child a kidnapper yes a hupia her whole manner changed do not say this word doctor why not do not speak of hupia now elena said firmly nodding her head toward the groans of the laboring woman it is not wise to say this word now but does a raptor bite and cut his victims bite and cut elena said puzzled no doctor nothing like this a raptor is a man who takes a new baby she seemed irritated by the conversation impatient to end it elena started back toward the clinic i will call to you when she is ready doctor i think one hour more perhaps two bobbie looked at the stars and listened to the peaceful lapping of the surf at the shore in the darkness she saw the shadows of the fishing boats anchored offshore the whole scene was quiet so normal she felt foolish to be talking of vampires and kidnapped babies bobbie went back to her room remembering again that manuel had insisted it was not a spanish word out of curiosity she looked in the little english dictionary and to her surprise she found the word there too raptor n deriv of l raptor plunderer fr raptus bird of prey first iteration at the earliest drawings of the fractal curve few clues to the underlying mathematical structre will be seen ian malcolm almost paradise mike bowman whistled cheerfully as he drove the land rover through the cabo blanco biological reserve on the west coast of costa rica it was a beautiful morning in july and the road before him was spectacular hugging the edge of a cliff overlooking the jungle and the blue pacific according to the guidebooks cabo blanco was unspoiled wilderness almost a paradise seeing it now made bowman feel as if the vacation was back on track bowman a thirtysixyearold real estate developer from dallas had come to costa rica with his wife and daughter for a twoweek holiday the trip had actually been his wifes idea for weeks ellen had filled his ear about the wonderful national parks of costa rica and how good it would be for tina to see them then when they arrived it turned out ellen had an appointment to see a plastic surgeon in san jose that was the first mike bowman had heard about the excellent and inexpensive plastic surgery available in costa rica and all the luxurious private clinics in san jose of course theyd had a huge fight mike felt shed lied to him and she had and he put his foot down about this plastic surgery business anyway it was ridiculous ellen was only thirty and she was a beautiful woman hell shed been homecoming queen her senior year at rice and that was not even ten years earlier but ellen tended to be insecure and worried and it seemed as if in recent years she had mostly worried about losing her looks that and everything else the land rover bounced in a pothole splashing mud seated beside him ellen said mike are you sure this is the right road we havent seen any other people for hours there was another car fifteen minutes ago he reminded her remember the blue one going the other way darling you wanted a deserted beach he said and thats what youre going to get ellen shook her head doubtfully i hope youre right yeah dad i hope youre right said christina from the back seat she was eight years old trust me im right he drove in silence a moment its beautiful isnt it look at that view its beautiful its okay tina said ellen got out a compact and looked at herself in the mirror pressing under her eyes she sighed and put the compact away the road began to descend and mike bowman concentrated on driving suddenly a small black shape flashed across the road and tina shrieked look look then it was gone into the jungle what was it ellen asked a monkey maybe a squirrel monkey bowman said can i count it tina said taking her pencil out she was keeping a list of all the animals she had seen on her trip as a project for school i dont know mike said doubtfully tina consulted the pictures in the guidebook i dont think it was a squirrel monkey she said i think it was just another howler they had seen several howler monkeys already on their trip hey she said more brightly according to this book the beaches of cabo blanco are frequented by a variety of wildlife including howler and whitefaced monkeys threetoed sloths and coatimundis you think well see a threetoed sloth dad i bet we do really just look in the mirror very funny dad the road sloped downward through the jungle toward the ocean mike bowman felt like a hero when they finally reached the beach a twomile crescent of white sand utterly deserted he parked the land rover in the shade of the palm trees that fringed the beach and got out the box lunches ellen changed into her bathing suit saying honestly i dont know how im going to get this weight off you look great hon actually he felt that she was too thin but he had learned not to mention that tina was already running down the beach dont forget you need your sunscreen ellen called later tina shouted over her shoulder im going to see if theres a sloth ellen bowman looked around at the beach and the trees you think shes all right honey theres nobody here for miles mike said what about snakes oh for gods sake mike bowman said theres no snakes on a beach well there might be honey he said firmly snakes are coldblooded theyre reptiles they cant control their body temperature its ninety degrees on that sand if a snake came out itd be cooked believe me theres no snakes on the beach he watched his daughter scampering down the beach a dark spot on the white sand let her go let her have a good time he put his arm around his wifes waist tina ran until she was exhausted and then she threw herself down on the sand and gleefully rolled to the waters edge the ocean was warm and there was hardly any surf at all she sat for a while catching her breath and then she looked back toward her parents and the car to see how far she had come her mother waved beckoning her to return tina waved back cheerfully pretending she didnt understand tina didnt want to put sunscreen on and she didnt want to go back and hear her mother talk about losing weight she wanted to stay right here and maybe see a sloth tina had seen a sloth two days earlier at the zoo in san jose it looked like a muppets character and it seemed harmless in any case it couldnt move fast she could easily outrun it now her mother was calling to her and tina decided to move out of the sun back from the water to the shade of the palm trees in this part of the beach the palm trees overhung a gnarled tangle of mangrove roots which blocked any attempt to penetrate inland tina sat in the sand and kicked the dried mangrove leaves she noticed many bird tracks in the sand costa rica was famous for its birds the guidebooks said there were three times as many birds in costa rica as in all of america and canada in the sand some of the threetoed bird tracks were small and so faint they could hardly be seen other tracks were large and cut deeper in the sand tina was looking idly at the tracks when she heard a chirping followed by a rustling in the mangrove thicket did sloths make a chirping sound tina didnt think so but she wasnt sure the chirping was probably some ocean bird she waited quietly not moving hearing the rustling again and finally she saw the source of the sounds a few yards away a lizard emerged from the mangrove roots and peered at her tina held her breath a new animal for her list the lizard stood up on its hind legs balancing on its thick tail and stared at her standing like that it was almost a foot tall dark green with brown stripes along its back its tiny front legs ended in little lizard fingers that wiggled in the air the lizard cocked its head as it looked at her tina thought it was cute sort of like a big salamander she raised her hand and wiggled her fingers back the lizard wasnt frightened it came toward her walking upright on its hind legs it was hardly bigger than a chicken and like a chicken it bobbed its head as it walked tina thought it would make a wonderful pet she noticed that the lizard left threetoed tracks that looked exactly like bird tracks the lizard came closer to tina she kept her body still not wanting to frighten the little animal she was amazed that it would come so close but she remembered that this was a national park all the animals in the park would know that they were protected this lizard was probably tame maybe it even expected her to give it some food unfortunately she didnt have any slowly tina extended her hand palm open to show she didnt have any food the lizard paused cocked his head and chirped sorry tina said i just dont have anything and then without warning the lizard jumped up onto her outstretched hand tina could feel its little toes pinching the skin of her palm and she felt the surprising weight of the animals body pressing her arm down and then the lizard scrambled up her arm toward her face i just wish i could see her ellen bowman said squinting in the sunlight thats all just see her im sure shes fine mike said picking through the box lunch packed by the hotel there was unappetizing grilled chicken and some kind of a meatfilled pastry not that ellen would cat any of it you dont think shed leave the beach ellen said no hon i dont i feel so isolated here ellen said i thought thats what you wanted mike bowman said i did well then whats the problem i just wish i could see her is all ellen said then from down the beach carried by the wind they heard their daughters voice she was screaming puntarenas i think she is quite comfortable now dr cruz said lowering the plastic flap of the oxygen tent around tina as she slept mike bowman sat beside the bed close to his daughter mike thought dr cruz was probably pretty capable he spoke excellent english the result of training at medical centers in london and baltimore dr cruz radiated competence and the clinica santa maria the modern hospital in puntarenas was spotless and efficient but even so mike bowman felt nervous there was no getting around the fact that his only daughter was desperately ill and they were far from home when mike had first reached tina she was screaming hysterically her whole left arm was bloody covered with a profusion of small bites each the size of a thumbprint and there were flecks of sticky foam on her arm like a foamy saliva he carried her back down the beach almost immediately her arm began to redden and swell mike would not soon forget the frantic drive back to civilization the fourwheeldrive land rover slipping and sliding up the muddy track into the hills while his daughter screamed in fear and pain and her arm grew more bloated and red long before they reached the park boundaries the swelling had spread to her neck and then tina began to have trouble breathing shell be all right now ellen said staring through the plastic oxygen tent i believe so dr cruz said i have given her another dose of steroids and her breathing is much easier and you can see the edema in her arm is greatly reduced mike bowman said about those bites we have no identification yet the doctor said i myself havent seen bites like that before but youll notice they are disappearing its already quite difficult to make them out fortunately i have taken photographs for reference and i have washed her arm to collect some samples of the sticky salivaone for analysis here a second to send to the labs in san jose and the third we will keep frozen in case it is needed do you have the picture she made yes mike bowman said he handed the doctor the sketch that tina had drawn in response to questions from the admitting officials this is the animal that bit her dr cruz said looking at the picture yes mike bowman said she said it was a green lizard the size of a chicken or a crow i dont know of such a lizard the doctor said she has drawn it standing on its hind legs thats right mike bowman said she said it walked on its hind legs dr cruz frowned he stared at the picture a while longer i am not an expert ive asked for dr guitierrez to visit us here he is a senior researcher at the reserva biologica de carara which is across the bay perhaps he can identify the animal for us isnt there someone from cabo blanco bowman asked thats where she was bitten unfortunately not dr cruz said cabo blanco has no permanent staff and no researcher has worked there for some time you were probably the first people to walk on that beach in several months but i am sure you will find dr guitierrez to be knowledgeable dr guitierrez turned out to be a bearded man wearing khaki shorts and shirt the surprise was that he was american he was introduced to the bowmans saying in a soft southern accent mr and mrs bowman how you doing nice to meet you and then explaining that he was a field biologist from yale who had worked in costa rica for the last five years marty guitierrez examined tina thoroughly lifting her arm gently peering closely at each of the bites with a penlight then measuring them with a small pocket ruler after a while guitierrez stepped away nodding to himself as if he had understood something he then inspected the polaroids and asked several questions about the saliva which cruz told him was still being tested in the lab finally he turned to mike bowman and his wife waiting tensely i think tinas going to be fine i just want to be clear about a few details he said making notes in a precise band your daughter says she was bitten by a green lizard approximately one foot high which walked upright onto the beach from the mangrove swamp thats right yes and the lizard made some kind of a vocalization tina said it chirped or squeaked like a mouse would you say yes well then dr guitierrez said i know this lizard he explained that of the six thousand species of lizards in the world no more than a dozen species walked upright of those species only four were found in latin america and judging by the coloration the lizard could be only one of the four i am sure this lizard was a basiliscus amoratus a striped basilisk lizard found here in costa rica and also in honduras standing on their hind legs they are sometimes as tall as a foot are they poisonous no mrs bowman not at all guitierrez explained that the swelling in tinas arm was an allergic reaction according to the literature fourteen percent of people are strongly allergic to reptiles he said and your daughter seems to be one of them she was screaming she said it was so painful probably it was guitierrez said reptile saliva contains serotonin which causes tremendous pain he turned to cruz her blood pressure came down with antihistamines yes cruz said promptly serotonin guitierrez said no question still ellen bowman remained uneasy but why would a lizard bite her in the first place lizard bites are very common guitierrez said animal handlers in zoos get bitten all the time and just the other day i heard that a lizard had bitten an infant in her crib in amaloya about sixty miles from where you were so bites do occur im not sure why your daughter had so many bites what was she doing at the time nothing she said she was sitting pretty still because she didnt want to frighten it away sitting pretty still guitierrez said frowning he shook his head well i dont think we can say exactly what happened wild animals are unpredictable and what about the foamy saliva on her arm ellen said i keep thinking about rabies no no dr guitierrez said a reptile cant carry rabies mrs bowman your daughter has suffered an allergic reaction to the bite of a basilisk lizard nothing more serious mike bowman then showed guitierrez the picture that tina had drawn guitierrez nodded i would accept this as a picture of a basillsk lizard he said a few details are wrong of course the neck is much too long and she has drawn the hind legs with only three toes instead of five the tall is too thick and raised too high but otherwise this is a perfectly serviceable lizard of the kind we are talking about but tina specifically said the neck was long ellen bowman insisted and she said there were three toes on the foot tinas pretty observant mike bowman said im sure she is guitierrez said smiling but i still think your daughter was bitten by a common basilisk amoratus and had a severe herpetological reaction normal time course with medication is twelve hours she should be just fine in the morning in the modern laboratory in the basement of the clinica santa maria word was received that dr guitierrez had identified the animal that had bitten the american child as a harmless basilisk lizard immediately the analysis of the saliva was halted even though a preliminary fractionation showed several extremely high molecular weight proteins of unknown biological activity but the night technician was busy and he placed the saliva samples on the holding shelf of the refrigerator the next morning the day clerk checked the holding shelf against the names of discharged patients seeing that bowman christina l was scheduled for discharge that morning the clerk threw out the saliva samples at the last moment he noticed that one sample had the red tag which meant that it was to be forwarded to the university lab in san jose he retrieved the test tube from the wastebasket and sent it on its way go on say thank you to dr cruz ellen bowman said and pushed tina forward thank you dr cruz tina said i feel much better now she reached up and shook the doctors band then she said you have a different shirt for a moment dr cruz looked perplexed then he smiled thats right tina when i work all night at the hospital in the morning i change my shirt but not your tie no just my shirt ellen bowman said mike told you shes observant she certainly is dr cruz smiled and shook the little girls band gravely enjoy the rest of your holiday in costa rica tina i will the bowman family had started to leave when dr cruz said ob tina do you remember the lizard that bit you uhhuh you remember its feet uhhuh did it have any toes yes how many toes did it have three she said how do you know that because i looked she said anyway all the birds on the beach made marks in the sand with three toes like this she held up her hand middle three fingers spread wide and the lizard made those kind of marks in the sand too the lizard made marks like a bird uhhuh tina said he walked like a bird too he jerked his head like this up and down she took a few steps bobbing her head after the bowmans had departed dr cruz decided to report this conversation to guitierrez at the biological station i must admit the girls story is puzzling guitierrez said i have been doing some checking myself i am no longer certain she was bitten by a basilisk not certain at all then what could it be well guitierrez said lets not speculate prematurely by the way have you heard of any other lizard bites at the hospital no why let me know my friend if you do the beach marty guitierrez sat on the beach and watched the afternoon sun fall lower in the sky until it sparkled harshly on the water of the bay and its rays reached beneath the palm trees to where he sat among the mangroves on the beach of cabo blanco as best he could determine he was sitting near the spot where the american girl had been two days before although it was true enough as he had told the bowmans that lizard bites were common guitierrez had never heard of a basilisk lizard biting anyone and he had certainly never heard of anyone being hospitalized for a lizard bite then too the bite radius on tinas arm appeared slightly too large for a basilisk when he got back to the carara station he had checked the small research library there but found no reference to basilisk lizard bites next he checked international biosciences services a computer database in america but he found no references to basilisk bites or hospitalization for lizard bites he then called the medical officer in amaloya who confirmed that a ninedayold infant sleeping in its crib had been bitten on the foot by an animal the grandmotherthe only person actually to see itclaimed was a lizard subsequently the foot had become swollen and the infant had nearly died the grandmother described the lizard as green with brown stripes it had bitten the child several times before the woman frightened it away strange guitierrez had said no like all the others the medical officer replied adding that he had heard of other biting incidents a child in vasquez the next village up the coast had been bitten while sleeping and another in puerta sotrero all these incidents had occurred in the last two months all had involved sleeping children and infants such a new and distinctive pattern led guitierrez to suspect the presence of a previously unknown species of lizard this was particularly likely to happen in costa rica only seventyfive miles wide at its narrowest point the country was smaller than the state of maine yet within its limited space costa rica had a remarkable diversity of biological habitats seacoasts on both the atlantic and the pacific four separate mountain ranges including twelvethousandfoot peaks and active volcanoes rain forests cloud forests temperate zones swampy marshes and arid deserts such ecological diversity sustained an astonishing diversity of plant and animal life costa rica had three times as many species of birds as all of north america more than a thousand species of orchids more than five thousand species of insects new species were being discovered all the time at a pace that had increased in recent years for a sad reason costa rica was becoming deforested and as jungle species lost their habitats they moved to other areas and sometimes changed behavior as well so a new species was perfectly possible but along with the excitement of a new species was the worrisome possibility of new diseases lizards carried viral diseases including several that could be transmitted to man the most serious was central saurian encephalitis or cse which caused a form of sleeping sickness in human beings and horses guitierrez felt it was important to find this new lizard if only to test it for disease sitting on the beach he watched the sun drop lower and sighed perhaps tina bowman had seen a new animal and perhaps not certainly guitierrez had not earlier that morning he had taken the air pistol loaded the clip with ligamine darts and set out for the beach with high hopes but the day was wasted soon he would have to begin the drive back up the hill from the beach he did not want to drive that road in darkness guitierrez got to his feet and started back up the beach farther along he saw the dark shape of a howler monkey ambling along the edge of the mangrove swamp guitierrez moved away stepping out toward the water if there was one howler there would probably be others in the trees overhead arid howlers tended to urinate on intruders but this particular howler monkey seemed to be alone and walking slowly and pausing frequently to sit on its haunches the monkey had something in its mouth as guitierrez came closer he saw it was eating a lizard the tail and the hind legs drooped from the monkeys jaws even from a distance guitierrez could see the brown stripes against the green guitierrez dropped to the ground and aimed the pistol the howler monkey accustomed to living in a protected reserve stared curiously he did not run away even when the first dart whined harmlessly past him when the second dart struck deep in the thigh the howler shrieked in anger and surprise dropping the remains of its meal as it fled into the jungle guitierrez got to his feet and walked forward he wasnt worried about the monkey the tranquilizer dose was too small to give it anything but a few minutes of dizziness already he was thinking of what to do with his new find guitierrez himself would write the preliminary report but the remains would have to be sent back to the united states for final positive identification of course to whom should he send it the acknowledged expert was edward h simpson emeritus professor of zoology at columbia university in new york an elegant older man with sweptback white hair simpson was the worlds leading authority on lizard taxonomy probably marty thought he would send his lizard to dr simpson new york dr richard stone head of the tropical diseases laboratory of columbia university medical center often remarked that the name conjured up a grander place than it actually was in the early twentieth century when the laboratory occupied the entire fourth floor of the biomedical research building crews of technicians worked to eliminate the scourges of yellow fever malaria and cholera but medical successesand research laboratories in nairobi and sao paulohad left the tdl a much less important place than it once was now a fraction of its former size it employed only two fulltime technicians and they were primarily concerned with diagnosing illnesses of new yorkers who had traveled abroad the labs comfortable routine was unprepared for what it received that morning oh very nice the technician in the tropical diseases laboratory said as she read the customs label partially masticated fragment of unidentified costa rican lizard she wrinkled her nose this ones all yours dr stone richard stone crossed the lab to inspect the new arrival is this the material from ed simpsons lab yes she said but i dont know why theyd send a lizard to us his secretary called stone said simpsons on a field trip in borneo for the summer and because theres a question of communicable disease with this lizard she asked our lab to take a took at it lets see what weve got the white plastic cylinder was the size of a halfgallon milk container it had locking metal latches and a screw top it was labeled international biological specimen container and plastered with stickers and warnings in four languages the warnings were intended to keep the cylinder from being opened by suspicious customs officials apparently the warnings had worked as richard stone swung the big light over he could see the seals were still intact stone turned on the air handlers and pulled on plastic gloves and a face mask after all the lab had recently identified specimens contaminated with venezuelan equine fever japanese b encephalitis kyasanur forest virus langat virus and mayaro then he unscrewed the top there was the hiss of escaping gas and white smoke boiled out the cylinder turned frosty cold inside he found a plastic ziplock sandwich bag containing something green stone spread a surgical drape on the table and shook out the contents of the bag a piece of frozen flesh struck the table with a dull thud huh the technician said looks eaten yes it does stone said what do they want with us the technician consulted the enclosed documents lizard is biting local children they have a question about identification of the species and a concern about diseases transmitted from the bite she produced a childs picture of a lizard signed tina at the top one of the kids drew a picture of the lizard stone glanced at the picture obviously we cant verify the species stone said but we can check diseases easily enough if we can get any blood out of this fragment what are they calling this animal basiliscus amoratus with threetoed genetic anomaly she said reading okay stone said lets get started while youre waiting for it to thaw do an xray and take polaroids for the record once we have blood start running antibody sets until we get some matches let me know if theres a problem before lunchtime the lab had its answer the lizard blood showed no significant reactivity to any viral or bacterial antigen they had run toxicity profiles as well and they had found only one positive match the blood was mildly reactive to the venom of the indian king cobra but such crossreactivity was common among reptile species and dr stone did not think it noteworthy to include in the fax his technician sent to dr martin guitierrez that same evening there was never any question about identifying the lizard that would await the return of dr simpson he was not due back for several weeks and his secretary asked if the tdl would please store the lizard fragment in the meantime dr stone put it back in the ziplock bag and stuck it in the freezer martin guitierrez read the fax from the columbia medical centertropical diseases laboratory it was brief subject basiliscus amoratus with genetic anomaly forwarded from dr simpsons office materials posterior segment partially eaten animal procedures performed xray microscopic immunological rtx for viral parasitic bacterial disease findings no histologic or immunologic evidence for any communicable disease in man in this basiliscus amoratus sample signed richard a stone md director guitierrez made two assumptions based on the memo first that his identification of the lizard as a basilisk had been confirmed by scientists at columbia university and second that the absence of communicable disease meant the recent episodes of sporadic lizard bites implied no serious health hazards for costa rica on the contrary he felt his original views were correct that a lizard species had been driven from the forest into a new habitat and was coming into contact with village people guitierrez was certain that in a few more weeks the lizards would settle down and the biting episodes won end the tropical rain fell in great drenching sheets hammering the corrugated roof of the clinic in bahia anasco it was nearly midnight power had been lost in the storm and the midwife elena morales was working by flashlight when she heard a squeaking chirping sound thinking that it was a rat she quickly put a compress on the forehead of the mother and went into the next room to check on the newborn baby as her hand touched the doorknob she heard the chirping again and she relaxed evidently it was just a bird flying in the window to get out of the rain costa ricans said that when a bird came to visit a newborn child it brought good luck elena opened the door the infant lay in a wicker bassinet swaddled in a light blanket only its face exposed around the rim of the bassinet three darkgreen lizards crouched like gargoyles when they saw elena they cocked their heads and stared curiously at her but did not flee in the light of her flashlight elena saw the blood dripping from their snouts softly chirping one lizard bent down and with a quick shake of its head tore a ragged chunk of flesh from the baby elena rushed forward screaming and the lizards fled into the darkness but long before she reached the bassinet she could see what had happened to the infants face and she knew the child must be dead the lizards scattered into the rainy night chirping and squealing leaving behind only bloody threetoed tracks like birds the shape of the data later when she was calmer elena morales decided not to report the lizard attack despite the horror she had seen she began to worry that she might be criticized for leaving the baby unguarded so she told the mother that the baby had asphyxiated and she reported the death on the forms she sent to san jose as sids sudden infant death syndrome this was a syndrome of unexplained death among very young children it was unremarkable and her report went unchallenged the university lab in san jose that analyzed the saliva sample from tina bowmans arm made several remarkable discoveries there was as expected a great deal of serotonin but among the salivary proteins was a real monster molecular mass of one of the largest proteins known biological activity was still under study but it seemed to be a neurotoxic poison related to cobra venom although more primitive in structure the lab also detected trace quantities of the gammaamino metbionine hydrolase because this enzyme was a marker for genetic engineering and not found in wild animals technicians assumed it was a lab contaminant and did not report it when they called dr cruz the referring physician in puntarenas the lizard fragment rested in the freezer at columbia university awaiting the return of dr simpson who was not expected for at least a month and so things might have remained had not a technician named alice levin walked into the tropical diseases laboratory seen tina bowmans picture and said oh whose kid drew the dinosaur what richard stone said turning slowly toward her the dinosaur isnt that what it is my kid draws them all the time this is a lizard stone said from costa rica some girl down there drew a picture of it no alice levin said shaking her head look at it its very clear big head long neck stands on its hind legs thick tail its a dinosaur it cant be it was only a foot tall so there were little dinosaurs back then alice said believe me i know i have two boys im an expert the smallest dinosaurs were under a foot teenysaurus or something i dont know those names are impossible youll never learn those names if youre over the age of ten you dont understand richard stone said this is a picture of a contemporary animal they sent us a fragment of the animal its in the freezer now stone went and got it and shook it out of the baggie alice levin looked at the frozen piece of leg and tail and shrugged she didnt touch it i dont know she said but that looks like a dinosaur to me stone shook his head impossible why alice levin said it could be a leftover or a remnant or whatever they call them stone continued to shake his head alice was uninformed she was just a technician who worked in the bacteriology lab down the hall and she had an active imagination stone remembered the time when she thought she was being followed by one of the surgical orderlies you know alice levin said if this is a dinosaur richard it could be a big deal its not a dinosaur has anybody checked it no stone said well take it to the museum of natural history or something alice levin said you really should id be embarrassed you want me to do it for you she said no richard stone said i dont youre not going to do anything nothing at all he put the baggie back in the freezer and slammed the door its not a dinosaur its a lizard and whatever it is it can wait until dr simpson gets back from borneo to identify it thats final alice this lizards not going anywhere second iteration with subsequent drawings of the fractal curve sudden changes may appear ian malcom the shore of the inland sea alan grant crouched down his nose inches from the ground the temperature was over a hundred degrees his knees ached despite the ruglayers pads he wore his lungs burned from the harsh alkaline dust sweat dripped off his forehead onto the ground but grant was oblivious to the discomfort his entire attention was focused on the sixinch square of earth in front of him working patiently with a dental pick and an artists camel brush he exposed the tiny lshaped fragment of jawbone it was only an inch long and no thicker than his little finger the teeth were a row of small points and had the characteristic media angling bits of bone flaked away as he dug grant paused for a moment to paint the bone with rubber cement before continuing to expose it there was no question that this was the jawbone from an infant carnivorous dinosaur its owner had died seventynine million years ago at the age of about two months with any luck grant might find the rest of the skeleton as well if so it would be the first complete skeleton of a baby carnivore hey alan alan grant looked up blinking in the sunlight he pulled down his sunglasses and wiped his forehead with the back of his arm he was crouched on an eroded hillside in the badlands outside snakewater montana beneath the great blue bowl of sky blunted hills exposed outcroppings of crumbling limestone stretched for miles in every direction there was not a tree or a bush nothing but barren rock hot sun and whining wind visitors found the badlands depressingly bleak but when grant looked at this landscape he saw something else entirely this barren land was what remained of another very different world which had vanished eighty million years ago in his minds eye grant saw himself back in the warm swampy bayou that formed the shoreline of a great inland sea this inland sea was a thousand miles wide extending all the way from the newly upthrust rocky mountains to the sharp craggy peaks of the appalachians all of the american west was underwater at that time there were thin clouds in the sky overhead darkened by the smoke of nearby volcanoes the atmosphere was denser richer in carbon dioxide plants grew rapidly along the shoreline there were no fish in these waters but there were clams and snails pterosaurs swooped down to scoop algae from the surface a few carnivorous dinosaurs prowled the swampy shores of the lake moving among the palm trees and offshore was a small island about two acres in size ringed with dense vegetation this island formed a protected sanctuary where herds of herbivorous duckbilled dinosaurs laid their eggs in communal nests and raised their squeaking young over the millions of years that followed the pale green alkaline lake grew shallower and finally vanished the exposed land buckled and cracked under the heat and the offshore island with its dinosaur eggs became the eroded hillside in northern montana which alan grant was now excavating hey alan he stood a barrelchested bearded man of forty he heard the chugging of the portable generator and the distant clatter of the jackhammer cutting into the dense rock on the next hill he saw the kids working around the jackhammer moving away the big pieces of rock after checking them for fossils at the foot of the hill he saw the six tipis of his camp the flapping mess tent and the trailer that served as their field laboratory and he saw ellie waving to him from the shadow of the field laboratory visitor she called and pointed to the east grant saw the cloud of dust and the blue ford sedan bouncing over the rutted road toward them he glanced at his watch right on time on the other hill the kids looked up with interest they didnt get many visitors in snakewater and there had been a lot of speculation about what a lawyer from the environmental protection agency would want to see alan grant about but grant knew that paleontology the study of extinct life had in recent years taken on an unexpected relevance to the modern world the modem world was changing fast and urgent questions about the weather deforestation global warming or the ozone layer often seemed answerable at least in part with information from the past information that paleontologists could provide he had been called as an expert witness twice in the past few years grant started down the hill to meet the car the visitor coughed in the white dust as he slammed the car door bob morris epa he said extending his hand im with the san francisco office grant introduced himself and said you look hot want a beer jesus yeah morris was in his late twenties wearing a tie and pants from a business suit he carried a briefcase his wingtip shoes crunched on the rocks as they walked toward the trailer when i first came over the hill i thought this was an indian reservation morris said pointing to the tipis no grant said just the best way to live out here grant explained that in the first year of the excavations they had come out in north slope octahedral tents the most advanced available but the tents always blew over in the wind they tried other kinds of tents with the same result finally they started putting up tipis which were larger inside more comfortable and more stable in wind thesere blackfoot tipis built around four poles grant said sioux tipis are built around three but this used to be blackfoot territory so we thought uhhuh morris said very fitting he squinted at the desolate landscape and shook his head how long you been out here about sixty cases grant said when morris looked surprised he explained we measure time in beer we start in june with a hundred cases weve gone through about sixty so far sixtythree to be exact ellie sattler said as they reached the trailer grant was amused to see morris gaping at her ellie was wearing cutoff jeans and a workshirt tied at her midriff she was twentyfour and darkly tanned her blond hair was pulled back ellie keeps us going grant said introducing her shes very good at what she does what does she do morris asked paleobotany ellie said and i also do the standard field preps she opened the door and they went inside the air conditioning in the trailer only brought the temperature down to eightyfive degrees but it seemed cool after the midday beat the trailer had a series of long wooden tables with tiny bone specimens neatly laid out tagged and labeled farther along were ceramic dishes and crocks there was a strong odor of vinegar morris glanced at the bones i thought dinosaurs were big he said they were ellie said but everything you see here comes from babies snakewater is important primarily because of the number of dinosaur nesting sites here until we started this work there were hardly any infant dinosaurs known only one nest had ever been found in the gobi desert weve discovered a dozen different hadrosaur nests complete with eggs and bones of infants while grant went to the refrigerator she showed morris the acetic acid baths which were used to dissolve away the limestone from the delicate bones they look like chicken bones morris said peering into the ceramic dishes yes she said theyre very birdlike and what about those morris said pointing through the trailer window to piles of large bones outside wrapped in heavy plastic rejects ellie said bones too fragmentary when we took them out of the ground in the old days wed just discard them but nowadays we send them for genetic testing genetic testing morris said here you go grant said thrusting a beer into his band he gave another to ellie she chugged hers throwing her long neck back morris stared were pretty informal here grant said want to step into my office sure morris said grant led him to the end of the trailer where there was a torn couch a sagging chair and a battered endtable grant dropped onto the couch which creaked and exhaled a cloud of chalky dust he leaned back thumped his boots up on the endtable and gestured for morris to sit in the chair make yourself comfortable grant was a professor of paleontology at the university of denver and one of the foremost researchers in his field but he had never been comfortable with social niceties he saw himself as an outdoor man and he knew that all the important work in paleontology was done outdoors with your bands grant had little patience for the academics for the museum curators for what he called teacup dinosaur hunters and he took some pains to distance himself in dress and behavior from the teacup dinosaur hunters even delivering his lectures in jeans and sneakers grant watched as morris primly brushed off the seat of the chair before he sat down morris opened his briefcase rummaged through his papers and glanced back at ellie who was lifting bones with tweezers from the acid bath at the other end of the trailer paying no attention to them youre probably wondering why im here grant nodded its a long way to come mr morris well morris said to get right to the point the epa is concerned about the activities of the hammond foundation you receive some funding from them thirty thousand dollars a year grant said nodding for the last five years what do you know about the foundation morris said grant shrugged the hammond foundation is a respected source of academic grants they fund research all over the world including several dinosaur researchers i know they support bob kerry out of the tyrrell in alberta and john weller in alaska probably more do you know why the hammond foundation supports so much dinosaur research morris asked of course its because old john hammond is a dinosaur nut youve met hammond grant shrugged once or twice he comes here for brief visits hes quite elderly you know and eccentric the way rich people sometimes are but always very enthusiastic why well morris said the hammond foundation is actually a rather mysterious organization he pulled out a xeroxed world map marked with red dots and passed it to grant these are the digs the foundation financed last year notice anything odd about them montana alaska canada sweden theyre all sites in the north theres nothing below the fortyfifth parallel morris pulled out more maps its the same year after year dinosaur projects to the south in utah or colorado or mexico never get funded the hammond foundation only supports coldweather digs wed like to know why grant shuffled through the maps quickly if it was true that the foundation only supported coldweather digs then it was strange behavior because some of the best dinosaur researchers were working in hot climates and and there are other puzzles morris said for example what is the relationship of dinosaurs to amber amber yes its the hard yellow resin of dried tree sap i know what it is grant said but why are you asking because morris said over the last five years hammond has purchased enormous quantities of amber in america europe and asia including many pieces of museumquality jewelry the foundation has spent seventeen million dollars on amber they now possess the largest privately held stock of this material in the world i dont get it grant said neither does anybody else morris said as far as we can tell it doesnt make any sense at all amber is easily synthesized it has no commercial or defense value theres no reason to stockpile it but hammond has done just that over many years amber grant said shaking his head and what about his island in costa rica morris continued ten years ago the hammond foundation leased an island from the government of costa rica supposedly to set up a biological preserve i dont know anything about that grant said frowning i havent been able to find out much morris said the island is a hundred miles off the west coast its very rugged and its in an area of ocean where the combinations of wind and current make it almost perpetually covered in fog they used to call it cloud island isla nublar apparently the costa ricans were amazed that anybody would want it morris searched in his briefcase the reason i mention it he said is that according to the records you were paid a consultants fee in connection with this island i was grant said morris passed a sheet of paper to grant it was the xerox of a check issued in march from ingen inc farallon road palo alto california made out to alan grant in the amount of twelve thousand dollars at the lower corner the check was marked consultant servicescosta ricajuvenile hyperspace ob sure grant said i remember that it was weird as hell but i remember it and it didnt have anything to do with an island alan grant had found the first clutch of dinosaur eggs in montana in and many more in the next two years but he hadnt gotten around to publishing his findings until his paper with its report of a herd of ten thousand duckbilled dinosaurs living along the shore of a vast inland sea building communal nests of eggs in the mud raising their infant dinosaurs in the herd made grant a celebrity overnight the notion of maternal instincts in giant dinosaursand the drawings of cute babies poking their snouts out of the eggshad appeal around the world grant was besieged with requests for interviews lectures books characteristically he turned them all down wanting only to continue his excavations but it was during those frantic days of the mids that he was approached by the ingen corporation with a request for consulting services had you heard of ingen before morris asked no how did they contact you telephone call it was a man named gennaro or gennino something like that morris nodded donald gennaro he said hes the legal counsel for ingen anyway he wanted to know about eating habits of dinosaurs and he offered me a fee to draw up a paper for him grant drank his beer set the can on the floor gennaro was particularly interested in young dinosaurs infants and juveniles what they ate i guess he thought i would know about that did you not really no i told him that we had found lots of skeletal material but we had very little dietary data but gennaro said he knew we hadnt published everything and he wanted whatever we had and he offered a very large fee fifty thousand dollars morris took out a tape recorder and set it on the endtable you mind no go ahead so gennaro telephoned you in what happened then well grant said you see our operation here fifty thousand would support two full summers of digging i told him id do what i could so you agreed to prepare a paper for him yes on the dietary habits of juvenile dinosaurs yes you met gennaro no just on the phone did gennaro say why he wanted this information yes grant said he was planning a museum for children and he wanted to feature baby dinosaurs he said he was hiring a number of academic consultants and named them there were paleontologists like me and a mathematician from texas named ian malcolm and a couple of ecologists a systems analyst good group morris nodded making notes so you accepted the consultancy yes i agreed to send him a summary of our work what we knew about the habits of the duckbilled hadrosaurs wed found what kind of information did you send morris asked everything nesting behavior territorial ranges feeding behavior social behavior everything and how did gennaro respond he kept calling and calling sometimes in the middle of the night would the dinosaurs eat this would they eat that should the exhibit include this i could never understand why he was so worked up i mean i think dinosaurs are important too but not that important theyve been dead sixtyfive million years youd think his calls could wait until morning i see morris said and the fifty thousand dollars grant shook his head i got tired of gennaro and called the whole thing off we settled up for twelve thousand that must have been about the middle of morris made a note and ingen any other contact with them not since and when did the hammond foundation begin to fund your research id have to look grant said but it was around then mideighties and you know hammond as just a rich dinosaur enthusiast yes morris made another note look grant said if the epa is so concerned about john hammond and what hes doingthe dinosaur sites in the north the amber purchases the island in costa ricawhy dont you ust ask him about it at the moment we cant morris said why not grant said because we dont have any evidence of wrongdoing morris said but personally i think its clear john hammond is evading the law i was first contacted morris explained by the office of technology transfer the ott monitors shipments of american technology which might have military significance they called to say that ingen had two areas of possible illegal technology transfer first ingen shipped three cray xmps to costa rica ingen characterized it as transfer within corporate divisions and said they werent for resale but ott couldnt imagine why the hell somebodyd need that power in costa rica three crays grant said is that a kind of computer morris nodded very powerful supercomputers to put it in perspective three crays represent more computing power than any other privately held company in america and ingen sent the machines to costa rica you have to wonder why i give up why grant said nobody knows and the hoods are even more worrisome morris continued hoods are automated gene sequencersmachines that work out the genetic code by themselves theyre so new that they havent been put on the restricted lists yet but any genetic engineering lab is likely to have one if it can afford the halfmilliondollar price tag he flipped through his notes well it seems ingen shipped twentyfour hood sequencers to their island in costa rica again they said it was a transfer within divisions and not an export morris said there wasnt much that ott could do theyre not officially concerned with use but ingen was obviously setting up one of the most powerful genetic engineering facilities in the world in an obscure central american country a country with no regulations that kind of thing has happened before there had already been cases of american bioenginecring companies moving to another country so they would not be hampered by regulations and rules the most flagrant morris explained was the biosyn rabies case in genetic biosyn corporation of cupertino tested a bioengineered rabies vaccine on a farm in chile they didnt inform the government of chile or the farm workers involved they simply released the vaccine the vaccine consisted of live rabies virus genetically modified to be nonvirulent but the virulence hadnt been tested biosyn didnt know whether the virus could still cause rabies or not even worse the virus had been modified ordinarily you couldnt contract rabies unless you were bitten by an animal but biosyn modified the rabies virus to cross the pulmonary alveoli you could get an infection just inhaling it biosyn staffers brought this live rabies virus down to chile in a carryon bag on a commercial airline flight morris often wondered what would have happened if the capsule had broken open during the flight everybody on the plane might have been infected with rabies it was outrageous it was irresponsible it was criminally negligent but no action was taken against biosyn the chilean farmers who unwittingly risked their lives were ignorant peasants the government of chile had an economic crisis to worry about and the american authorities had no jurisdiction so lewis dodgson the geneticist responsible for the test was still working at biosyn biosyn was still as reckless as ever and other american companies were hurrying to set up facilities in foreign countries that lacked sophistication about genetic research countries that perceived genetic engineering to be like any other hightech development and thus welcomed it to their lands unaware of the dangers posed so thats why we began our investigation of ingen morris said about three weeks ago and what have you actually found grant said not much morris admitted when i go back to san francisco well probably have to close the investigation and i think im about finished here he started packing up his briefcase by the way what does juvenile hyperspace mean thats just a fancy label for my report grant said hyperspace is a term for multidimensional spacelike threedimensional tictactoe i you were to take all the behaviors of an animal its eating and movement and sleeping you could plot the animal within the multidimensional space some paleontologists refer to the behavior of an animal as occurring in an ecological hyperspace juvenile hyperspace would just refer to the behavior of juvenile dinosaursif you wanted to be as pretentious as possible at the far end of the trailer the phone rang ellie answered it she said hes in a meeting right now can he call you back morris snapped his briefcase shut and stood thanks for your help and the beer he said no problem grant said grant walked with morris down the trailer to the door at the far end morris said did hammond ever ask for any physical materials from your site bones or eggs or anything like that no grant said dr sattler mentioned you do some genetic work here well not exactly grant said when we remove fossils that are broken or for some other reason not suitable for museum preservation we send the bones out to a lab that grinds them up and tries to extract proteins for us the proteins are then identified and the report is sent back to us which lab is that morris asked medical biologic services in salt lake howd you choose them competitive bids the lab has nothing to do with ingen morris asked not that i know grant said they came to the door of the trailer grant opened it and felt the rush of hot air from outside morris paused to put on his sunglasses one last thing morris said suppose ingen wasnt really making a museum exhibit is there anything else they could have done with the information in the report you gave them grant laughed sure they could feed a baby hadrosaur morris laughed too a baby hadrosaur thatd be something to see how big were they about so grant said holding his hands six inches apart squirrelsize and how long before they become fullgrown three years grant said give or take morris held out his band well thanks again for your help take it easy driving back grant said he watched for a moment as morris walked back toward his car and then closed the trailer door grant said what did you think ellie shrugged naive you like the part where john hammond is the evil archvillain grant laughed john hammonds about as sinister as walt disney by the way who called oh ellie said it was a woman named alice levin she works at columbia medical center you know her grant shook his head no well it was something about identifying some remains she wants you to call her back right away skeleton ellie sattler brushed a strand of blond hair back from her face and turned her attention to the acid baths she had six in a row at molar strengths from to percent she had to keep an eye on the stronger solutions because they would eat through the limestone and begin to erode the bones and infantdinosaur bones were so fragile she marveled that they had been preserved at all after eighty million years she listened idly as grant said miss levin this is alan grant whats this about a you have what a what he began to laugh oh i doubt that very much miss levin no i really dont have time im sorry well id take a look at it but i can pretty much guarantee its a basilisk lizard but yes you can do that all right send it now grant hung up and shook his head these people ellie said whats it about some lizard shes trying to identify grant said shes going to fax me an xray he walked over to the fax and waited as the transmission came through incidentally ive got a new find for you a good one yes grant nodded found it just before the kid showed up on south hill horizon four infant velociraptor jaw and complete dentition so theres no question about identity and the site looks undisturbed we might even get a full skeleton thats fantastic ellie said how young young grant said two maybe four months at most and its definitely a velociraptor definitely grant said maybe our luck has finally turned for the last two years at snakewater the team had excavated only duckbilled hadrosaurs they already had evidence for vast herds of these grazing dinosaurs roaming the cretaceous plains in groups of ten or twenty thousand as buffalo would later roam but increasingly the question that faced them was where were the predators they expected predators to be rare of course studies of predatorprey populations in the game parks of africa and india suggested that roughly speaking there was one predatory carnivore for every four hundred herbivores that meant a herd of ten thousand duckbills would support only twentyfive tyrannosaurs so it was unlikely that they would find the remains of a large predator but where were the smaller predators snakewater had dozens of nesting sitesin some places the ground was literally covered with fragments of dinosaur eggshellsand many small dinosaurs ate eggs animals like dromaeosaurus oviraptor velociraptor and coeluruspredators three to six feet tallmust have been found here in abundance but they had discovered none so far perhaps this velociraptor skeleton did mean their luck had changed and an infant ellie knew that one of grants dreams was to study infantrearing behavior in carnivorous dinosaurs as he had already studied the behavior of herbivores perhaps this was the first step toward that dream you must be pretty excited ellie said grant didnt answer i said you must be excited ellie repeated my god grant said he was staring at the fax ellie looked over grants shoulder at the xray and breathed out slowly you think its an amassicus yes grant said or a triassicus the skeleton is so light but its no lizard she said no grant said this is not a lizard no threetoed lizard has walked on this planet for two hundred million years ellies first thought was that she was looking at a hoaxan ingenious skillful hoax but a hoax nonetheless every biologist knew that the threat of a hoax was omnipresent the most famous hoax the piltdown man had gone undetected for forty years and its perpetrator was still unknown more recently the distinguished astronomer fred hoyle had claimed that a fossil winged dinosaur archaeopteryx on display in the british museum was a fraud it was later shown to be genuine the essence of a successful hoax was that it presented scientists with what they expected to see and to ellies eye the xray image of the lizard was exactly correct the threetoed foot was well balanced with the medial claw smallest the bony remnants of the fourth and fifth toes were located up near the metatarsal joint the tibia was strong and considerably longer than the femur at the hip the acetabulum was complete the tail showed fortyfive vertebrae it was a procompsognathus could this xray be faked i dont know grant said but its almost impossible to fake an xray and procompsognathus is an obscure animal even people familiar with dinosaurs have never heard of it ellie read the note specimen acquired on the beach of cabo blanco july apparently a howler monkey was eating the animal and this was all that was recovered oh and it says the lizard attacked a little girl i doubt that grant said but perhaps procompsognathus was so small and light we assume it must be a scavenger only feeding off dead creatures and you can tell the sizehe measured quicklyits about twenty centimeters to the hips which means the full animal would be about a foot tall about as big as a chicken even a child would look pretty fearsome to it it might bite an infant but not a child ellie frowned at the xray image you think this could really be a legitimate rediscovery she said like the coelacanth maybe grant said the coelacanth was a fivefootlong fish thought to have died out sixtyfive million years ago until a specimen was pulled from the ocean in but there were other examples the australian mountain pygmy possum was known only from fossils until a live one was found in a garbage can in melbourne and a tenthousandyearold fossil fruit bat from new guinea was described by a zoologist who not long afterward received a living specimen in the mail but could it be real she persisted what about the age grant nodded the age is a problem most rediscovered animals were rather recent additions to the fossil record ten or twenty thousand years old some were a few million years old in the case of the coelacanth sixtyfive million years old but the specimen they were looking at was much much older than that dinosaurs had died out in the cretaceous period sixtyfive million years ago they had flourished as the dominant life form on the planet in the jurassic million years ago and they had first appeared in the triassic roughly million years ago it was during the early triassic period that procompsognathus had liveda time so distant that our planet didnt even look the same all the continents were joined together in a single landmass called pangaca which extended from the north to the south polea vast continent of ferns and forests with a few large deserts the atlantic ocean was a narrow lake between what would become africa and florida the air was denser the land was warmer there were hundreds of active volcanoes and it was in this environment that procompsognathus lived well ellie said we know animals have survived crocodiles are basically triassic animals living in the present sharks are triassic so we know it has happened before grant nodded and the thing is he said how else do we explain it its either a fakewhich i doubtor else its a rediscovery what else could it be the phone rang alice levin again grant said lets see if shell send us the actual specimen he answered it and looked at ellie surprised yes ill hold for mr hammond yes of course hammond what does he want ellie said grant shook his head and then said into the phone yes mr hammond yes its good to hear your voice tooyes he looked at ellie oh you did oh yes is that right he cupped his hand over the mouthpiece and said still as eccentric as ever youve got to hear this grant pushed the speaker button and ellie heard a raspy oldmans voice speaking rapidly hell of an annoyance from some epa fellow seems to have gone off half cocked all on his own running around the country talking to people stirring up things i dont suppose anybodys come to see you way out there as a matter of fact grant said somebody did come to see me hammond snorted i was afraid of that smartass kid named morris yes his name was morris grant said hes going to see all our consultants hammond said he went to see ian malcolm the other dayyou know the mathematician in texas thats the first i knew of it were having one hell of a time getting a handle on this thing its typical of the way government operates there isnt any complaint there isnt any charge just harassment from some kid whos unsupervised and is running around at the taxpayers expense did he bother you disrupt your work no no he didnt bother me well thats too bad in a way hammond said because id try and get an injunction to stop him if he had as it is i had our lawyers call over at epa to find out what the hell their problem is the head of the office claims he didnt know there was any investigation you figure that one out damned bureaucracy is all it is hell i think this kids trying to get down to costa rica poke around get onto our island you know we have an island down there no grant said looking at ellie i didnt know oh yes we bought it and started our operation oh four or five years ago now i forget exactly called isla nublarbig island hundred miles offshore going to be a biological preserve wonderful place tropical jungle you know you ought to see it dr grant sounds interesting grant said but actually its almost finished now you know hammond said ive sent you some material about it did you get my material no but were pretty far from maybe itll come today look it over the islands just beautiful its got everything weve been in construction now thirty months you can imagine big park opens in september next year you really ought to go see it it sounds wonderful but as a matter of fact hammond said im going to insist you see it dr grant i know youd find it right up your alley youd find it fascinating im in the middle of grant said say ill tell you what hammond said as if the idea had just occurred to him im having some of the people who consulted for us go down there this weekend spend a few days and look it over at our expense of course itd be terrific if youd give us your opinion i couldnt possibly grant said oh just for a weekend hammond said with the irritating cheery persistence of an old man thats all im talking about dr grant i wouldnt want to interrupt your work i know how important that work is believe me i know that never interrupt your work but you could hop on down there this weekend and be back on monday no i couldnt grant said ive just found a new skeleton and yes fine but i still think you should come hammond said not really listening and weve just received some evidence for a very puzzling and remarkable find which seems to be a living procompsognathid a what hammond said slowing down i didnt quite get that you said a living procompsognathid thats right grant said its a biological specimen a partial fragment of an animal collected from central america a living animal you dont say hammond said a living animal how extraordinary yes grant said we think so too so you see this isnt the time for me to be leaving central america did you say yes where in central america is it from do you know a beach called cabo blanco i dont know exactly where i see hammond cleared his throat and when did this ah specimen arrive in your hands just today today i see today i see yes hammond cleared his throat again grant looked at ellie and mouthed whats going on ellie shook her head sounds upset grant mouthed see if morris is still here she went to the window and looked out but morriss car was gone she turned back on the speaker hammond coughed ah dr grant have you told anybody about it yet no good thats good well yes ill tell you frankly dr grant im having a little problem about this island this epa thing is coming at just the wrong time hows that grant said well weve had our problems and some delays lets just say that im under a little pressure here and id like you to look at this island for me give me your opinion ill be paying you the usual weekend consultant rate of twenty thousand a day thatd be sixty thousand for three days and if you can spare dr sattler shell go at the same rate we need a botanist what do you say ellie looked at grant as he said well mr hammond that much money would fully finance our expeditions for the next two summers good good hammond said blandly he seemed distracted now his thoughts elsewhere i want this to be easy now im sending the corporate jet to pick you up at that private airfield cast of choteau you know the one i mean its only about two hours drive from where you are you be there at five pm tomorrow and ill be waiting for you take you right down can you and dr sattler make that plane i guess we can good pack lightly you dont need passports im looking forward to it see you tomorrow hammond said and he hung up cowan swain and ross midday sun streamed into the san francisco law offices of cowan swain and ross giving the room a cheerfulness that donald gennaro did not feel he listened on the phone and looked at his boss daniel ross cold as an undertaker in his dark pinstripe suit i understand john gennaro said and grant agreed to come good good yes that sounds fine to me my congratulations john he hung up the phone and turned to ross we cant trust hammond any more hes under too much pressure the epas investigating him hes behind schedule on his costa rican resort and the investors are getting nervous there have been too many rumors of problems down there too many workmen have died and now this business about a living procompsitwhatever on the mainland what does that mean ross said maybe nothing gennaro said but hamachi is one of our principal investors i got a report last week from hamachis representative in san jose the capital of costa rica according to the report some new kind of lizard is biting children on the coast ross blinked new lizard yes gennaro said we cant screw around with this weve got to inspect that island right away ive asked hammond to arrange independent site inspections every week for the next three weeks and what does hammond say he insists nothing is wrong on the island claims he has all these security precautions but you dont believe him ross said no gennaro said i dont donald gennaro had come to cowan swain from a background in investment banking cowan swains hightech clients frequently needed capitalization and gennaro helped them find the money one of his first assignments back in had been to accompany john hammond while the old man then nearly seventy put together the funding to start the ingen corporation they eventually raised almost a billion dollars and gcnnaro remembered it as a wild ride hammonds a dreamer gennaro said a potentially dangerous dreamer ross said we should never have gotten involved what is our financial position the firm gennaro said owns five percent general or limited general ross shook his head we should never have done that it seemed wise at the time gennaro said hell it was eight years ago we took it in lieu of some fees and if you remember hammonds plan was extremely speculative he was really pushing the envelope nobody really thought he could pull it off but apparently he has ross said in any case i agree that an inspection is overdue what about your site experts im starting with experts hammond already hired as consultants early in the project gennaro tossed a list onto rosss desk first group is a paleontologist a paleobotanist and a mathematician they go down this weekend ill go with them will they tell you the truth ross said i think so none of them had much to do with the island and one of themthe mathematician ian malcolmwas openly hostile to the project from the start insisted it would never work could never work and who else just a technical person the computer system analyst review the parks computers and fix some bugs he should be there by friday morning fine ross said youre making the arrangements hammond asked to place the calls himself i think he wants to pretend that hes not in trouble that its just a social invitation showing off his island all right ross said but just make sure it happens stay on top of it i want this costa rican situation resolved within a week ross got up and walked out of the room gennaro dialed heard the whining hiss of a radiophone then he heard a voice say grant here hi dr grant this is donald gennaro im the general counsel for ingen we talked a few years back i dont know if you remember i remember grant said well gennaro said i just got off the phone with john hammond who tells me the good news that youre coming down to our island in costa rica yes grant said i guess were going down there tomorrow well i just want to extend my thanks to you for doing this on short notice everybody at ingen appreciates it weve asked fan malcolm who like you was one of the early consultants to come down as well hes the mathematician at ut in austin john hammond mentioned that grant said well good gennaro said and ill be coming too as a matter of fact by the way this specimen you have found of a pro procom what is it procompsognathus grant said yes do you have the specimen with you dr grant the actual specimen no grant said ive only seen an xray the specimen is in new york a woman from columbia university called me well i wonder if you could give me the details on that gennaro said then i can run down that specimen for mr hammond whos very excited about it im sure you want to see the actual specimens too perhaps i can even get it delivered to the island while youre all down there gennaro said grant gave him the information well thats fine dr grant gennaro said my regards to dr sattler i look forward to meeting you and him tomorrow and gennaro hung up plans this just came ellie said the next day walking to the back of the trailer with a thick manila envelope one of the kids brought it back from town its from hammond grant noticed the blueandwhite ingen logo as he tore open the envelope inside there was no cover letter just a bound stack of paper pulling it out he discovered it was blueprints they were reduced forming a thick book the cover was marked isla nublar resort guest facilities full set safari lodge what the hell is this he said as he flipped open the book a sheet of paper fell out dear alan and ellie as you can imagine we dont have much in the way of formal promotional materials yet but this should give you some idea of the isla nublar project i think its very exciting looking forward to discussing this with you hope you can join us regards john i dont get it grant said he flipped through the sheets these are architectural plans he turned to the top sheet visitor centerlodge isla nublar resort client ingen inc palo alto calif architects dunning murphy amp associates new york richard murphy design partner theodore chen senior designer sheldon james administrative partner engineers harlow whitney amp fields boston structural atmisikawa osaka mechanical landscaping shepperton rogers london aashikiga h ieyasu kanazawa electrical n v kobayashi tokyo a r makasawa senior consultant computer cc integrated computer systems inc cambridge mass dennis nedry project supervisor grant turned to the plans themselves they were stamped industrial secrets do not copy and confidential work productnot for distribution each sheet was numbered and at the top these plans represent the confidential creations of ingen inc you must have signed document a or you risk prosecution looks pretty paranoid to me he said maybe theres a reason ellie said the next page was a topographical map it showed isla nublar as an inverted teardrop bulging at the north tapering at the south the island was eight miles long and the map divided it into several large sections the northern section was marked visitor area and it contained structures marked visitor arrivals visitor centeradministration powerdesalinizationsupport hammond res and safari lodge grant could see the outline of a swimming pool the rectangles of tennis courts and the round squiggles that represented planting and shrubbery looks like a resort all right ellie said there followed detail sheets for the safari lodge itself in the elevation sketches the lodge looked dramatic a long low building with a series of pyramid shapes on the roof but there was little about the other buildings in the visitor area and the rest of the island was even more mysterious as far as grant could tell it was mostly open space a network of roads tunnels and outlying buildings and a long thin lake that appeared to be manmade with concrete dams and barriers but for the most part the island was divided into big curving areas with very little development at all each area was marked by codes pprocva dtriclai lnothnca and vv hadrx a db is there an explanation for the codes she said grant flipped the pages rapidly but he couldnt find one maybe they took it out she said im telling you grant said paranoid he looked at the big curving divisions separated from one another by the network of roads there were only six divisions on the whole island and each division was separated from the road by a concrete moat outside each moat was a fence with a little lightning sign alongside it that mystified them until they were finally able to figure out it meant the fences were electrified thats odd she said electrified fences at a resort miles of them grant said electrified fences and moats together and usually with a road alongside them as well just like a zoo ellie said they went back to the topographical map and looked closely at the contour lines the roads had been placed oddly the main road ran northsoutb right through the central hills of the island including one section of road that seemed to be literally cut into the side of a cliff above a river it began to look as if there had been a deliberate effort to leave these open areas as big enclosures separated from the roads by moats and electric fences and the roads were raised up above ground level so you could see over the fences you know ellie said some of these dimensions are enormous look at this this concrete moat is thirty feet wide thats like a military fortification so are these buildings grant said he had noticed that each open division had a few buildings usually located in outoftheway corners but the buildings were all concrete with thick walls in sideview elevations they looked like concrete bunkers with small windows like the nazi pillboxes from old war movies at that moment they heard a muffled explosion and grant put the papers aside back to work he said fire there was a slight vibration and then yellow contour lines traced across the computer screen this time the resolution was perfect and alan grant had a glimpse of the skeleton beautifully defined the long neck arched back it was unquestionably an infant velociraptor and it looked in perfect the screen went blank i hate computers grant said squinting in the sun what happened now lost the integrator input one of the kids said just a minute the kid bent to look at the tangle of wires going into the back of the batterypowered portable computer they had set the computer up on a beer carton on top of hill four not far from the device they called thumper grant sat down on the side of the hill and looked at his watch he said to ellie were going to have to do this the oldfashioned way one of the kids overheard aw alan look grant said ive got a plane to catch and i want the fossil protected before i go once you began to expose a fossil you had to continue or risk losing it visitors imagined the landscape of the badlands to be unchanging but in fact it was continuously eroding literally right before your eyes all day long you could hear the clatter of pebbles rolling down the crumbling hillside and there was always the risk of a rainstorm even a brief shower would wash away a delicate fossil thus grants partially exposed skeleton was at risk and it had to be protected until he returned fossil protection ordinarily consisted of a tarp over the site and a trench around the perimeter to control water runoff the question was how large a trench the velociraptor fossil required to decide that they were using computerassisted sonic tomography or cast this was a new procedure in which thumper fired a soft lead slug into the ground setting up shock waves that were read by the computer and assembled into a kind of xray image of the hillside they had been using it all summer with varying results thumper was twenty feet away now a big silver box on wheels with an umbrella on top it looked like an icecream vendors pushcart parked incongruously on the badlands thumper had two youthful attendants loading the next soft lead pellet so far the cast program merely located the extent of finds helping grants team to dig more efficiently but the kids claimed that within a few years it would be possible to generate an image so detailed that excavation would he redundant you could get a perfect image of the bones in three dimensions and it promised a whole new era of archaeology without excavation but none of that had happened yet and the equipment that worked flawlessly in the university laboratory proved pitifully delicate and fickle in the field how much longer grant said we got it now alan its not bad grant went to look at the computer screen he saw the complete skeleton traced in bright yellow it was indeed a young specimen the outstanding characteristic of velociraptorthe singletoed claw which in a fullgrown animal was a curved sixinchlong weapon capable of ripping open its preywas in this infant no larger than the thorn on a rosebush it was hardly visible at all on the screen and velociraptor was a lightly built dinosaur in any case an animal as fineboned as a bird and presumably as intelligent here the skeleton appeared in perfect order except that the head and neck were bent back toward the posterior such neck flexion was so common in fossils that some scientists had formulated a theory to explain it suggesting that the dinosaurs had become extinct because they had been poisoned by the evolving alkaloids in plants the twisted neck was thought to signify the death agony of the dinosaurs grant had finally put that one to rest by demonstrating that many species of birds and reptiles underwent a postmortem contraction of posterior neck ligaments which bent the head backward in a characteristic way it had nothing to do with the cause of death it had to do with the way a carcass dried in the sun grant saw that this particular skeleton had also been twisted laterally so that the right leg and foot were raised up above the backbone it looks kind of distorted one of the kids said but i dont think its the computer no grant said its just time lots and lots of time grant knew that people could not imagine geological time human life was lived on another scale of time entirely an apple turned brown in a few minutes silverware turned black in a few days a compost heap decayed in a season a child grew up in a decade none of these everyday human experiences prepared people to be able to imagine the meaning of eighty million years the length of time that had passed since this little animal had died in the classroom grant had tried different comparisons if you imagined the human lifespan of sixty years was compressed to an hour then eighty million years would still be yearsolder than the pyramids the velociraptor had been dead a long time doesnt look very fearsome one of the kids said he wasnt grant said at least not until he grew up probably this baby had scavenged feeding off carcasses slain by the adults after the big animals had gorged themselves and lay basking in the sun carnivores could eat as much as percent of their body weight in a single meal and it made them sleepy afterward the babies would chitter and scramble over the indulgent somnolent bodies of the adults and nip little bites from the dead animal the babies were probably cute little animals but an adult velociraptor was another matter entirely pound for pound a velociraptor was the most rapacious dinosaur that ever lived although relatively smallabout two hundred pounds the size of a leopardvelociraptors were quick intelligent and vicious able to attack with sharp jaws powerful clawed forearms and the devastating single claw on the foot velociraptors hunted in packs and grant thought it must have been a sight to see a dozen of these animals racing at full speed leaping onto the back of a much larger dinosaur tearing at the neck and slashing at the ribs and belly were running out of time ellie said bringing him back grant gave instructions for the trench from the computer image they knew the skeleton lay in a relatively confined area a ditch around a twometer square would be sufficient meanwhile ellie lashed down the tarp that covered the side of the hill grant helped her pound in the final stakes how did the baby die one of the kids asked i doubt well know grant replied infant mortality in the wild is high in african parks it runs seventy percent among some carnivores it could have been anything disease separation from the group anything or even attack by an adult we know these animals hunted in packs but we dont know anything about their social behavior in a group the students nodded they had all studied animal behavior and they knew for example that when a new male took over a lion pride the first thing he did was kill all the cubs the reason was apparently genetic the male had evolved to disseminate his genes as widely as possible and by killing the cubs he brought all the females into heat so that he could impregnate them it also prevented the females from wasting their time nurturing the offspring of another male perhaps the velociraptor hunting pack was also ruled by a dominant male they knew so little about dinosaurs grant thought after years of research and excavation all around the world they still knew almost nothing about what the dinosaurs had really been like weve got to go ellie said if were going to get to choteau by five hammond gennaros secretary bustled in with a new suitcase it still had the sales tags on it you know mr gennaro she said severely when you forget to pack it makes me think you dont really want to go on this trip maybe youre right gennaro said im missing my kids birthday saturday was amandas birthday and elizabeth had invited twenty screaming fouryearolds to share it as well as cappy the clown and a magician his wife hadnt been happy to hear that gennaro was going out of town neither was amanda well i did the best i could on short notice his secretary said theres running shoes your size and khaki shorts and shirts and a shaving kit a pair of jeans and a sweatshirt if it gets cold the car is downstairs to take you to the airport you have to leave now to make the flight she left gennaro walked down the hallway tearing the sales tags off the suitcase as he passed the allglass conference room dan ross left the table and came outside have a good trip ross said but lets be very clear about one thing i dont know how bad this situation actually is donald but if theres a problem on that island burn it to the ground jesus dan were talking about a big investment dont hesitate dont think about it just do it hear me gennaro nodded i hear you he said but hammond screw hammond ross said my boy my boy the familiar raspy voice said how have you been my boy very well sir gennaro replied he leaned back in the padded leather chair of the gulfstream ii jet as it flew east toward the rocky mountains you never call me any more hammond said reproachfully ive missed you donald how is your lovely wife shes fine elizabeths fine we have a little girl now wonderful wonderful children are such a delight shed get a kick out of our new park in costa rica gennaro had forgotten how short hammond was as he sat in the chair his feet didnt touch the carpetinghe swung his legs as he talked there was a childlike quality to the man even though hammond must now be what seventyfive seventysix something like that he looked older than gennaro remembered but then gennaro hadnt seen him for almost five years hammond was flamboyant a born showman and back in he had had an elephant that he carried around with him in a little cage the elephant was nine inches high and a foot long and perfectly formed except his tusks were stunted hammond took the elephant with him to fundraising meetings gennaro usually carried it into the room the cage covered with a little blanket like a tea cozy and hammond would give his usual speech about the prospects for developing what he called consumer biologicals then at the dramatic moment hammond would whip away the blanket to reveal the elephant and he would ask for money the elephant was always a rousing success its tiny body hardly bigger than a cats promised untold wonders to come from the laboratory of norman atherton the stanford geneticist who was hammonds partner in the new venture but as hammond talked about the elephant he left a great deal unsaid for example hammond was starting a genetics company but the tiny elephant hadnt been made by any genetic procedure atherton had simply taken a dwarfelephant embryo and raised it in an artificial womb with hormonal modifications that in itself was quite an achievement but nothing like what hammond hinted had been done also atherton hadnt been able to duplicate his miniature elephant and hed tried for one thing everybody who saw the elephant wanted one then too the elephant was prone to colds particularly during winter the sneezes coming through the little trunk filled hammond with dread and sometimes the elephant would get his tusks stuck between the bars of the cage and snort irritably as he tried to get free sometimes he got infections around the tusk line hammond always fretted that his elephant would die before atherton could grow a replacement hammond also concealed from prospective investors the fact that the elephants behavior had changed substantially in the process of miniaturization the little creature might look like an elephant but he acted like a vicious rodent quickmoving and meantempered hammond discouraged people from petting the elephant to avoid nipped fingers and although hammond spoke confidently of seven billion dollars in annual revenues by his project was intensely speculative hammond had vision and enthusiasm but there was no certainty that his plan would work at all particularly since norman atherton the brains behind the project bad terminal cancerwhich was a final point hammond neglected to mention even so with gennaros help hammond got his money between september of and november of john alfred hammond and his pachyderm portfolio raised million in venture capital to finance his proposed corporation international genetic technologies inc and they could have raised more except hammond insisted on absolute secrecy and he offered no return on capital for at least five years that scared a lot of investors off in the end theyd had to take mostly japanese consortia the japanese were the only investors who had the patience sitting in the leather chair of the jet gennaro thought about how evasive hammond was the old man was now ignoring the fact that gennaros law firm had forced this trip on him instead hammond behaved as if they were engaged in a purely social outing its too bad you didnt bring your family with you donald he said gennaro shrugged its my daughters birthday twenty kids already scheduled the cake and the clown you know how it is oh i understand hammond said kids set their hearts on things anyway is the park ready for visitors gennaro asked well not officially hammond said but the hotel is built so there is a place to stay and the animals of course the animals are all there all in their spaces gennaro said i remember in the original proposal you were hoping for a total of twelve ob were far beyond that we have two hundred and thirtyeight anmals donald two hundred and thirtyeight the old man giggled pleased at gennaros reaction you cant imagine it we have herds of them two hundred and thirtyeight how many species fifteen different species donald thats incredible gennaro said thats fantastic and what about all the other things you wanted the facilities the computers all of it all of it hammond said everything on that island is stateoftheart youll see for yourself donald its perfectly wonderful thats why this concern is so misplaced theres absolutely no problem with the island gennaro said then there should be absolutely no problem with an inspection and there isnt hammond said but it slows things down everything has to stop for the official visit youve had delays anyway youve postponed the opening oh that hammond tugged at the red silk handkerchief in the breast pocket of his sportcoat it was bound to happen bound to happen why gennaro asked well donald hammond said to explain that you have to go back to the initial concept of the resort the concept of the most advanced amusement park in the world combining the latest electronic and biological technologies im not talking about rides everybody has rides coney island has rides and these days everybody has animatronic environments the haunted house the pirate den the wild west the earthquakeeveryone has those things so we set out to make biological attractions living attractions attractions so astonishing they would capture the imagination of the entire world gennaro had to smile it was almost the same speech word for word that he had used on the investors so many years ago and we can never forget the ultimate object of the project in costa ricato make money hammond said staring out the windows of the jet lots and lots of money i remember gennaro said and the secret to making money in a park hammond said is to limit your personnel costs the food handlers ticket takers cleanup crews repair teams to make a park that runs with minimal staff that was why we invested in all the computer technologywe automated wherever we could i remember but the plain fact is hammond said when you put together all the animals and all the computer systems you run into snags who ever got a major computer system up and running on schedule nobody i know so youve just had normal startup delays yes thats right hammond said normal delays i heard there were accidents during construction gennaro said some workmen died yes there were several accidents hammond said and a total of three deaths two workers died building the cliff road one other died as a result of an earthmover accident in january but we havent had any accidents for months now he put his band on the younger mans arm donald he said believe me when i tell you that everything on the island is going forward as planned everything on that island is perfectly fine the intercom clicked the pilot said seat belts please were landing in choteau choteau choteau dry plains stretched away toward distant black buttes the afternoon wind blew dust and tumbleweed across the cracked concrete grant stood with ellie near the jeep and waited while the sleek grumman jet circled for a landing i hate to wait on the money men grant grumbled ellie shruggedgoes with the job although many fields of science such as physics and chemistry had become federally funded paleontology remained strongly dependent on private patrons quite apart from his own curiosity about the island in costa rica grant understood that if john hammond asked for his help he would give it that was how patronage workedhow it had always worked the little jet landed and rolled quickly toward them ellie shouldered her bag the iet came to a stop and a stewardess in a blue uniform opened the door inside he was surprised at how cramped it was despite the luxurious appointments grant had to hunch over as he went to shake hammonds hand dr grant and dr sattler hammond said its good of you to join us allow me to introduce my associate donald gennaro gennaro was a stocky muscular man in his midthirties wearing an armani suit and wireframe glasses grant disliked him on sight he shook hands quickly when ellie shook hands gennaro said in surprise youre a woman these things happen she said and grant thought she doesnt like him either hammond turned to gennaro you know of course what dr grant and dr sattler do they are paleontologists they dig up dinosaurs and then he began to laugh as if he found the idea very funny take your seats please the stewardess said closing the door immediately the plane began to move youll have to excuse us hammond said but we are in a bit of a rush donald thinks its important we get right down there the pilot announced four hours flying time to dallas where they would refuel and then go on to costa rica arriving the following morning and how long will we be in costa rica grant asked well that really depends gennaro said we have a few things to clear up take my word for it hammond said turning to grant well be down there no more than fortyeight hours grant buckled his seat belt this island of yours that were going toi havent heard anything about it before is it some kind of secret in a way hammond said we have been very very careful about making sure nobody knows about it until the day we finally open that island to a surprised and delighted public target of opportunity the biosyn corporation of cupertino california had never called an emergency meeting of its board of directors the ten directors now sitting in the conference room were irritable and impatient it was pm they had been talking among themselves for the last ten minutes but slowly had fallen silent shuffling papers looking pointedly at their watches what are we waiting for one asked one more lewis dodgson said we need one more he glanced at his watch ron meyers office had said he was coming up on the six oclock plane from san diego he should be here by now even allowing for traffic from the airport you need a quorum another director asked yes dodgson said we do that shut them up for a moment a quorum meant that they were going to be asked to make an important decision and god knows they were although dodgson would have preferred not to call a meeting at all but steingarten the head of biosyn was adamant youll have to get their agreement for this one lew he had said depending on who you talked to lewis dodgson was famous as the most aggressive geneticist of his generation or the most reckless thirtyfour balding hawkfaced and intense he had been dismissed by johns hopkins as a graduate student for planning gene therapy on human patients without obtaining the proper fda protocols hired by biosyn he had conducted the controversial rabies vaccine test in chile now he was the head of product development at biosyn which supposedly consisted of reverse engineering taking a competitors product tearing it apart learning how it worked and then making your own version in practice it involved industrial espionage much of it directed toward the ingen corporation in the s a few genetic engineering companies began to ask what is the biological equivalent of a sony walkman these companies werent interested in pharmaceuticals or health they were interested in entertainment sports leisure activities cosmetics and pets the perceived demand for consumer biologicals in the s was high ingen and biosyn were both at work in this field biosyn had already achieved some success engineering a new pale trout under contract to the department of fish and game of the state of idaho this trout was easier to spot in streams and was said to represent a step forward in angling at least it eliminated complaints to the fish and came department that there were no trout in the streams the fact that the pale trout sometimes died of sunburn and that its flesh was soggy and tasteless was not discussed biosyn was still working on that and the door opened and ron meyer entered the room slipped into a seat dodgson now had his quorum he immediately stood gentlemen he said were here tonight to consider a target of opportunity ingen dodgson quickly reviewed the background ingens startup in with japanese investors the purchase of three cray xmp supercomputers the purchase of isla nublar in costa rica the stockpiling of amber the unusual donations to zoos around the world from the new york zoological society to the rantbapur wildlife park in india despite all these clues dodgson said we still had no idea where ingen might be going the company seemed obviously focused on animals and they had hired researchers with an interest in the pastpaleoblologists dna phylogeneticists and so on then in ingen bought an obscure company called millipore plastic products in nashville tennessee this was an agribusiness company that had recently patented a new plastic with the characteristics of an avian eggshell this plastic could be shaped into an egg and used to grow chick embryos starting the following year ingen took the entire output of this millipore plastic for its own use dr dodgson this is all very interesting at the same time dodgson continued construction was begun on isla nublar this involved massive earthworks including a shallow lake two miles long in the center of the island plans for resort facilities were let out with a high degree of confidentiality but it appears that ingen has built a private zoo of large dimensions on the island one of the directors leaned forward and said dr dodgson so what its not an ordinary zoo dodgson said this zoo is unique in the world it seems that ingen has done something quite extraordinary they have managed to clone extinct animals from the past what animals animals that hatch from eggs and that require a lot of room in a zoo what animals dinosaurs dodgson said they are cloning dinosaurs the consternation that followed was entirely misplaced in dodgsons view the trouble with money men was that they didnt keep up they had invested in a field but they didnt know what was possible in fact there had been discussion of cloning dinosaurs in the technical literature as far back as with each passing year the manipulation of dna had grown easier genetic material had already been extracted from egyptian mummies and from the hide of a quagga a zebralike african animal that had become extinct in the s by it seemed possible that quagga dna might be reconstituted and a new animal grown if so it would be the first creature brought back from extinction solely by reconstruction of its dna if that was possible what else was also possible the mastodon the sabertoothed tiger the dodo or even a dinosaur of course no dinosaur dna was known to exist anywhere in the world but by grinding up large quantities of dinosaur bones it might be possible to extract fragments of dna formerly it was thought that fossilization eliminated all dna now that was recognized as untrue if enough dna fragments were recovered it might be possible to clone a living animal back in the technical problems had seemed daunting but there was no theoretical barrier it was merely difficult expensive and unlikely to work yet it was certainly possible if anyone cared to try ingen had apparently decided to try what they have done dodgson said is build the greatest single tourist attraction in the history of the world as you know zoos are extremely popular last year more americans visited zoos than all professional baseball and football games combined and the japanese love zoosthere are fifty zoos in japan and more being built and for this zoo ingen can charge whatever they want two thousand dollars a day ten thousand dollars a day and then there is the merchandising the picture books tshirts video games caps stuffed toys comic books and pets pets of course if ingen can make fullsize dinosaurs they can also make pygmy dinosaurs as household pets what child wont want a little dinosaur as a pet a little patented animal for their very own ingen will sell millions of them and ingen will engineer them so that these pet dinosaurs can only eat ingen pet food jesus somebody said exactly dodgson said the zoo is the centerpiece of an enormous enterprise you said these dinosaurs will be patented yes genetically engineered animals can now be patented the supreme court ruled on that in favor of harvard in ingen will own its dinosaurs and no one else can legally make them what prevents us from creating our own dinosaurs someone said nothing except that they have a fiveyear start itll be almost impossible to catch up before the end of the century he paused of course if we could obtain examples of their dinosaurs we could reverse engineer them and make our own with enough modifications in the dna to evade their patents can we obtain examples of their dinosaurs dodgson paused i believe we can yes somebody cleared his throat there wouldnt be anything illegal about it oh no dodgson said quickly nothing illegal im talking about a legitimate source of their dna a disgruntled employee or some trash improperly disposed of something like that do you have a legitimate source dr dodgson i do dodgson said but im afraid there is some urgency to the decision because ingen is experiencing a small crisis and my source will have to act within the next twentyfour hours a long silence descended over the room the men looked at the secretary taking notes and the tape recorder on the table in front of her i dont see the need for a formal resolution on this dodgson said just a sense of the room as to whether you feel i should proceed slowly the heads nodded nobody spoke nobody went on record they just nodded silently thank you for coming gentlemen dodgson said ill take it from here airport lewis dodgson entered the coffee shop in the departure building of the san francisco airport and looked around quickly his man was already there waiting at the counter dodgson sat down next to him and placed the briefcase on the floor between them youre late pal the man said he looked at the straw hat dodgson was wearing and laughed what is this supposed to be a disguise you never know dodgson said suppressing his anger for six months dodgson had patiently cultivated this man who had grown more obnoxious and arrogant with each meeting but there was nothing dodgson could do about tbatboth men knew exactly what the stakes were bioengineered dna was weight for weight the most valuable material in the world a single microscopic bacterium too small to see with the naked eye but containing the genes for a heartattack enzyme streptokinase or for iceminus which prevented frost damage to crops might be worth five billion dollars to the right buyer and that fact of life had created a bizarre new world of industrial espionage dodgson was especially skilled at it in he convinced a disgruntled geneticist to quit cetus for biosyn and take five strains of engineered bacteria with her the geneticist simply put a drop of each on the fingernails of one hand and walked out the door but ingen presented a tougher challenge dodgson wanted more than bacterial dna he wanted frozen embryos and he knew ingen guarded its embryos with the most elaborate security measures to obtain them he needed an ingen employee who had access to the embryos who was willing to steal them and who could defeat the security such a person was not easy to find dodgson had finally located a susceptible ingen employee earlier in the year although this particular person had no access to genetic material dodgson kept up the contact meeting the man monthly at carlos and charlies in silicon valley helping him in small ways and now that ingen was inviting contractors and advisers to visit the island it was the moment that dodgson had been waiting forbecause it meant his man would have access to embryos lets get down to it the man said ive got ten minutes before my flight you want to go over it again dodgson said hell no dr dodgson the man said i want to see the damn money dodgson flipped the latch on the briefcase and opened it a few inches the man glanced down casually thats all of it thats half of it seven hundred fifty thousand dollars okay fine the man turned away drank his coffee thats fine dr dodgson dodgson quickly locked the briefcase thats for all fifteen species you remember i remember fifteen species frozen embryos and how am i going to transport them dodgson handed the man a large can of gillette foamy shaving cream thats it thats it they may check my luggage dodgson shrugged press the top he said the man pressed it and white shaving cream puffed into his hand not bad he wiped the foam on the edge of his plate not bad the cans a little heavier than usual is all dodgsons technical team had been assembling it around the clock for the last two days quickly he showed him how it worked how much coolant gas is inside enough for thirtysix hours the embryos have to be back in san jose by then thats up to your guy in the boat the man said better make sure he has a portable cooler on board ill do that dodgson said and lets just review the bidding the deal is the same dodgson said fifty thousand on delivery of each embryo if theyre viable an additional fifty thousand each thats fine just make sure you have the boat waiting at the east dock of the island friday night not the north dock where the big supply boats arrive the east dock its a small utility dock you got that i got it dodgson said when will you be back in san jose probably sunday the man pushed away from the counter dodgson fretted youre sure you know how to work the i know the man said believe me i know also dodgson said we think the island maintains constant radio contact with ingen corporate headquarters in california so look ive got it covered the man said just relax and get the money ready i want it all sunday morning in san jose airport in cash itll be waiting for you dodgson said dont worry malcolm shortly before midnight be stepped on the plane at the dallas airport a tall thin balding man of thirtyfive dressed entirely in black black shirt black trousers black socks black sneakers ah dr malcolm hammond said smiling with forced graciousness malcolm grinned hello john yes i am afraid your old nemesis is here malcolm shook bands with everyone saying quickly ian malcolm how do you do i do maths he struck grant as being more amused by the outing than anything else certainly grant recognized his name ian malcolm was one of the most famous of the new generation of mathematicians who were openly interested in how the real world works these scholars broke with the cloistered tradition of mathematics in several important ways for one thing they used computers constantly a practice traditional mathematicians frowned on for another they worked almost exclusively with nonlinear equations in the emerging field called chaos theory for a third they appeared to care that their mathematics described something that actually existed in the real world and finally as if to emphasize their emergence from academia into the world they dressed and spoke with what one senior mathematician called a deplorable excess of personality in fact they often behaved like rock stars malcolm sat in one of the padded chairs the stewardess asked him if he wanted a drink he said diet coke shaken not stirred humid dallas air drifted through the open door ellie said isnt it a little warm for black youre extremely pretty dr sattler he said i could look at your legs all day but no as a matter of fact black is an excellent color for heat if you remember your blackbody radiation black is actually best in heat efficient radiation in any case i wear only two colors black and gray ellie was staring at him her mouth open these colors are appropriate for any occasion malcolm continued and they go well together should i mistakenly put on a pair of gray socks with my black trousers but dont you find it boring to wear only two colors not at all i find it liberating i believe my life has value and i dont want to waste it thinking about clothing malcolm said i dont want to think about what i will wear in the morning truly can you imagine anything more boring than fashion professional sports perhaps grown men swatting little balls while the rest of the world pays money to applaud but on the whole i find fashion even more tedious than sports dr malcolm hammond explained is a man of strong opinions and mad as a hatter malcolm said cheerfully but you must admit these are nontrivial issues we live in a world of frightful givens it is given that you will behave like this given that you will care about that no one thinks about the givens isnt it amazing in the information society nobody thinks we expected to banish paper but we actually banished thought hammond turned to gennaro and raised his hands you invited him and a lucky thing too malcolm said because it sounds as if you have a serious problem we have no problem hammond said quickly i always maintained this island would be unworkable malcolm said i predicted it from the beginning he reached into a soft leather briefcase and i trust by now we all know what the eventual outcome is going to be youre going to have to shut the thing down shut it down hammond stood angrily this is ridiculous malcolm shrugged indifferent to hammonds outburst ive brought copies of my original paper for you to took at he said the original consultancy paper i did for ingen the mathematics are a bit sticky but i can walk you through it are you leaving now i have some phone calls to make hammond said and went into the adjoining cabin well its a long flight malcolm said to the others at least my paper will give you something to do the plane flew through the night grant knew that ian malcolm had his share of detractors and he could understand why some found his style too abrasive and his applications of chaos theory too glib grant thumbed through the paper glancing at the equations gennaro said your paper concludes that hammonds island is bound to fail correct because of chaos theory correct to be more precise because of the behavior of the system in phase space gennaro tossed the paper aside and said can you explain this in english surely malcolm said lets see where we have to startyou know what a nonlinear equation is no strange attractors no all right malcolm said lets go back to the beginning he paused staring at the ceiling physics has had great success at describing certain kinds of behavior planets in orbit spacecraft going to the moon pendulums and springs and rolling balls that sort of thing the regular movement of objects these are described by what are called linear equations and mathematicians can solve those equations easily weve been doing it for hundreds of years okay gennaro said but there is another kind of behavior which physics handles badly for example anything to do with turbulence water coming out of a spout air moving over an airplane wing weather blood flowing through the heart turbulent events are described by nonlinear equations theyre bard to solvein fact theyre usually impossible to solve so physics has never understood this whole class of events until about ten years ago the new theory that describes them is called chaos theory chaos theory originally grew out of attempts to make computer models of weather in the s weather is a big complicated system namely the earths atmosphere as it interacts with the land and the sun the behavior of this big complicated system always defied understanding so naturally we couldnt predict weather but what the early researchers learned from computer models was that even if you could understand it you still couldnt predict it weather prediction is absolutely impossible the reason is that the behavior of the system is sensitively dependent on initial conditions you lost me gennaro said use a cannon to fire a shell of a certain weight at a certain speed and a certain angle of inclinationand if i then fire a second shell with almost the same weight speed and anglewhat well happen the two shells will land at almost the same spot right malcolm said thats linear dynamics okay but if i have a weather system that i start up with a certain temperature and a certain wind speed and a certain humidityand if i then repeat it with almost the same temperature wind and humiditythe second system will not behave almost the same itll wander off and rapidly will become very different from the first thunderstorms instead of sunshine thats nonlinear dynamics they are sensitive to initial conditions tiny differences become amplified i think i see gennaro said the shorthand is the butterfly effect a butterfly flaps its wings in peking and weather in new york is different so chaos is all just random and unpredictable gennaro said is that it no malcolm said we actually find bidden regularities within the complex variety of a systems behavior thats why chaos has now become a very broad theory thats used to study everything from the stock market to rioting crowds to brain waves during epilepsy any sort of complex system where there is confusion and unpredictability we can find an underlying order okay okay gennaro said but what is this underlying order its essentially characterized by the movement of the system within phase space malcolm said jesus gennaro said all i want to know is why you think hammonds island cant work i understand malcolm said ill get there chaos theory says two things first that complex systems like weather have an underlying order second the reverse of thatthat simple systems can produce complex behavior for example pool balls you hit a pool ball and it starts to carom off the sides of the table in theory thats a fairly simple system almost a newtonian system since you can know the force imparted to the ball and the mass of the ball and you can calculate the angles at which it will strike the walls you can predict the future behavior of the ball in theory you could predict the behavior of the ball far into the future as it keeps bouncing from side to side you could predict where it will end up three hours from now in theory okay gennaro nodded but in fact malcolm said it turns out you cant predict more than a few seconds into the future because almost immediately very small effectsimperfections in the surface of the ball tiny indentations in the wood of the tablestart to make a difference and it doesnt take long before they overpower your careful calculations so it turns out that this simple system of a pool ball on a table has unpredictable behavior okay and hammonds project malcolm said is another apparently simple systemanimals within a zoo environmentthat will eventually show unpredictable behavior you know this because of theory malcolm said but hadnt you better see the island to see what hes actually done no that is quite unnecessary the details dont matter theory tells me that the island will quickly proceed to behave in unpredictable fashion and youre confident of your theory ob yes malcolm said totally confident he sat back in the chair there is a problem with that island it is an accident waiting to happen isla nublar with a whine the rotors began to swing in circles overhead casting shadows on the runway of san jose airport grant listened to the crackle in his earphones as the pilot talked to the tower they had picked up another passenger in san jose a man named dennis nedry who had flown in to meet them he was fat and sloppy eating a candy bar and there was sticky chocolate on his fingers and flecks of aluminum foil on his shirt nedry had mumbled something about doing computers on the island and hadnt offered to shake hands through the plexi bubble grant watched the airport concrete drop away beneath his feet and he saw the shadow of the helicopter racing along as they went west toward the mountains its about a fortyminute trip hammond said from one of the rear seats grant watched the low hills rise up and then they were passing through intermittent clouds breaking out into sunshine the mountains were rugged though he was surprised at the amount of deforestation acre after acre of denuded eroded hills costa rica hammond said has better population control than other countries in central america but even so the land is badly deforested most of this is within the last ten years they came down out of the clouds on the other side of the mountains and grant saw the beaches of the west coast they flashed over a small coastal village bahia anasco the pilot said fishing village he pointed north up the coast there you see the cabo blanco preserve they have beautiful beaches the pilot headed straight out over the ocean the water turned green and then deep aquamarine the sun shone on the water it was about ten in the morning just a few minutes now hammond said and we should be seeing isla nublar isla nublar hammond explained was not a true island rather it was a seamount a volcanic upthrusting of rock from the ocean floor its volcanic origins can be seen all over the island hammond said there are steam vents in many places and the ground is often hot underfoot because of this and also because of prevailing currents isla nublar lies in a foggy area as we get there you will seeah there we are the helicopter rushed forward low to the water ahead grant saw an island rugged and craggy rising sharply from the ocean christ it looks like alcatraz malcolm said its forested slopes were wreathed in fog giving the island a mysterious appearance much larger of course hammond said eight miles long and three miles wide at the widest point in total some twentytwo square miles making it the largest private animal preserve in north america the helicopter began to climb and headed toward the north end of the island grant was trying to see through the dense fog its not usually this thick hammond said he sounded worried at the north end of the island the hills were highest rising more than two thousand feet above the ocean the tops of the hills were in fog but grant saw rugged cliffs and crashing ocean below the helicopter climbed above the hills unfortunately hammond said we have to land on the island i dont like to do it because it disturbs the animals and its sometimes a bit thrilling hammonds voice cut off as the pilot said starting our descent now hang on folks the helicopter started down and immediately they were blanketed in fog grant heard a repetitive electronic beeping through his earphones but he could see nothing at all then he began dimly to discern the green branches of pine trees reaching through the mist some of the branches were close how the hell is he doing this malcolm said but nobody answered the pilot swung his gaze left then right looking at the pine forest the trees were still close the helicopter descended rapidly jesus malcolm said the beeping was louder grant looked at the pilot he was concentrating grant glanced down and saw a giant glowing fluorescent cross beneath the plexi bubble at his feet there were flashing lights at the corners of the cross the pilot corrected slightly and touched down on a helipad the sound of the rotors faded and died grant sighed and released his seat belt we have to come down fast that way hammond said because of the wind shear there is often had wind shear on this peak and well were safe someone was running up to the helicopter a man with a baseball cap and red hair he threw open the door and said cheerfully hi im ed regis welcome to isla nublar everybody and watch your step please a narrow path wound down the hill the air was chilly and damp as they moved lower the mist around them thinned and grant could see the landscape better it looked he thought rather like the pacific northwest the olympic peninsula thats right regis said primary ecology is deciduous rain forest rather different from the vegetation on the mainland which is more classical rain forest but this is a microclimate that only occurs at elevation on the slopes of the northern hills the majority of the island is tropical down below they could see the white roofs of large buildings nestled among the planting grant was surprised the construction was elaborate they moved lower out of the mist and now he could see the full extent of the island stretching away to the south as regis had said it was mostly covered in tropical forest to the south rising above the palm trees grant saw a single trunk with no leaves at all just a big curving stump then the stump moved and twisted around to face the new arrivals grant realized that he was not seeing a tree at all he was looking at the graceful curving neck of an enormous creature rising fifty feet into the air he was looking at a dinosaur welcome my god ellie said softly they were all staring at the animal above the trees my god her first thought was that the dinosaur was extraordinarily beautiful books portrayed them as oversize dumpy creatures but this longnecked animal had a gracefulness almost a dignity about its movements and it was quickthere was nothing lumbering or dull in its behavior the sauropod peered alertly at them and made a low trumpeting sound rather like an elephant a moment later a second head rose above the foliage and then a third and a fourth my god ellie said again gennaro was speechless he had known all along what to expecthe had known about it for yearsbut he had somehow never believed it would happen and now he was shocked into silence the awesome power of the new genetic technology which he had formerly considered to he just so many words in an overwrought sales pitchthe power suddenly became clear to him these animals were so big they were enormous big as a house and so many of them actual damned dinosaurs just as real as you could want gennaro thought we are going to make a fortune on this place a fortune he hoped to god the island was safe grant stood on the path on the side of the hill with the mist on his face staring at the gray necks craning above the palms he felt dizzy as if the ground were sloping away too steeply he had trouble getting his breath because he was looking at something he had never expected to see in his life yet he was seeing it the animals in the mist were perfect apatosaurs mediumsize sauropods his stunned mind made academic associations north american herbivores late jurassic horizon commonly called brontosaurs first discovered by e d cope in montana in specimens associated with morrison formation strata in colorado utah and oklahoma recently berman and mcintosh had reclassified it a diplodocus based on skull appearance traditionally brontosaurus was thought to spend most of its time in shallow water which would help support its large bulk although this animal was clearly not in the water it was moving much too quickly the head and neck shifting above the palms in a very active mannera surprisingly active manner grant began to laugh what is it hammond said worried is something wrong grant just shook his head and continued to laugh he couldnt tell them that what was funny was that he had seen the animal for only a few seconds but he had already begun to accept itand to use his observations to answer longstanding questions in the field he was still laughing as he saw a fifth and a sixth neck crane up above the palm trees the sauropods watched the people arrive they reminded grant of oversize giraffesthey had the same pleasant rather stupid gaze i take it theyre not animatronic malcolm said theyre very lifelike yes they certainly are hammond said well they should be shouldnt they from the distance they heard the trumpeting sound again first one animal made it and then the others joined in thats their call ed regis said welcoming us to the island grant stood and listened for a moment entranced you probably want to know what happens next hammond was saying continuing down the path weve scheduled a complete tour of the facilities for you and a trip to see the dinosaurs in the park later this afternoon ill be joining you for dinner and will answer any remaining questions you may have then now if youll go with mr regis the group followed ed regis toward the nearest buildings over the path a crude bandpainted sign read welcome to jurassic park third iteration details emerge more clearly as the fractal curve is redrawn ian malcom jurassic park they moved into a green tunnel of overarching palms leading toward the main visitor building everywhere extensive and elaborate planting emphasized the feeling that they were entering a new world a prehistoric tropical world and leaving the normal world behind ellie said to grant they look pretty good yes grant said i want to see them up close i want to lift up their toe pads and inspect their claws and feel their skin and open their laws and have a look at their teeth until then i dont know for sure but yes they look good i suppose it changes your field a bit malcolm said grant shook his head it changes everything he said for years ever since the discovery of gigantic animal bones in europe the study of dinosaurs had been an exercise in scientific deduction paleontology was essentially detective work searching for clues in the fossil bones and the trackways of the longvanished giants the best paleontologists were the ones who could make the most clever deductions and all the great disputes of paleontology were carried out in this fashionincluding the bitter debate in which grant was a key figure about whether dinosaurs were warmblooded scientists had always classified dinosaurs as reptiles coldblooded creatures drawing the heat they needed for life from the environment a mammal could metabolize food to produce bodily warmth but a reptile could not eventually a handful of researchersled chiefly by john ostrom and robert bakker at yalebegan to suspect that the concept of sluggish coldblooded dinosaurs was inadequate to explain the fossil record in classic deductive fashion they drew conclusions from several lines of evidence first was posture lizards and reptiles were bentlegged sprawlers hugging the ground for warmth lizards didnt have the energy to stand on their hind legs for more than a few seconds but the dinosaurs stood on straight legs and many walked erect on their hind legs among living animals erect posture occurred only in warmblooded mammals and birds thus dinosaur posture suggested warmbloodedness next they studied metabolism calculating the pressure necessary to push blood up the eigbteenfootlong neck of a brachlosaur and concluding that it could only be accomplished by a fourchambered hotblooded heart they studied trackways fossil footprints left in mud and concluded that dinosaurs ran as fast as a man such activity implied warm blood they found dinosaur remains above the arctic circle in a frigid environment unimaginable for a reptile and the new studies of group behavior based largely on grants own work suggested that dinosaurs had a complex social life and reared their young as reptiles did not crocodiles and turtles abandon their eggs but dinosaurs probably did not the warmblooded controversy had raged for fifteen years before a new perception of dinosaurs as quickmoving active animals was acecptedbut not without lasting animosities at conventions there were still colleagues who did not speak to one another but now if dinosaurs could be clonedwhy grants field of study was going to change instantly the paleontological study of dinosaurs was finished the whole enterprisethe museum balls with their giant skeletons and flocks of echoing schoolchildren the university laboratories with their bone trays the research papers the journalsall of it was going to end you dont seem upset malcolm said grant shook his head its been discussed in the field many people imagined it was coming but not so soon story of our species malcolm said laughing everybody knows its coming but not so soon as they walked down the path they could no longer see the dinosaurs but they could hear them trumpeting softly in the distance grant said my only question is whered they get the dna grant was aware of serious speculation in laboratories in berkeley tokyo and london that it might eventually be possible to clone an extinct animal such as a dinosaurif you could get some dinosaur dna to work with the problem was that all known dinosaurs were fossils and the fossilization destroyed most dna replacing it with inorganic material of course if a dinosaur was frozen or preserved in a peat bog or mummified in a desert environment then its dna might be recoverable but nobody had ever found a frozen or mummified dinosaur so cloning was therefore impossible there was nothing to clone from all the modern genetic technology was useless it was like having a xerox copier but nothing to copy with it ellie said you cant reproduce a real dinosaur because you cant get real dinosaur dna unless theres a way we havent thought of grant said like what she said i dont know grant said beyond a fence they came to the swimming pool which spilled over into a series of waterfalls and smaller rocky pools the area was planted with huge ferns isnt this extraordinary ed regis said especially on a misty day these plants really contribute to the prehistoric atmosphere these are authentic jurassic ferns of course ellie paused to look more closely at the ferns yes it was just as he said serenna veriformans a plant found abundantly in fossils more than two hundred million years old now common only in the wetlands of brazil and colombia but whoever had decided to place this particular fern at poolside obviously didnt know that the spores of veriformans contained a deadly betacarboline alkaloid even touching the attractive green fronds could make you sick and if a child were to take a mouthful he would almost certainly diethe toxin was fifty times more poisonous than oleander people were so naive about plants ellie thought they just chose plants for appearance as they would choose a picture for the wall it never occurred to them that plants were actually living things busily performing all the living functions of respiration ingestion excretion reproductionand defense but ellie knew that in the earths history plants had evolved as competitively as animals and in some ways more fiercely the poison in serenna veriformans was a minor example of the elaborate chemical arsenal of weapons that plants had evolved there were terpenes which plants spread to poison the soil around them and inhibit competitors alkaloids which made them unpalatable to insects and predators and children and pheromones used for communication when a douglas fir tree was attacked by beetles it produced an antifeedant chemicaland so did other douglas firs in distant parts of the forest it happened in response to a warning alleochemical secreted by the trees that were under attack people who imagined that life on earth consisted of animals moving against a green background seriously misunderstood what they were seeing that green background was busily alive plants grew moved twisted and turned fighting for the sun and they interacted continuously with ammalsdiscouraging some with bark and thorns poisoning others and feeding still others to advance their own reproduction to spread their pollen and seeds it was a complex dynamic process which she never ceased to find fascinating and which she knew most people simply didnt understand but if planting deadly ferns at poolside was any indication then it was clear that the designers of jurassic park had not been as careful as they should have been isnt it just wonderful ed regis was saying if you look up ahead youll see our safari lodge ellie saw a dramatic low building with a series of glass pyramids on the roof thats where youll all be staying here in jurassic park grants suite was done in beige tones the rattan furniture in green jungleprint motifs the room wasnt quite finished there were stacks of lumber in the closet and pieces of electrical conduit on the floor there was a television set in the corner with a card on top channel hypsilophodont highlands channel triceratops territory channel sauropod swamp channel carnivore country channel stegosaurus south channel velociraptor valley channel pterosaur peak he found the names irritatingly cute grant turned on the television but got only static he shut it off and went into his bedroom tossed his suitcase on the bed directly over the bed was a large pyramidal skylight it created a tented feeling like sleeping under the stars unfortunately the glass had to be protected by heavy bars so that striped shadows fell across the bed grant paused he had seen the plans for the lodge and be didnt remember bars on the skylight in fact these bars appeared to be a rather crude addition a black steel frame had been constructed outside the glass walls and the bars welded to the frame puzzled grant moved from the bedroom to the living room his window looked out on the swimming pool by the way those ferns are poison ellie said walking into his room but did you notice anything about the rooms alan they changed the plans i think so yes she moved around the room the windows are small she said and the glass is tempered set in a steel frame the doors are steelclad that shouldnt be necessary and did you see the fence when we came in grant nodded the entire lodge was enclosed within a fence with bars of incbthick steel the fence was gracefully landscaped and painted flat black to resemble wrought iron but no cosmetic effort could disguise the thickness of the metal or its twelvefoot height i dont think the fence was in the plans either ellie said it looks to me like theyve turned this place into a fortress grant looked at his watch well be sure to ask why he said the tour starts in twenty minutes when dinosaurs ruled the earth they met in the visitor building two stories high and all glass with exposed black anodized girders and supports grant found it determinedly hightech there was a small auditorium dominated by a robot tyrannosaurus rex poised menacingly by the entrance to an exhibit area labeled when dinosaurs ruled the earth farther on were other displays what is a dinosaur and the mesozoic world but the exhibits werent completed there were wires and cables all over the floor gennaro climbed up on the stage and talked to grant ellie and malcolm his voice echoing slightly in the room hammond sat in the back his hands folded across his chest were about to tour the facilities gennaro said im sure mr hammond and his staff will show everything in the best light before we go i wanted to review why we are here and what i need to decide before we leave basically as you all realize by now this is an island in which genetically engineered dinosaurs have been allowed to move in a natural parklike setting forming a tourist attraction the attraction isnt open to tourists yet but it will be in a year now my question for you is a simple one is this island safe is it safe for visitors and is it safely containing the dinosaurs gennaro turned down the room lights there are two pieces of evidence which we have to deal with first of all there is dr grants identification of a previously unknown dinosaur on the costa rican mainland this dinosaur is known only from a partial fragment it was found in july of this year after it supposedly bit an american girl on a beach dr grant can tell you more later ive asked for the original fragment which is in a lab in new york to be flown here so that we can inspect it directly meanwhile there is a second piece of evidence costa rica has an excellent medical service and it tracks all kinds of data beginning in march there were reports of lizards biting infants in their cribsand also i might add biting old people who were sleeping soundly these lizard bites were sporadically reported in coastal villages from ismaloya to puntarenas after march lizard bites were no longer reported however i have this graph from the public health service in san jos of infant mortality in the towns of the west coast earlier this year picture i direct your attention to two features of this graph gennaro said first infant mortality is low in the months of january and february then spikes in march then its low again in april but from may onward it is high right through july the month the american girl was bitten the public health service feels that something is now affecting infant mortality and it is not being reported by the workers in the coastal villages the second feature is the puzzling biweekly spiking which seems to suggest some kind of alternating phenomenon is at work the lights came back on all right gennaro said thats the evidence i want explained now are there any we can save ourselves a great deal of trouble malcolm said ill explain it for you now you will gennaro said yes malcolm said first of all animals have very likely gotten off the island oh balls hammond growled from the back and second the graph from the public health service is almost certainly unrelated to any animals that have escaped grant said how do you know that youll notice that the graph alternates between high and low spikes malcolm said that is characteristic of many complex systems for example water dripping from a tap if you turn on the faucet lust a little youll get a constant drip drip drip but if you open it a little more so that theres a bit of turbulence in the flow then youll get alternating large and small drops drip drip drip drip like that you can try it yourself turbulence produces alternationits a signature and you will get an alternating graph like this for the spread of any new illness in a community but why do you say it isnt caused by escaped dinosaurs grant said because it is a nonlinear signature malcolm said youd need hundreds of escaped dinosaurs to cause it and i dont think hundreds of dinosaurs have escaped so i conclude that some other phenomenon such as a new variety of flu is causing the fluctuations you see in the graph gennaro said but you think that dinosaurs have escaped probably yes why because of what you are attempting here look this island is an attempt to recreate a natural environment from the past to make an isolated world where extinct creatures roam freely correct yes but from my point of view such an undertaking is impossible the mathematics are so selfevident that they dont need to be calculated its rather like my asking you whether on a billion dollars in income you had to pay tax you wouldnt need to pull out your calculator to check youd know tax was owed and similarly i know overwhelmingly that one cannot successfully duplicate nature in this way or hope to isolate it why not after all there are zoos zoos dont recreate nature malcolm said lets be clear zoos take the nature that already exists and modify it very slightly to create holding pens for animals even those minimal modifications often fail the animals escape with regularity but a zoo is not a model for this park this park is attempting something far more ambitious than that something much more akin to making a space station on earth gennaro shook his head i dont understand well its very simple except for the air which flows freely everything about this park is meant to be isolated nothing gets in nothing out the animals kept here are never to mix with the greater ecosystems of earth they are never to escape and they never have hammond snorted such isolation is impossible malcolm said flatly it simply cannot be done it can its done all the time i beg your pardon malcolm said but you dont know what you are talking about you arrogant little snot hammond said he stood and walked out of the room gentlemen gentlemen gennaro said im sorry malcolm said but the point remains what we call nature is in fact a complex system of far greater subtlety than we are willing to accept we make a simplified image of nature and then we botch it up im no environmentalist but you have to understand what you dont understand how many times must the point be made how many times must we see the evidence we build the aswan dam and claim it is going to revitalize the country instead it destroys the fertile nile delta produces parasitic infestation and wrecks the egyptian economy we build the excuse me gennaro said but i think i hear the helicopter thats probably the sample for dr grant to look at he started out of the room they all followed at the foot of the mountain gennaro was screaming over the sound of the helicopter the veins of his neck stood out you did what you invited who take it easy hammond said gennaro screamed are you out of your goddamned mind now look here hammond said drawing himself up i think we have to get something clear no gennaro said no you get something clear this is not a social outing this is not a weekend excursion this is my island hammond said and i can invite whomever i want this is a serious investigation of your island because your investors are concerned that its out of control we think this is a very dangerous place and youre not going to shut me down donald i will if i have to this is a safe place hammond said no matter what that damn mathematician is saying its not and ill demonstrate its safety and i want you to put them tight back on that helicopter gennaro said cant hammond said pointing toward the clouds its already leaving and indeed the sound of the rotors was fading god damn it gennaro said dont you see youre needlessly risking ah ah hammond said lets continue this later i dont want to upset the children grant turned and saw two children coming down the hillside led by ed regis there was a bespectacled boy of about eleven and a girl a few years younger perhaps seven or eight her blond hair pushed up under a mets baseball cap and a baseball glove slung over her shoulder the two kids made their way nimbly down the path from the helipad and stopped some distance from gennaro and hammond low under his breath gennaro said christ now take it easy hammond said their parents are getting a divorce and i want them to have a fun weekend here the girl waved tentatively hi grandpa she said were here the tour tim murphy could see at once that something was wrong his grandfather was in the middle of an argument with the younger redfaced man opposite him and the other adults standing behind looked embarrassed and uncomfortable alexis felt the tension too because she hung back tossing her baseball in the air he had to push her go on lex go on yourself timmy dont be a worm he said lex glared at him but ed regis said cheerfully ill introduce you to everybody and then we can take the tour i have to go lex said ill just introduce you first ed regis said no i have to go but ed regis was already making introductions first to grandpa who kissed them both and then to the man he was arguing with this man was muscular and his name was gennaro the rest of the introductions were a blur to tim there was a blond woman wearing shorts and a man with a beard who wore jeans and a hawaiian shirt he looked like the outdoors type then a fat college kid who had something to do with computers and finally a thin man in black who didnt shake hands but just nodded his head tim was trying to organize his impressions and was looking at the blond womans legs when he suddenly realized that he knew who the bearded man was your mouth is open lex said tim said i know him oh sure you just met him no tim said i have his book the bearded man said what book is that tim lost world of the dinosaurs tim said alexis snickered daddy says tim has dinosaurs on the brain she said tim hardly heard her he was thinking of what he knew about alan grant alan grant was one of the principal advocates of the theory that dinosaurs were warmblooded he had done lots of digging at the place called egg hill in montana which was famous because so many dinosaur eggs had been found there professor grant had found most of the dinosaur eggs that had ever been discovered he was also a good illustrator and he drew the pictures for his own books dinosaurs on the brain the bearded man said well as a matter of fact i have that same problem dad says dinosaurs are really stupid lex said he says tim should get out in the air and play more sports tim felt embarrassed i thought you had to go he said in a minute lex said i thought you were in such a rush im the one who would know dont you think timothy she said putting her hands on her hips copying her mothers most irritating stance tell you what ed regis said why dont we all just head on over to the visitor center and we can begin our tour everybody started walking tim heard gennaro whisper to his grandfather i could kill you for this and then tim looked up and saw that dr grant had fallen into step beside him how old are you tim eleven and how long have you been interested in dinosaurs grant asked tim swallowed a while now he said he felt nervous to be talking to dr grant we go to museums sometimes when i can talk my family into it my father your fathers not especially interested tim nodded and told grant about his familys last trip to the museum of natural history his father had looked at a skeleton and said thats a big one tim had said no dad thats a mediumsize one a camptosaurus oh i dont know looks pretty big to me its not even fullgrown dad his father squinted at the skeleton what is it jurassic jeez no cretaceous cretaceous whats the difference between cretaceous and jurassic only about a hundred million years tim said cretaceous is older no dad jurassic is older well his father said stepping back it looks pretty damn big to me and he turned to tim for agreement tim knew he had better agree with his father so he just muttered something and they went on to another exhibit tim stood in front of one skeletontyrannosaurus rex the mightiest predator the earth had ever knownfor a long time finally his father said what are you looking at im counting the vertebrae tim said the vertebrae in the backbone i know what vertebrae are his father said annoyed he stood there a while longer and then he said why are you counting them i think theyre wrong tyrannosaurs should only have thirtyseven vertebrae in the tall this has more you mean to tell me his father said that the museum of natural history has a skeleton thats wrong i cant believe that its wrong tim said his father stomped off toward a guard in the corner what did you do now his mother said to tim i didnt do anything tim said i just said the dinosaur is wrong thats all and then his father came back with a funny look on his face because of course the guard told him that the tyrannosaurus had too many vertebrae in the tail howd you know that his father asked i read it tim said thats pretty amazing son he said and he put his hand on his shoulder giving it a squeeze you know how many vertebrae belong in that tail ive never seen anything like it you really do have dinosaurs on the brain and then his father said he wanted to catch the last half of the mets game on tv and lex said she did too so they left the museum and tim didnt see any other dinosaurs which was why they had come there in the first place but that was how things happened in his family how things used to happen in his family tim corrected himself now that his father was getting a divorce from his mother things would probably be different his father had already moved out and even though it was weird at first tim liked it he thought his mother had a boyfriend but he couldnt be sure and of course he would never mention it to lex lex was heartbroken to be separated from her father and in the last few weeks she had become so obnoxious that was it grant said im sorry tim said the tyrannosaurus at the museum was it yes tim said howd you know grant smiled theyve been talking about fixing it for years but now it may never happen why is that because of what is taking place here grant said on your grandfathers island tim shook his head he didnt understand what grant was talking about my mom said it was just a resort you know with swimming and tennis not exactly grant said ill explain as we walk along now im a damned babysitter ed regis thought unhappily tapping his foot as he waited in the visitor center that was what the old man had told him him you watch my kids like a hawk theyre your responsibility for the weekend ed regis didnt like it at all he felt degraded he wasnt a damn babysitter and for that matter he wasnt a damned tour guide even for vips he was the head of public relations for jurassic park and he had much to prepare between now and the opening a year away just to coordinate with the pr firms in san francisco and london and the agencies in new york and tokyo was a fulltime jobespecially since the agencies couldnt yet be told what the resorts real attraction was the firms were all designing teaser campaigns nothing specific and they were unhappy creative people needed nurturing they needed encouragement to do their best work he couldnt waste his time taking scientists on tours but that was the trouble with a career in public relationsnobody saw you as a professional regis had been down here on the island off and on for the past seven months and they were still pushing odd jobs on him like that episode back in january harding should have handled that harding or owens the general contractor instead it had fallen to ed regis what did he know about taking care of some sick workman and now he was a damn tour guide and babysitter he turned back and counted the heads still one short then in the back he saw dr sattler emerge from the bathroom all right folks lets begin our tour on the second floor tim went with the others following mr regis up the black suspended staircase to the second floor of the building they passed a sign that read closed area authorized personnel only beyond this point tim felt a thrill when he saw that sign they walked down the secondfloor hallway one wall was glass looking out onto a balcony with palm trees in the light mist on the other wall were stenciled doors like offices park warden guest services general manager halfway down the corridor they came to a glass partition marked with another sign picture underneath were more signs caution teratogenic substances pregnant women avoid exposure to this area danger radioactive isotopes in use carcinogenic potential tim grew more excited all the time teratogenic substances things that made monsters it gave him a thrill and he was disappointed to hear ed regis say never mind the signs theyre just up for legal reasons i can assure you everything is perfectly safe he led them through the door there was a guard on the other side ed regis turned to the group you may have noticed that we have a minimum of personnel on the island we can run this resort with a total of twenty people of course well have more when we have guests here but at the moment theres only twenty heres our control room the entire park is controlled from here they paused before windows and peered into a darkened room that looked like a small version of mission control there was a vertical glass seethrough map of the park and facing it a bank of glowing computer consoles some of the screens displayed data but most of them showed video images from around the park there were just two people inside standing and talking the man on the left is our chief engineer john arnoldregis pointed to a thin man in a buttondown shortsleeve shirt and tie smoking a cigaretteand next to him our park warden mr robert muldoon the famous white bunter from nairobi muldoon was a burly man in khaki sunglasses dangling from his shirt pockct he glanced out at the group gave a brief nod and turned back to the computer screens im sure you want to see this room ed regis said but first lets see how we obtain dinosaur dna the sign on the door said extractions and like all the doors in the laboratory building it opened with a security card ed regis slipped the card in the slot the light blinked and the door opened inside tim saw a small room bathed in green light four technicians in lab coats were peering into doublebarreled stereo microscopes or looking at images on high resolution video screens the room was filled with yellow stones the stones were in glass shelves in cardboard boxes in large pullout trays each stone was tagged and numbered in black ink regis introduced henry wu a slender man in his thirties dr wu is our chief geneticist ill let him explain what we do here henry wu smiled at least ill try he said genetics is a bit complicated but youre probably wondering where our dinosaur dna comes from it crossed my mind grant said as a matter of fact wu said there are two possible sources using the loy antibody extraction technique we can sometimes get dna directly from dinosaur bones what kind of a yield grant asked well most soluble protein is leached out during fossilization but twenty percent of the proteins are still recoverable by grinding up the bones and using loys procedure dr loy himself has used it to obtain proteins from extinct australian marsupials as well as blood cells from ancient human remains his technique is so refined it can work with a mere fifty nanograms of material thats fiftybillionths of a gram and youve adapted his technique here grant asked only as a backup wu said as you can imagine a twenty percent yield is insufficient for our work we need the entire dinosaur dna strand in order to clone and we get it here he held up one of the yellow stones from amberthe fossilized resin of prehistoric tree sap grant looked at ellie then at malcolm thats really quite clever malcolm said nodding i still dont understand grant admitted tree sap wu explained often flows over insects and traps them the insects are then perfectly preserved within the fossil one finds all kinds of insects in amberincluding biting insects that have sucked blood from larger animals sucked the blood grant repeated his mouth fell open you mean sucked the blood of dinosaurs hopefully yes and then the insects are preserved in amber grant shook his head ill be damnedthat just might work i assure you it does work wu said he moved to one of the microscopes where a technician positioned a piece of amber containing a fly under the microscope on the video monitor they watched as he inserted a long needle through the amber into the thorax of the prehistoric fly if this insect has any foreign blood cells we may be able to extract them and obtain paleodna the dna of an extinct creature we wont know for sure of course until we extract whatever is in there replicate it and test it that is what we have been doing for five years now it has been a long slow processbut it has paid off actually dinosaur dna is somewhat easier to extract by this process than mammalian dna the reason is that mammalian red cells have no nuclei and thus no dna in their red cells to clone a mammal you must find a white cell which is much rarer than red cells but dinosaurs had nucleated red cells as do modern birds it is one of the many indications we have that dinosaurs arent really reptiles at all they are big leathery birds tim saw that dr grant still looked skeptical and dennis nedry the messy fat man appeared completely uninterested as if he knew it all already nedry kept looking impatiently toward the next room i see mr nedry has spotted the next phase of our work wu said how we identify the dna we have extracted for that we use powerful computers they went through sliding doors into a chilled room there was a loud humming sound two sixfoottall round towers stood in the center of the room and along the walls were rows of waisthigh stainlesssteel boxes this is our hightech laundromat dr wu said the boxes along the walls are all hamachihood automated gene sequencers they are being run at very high speed by the cray xmp supercomputers which are the towers in the center of the room in essence you are standing in the middle of an incredibly powerful genetics factory there were several monitors all running so fast it was hard to see what they were showing wu pushed a button and slowed one image gcgttgctgg cgtttttcca taggctccgc ccccctgacg agcatcacaa aaatcgacgc ggtggcgaaa cccgacagga ctataaagat accaggcgtt tccccctgga agctccctcg tgttccgacc ctgccgctta

structure of a small fragment of dinosaur dna wu said notice the sequence is made up of four basic compoundsadenine thymine guanine and cytosine this amount of dna probably contains instructions to make a single proteinsay a hormone or an enzyme the full dna molecule contains three billion of these bases if we looked at a screen like this once a second for eight hours a day itd still take more than two years to look at the entire dna strand its that big he pointed to the image this is a typical example because you see the dna has an error down here in line much of the dna we extract is fragmented or incomplete so the first thing we have to do is repair itor rather the computer has to itll cut the dna using what are called restriction enzymes the computer will select a variety of enzymes that might do the job gcgttgctggcgtttttccatagggtccgcccccctgacgagcatcacaaaaatcgacgc ggtggcgaaacccgacaggactfitaaagataccaggcgtttccccctggaagctccctcg nspo

located as you can see in line two enzymes will cut on either side of the damaged point ordinarily we let the computers decide which to use but we also need to know what base pairs we should insert to repair the injury for that we have to align various cut fragments like so picture now we are finding a fragment of dna that overlaps the injury area and will tell us what is missing and you can see we can find it and go ahead and make the repair the dark bars you see arc restriction fragmentssmall sections of dinosaur dna broken by enzymes and then analyzed the computer is now recombining them by

aacatgaatggtcttcggtttccgtgtttc gtaaagtctggaaacgcggaagtcagcgcc and here is the revised dna strand repaired by the computer the operation youve witnessed would have taken months in a conventional lab but we can do it in seconds then are you working with the entire dna strand grant asked oh no wu said thats impossible weve come a long way from the sixties when it took a whole laboratory four years to decode a screen like this now the computers can do it in a couple of hours but even so the dna molecule is too big we look only at the sections of the strand that differ from animal to animal or from contemporary dna only a few percent of the nucleotides differ from one species to the next thats what we analyze and its still a big job dennis nedry yawned hed long ago concluded that ingen must be doing something like this a couple of years earlier when ingen had hired nedry to design the park control systems one of the initial design parameters called for data records with x fields nedry just assumed that was a mistake and had called palo alto to verify it but they had told him the spec was correct three billion fields nedry had worked on a lot of large systems hed made a name for himself setting up worldwide telephone communications for multinational corporations often those systems had millions of records he was used to that but ingen wanted something so much larger puzzled nedry had gone to see barney fellows over at symbolics near the mit campus in cambridge what kind of a database has three billion records barney a mistake barney said laughing they put in an extra zero or two its not a mistake i checked its what they want but thats crazy barney said its not workable even if you had the fastest processors and blindingly fast algorithms a search would still take days maybe weeks yeah nedry said i know fortunately im not being asked to do algorithms im just being asked to reserve storage and memory for the overall system but still what could the database be for barney frowned you operating under an nd yes nedry said most of his jobs required nondisclosure agreements can you tell me anything its a bioengineering firm bioengineering barney said well theres the obvious which is a dna molecule oh come on nedry said nobody could be analyzing a dna molecule he knew biologists were talking about the human genome project to analyze a complete human dna strand but that would take ten years of coordinated effort involving laboratories around the world it was an enormous undertaking as big as the manhattan project which made the atomic bomb this is a private company nedry said with three billion records barney said i dont know what else it could be maybe theyre being optimistic designing their system very optimistic nedry said or maybe theyre just analyzing dna fragments but theyve got ramintensive algorithms that made more sense certain database search techniques ate up a lot of memory you know who did their algorithms no nedry said this company is very secretive well my guess is theyre doing something with dna barney said whats the system multixmp multixmp you mean more than one cray wow barney was frowning now thinking that one over can you tell me anything else sorry nedry said i cant and he had gone back and designed the control systems it had taken him and his programming team more than a year and it was especially difficult because the company wouldnt ever tell him what the subsystems were for the instructions were simply design a module for record keeping or design a module for visual display they gave him design parameters but no details about use he had been working in the dark and now that the system was up and running he wasnt surprised to learn there were bugs what did they expect and theyd ordered him down here in a panic all hot and bothered about his bugs it was annoying nedry thought nedry turned back to the group as grant asked and once the computer has analyzed the dna how do you know what animal it encodes we have two procedures wu said the first is phylogenetic mapping dna evolves over time like everything else in an organismhands or feet or any other physical attribute so we can take an unknown piece of dna and determine roughly by computer where it fits in the evolutionary sequence its timeconsuming but it can be done and the other way wu shrugged just grow it and find out what it is he said thats what we usually do ill show you how thats accomplished tim felt a growing impatience as the tour continued he liked technical things but even so he was losing interest they came to the next door which was marked fertlization dr wu unlocked the door with his security card and they went inside tim saw still another room with technicians working at microscopes in the back was a section entirely lit by blue ultraviolet light dr wu explained that their dna work required the interruption of cellular mitosis at precise instants and therefore they kept some of the most virulent poisons in the world helotoxins colchicinolds betaalkaloids he said pointing to a series of syringes set out under the uv light kill any living animal within a second or two tim would have liked to know more about the poisons but dr wu droned on about using unfertilized crocodile ova and replacing the dna and then professor grant asked some complicated questions to one side of the room were big tanks marked liquid n and there were big walkin freezers with shelves of frozen embryos each stored in a tiny silverfoil wrapper lex was bored nedry was yawning and even dr sattler was losing interest tim was tired of looking at these complicated laboratories he wanted to see the dinosaurs the next room was labeled hatchery its a little warm and damp in here dr wu said we keep it at ninetynine degrees fahrenheit and a relative humidity of one hundred percent we also run a higher o concentration its up to thirtythree percent jurassic atmosphere grant said yes at least we presume so if any of you feel faint just tell me dr wu inserted his security card into the slot and the outer door hissed open just a reminder dont touch anything in this room some of the eggs are permeable to skin oils and watch your heads the sensors are always moving he opened the inner door to the nursery and they went inside tim faced a vast open room bathed in deep infrared light the eggs lay on long tables their pale outlines obscured by the hissing low mist that covered the tables the eggs were all moving gently rocking reptile eggs contain large amounts of yolk but no water at all the embryos must extract water from the surrounding environment hence the mist dr wu explained that each table contained eggs and represented a new batch of dna extractions the batches were identified by numbers at each table stec or tric waistdeep in the mist the workers in the nursery moved from one egg to the next plunging their hands into the mist turning the eggs every hour and checking the temperatures with thermal sensors the room was monitored by overhead tv cameras and motion sensors an overhead thermal sensor moved from one egg to the next touching each with a flexible wand beeping then going on in this hatchery we have produced more than a dozen crops of extractions giving us a total of two hundred thirtyeight live animals our survival rate is somewhere around point four percent and we naturally want to improve that but by computer analysis were working with something like five hundred variables one hundred and twenty environmental another two hundred intraegg and the rest from the genetic material itself our eggs are plastic the embryos are mechanically inserted and then hatched here and how long to grow dinosaurs mature rapidly attaining full size in two to four years so we now have a number of adult specimens in the park what do the numbers mean those codes wu said identify the various batch extractions of dna the first four letters identify the animals being grown over there that tric means triceratops and the stec means stegosaurus and so on and this table here grant said the code said xxxx beneath was scrawled presumed coelu thats a new batch of dna wu said we dont know exactly what will grow out the first time an extraction is done we dont know for sure what the animal is you can see its marked presumed coelu so it is likely to be a coelurosaurus a small herbivore if i remember its hard for me to keep track of the names there are something like three hundred genera of dinosaurs known so far three hundred and fortyseven tim said grant smiled then said is anything hatching now not at the moment the incubation period varies with each animal but in general it runs about two months we try to stagger hatchings to make less work for the nursery staff you can imagine how it is when we have a hundred and fifty animals born within a few daysthough of course most dont survive actually these xs are due any day now any other questions no then well go to the nursery where the newborns are it was a circular room all white there were some incubators of the kind used in hospital nurseries but they were empty at the moment rags and toys were scattered across the floor a young woman in a white coat was seated on the floor her back to them whatve you got here today kathy dr wu asked not much she said just a baby raptor lets have a look the woman got to her feet and stepped aside tim heard nedry say it looks like a lizard the animal on the floor was about a foot and a half long the size of a small monkey it was dark yellow with brown stripes like a tiger it had a lizards head and long snout but it stood upright on strong hind legs balanced by a thick straight tail its smaller front legs waved in the air it cocked its head to one side and peered at the visitors staring down at it velociraptor alan grant said in a low voice velociraptor mongoliensis wu said nodding a predator this ones only six weeks old i just excavated a raptor grant said as he bent down for a closer look immediately the little lizard sprang up leaping over grants head into tims arms hey they can jump wu said the babies can jump so can the adults as a matter of fact tim caught the velociraptor and held it to him the little animal didnt weigh very much a pound or two the skin was warm and completely dry the little head was inches from tims face its dark beady eyes stared at him a small forked tongue flicked in and out will he hurt me no shes friendly are you sure about that asked gennaro with a look of concern oh quite sure wu said at least until she grows a little older but in any case the babies dont have any teeth even egg teeth egg teeth nedry said most dinosaurs are born with egg teethlittle horns on the tip of the nose like rhino horns to help them break out of the eggs but raptors arent they poke a hole in the eggs with their pointed snouts and then the nursery staff has to help them out you have to help them out grant said shaking his head what happens in the wild in the wild when they breed in the wild grant said when they make a nest oh they cant do that wu said none of our animals is capable of breeding thats why we have this nursery its the only way to replace stock in jurassic park why cant the animals breed well as you can imagine its important that they not be able to breed wu said and whenever we faced a critical matter such as this we designed redundant systems that is we always arranged at least two control procedures in this case there are two independent reasons why the animals cant breed first of a theyre sterile because we irradiate them with xrays and the second reason all the animals in jurassic park are female wu said with a pleased smile malcolm said i should like some clarification about this because it seems to me that irradiation is fraught with uncertainty the radiation dose may be wrong or aimed at the wrong anatomical area of the animal all true wu said but were quite confident we have destroyed gonadal tissue and as for them all being female malcolm said is that checked does anyone go out and ah lift up the dinosaurs skirts to have a look i mean how does one determine the sex of a dinosaur anyway sex organs vary with the species its easy to tell on some subtle on others but to answer your question the reason we know all the animals are female is that we literally make them that way we control their chromosomes and we control the intraegg developmental environment from a bioengineering standpoint females are easier to breed you probably know that all vertebrate embryos are inherently female we all start life as females it takes some kind of added effectsuch as a hormone at the right moment during developmentto transform the growing embryo into a male but left to its own devices the embryo will naturally become female so our animals are all female we tend to refer to some of them as malesuch as the tyrannosaurus rex we all call it a himbut in fact theyre all female and believe me they cant breed the little velociraptor sniffed at tim and then rubbed her head against tims neck tim giggled she wants you to feed her wu said what does she eat mice but shes just eaten so we wont feed her again for a while the little raptor leaned back stared at tim and wiggled her forearms again in the air tim saw the small claws on the three fingers of each hamd then the raptor burrowed her head against his neck again grant came over and peered critically at the creature he touched the tiny threeclawed band he said to tim do you mind and tim released the raptor into his hands grant flipped the animal onto its back inspecting it while the little lizard wiggled and squirmed then he lifted the animal high to look at its profile and it screamed shrilly she doesnt like that regis said doesnt like to be held away from body contact the raptor was still screaming but grant paid no attention now he was squeezing the tail feeling the bones regis said dr grant if you please im not hurting her dr grant these creatures are not of our world they come from a time when there were no human beings around to prod and poke them im not prodding and dr grant put her down ed regis said but now regis was starting to get annoyed grant handed the animal back to tim it stopped squealing tim could feel its little heart beating rapidly against his chest im sorry dr grant regis said but these animals are delicate in infancy we have lost several from a postnatal stress syndrome which we believe is adrenocortically mediated sometimes they die within five minutes tim petted the little raptor its okay kid he said everythings fine now the heart was still beating rapidly we feel it is important that the animals here be treated in the most humane manner regis said i promise you that you will have every opportunity to examine them later but grant couldnt stay away he again moved toward the animal in tims arms peering at it the little velociraptor opened her jaws and hissed at grant in a posture of sudden intense fury fascinating grant said can i stay and play with her tim said not right now ed regis said glancing at his watch its three oclock and its a good time for a tour of the park itself so you can see all the dinosaurs in the habitats we have designed for them tim released the velociraptor which scampered across the room grabbed a cloth rag put it in her mouth and tugged at the end with her tiny claws control walking back toward the control room malcolm said i have one more question dr wu how many different species have you made so far im not exactly sure wu said i believe the number at the moment is fifteen fifteen species do you know ed yes its fifteen ed regis said nodding you dont know for sure malcolm said affecting astonishment wu smiled i stopped counting he said after the first dozen and you have to realize that sometimes we think we have an animal correctly madefrom the standpoint of the dna which is our basic workand the animal grows for six months and then something untoward happens and we realize there is some error a releaser gene isnt operating a hormone not being released or some other problem in the developmental sequence so we have to go back to the drawing board with that animal so to speak he smiled at one time i thought i had more than twenty species but now only fifteen and is one of the fifteen species a malcolm turned to grant what was the name procompsognathus grant said you have made some procompsognathuses or whatever theyre called malcolm asked oh yes wu said immediately compys are very distinctive animals and we made an unusually large number of them why is that well we want jurassic park to be as real an environment as possibleas authentic as possibleand the procompsognathids are actual scavengers from the jurassic period rather like jackals so we wanted to have the compys around to clean up you mean to dispose of carcasses yes if there were any but with only two hundred and thirtyodd animals in our total population we dont have many carcasses wu said that wasnt the primary objective actually we wanted the compys for another kind of waste management entirely which was well wu said we have some very big herbivores on this island we have specifically tried not to breed the biggest sauropods but even so weve got several animals in excess of thirty tons walking around out there and many others in the five to tenton area that gives us two problems one is feeding them and in fact we must import food to the island every two weeks there is no way an island this small can support these animals for any time but the other problem is waste i dont know if youve ever seen elephant droppings wu said but they are substantial each spoor is roughly the size of a soccer ball imagine the droppings of a brontosaur ten times as large now imagine the droppings of a herd of such animals as we keep here and the largest animals do not digest their food terribly well so that they excrete a great deal and in the sixty million years since dinosaurs disappeared apparently the bacteria that specialize in breaking down their feces disappeared too at least the sauropod feces dont decompose readily thats a problem malcolm said i assure you it is wu said not smiling we had a hell of a time trying to solve it you probably know that in africa there is a specific insect the dung beetle which eats elephant feces many other large species have associated creatures that have evolved to eat their excrement well it turns out that compys will eat the feces of large herbivores and redigest it and the droppings of compys are readily broken down by contemporary bacteria so given enough compys our problem was solved how many compys did you make ive forgotten exactly but i think the target population was fifty animals and we attained that or very nearly so in three batches we did a batch every six months until we had the number fifty animals malcolm said is a lot to keep track of the control room is built to do exactly that theyll show you how its done im sure malcolm said but if one of these compys were to escape from the island to get away they cant get away i know that but just supposing one did you mean like the animal that was found on the beach wu said raising his eyebrows the one that bit the american girl yes for example i dont know what the explanation for that animal is wu said but i know it cant possibly be one of ours for two reasons first the control procedures our animals are counted by computer every few minutes if one were missing wed know at once and the second reason the mainland is more than a hundred miles away it takes almost a day to get there by boat and in the outside world our animals will die within twelve hours wu said how do you know because ive made sure thats precisely what will occur wu said finally showing a trace of irritation look were not fools we understand these are prehistoric animals they are part of a vanished ecologya complex web of life that became extinct millions of years ago they might have no predators in the contemporary world no checks on their growth we dont want them to survive in the wild so ive made them lysine dependent i inserted a gene that makes a single faulty enzyme in protein metabolism as a result the animals cannot manufacture the amino acid lysine they must ingest it from the outside unless they get a rich dietary source of exogenous lysinesupplied by us in tablet formtheyll go into a coma within twelve hours and expire these animals are genetically engineered to be unable to survive in the real world they can only live here in jurassic park they are not free at all they are essentially our prisoners heres the control room ed regis said now that you know how the animals are made youll want to see the control room for the park itself before we go out on the he stopped through the thick glass window the room was dark the monitors were off except for three that displayed spinning numbers and the image of a large boat whats going on ed regis said oh hell theyre docking docking every two weeks the supply boat comes in from the mainland one of the things this island doesnt have is a good harbor or even a good dock its a little hairy to get the ship in when the seas are rough could be a few minutes he rapped on the window but the men inside paid no attention i guess we have to wait then ellie turned to dr wu you mentioned before that sometimes you make an animal and it seems to be fine but as it grows it shows itself to be flawed yes wu said i dont think theres any way around that we can duplicate the dna but there is a lot of timing in development and we dont know if everything is working unless we actually see an animal develop correctly grant said how do you know if its developing correctly no one has ever seen these animals before wu smiled i have often thought about that i suppose it is a bit of a paradox eventually i hope paleontologists such as yourself will compare our animals with the fossil record to verify the developmental sequence ellie said but the animal we just saw the velociraptoryou said it was a mongoliensis from the location of the amber wu said it it is from china interesting grant said i was just digging up an infant antirrhopus are there any fullgrown raptors here yes ed regis said without hesitation eight adult females the females are the real hunters theyre pack hunters you know will we see them on the tour no wu said looking suddenly uncomfortable and there was an awkward pause wu looked at regis not for a while regis said cheerfully the velociraptors havent been integrated into the park setting just yet we keep them in a holding pen can i see them there grant said why yes of course in fact while were waitinghe glanced at his watchyou might want to go around and have a look at them i certainly would grant said absolutely ellie said i want to go too tim said eagerly just go around the back of this building past the support facility and youll see the pen but dont get too close to the fence do you want to go too he said to the girl no lex said she looked appraisingly at regis you want to play a little pickle throw a few well sure ed regis said why dont you and i go downstairs and well do that while we wait for the control room to open up grant walked with ellie and malcolm around the back of the main building with the kid tagging along grant liked kidsit was impossible not to like any group so openly enthusiastic about dinosaurs grant used to watch kids in museums as they stared openmouthed at the big skeletons rising above them he wondered what their fascination really represented he finally decided that children liked dinosaurs because these giant creatures personified the uncontrollable force of looming authority they were symbolic parents fascinating and frightening like parents and kids loved them as they loved their parents grant also suspected that was why even young children learned the names of dinosaurs it never failed to amaze him when a threeyearold shrieked stegosaurus saying these complicated names was a way of exerting power over the giants a way of being in control what do you know about velociraptor grant asked tim he was just making conversation its a small carnivore that hunted in packs like deinonychus tim said thats right grant said although the evidence for pack hunting is all circumstantial it derives in part from the appearance of the animals which are quick and strong but small for dinosaursjust a hundred and fifty to three hundred pounds each we assume they hunted in groups if they were to bring down larger prey and there are some fossil finds in which a single large prey animal is associated with several raptor skeletons suggesting they hunted in packs and of course raptors were largebrained more intelligent than most dinosaurs how intelligent is that malcolm asked depends on who you talk to grant said just as paleontologists have come around to the idea that dinosaurs were probably warmblooded a lot of us are starting to think some of them might have been quite intelligent too but nobody knows for sure they left the visitor area behind and soon they heard the loud hum of generators smelled the faint odor of gasoline they passed a grove of palm trees and saw a large low concrete shed with a steel roof the noise seemed to come from there they looked in the shed it must be a generator ellie said its big grant said peering inside the power plant actually extended two stories below ground level a vast complex of whining turbines and piping that ran down in the earth lit by harsh electric bulbs they cant need all this just for a resort malcolm said theyre generating enough power here for a small city maybe for the computers maybe grant heard bleating and walked north a few yards he came to an animal enclosure with goats by a quick count he estimated there were fifty or sixty goats whats that for ellie asked beats me probably they feed em to the dinosaurs malcolm said the group walked on following a dirt path through a dense bamboo grove at the far side they came to a doublelayer chainlink fence twelve feet high with spirals of barbed wire at the top there was an electric hum along the outer fence beyond the fences grant saw dense clusters of large ferns five feet high he heard a snorting sound a kind of snuffling then the sound of crunching footsteps coming closer then a long silence i dont see anything tim whispered finally ssssh grant waited several seconds passed flies buzzed in the air he still saw nothing ellie tapped him on the shoulder and pointed amid the ferns grant saw the head of an animal it was motionless partially hidden in the fronds the two large dark eyes watching them coldly the head was two feet long from a pointed snout a long row of teeth ran back to the hole of the auditory meatus which served as an ear the head reminded him of a large lizard or perhaps a crocodile the eyes did not blink and the animal did not move its skin was leathery with a pebbled texture and basically the same coloration as the infants yellowbrown with darker reddish markings like the stripes of a tiger as grant watched a single forelimb reached up very slowly to part the ferns beside the animals face the limb grant saw was strongly muscled the hand had three grasping fingers each ending in curved claws the band gently slowly pushed aside the ferns grant felt a chill and thought hes hunting us for a mammal like man there was something indescribably alien about the way reptiles hunted their prey no wonder men hated reptiles the stillness the coldness the pace was all wrong to be among alligators or other large reptiles was to be reminded of a different kind of life a different kind of world now vanished from the earth of course this animal didnt realize that he had been spotted that he the attack came suddenly from the left and right charging raptors covered the ten yards to the fence with shocking speed grant had a blurred impression of powerful sixfoottall bodies stiff balancing tails limbs with curving claws open jaws with rows of jagged teetb the animals snarled as they came forward and then leapt bodily into the air raising their hind legs with their big daggerclaws then they struck the fence in front of them throwing off twin bursts of hot sparks the veloctiraptors fell backward to the ground hissing the visitors all moved forward fascinated only then did the third animal attack leaping up to strike the fence at chest level tim screamed in fright as the sparks exploded all around him the creatures snarled a low reptilian hissing sound and leapt back among the ferns then they were gone leaving behind a faint odor of decay and banging acrid smoke holy shit tim said it was so fast ellie said pack hunters grant said shaking his head pack hunters for whom ambush is an instinct fascinating i wouldnt call them tremendously intelligent malcolm said on the other side of the fence they heard snorting in the palm trees several heads poked slowly out of the foliage grant counted three four five the animals watched them staring coldly a black man in coveralls came running up to them are you all right were okay grant said the alarms were set off the man looked at the fence dented and charred they attacked you three of them did yes the black man nodded they do that all the time hit the fence take a shock they never seem to mind not too smart are they malcolm said the black man paused he squinted at malcolm in the afternoon light be glad for that fence senor he said and turned away from beginning to end the entire attack could not have taken more than six seconds grant was still trying to organize his impressions the speed was astonishingthe animals were so fast he had hardly seen them move walking back malcolm said they are remarkably fast yes grant said much faster than any living reptile a bull alligator can move quickly but only over a short distancefive or six feet big lizards like the fivefoot komodo dragons of indonesia have been clocked at thirty miles an hour fast enough to run down a man and they kill men all the time but id guess the animal behind the fence was more than twice that fast cheetah speed malcolm said sixty seventy miles an hour exactly but they seemed to dart forward malcolm said rather like birds yes in the contemporary world only very small mammals like the cobrafighting mongoose had such quick responses small mammals and of course birds the snakehunting secretary bird of africa or the cassowary in fact the velociraptor conveyed precisely the same impression of deadly swift menace grant had seen in the cassowary the clawed ostrichlike bird of new guinea so these velociraptors look like reptiles with the skin and general appearance of reptiles but they move like birds with the speed and predatory intelligence of birds is that about it malcolm said yes grant said id say they display a mixture of traits does that surprise you not really grant said its actually rather close to what paleontologists believed a long time ago when the first giant bones were found in the s and s scientists felt obliged to explain the bones as belonging to some oversize variant of a modern species this was because it was believed that no species could ever become extinct since god would not allow one of his creations to die eventually it became clear that this conception of god was mistaken and the bones belonged to extinct animals but what kind of animals in richard owen the leading british anatomist of the day called them dinosauria meaning terrible lizards owen recognized that dinosaurs seemed to combine traits of lizards crocodiles and birds in particular dinosaur hips were birdlike not lizardlike and unlike lizards many dinosaurs seemed to stand upright owen imagined dinosaurs to be quickmoving active creatures and his view was accepted for the next forty years but when truly gigantic finds were unearthedanimals that had weighed a hundred tons in lifescientists began to envision the dinosaurs as stupid slowmoving giants destined for extinction the image of the sluggish reptile gradually predominated over the image of the quickmoving bird in recent years scientists like grant had begun to swing back toward the idea of more active dinosaurs grants colleagues saw him as radical in his conception of dinosaur behavior but now he had to admit his own conception had fallen far short of the reality of these large incredibly swift hunters actually what i was driving at malcolm said was this is it a persuasive animal to you is it in fact a dinosaur id say so yes and the coordinated attack behavior to be expected grant said according to the fossil record packs of velociraptors were capable of bringing down animals that weighed a thousand pounds like tenontosaurus which could run as fast as a horse coordination would be required how do they do that without language oh language isnt necessary for coordinated hunting ellie said chimpanzees do it all the time a group of chimps will stalk a monkey and kill it all communication is by eyes and were the dinosaurs in fact attacking us yes they would kill us and eat us if they could malcolm said i think so the reason i ask malcolm said is that im told large predators such as lions and tigers are not born maneaters isnt that true these animals must learn somewhere along the way that human beings are easy to kill only afterward do they become mankillers yes i believe thats true grant said well these dinosaurs must be even more reluctant than lions and tigers after all they come from a time before human beingsor even large mammalsexisted at all god knows what they think when they see us so i wonder have they learned somewhere along the line that humans are easy to kill the group fell silent as they walked in any case malcolm said i shall be extremely interested to see the control room now version was there any problem with the group hammond asked no henry wu said there was no problem at all they accepted your explanation why shouldnt they wu said its all quite straightforward in the broad strokes its only the details that get sticky and i wanted to talk about the details with you today you can think of it as a matter of aesthetics john hammond wrinkled his nose as if he smelled something disagreeable aesthetics he repeated they were standing in the living room of hammonds elegant bungalow set back among palm trees in the northern sector of the park the living room was airy and comfortable fitted with a halfdozen video monitors showing the animals in the park the file wu had brought stamped animal development version lay on the coffee table hammond was looking at him in that patient paternal way wu thirtythree years old was acutely aware that he had worked for hammond all his professional life hammond had hired him right out of graduate school of course there are practical consequences as well wu said i really think you should consider my recommendations for phase two we should go to version you want to replace all the current stock of animals hammond said yes i do why whats wrong with them nothing wu said except that theyre real dinosaurs thats what i asked for henry hammond said smiling and thats what you gave me i know wu said but you see he paused how could he explain this to hammond hammond hardly ever visited the island and it was a peculiar situation that wu was trying to convey right now as we stand here almost no one in the world has ever seen an actual dinosaur nobody knows what theyre really like yes the dinosaurs we have now are real wu said pointing to the screens around the room but in certain ways they are unsatisfactory unconvincing i could make them better better in what way for one thing they move too fast henry wu said people arent accustomed to seeing large animals that are so quick im afraid visitors will think the dinosaurs look speeded up like film running too fast but henry these are real dinosaurs you said so yourself i know wu said but we could easily breed slower more domesticated dinosaurs domesticated dinosaurs hammond snorted nobody wants domesticated dinosaurs henry they want the real thing but thats my point wu said i dont think they do they want to see their expectation which is quite different hammond was frowning you said yourself john this park is entertainment wu said and entertainment has nothing to do with reality entertainment is antithetical to reality hammond sighed now henry are we going to have another one of those abstract discussions you know i like to keep it simple the dinosaurs we have now are real and well not exactly wu said he paced the living room pointed to the monitors i dont think we should kid ourselves we havent recreated the past here the past is gone it can never be recreated what weve done is reconstruct the pastor at least a version of the past and im saying we can make a better version better than real why not wu said after all these animals are already modified weve inserted genes to make them patentable and to make them lysine dependent and weve done everything we can to promote growth and accelerate development into adulthood hammond shrugged that was inevitable we didnt want to wait we have investors to consider of course but im ust saying why stop there why not push ahead to make exactly the kind of dinosaur that wed like to see one that is more acceptable to visitors and one that is easier for us to handle a slower more docile version for our park hammond frowned but then the dinosaurs wouldnt be real but theyre not real now wu said thats what im trying to tell you there isnt any reality here he shrugged helplessly he could see he wasnt getting through hammond had never been interested in technical details and the essence of the argument was technical how could he explain to hammond about the reality of dna dropouts the patches the gaps in the sequence that wu had been obliged to fill in making the best guesses he could but still making guesses the dna of the dinosaurs was like old photographs that had been retouched basically the same as the original but in some places repaired and clarified and as a result now henry hammond said putting his arm around wus shoulder if you dont mind my saying so i think youre getting cold feet youve been working very hard for a long time and youve done a hell of a joba hell of a joband its finally time to reveal to some people what youve done its natural to be a little nervous to have some doubts but i am convinced henry that the world will be entirely satisfied entirely satisfied as he spoke hammond steered him toward the door but john wu said remember back in when we started to build the containment devices we didnt have any fullgrown adults yet so we had to predict what wed need we ordered big taser shockers cars with cattle prods mounted on them guns that blow out electric nets all built specially to our specifications weve got a whole array of devices now and theyre all too slow weve got to make some adjustments you know that muldoon wants military equipment tow missiles and laserguided devices lets leave muldoon out of this hammond said im not worried its just a zoo henry the phone rang and hammond went to answer it wu tried to think of another way to press his case but the fact was that after five long years jurassic park was nearing completion and john hammond lust wasnt listening to him any more there had been a time when hammond listened to wu very attentively especially when he had first recruited him back in the days when henry wu was a twentyeightyearold graduate student getting his doctorate at stanford in norman athertons tab athertons death had thrown the lab into confusion as well as mourning no one knew what would happen to the funding or the doctoral programs there was a lot of uncertainty people worried about their careers two weeks after the funeral john hammond came to see wu everyone in the lab knew that atherton had had some association with hammond although the details were never clear but hammond had approached wu with a directness wu never forgot norman always said youre the best geneticist in his lab he said what are your plans now i dont know research you want a university appointment yes thats a mistake hammond said briskly at least if you respect your talent wu had blinked why because lets face facts hammond said universities are no longer the intellectual centers of the country the very idea is preposterous universities are the backwater dont look so surprised im not saying anything you dont know since world war ii all the really important discoveries have come out of private laboratories the laser the transistor the polio vaccine the microchip the hologram the personal computer magnetic resonance imaging cat scansthe list goes on and on universities simply arent where its happening any more and they havent been for forty years if you want to do something important in computers or genetics you dont go to a university dear me no wu found he was speechless good heavens hammond said what must you go through to start a new project how many grant applications how many forms how many approvals the steering committee the department chairman the university resources committee how do you get more work space if you need i t more assistants if you need them how long does all that take a brilliant man cant squander precious time with forms and committees life is too short and dna too long you want to make your mark if you want to get something done stay out of universities in those days wu desperately wanted to make his mark john hammond had his full attention im talking about work hammond continued real accomplishment what does a scientist need to work he needs time and he needs money im talking about giving you a fiveyear commitment and ten million dollars a year in funding fifty million dollars and no one tells you how to spend it you decide everyone else just gets out of your way it sounded too good to be true wu was silent for a long time finally he said in return for what for taking a crack at the impossible hammond said for trying something that probably cant be done what does it involve i cant give you details but the general area involves cloning reptiles i dont think thats impossible wu said reptiles are easier than mammals clonings probably only ten fifteen years off assuming some fundamental advances ive got five years hammond said and a lot of money for somebody who wants to take a crack at it now is my work publishable eventually not immediately but eventually publishable wu asked sticking on this point hammond had laughed dont worry if you succeed the whole world will know about what youve done i promise you and now it seemed the whole world would indeed know wu thought after five years of extraordinary effort they were just a year away from opening the park to the public of course those years hadnt gone exactly as hammond had promised wu had had some people telling him what to do and many times fearsome pressures were placed on him and the work itself had shiftedit wasnt even reptilian cloning once they began to understand that dinosaurs were so similar to birds it was avian cloning a very different proposition much more difficult and for the last two years wu had been primarily an administrator supervising teams of researchers and banks of computeroperated gene sequencers administration wasnt the kind of work he relished it wasnt what he had bargained for still he had succeeded he had done what nobody really believed could be done at least in so short a time and henry wu thought that he should have some rights some say in what happened by virtue of his expertise and his efforts instead he found his influence waning with each passing day the dinosaurs existed the procedures for obtaining them were worked out to the point of being routine the technologies were mature and john hammond didnt need henry wu any more that should be fine hammond said speaking into the phone he listened for a while and smiled at wu fine yes fine he hung up where were we henry we were talking about phase two wu said oh yes weve gone over some of this before henry i know but you dont realize excuse me henry hammond said with an edge of impatience in his voice i do realize and i must tell you frankly henry i see no reason to improve upon reality every change weve made in the genome has been forced on us by law or necessity we may make other changes in the future to resist disease or for other reasons but i dont think we should improve upon reality just because we think its better that way we have real dinosaurs out there now thats what people want to see and thats what they should see thats our obligation henry thats honest henry and smiling hammond opened the door for him to leave control grant looked at all the computer monitors in the darkened control room feeling irritable grant didnt like computers he knew that this made him oldfashioned dated as a researcher but he didnt care some of the kids who worked for him had a real feeling for computers an intuition grant never felt that he found computers to be alien mystifying machines even the fundamental distinction between an operating system and an application left him confused and disheartened literally lost in a foreign geography he didnt begin to comprehend but he noticed that gennaro was perfectly comfortable and malcolm seemed to be in his element making little sniffing sounds like a bloodhound on a trail you want to know about control mechanisms john arnold said turning in his chair in the control room the head engineer was a thin tense chainsmoking man of fortyfive he squinted at the others in the room we have unbelievable control mechanisms arnold said and lit another cigarette for example gennaro said for example animal tracking arnold pressed a button on his console and the vertical glass map lit up with a pattern of jagged blue lines thats our juvenile trex the little rex all his movements within the park over the last twentyfour hours arnold pressed the button again previous twentyfour and again previous twentyfour the lines on the map became densely overlaid a childs scribble but the scribble was localized in a single area near the southeast side of the lagoon you get a sense of his home range over time arnold said hes young so he stays close to the water and he stays away from the big adult rex you put up the big rex and the little rex and youll see their paths never cross where is the big rex right now gennaro asked arnold pushed another button the map cleared and a single glowing spot with a code number appeared in the fields northwest of the lagoon hes right there and the little rex hell ill show you every animal in the park arnold said the map began to light up like a christmas tree dozens of spots of light each tagged with a code number thats two hundred thirtyeight animals as of this minute how accurate within five feet arnold puffed on the cigarette lets put it this way you drive out in a vehicle and you will find the animals right there exactly as theyre shown on the map how often is this updated every thirty seconds pretty impressive gennaro said hows it done we have motion sensors all around the park arnold said most of em hardwired some radiotelemetered of course motion sensors wont usually tell you the species but we get image recognition direct off the video even when were not watching the video monitors the computer is and checking where everybody is does the computer ever make a mistake only with the babies it mixes those up sometimes because theyre such small images but we dont sweat that the babies almost always stay close to herds of adults also you have the category tally whats that once every fifteen minutes the computer tallies the animals in all categories arnold said like this total animals species expected found ver tyrannosaurs maiasaurs stegosaurs triceratops procompsognathids othnielia velociraptors apatosaurs hadrosaurs dilophosaurs pterosaurs hypsilophodontids euoplocepbalids styracosaurs callovosaurs total what you see here arnold said is an entirely separate counting procedure it isnt based on the tracking data its a fresh look the whole idea is that the computer cant make a mistake because it compares two different ways of gathering the data if an animal were missing wed know it within five minutes i see malcolm said and has that ever actually been tested well in a way arnold said weve had a few animals die an othniellan got caught in the branches of a tree and strangled one of the stegos died of that intestinal illness that keeps bothering them one of the hypsilophodonts fell and broke his neck and in each case once the animal stopped moving the numbers stopped tallying and the computer signaled an alert within five minutes yes grant said what is the righthand column release version of the animals the most recent are version or were considering going to version version numbers you mean like software new releases well yes arnold said it is like software in a way as we discover the glitches in the dna dr wus labs have to make a new version the idea of living creatures being numbered like software being subject to updates and revisions troubled grant he could not exactly say whyit was too new a thoughtout he was instinctively uneasy about it they were after all living creatures arnold must have noticed his expression because he said look dr grant theres no point getting starryeyed about these animals its important for everyone to remember that these animals are created created by man sometimes there are bugs so as we discover the bugs dr wus labs have to make a new version and we need to keep track of what version we have out there yes yes of course you do malcolm said impatiently but going back to the matter of countingi take it all the counts are based on motion sensors yes and these sensors are everywhere in the park they cover ninetytwo percent of the land area arnold said there are only a few places we cant use them for example we cant use them on the jungle river because the movement of the water and the convection rising from the surface screws up the sensors but we have them nearly everywhere else and if the computer tracks an animal into an unsensed zone itll remember and look for the animal to come out again and if it doesnt it gives us an alarm now then malcolm said you show fortynine procompsognatbids suppose i suspect that some of them arent really the correct species how would you show me that im wrong two ways arnold said first of all i can track individual movements against the other presumed compys compys are social animals they move in a group we have two compy groups in the park so the individuals should be within either group a or group b yes but the other way is direct visual he said he punched buttons and one of the monitors began to flick rapidly through images of compys numbered from to these pictures are current id images from within the last five minutes so you can see all the animals if you want to yes i can visually review all the animals whenever i want how about physical containment gennaro said can they get out of their enclosures absolutely not arnold said these are expensive animals mr gennaro we take very good care of them we maintain multiple barriers first the moats he pressed a button and the board lit up with a network of orange bars these moats are never less than twelve feet deep and waterfilled for bigger animals the moats may be thirty feet deep next the electrified fences lines of bright red glowed on the board we have fifty miles of twelvefoothigh fencing including twentytwo miles around the perimeter of the island all the park fences carry ten thousand volts the animals quickly learn not to go near them but if one did get out gennaro said arnold snorted and stubbed out his cigarette just hypothetically gennaro said supposing it happened muldoon cleared his throat wed go out and get the animal back he said we have lots of ways to do thattaser shock guns electrified nets tranquilizers all nonlethal because as mr arnold says these are expensive animals gennaro nodded and if one got off the island itd die in less than twentyfour hours arnold said these are genetically engineered animals theyre unable to survive in the real world how about this control system itself gennaro said could anybody tamper with it arnold was shaking his head the system is hardened the computer is independent in every way independent power and independent backup power the system does not communicate with the outside so it cannot be influenced remotely by modem the computer system is secure there was a pause arnold puffed his cigarette hell of a system he said hell of a goddamned system then i guess malcolm said your system works so well you dont have any problems weve got endless problems here arnold said raising an eyebrow but none of the things you worry about i gather youre worried that the animals will escape and will get to the mainland and raise hell we havent got any concern about that at all we see these animals as fragile and delicate theyve been brought back after sixtyfive million years to a world thats very different from the one they left the one they were adapted to we have a hell of a time caring for them you have to realize arnold continued that men have been keeping mammals and reptiles in zoos for hundreds of years so we know a lot about how to take care of an elephant or a croc but nobody has ever tried to take care of a dinosaur before they are new animals and we just dont know diseases in our animals are the biggest concern diseases gennaro said suddenly alarmed is there any way that a visitor could get sick arnold snorted again you ever catch a cold from a zoo alligator mr gennaro zoos dont worry about that neither do we what we do worry about is the animals dying from their own illnesses or infecting other animals but we have programs to monitor that too you want to see the big rexs health file his vaccination record his dental record thats somethingyou ought to see the vets scrubbing those big fangs so he doesnt get tooth decay not just now gennaro said what about your mechanical systems you mean the rides arnold said grant looked up sharply rides none of the rides are running yet arnold was saying we have the jungle river ride where the boats follow tracks underwater and we have the aviary lodge ride but none of its operational yet the parkll open with the basic dinosaur tourthe one that youre about to take in a few minutes the other rides will come on line six twelve months after that wait a minute grant said youre going to have rides like an amusement park arnold said this is a zoological park we have tours of different areas and we call them rides thats all grant frowned again he felt troubled he didnt like the idea of dinosaurs being used for an amusement park malcolm continued his questions you can run the whole park from this control room yes arnold said i can run it singlehanded if i have to weve got that much automation built in the computer by itself can track the animals feed them and fill their water troughs for fortyeight hours without supervision this is the system mr nedry designed malcolm asked dennis nedry was sitting at a terminal in the far corner of the room eating a candy bar and typing yes thats right nedry said not looking up from the keyboard its a hell of a system arnold said proudly thats right nedry said absently just one or two minor bugs to fix now arnold said i see the tour is starting so unless you have other questions actually just one malcolm said just a research question you showed us that you can track the procompsognathids and you can visually display them individually can you do any studies of them as a group measure them or whatever if i wanted to know height or weight or arnold was punching buttons another screen came up picture we can do all of that and very quickly arnold said the computer takes measurement data in the course of reading the video screens so it is translatable at once you see here we have a normal poisson distribution for the animal population it shows that most of the animals cluster around an average central value and a few are either larger or smaller than the average at the tails of the curve youd expect that kind of graph malcolm said yes any healthy biological population shows this kind of distribution now then arnold said lighting another cigarette are there any other questions no malcolm said ive learned what i need to know as they were walking out gennaro said it looks like a pretty good system to me i dont see how any animals could get off this island dont you malcolm said i thought it was completely obvious wait a minute gennaro said you think animals have gotten out i know they have gennaro said but how you saw for yourself they can count all the animals they can look at all the animals they know where all the animals are at all times how can one possibly escape malcolm smiled its quite obvious he said its just a matter of your assumptions your assumptions gennaro repeated frowning yes malcolm said look here the basic event that has occurred in jurassic park is that the scientists and technicians have tried to make a new complete biological world and the scientists in the control room expect to see a natural world as in the graph they just showed us even though a moments thought reveals that nice normal distribution is terribly worrisome on this island it is yes based on what dr wu told us earlier one should never see a population graph like that why not gennaro said because that is a graph for a normal biological population which is precisely what jurassic park is not jurassic park is not the real world it is intended to be a controlled world that only imitates the natural world in that sense its a true park rather like a japanese formal garden nature manipulated to be more natural than the real thing if you will im afraid youve lost me gennaro said looking annoyed im sure the tour will make everything clear malcolm said the tour this way everybody this way ed regis said by his side a woman was passing out pith helmets with jurassic park labeled on the headband and a little blue dinosaur logo a line of toyota land cruisers came out of an underground garage beneath the visitor center each car pulled up driverless and silent two black men in safari uniforms were opening the doors for passengers two to four passengers to a car please two to four passengers to a car a recorded voice was saying children under ten must be accompanied by an adult two to four passengers to a car please tim watched as grant sattler and malcolm got into the first land cruiser with the lawyer gennaro tim looked over at lex who was standing pounding her fist into her glove tim pointed to the first car and said can i go with them im afraid they have things to discuss ed regis said technical things im interested in technical things tim said id rather go with them well youll be able to hear what theyre saying regis said well have a radio open between the cars the second car came tim and lex got in and ed regis followed these are electric cars regis said guided by a cable in the roadway tim was glad he was sitting in the front seat because mounted in the dashboard were two computer screens and a box that looked to him like a cdrom that was a laser disk player controlled by a computer there was also a portable walkietalkie and some kind of a radio transmitter there were two antennas on the roof and some odd goggles in the map pocket the black men shut the doors of the land cruiser the car started off with an electric hum up ahead the three scientists and gennaro were talking and pointing clearly excited ed regis said lets hear what they are saying an intercom clicked i dont know what the hell you think youre doing here gennaro said over the intercom he sounded very angry i know quite well why im here malcolm said youre here to advise me not play goddamned mind games ive got five percent of this company and a responsibility to make sure that hammond has done his job responsibly now you goddamn come here ed regis pressed the intercom button and said in keeping with the nonpolluting policies of jurassic park these lightweight electric land cruisers have been specially built for us by toyota in osaka eventually we hope to drive among the animalsjust as they do in african game parksbut for now sit back and enjoy the selfguided tour he paused and by the way we can hear you back here oh christ gennaro said i have to be able to speak freely i didnt ask for these damned kids to come ed regis smiled blandly and pushed a button well just begin the show shall we they heard a fanfare of trumpets and the interior screens flashed welcome to jurassic park a sonorous voice said welcome to jurassic park you are now entering the lost world of the prehistoric past a world of mighty creatures long gone from the face of the earth which you are privileged to see for the first time thats richard kiley ed regis said we spared no expense the land cruiser passed through a grove of low stumpy palm trees richard kiley was saying notice first of all the remarkable plant life that surrounds you those trees to your left and right are called cycads the prehistoric predecessors of palm trees cycads were a favorite food of the dinosaurs you can also see bennettitaleans and ginkgoes the world of the dinosaur included more modern plants such as pine and fir trees and swamp cypresses you will see these as well the land cruiser moved slowly among the foliage tim noticed the fences and retaining walls were screened by greenery to heighten the illusion of moving through real jungle we imagine the world of the dinosaurs said richard kileys voice as a world of huge vegetarians eating their way through the giant swampy forests of the jurassic and cretaceous world a hundred million years ago but most dinosaurs were not as large as people think the smallest dinosaurs were no bigger than a house cat and the average dinosaur was about as big as a pony we are first going to visit one of these averagesize animals called hypsilophodonts if you look to your left you may catch a glimpse of them now they all looked to the left the land cruiser stopped on a low rise where a break in the foliage provided a view to the east they could see a sloping forested area which opened into a field of yellow grass that was about three feet high there were no dinosaurs where are they lex said tim looked at the dashboard the transmitter lights blinked and the cdrom whirred obviously the disk was being accessed by some automatic system he guessed that the same motion sensors that tracked the animals also controlled the screens in the land cruiser the screens now showed pictures of hypsilophodonts and printed out data about them the voice said hypsilophodontids are the gazelles of the dinosaur world small quick animals that once roamed everywhere in the world from england to central asia to north america we think these dinosaurs were so successful because they had better jaws and teeth for chewing plants than their contemporaries did in fact the name hypsilophodontid means highridge tooth which refers to the characteristic selfsharpening teeth of these animals you can see them in the plains directly ahead and also perhaps in the branches of the trees in the trees lex said dinosaurs in the trees tim was scanning with binoculars too to the right he said halfway up that big green trunk in the dappled shadows of the tree a motionless dark green animal about the size of a baboon stood on a branch it looked like a lizard standing on its hind legs it balanced itself with a long drooping tail thats an othnielia tim said the small animals you see are called othnielia the voice said in honor of the nineteenthcentury dinosaur hunter othniel marsh of yale tim spotted two more animals on higher branches of the same tree they were all about the same size none of them were moving pretty boring lex said theyre not doing anything the main herd of animals can be found in the grassy plain below you said the voice we can rouse them with a simple mating call a loudspeaker by the fence gave a long nasal call like the honking of geese from the field of grass directly to their left six lizard heads poked up one after another the effect was comical and tim laughed the heads disappeared the loudspeaker gave the call again and once again the heads poked upin exactly the same way one after another the fixed repetition of the behavior was striking hypsilophodonts are not especially bright animals the voice explained they have roughly the intelligence of a domestic cow the heads were dull green with a mottling of dark browns and blacks that extended down the slender necks judging from the size of the heads tim guessed their bodies were four feet long about as large as deer some of the hypsilophodonts were chewing the jaws working one reached up and scratched its head with a fivefingered band the gesture gave the creature a pensive thoughtful quality if you see them scratching that is because they have skin problems the veterinary scientists here at jurassic park think it may be a fungus or an allergy but theyre not sure yet after all these are the first dinosaurs in history ever to be studied alive the electric motor of the car started and there was a grinding of gears at the unexpected sound the herd of hypsilophodonts suddenly leapt into the air and bounded above the grass like kangaroos showing their full bodies with massive hind limbs and long tails in the afternoon sunlight in a few leaps they were gone now that weve had a look at these fascinating herbivores we will go on to some dinosaurs that are a little larger quite a bit larger in fact the land cruisers continued onward moving south through jurassic park control gears are grinding john arnold said in the darkened control room have maintenance check the electric clutches on vehicles bb and bb when they come back yes mr arnold replied the voice on the intercom a minor detail hammond said walking in the room looking out he could see the two land cruisers moving south through the park muldoon stood in the corner silently watching arnold pushed his chair back from the central console at the control panel there are no minor details mr hammond he said and he lit another cigarette nervous at most times arnold was especially edgy now he was only too aware that this was the first time visitors had actually toured the park in fact arnolds team didnt often go into the park harding the vet sometimes did the animal handlers went to the individual feeding houses but otherwise they watched the park from the control room and now with visitors out there he worried about a hundred details john arnold was a systems engineer who had worked on the polaris submarine missile in the late s until he had his first child and the prospect of making weapons became too distasteful meanwhile disney had started to create amusement park rides of great technological sophistication and they employed a lot of aerospace people arnold helped build disney world in orlando and had gone on to implement major parks at magic mountain in california old country in virginia and astroworld in houston his continuous employment at parks had eventually given him a somewhat skewed view of reality arnold contended only half jokingly that the entire world was increasingly described by the metaphor of the theme park paris is a theme park he once announced after a vacation although its too expensive and the park employees are unpleasant and sullen for the past two years arnolds job had been to get jurassic park up and running as an engineer he was accustomed to long time scheduleshe often referred to the september opening by which he meant september of the following yearand as the september opening approached he was unhappy with the progress that had been made he knew from experience that it sometimes took years to work the bugs out of a single park ridelet alone get a whole park running properly youre just a worrier hammond said i dont think so arnold said youve got to realize that from an engineering standpoint jurassic park is by far the most ambitious theme park in history visitors will never think about it but i do he ticked the points off on his fingers first jurassic park has all the problems of any amusement parkride maintenance queue control transportation food handling living accommodations trash disposal security second we have all the problems of a major zoocare of the animals health and welfare feeding and cleanliness protection from insects pests allergies and illnesses maintenance of barriers and all the rest and finally we have the unprecedented problems of caring for a population of animals that no one has ever tried to maintain before oh its not as bad as all that hammond said yes it is youre just not here to see it arnold said the tyrannosaurs drink the lagoon water and sometimes get sick we arent sure why the triceratops females kill each other in fights for dominance and have to be separated into groups smaller than six we dont know why the stegosaurs frequently get blisters on their tongues and diarrhea for reasons no one yet understands even though weve lost two hypsilophodonts get skin rashes and the veloctraptors lets not start on the velociraptors hammond said im sick of hearing about the velociraptors how theyre the most vicious creatures anyone has ever seen they are muldoon said in a low voice they should all be destroyed you wanted to fit them with radio collars hammond said and i agreed yes and they promptly chewed the collars off but even if the raptors never get free arnold said i think we have to accept that jurassic park is inherently hazardous oh balls hammond said whose side are you on anyway we now have fifteen species of extinct animals and most of them are dangerous arnold said weve been forced to delay the jungle river ride because of the dilophosaurs and the pteratops lodge in the aviary because the pterodactyls are so unpredictable these arent engineering delays mr hammond theyre problems with control of the animals youve had plenty of engineering delays hammond said dont blame it on the animals yes we have in fact its all we could do to get the main attraction park drive working correctly to get the cdroms inside the cars to be controlled by the motion sensors its taken weeks of adjustment to get that working properlyand now the electric gearshifts on the cars are acting up the gearshifts lets keep it in perspective hammond said you get the engineering correct and the animals will fall into place after all theyre trainable from the beginning this had been one of the core beliefs of the planners the animals however exotic would fundamentally behave like animals in zoos anywhere they would learn the regularities of their care and they would respond meanwhile hows the computer hammond said he glanced at dennis nedry who was working at a terminal in the corner of the room this damn computer has always been a headache were getting there nedry said if you had done it right in the first place hammond began but arnold put a restraining band on his arm arnold knew there was no point in antagonizing nedry while he was working its a large system arnold said there are bound to be glitches in fact the bug list now ran to more than items and included many odd aspects for example the animalfeeding program reset itself every twelve hours not every twentyfour hours and would not record feedings on sundays as a result the staff could not accurately measure how much the animals were eating the security system which controlled all the securitycardoperated doors cut out whenever main power was lost and did not come back on with auxiliary power the security program only ran with main power the physical conservation program intended to dim lights after pm only worked on alternate days of the week the automated fecal analysis called auto poop designed to check for parasites in the animal stools invariably recorded all specimens as having the parasite phagostomum venulosum although none did the program then automatically dispensed medication into the animals food if the handlers dumped the medicine out of the hoppers to prevent its being dispensed an alarm sounded which could not be turned off and so it went page after page of errors when he had arrived dennis nedry had been under the impression that he could make all the fixes himself over the weekend he had paled when he saw the full listing now he was calling his office in cambridge telling his staff programmers they were going to have to cancel their weekend plans and work overtime until monday and he had told john arnold that he would need to use every telephone link between isla nublar and the mainland just to transfer program data back and forth to his programmers while nedry worked arnold punched up a new window in his own monitor it allowed him to see what nedry was doing at the corner console not that he didnt trust nedry but arnold just liked to know what was going on he looked at the graphics display on his righthand console which showed the progress of the electric land cruisers they were following the river just north of the aviary and the ornithischian paddock if you look to your left said the voice you will see the dome of the jurassic park aviary which is not yet finished for visitors tim saw sunlight glinting off aluminum struts in the distance and directly below is our mesozoic jungle riverwhere if you are lucky you just may catch a glimpse of a very rare carnivore keep your eyes peeled everyone inside the land cruiser the screens showed a birdlike head topped with a flaming red crest but everyone in tims car was looking out the windows the car was driving along a high ridge overlooking a fastmoving river below the river was almost enclosed by dense foliage on both sides there they are now said the voice the animals you see are called dilophosaurs despite what the recording said tim saw only one the dilophosaur crouched on its hind legs by the river drinking it was built on the basic carnivore pattern with a heavy tail strong hind limbs and a long neck its tenfoottall body was spotted yellow and black like a leopard but it was the head that held tims attention two broad curving crests ran along the top of the head from the eyes to the nose the crests met in the center making a v shape above the dinosaurs head the crests had red and black stripes reminiscent of a parrot or toucan the animal gave a soft hooting cry like an owl theyre pretty lex said dilophosaurus the tape said is one of the earliest carnivorous dinosaurs scientists thought their jaw muscles were too weak to kill prey and imagined they were primarily scavengers but now we know they are poisonous hey tim grinned all right again the distinctive booting call of the dilophosaur drifted across the afternoon air toward them lex shifted uneasily in her seat are they really poisonous mr regis dont worry about it ed regis said but are they well yes lex along with such living reptiles as gila monsters and rattlesnakes dilophosaurus secretes a hematotoxin from glands in its mouth unconsciousness follows within minutes of a bite the dinosaur will then finish the victim off at its leisuremaking dilophosaurus a beautiful but deadly addition to the animals you see here at jurassic park the land cruiser turned a corner leaving the river behind tim looked back hoping for a last glimpse of the dilophosaur this was amazing poisonous dinosaurs he wished he could stop the car but everything was automatic he bet dr grant wanted to stop the car too if you look on the bluff to the right youll see les gigantes the site of our superb threestar dining room chef alain richard hails from the worldfamous le beaumaniere in france make your reservations by dialing four from your hotel rooms tim looked up on the bluff and saw nothing not for a while though ed regis said the restaurant wont even start construction until november continuing on our prehistoric safari we come next to the herbivores of the ornithischian group if you look to your right you can probably see them now tim saw two animals standing motionless in the shade of a large tree triceratops the size and gray color of an elephant with the truculent stance of a rhino the horns above each eye curved five feet into the air looking almost like inverted elephant tusks a third rhinolike born was located near the nose and they had the beaky snout of a rhino unlike other dinosaurs the voice said triceratops serratus cant see well theyre nearsighted like the rhinos of today and they tend to be surprised by moving objects theyd charge our car if they were close enough to see it but relax folkswere safe enough here triceratops have a fanshaped crest behind their heads its made of solid bone and its very strong these animals weigh about seven tons each despite their appearance they are actually quite docile they know their handlers and theyll allow themselves to be petted they particularly like to be scratched in the hindquarters why dont they move lex said she rolled down her window hey stupid dinosaur move dont bother the animals lex ed regis said why its stupid they just sit there like a picture in a book lex said the voice was saying easygoing monsters from a bygone world stand in sharp contrast to what we will see next the most famous predator in the history of the world the mighty tyrant lizard known as tyrannosaurus rex good tyrannosaurus rex tim said i hope hes better than these bozos lex said turning away from the triceratops the land cruiser rumbled forward big rex the mighty tyrannosaurs arose late in dinosaur history dinosaurs ruled the earth for a hundred and twenty million years but there were tyrannosaurs for only the last fifteen million years of that period the land cruisers had stopped at the rise of a hill they overlooked a forested area sloping down to the edge of the lagoon the sun was falling to the west sinking into a misty horizon the whole landscape of jurassic park was bathed in soft light with lengthening shadows the surface of the lagoon rippled in pink crescents farther south they saw the graceful necks of the camarasaurs standing at the waters edge their bodies mirrored in the moving surface it was quiet except for the soft drone of cicadas as they stared out at that landscape it was possible to believe that they had really been transported millions of years back in time to a vanished world it works doesnt it they heard ed regis say over the intercom i like to come here sometimes in the evening and just sit grant was unimpressed where is trex good question you often see the little one down in the lagoon the lagoons stocked so we have fish in there the little one has learned to catch the fish interesting how he does it he doesnt use his hands but he ducks his whole head under the water like a bird the little one the little trex hes a juvenile two years old and about a third grown now stands eight feet high weighs a ton and a half the other ones a fullgrown tyrannosaur but i dont see him at the moment maybe hes down hunting the camarasaurs grant said regis laughed his voice tinny over the radio he would if he could believe me sometimes he stands by the lagoon and stares at those animals and wiggles those little forearms of his in frustration but the trex territory is completely enclosed with trenches and fences theyre disguised from view but believe me he cant go anywhere then where is he hiding regis said hes a little shy shy malcolm said tyrannosaurus rex is shy well he conceals himself as a general rule you almost never see him out in the open especially in daylight why is that we think its because he has sensitive skin and sunburns easily malcolm began to laugh grant sighed youre destroying a lot of illusions i dont think youll be disappointed regis said just wait they heard a soft bleating sound in the center of a field a small cage rose up into view lifted on hydraulics from underground the cage bars slid down and the goat remained tethered in the center of the field bleating plaintively any minute now regis said again they stared out the window look at them hammond said watching the control room monitor leaning out of the windows so eager they cant wait to see it they have come for the danger thats what im afraid of muldoon said he twirled the keys on his finger and watched the land cruisers tensely this was the first time that visitors had toured jurassic park and muldoon shared arnolds apprehension robert muldoon was a big man fifty years old with a steelgray mustache and deep blue eyes raised in kenya he had spent most of his life as a guide for african biggame hunters as had his father before him but since he had worked principally for conservation groups and zoo designers as a wildlife consultant he had become well known an article in the london sunday times had said what robert trent jones is to golf courses robert muldoon is to zoos a designer of unsurpassed knowledge and skill in he had done some work for a san francisco company that was building a private wildlife park on an island in north america muldoon had laid out the boundaries for different animals defining space and habitat requirements for lions elephants zebras and hippos identifying which animals could be kept together and which had to be separated at the time it had been a fairly routine job he had been more interested in an indian park called tigerworld in southern kashmir then a year ago he was offered a job as game warden of jurassic park it coincided with a desire to leave africa the salary was excellent muldoon had taken it on for a year he was astonished to discover the park was really a collection of genetically engineered prehistoric animals it was of course interesting work but during his years in africa muldoon had developed an unblinking view of animalsan unromantic viewthat frequently set him at odds with the jurassic park management in california particularly the little martinet standing beside him in the control room in muldoons opinion cloning dinosaurs in a laboratory was one thing maintaining them in the wild was quite another it was muldoons view that some dinosaurs were too dangerous to be kept in a park setting in part the danger existed because they still knew so little about the animals for example nobody even suspected the dilophosaurs were poisonous until they were observed hunting indigenous rats on the islandbiting the rodents and then stepping back to wait for them to die and even then nobody suspected the dilophosaurs could spit until one of the handlers was almost blinded by spitting venom after that hammond had agreed to study dilophosaur venom which was found to contain seven different toxic enzymes it was also discovered that the dilophosaurs could spit a distance of fifty feet since this raised the possibility that a guest in a car might be blinded management decided to remove the poison sacs the vets had tried twice on two different animals without success no one knew where the poison was being secreted and no one would ever know until an autopsy was performed on a dilophosaur and management would not allow one to be killed muldoon worried even more about the velociraptors they were instinctive hunters and they never passed up prey they killed even when they t werent hungry they killed for the pleasure of killing they were swift strong runners and astonishing jumpers they had lethal claws on all four limbs one swipe of a forearm would disembowel a man spilling his guts out and they had powerful tearing jaws that ripped flesh instead of biting it they were far more intelligent than the other dinosaurs and they seemed to be natural cagebreakers every zoo expert knew that certain animals were especially likely to get free of their cages some like monkeys and elephants could undo cage doors others like wild pigs were unusually intelligent and could lift gate fasteners with their snouts but who would suspect that the giant armadillo was a notorious cagebreaker or the moose yet a moose was almost as skillful with its snout as an elephant with its trunk moose were always getting free they had a talent for it and so did velociraptors raptors were at least as intelligent as chimpanzees and like chimpanzees they had agile hands that enabled them to open doors and manipulate objects they could escape with ease and when as muldoon had feared one of them finally escaped it killed two construction workers and maimed a third before being recaptured after that episode the visitor lodge had been reworked with heavy barred gates a high perimeter fence and temperedglass windows and the raptor holding pen was rebuilt with electronic sensors to warn of another impending escape muldoon wanted guns as well and he wanted shouldermounted towmissile launchers hunters knew how difficult it was to bring down a fourton african elephantand some of the dinosaurs weighed ten times as much management was horrified insisting there be no guns anywhere on the island when muldoon threatened to quit and to take his story to the press a compromise was reached in the end two specially built laserguided missile launchers were kept in a locked room in the basement only muldoon had keys to the room those were the keys muldoon was twirling now im going downstairs he said arnold watching the control screens nodded the two land cruisers sat at the top of the hill waiting for the trex to appear hey dennis nedry called from the far console as long as youre up get me a coke okay grant waited in the car watching quietly the bleating of the goat became louder more insistent the goat tugged frantically at its tether racing back and forth over the radio grant heard lex say in alarm whats going to happen to the goat is she going to eat the goat i think so someone said to her and then ellie turned the radio down then they smelled the odor a garbage stench of putrefaction and decay that drifted up the hillside toward them grant whispered hes here she malcolm said the goat was tethered in the center of the field thirty yards from the nearest trees the dinosaur must be somewhere among the trees but for a moment grant could see nothing at all then he realized he was looking too low the animals head stood twenty feet above the ground half concealed among the upper branches of the palm trees malcolm whispered oh my god shes as large as a bloody building grant stared at the enormous square head five feet long mottled reddish brown with huge jaws and fangs the tyrannosaurs jaws worked once opening and closing but the huge animal did not emerge from hiding malcolm whispered how long will it wait maybe three or four minutes maybe the tyrannosaur sprang silently forward fully revealing her enormous body in four bounding steps she covered the distance to the goat bent down and bit it through the neck the bleating stopped there was silence poised over her kill the tyrannosaur became suddenly hesitant her massive head turned on the muscular neck looking in all directions she stared fixedly at the land cruiser high above on the hill malcolm whispered can she see us oh yes regis said on the intercom lets see if shes going to eat here in front of us or if shes going to drag the prey away the tyrannosaur bent down and sniffed the carcass of the goat a bird chirped her head snapped up alert watchful she looked back and forth scanning in small jerking shifts like a bird ellie said still the tyrannosaur hesitated what is she afraid of malcolm whispered probably another tyrannosaur grant whispered big carnivores like lions and tigers often became cautious after a kill behaving as if suddenly exposed nineteenthcentury zoologists imagined the animals felt guilty for what they had done but contemporary scientists documented the effort behind a killhours of patient stalking before the final lungeas well as the frequency of failure the idea of nature red in tooth and claw was wrong most often the prey got away when a carnivore finally brought down an animal it was watchful for another predator who might attack it and steal its prize thus this tyrannosaur was probably fearful of another tyrannosaur the huge animal bent over the goat again one great hind limb held the carcass in place as the jaws began to tear the flesh shes going to stay regis whispered excellent the tyrannosaur lifted her head again ragged chunks of bleeding flesh in her jaws she stared at the land cruiser she began to chew they heard the sickening crunch of bones ewww lex said over the intercom thats disgusting and then as if caution had finally gotten the better of her the tyrannosaur lifted the remains of the goat in her jaws and carried it silently back among the trees ladies and gentlemen tyrannosaurus rex the tape said the land cruisers started up and moved silently off through the foliage malcolm sat back in his seat fantastic he said gennaro wiped his forehead he looked pale control henry wu came into the control room to find everyone sitting in the dark listening to the voices on the radio jesus if an animal like that gets out gennaro was saying his voice tinny on the speaker thered be no stopping it no stopping it no huge with no natural enemies my god think of it in the control room hammond said damn those people they are so negative wu said theyre still going on about an animal escaping i dont understand they must have seen by now that we have everything under control weve engineered the animals and engineered the resort he shrugged it was wus deepest perception that the park was fundamentally sound as he believed his paleodna was fundamentally sound whatever problems might arise in the dna were essentially pointproblems in the code causing a specific problem in the phenotype an enzyme that didnt switch on or a protein that didnt fold whatever the difficulty it was always solved with a relatively minor adjustment in the next version similarly he knew that jurassic parks problems were not fundamental problems they were not control problems nothing as basic or as serious as the possibility of an animal escaping wu found it offensive to think that anyone would believe him capable of contributing to a system where such a thing could happen its that malcolm hammond said darkly hes behind it all he was against us from the start you know hes got his theory that complex systems cant be controlled and nature cant be imitated i dont know what his problem is hell were just making a zoo here worlds full of em and they all work fine but hes going to prove his theory or die trying i just hope he doesnt panic gennaro into trying to shut the park down wu said can he do that no hammond said but he can try he can try and frighten the japanese investors and get them to withdraw funds or he can make a stink with the san jose government he can make trouble arnold stubbed out his cigarette lets wait and see what happens he said we believe in the park lets see how it plays out muldoon got off the elevator nodded to the groundfloor guard and went downstairs to the basement he flicked on the lights the basement was filled with two dozen land cruisers arranged in neat rows these were the electric cars that would eventually form an endless loop touring the park returning to the visitor center in the corner was a jeep with a red stripe one of two gasolinepowered vebiclesharding the vet had taken the other that morningwhich could go anywhere in the park even among the animals the jeeps were painted with a diagonal red stripe because for some reason it discouraged the triceratops from charging the car muldoon moved past the jeep toward the back the steel door to the armaments room was unmarked he unlocked it with his key and swung the heavy door wide gun racks lined the interior he pulled out a randler shoulder launcher and a case of canisters he tucked two gray rockets under his other arm after locking the door behind him he put the gun into the back seat of the jeep as he left the garage he heard the distant rumble of thunder looks like rain ed regis said glancing up at the sky the land cruisers had stopped again near the sauropod swamp a large herd of apatosaurs was grazing at the edge of the lagoon eating the leaves of the upper branches of the palm trees in the same area were several duckbilled hadrosaurs which in comparison looked much smaller of course tim knew the hadrosaurs werent really small it was only that the apatosaurs were so much larger their tiny heads reached fifty feet into the air extending out on their long necks the big animals you see are commonly called brontosaurus the recording said but they are actually apatosaurus they weigh more than thirty tons that means a single animal is as big as a whole herd of modern elephants and you may notice that their preferred area alongside the lagoon is not swampy despite what the books say brontosaurs avoid swamps they prefer dry land brontosaurus is the biggest dinosaur lex ed regis said tim didnt bother to contradict him actually brachiosaurus was three times as large and some people thought ultrasaurus and seismosaurus were even larger than brachiosaurus seismosaurus might have weighed a hundred tons alongside the apatosaurs the smaller hadrosaurs stood on their hind legs to get at foliage they moved gracefully for such large creatures several infant hadrosaurs scampered around the adults eating the leaves that dropped from the mouths of the larger animals the dinosaurs of jurassic park dont breed the recording said the young animals you see were introduced a few months ago already hatched but the adults nurture them anyway there was the rolling growl of thunder the sky was darker lower and menacing yeah looks like rain all right ed regis said the car started forward and tim looked back at the hadrosaurs suddenly off to one side he saw a pale yellow animal moving quickly there were brownish stripes on its back he recognized it instantly hey he shouted stop the car what is it ed regis said quick stop the car we move on now to see the last of our great prehistoric animals the stegosaurs the recorded voice said whats the matter tim i saw one i saw one in the field out there saw what a raptor in that field the stegosaurs are a midjurassic animal evolving about a hundred and seventy million years ago the recording said several of these remarkable herbivores live here at jurassic park oh i dont think so tim ed regis said not a raptor i did stop the car there was a babble on the intercom as the news was relayed to grant and malcolm tim says he saw a raptor where back at the field lets go back and look we cant go back ed regis said we can only go forward the cars are programmed we cant go back grant said no regis said sorry you see its kind of a ride tim this is professor malcolm said a voice cutting in on the intercom i have just one question for you about this raptor how old would you say it was older than the baby we saw today tim said and younger than the big adults in the pen the adults were six feet tall this one was about half that size thats fine malcolm said i only saw it for a second tim said im sure it wasnt a raptor ed regis said it couldnt possibly be a raptor must have been one of the othys theyre always jumping their fences we have a hell of a time with them i know i saw a raptor tim said im hungry lex said she was starting to whine in the control room arnold turned to wu what do you think the kid saw i think it must have been an otby arnold nodded we have trouble tracking otbys because they spend so much time in the trees the otbys were an exception to the usual minutetominute control they maintained over the animals the computers were constantly losing and picking up the othys as they went into the trees and then came down again what burns me hammond said is that we have made this wonderful park this fantastic park and our very first visitors are going through it like accountants just looking for problems they arent experiencing the wonder of it at all thats their problem arnold said we cant make them experience wonder the intercom clicked and arnold heard a voice drawl ah john this is the anne b over at the dock we havent finished offloading but im looking at that storm pattern south of us id rather not be tied up here if this chop gets any worse arnold turned to the monitor showing the cargo vessel which was moored at the dock on the east side of the island he pressed the radio button how much left to do jim just the three final equipment containers i havent checked the mainfest but i assume you can wait another two weeks for it were not well berthed here you know and we are one hundred miles offshore you requesting permission to leave yes john i want that equipment hammond said thats equipment for the labs we need it yes arnold said but you didnt want to put money into a storm barrier to protect the pier so we dont have a good harbor if the storm gets worse the ship will be pounded against the dock ive seen ships lost that way then youve got all the other expenses replacement of the vessel plus salvage to clear your dock and you cant use your dock until you do hammond gave a dismissing wave get them out of there permission to leave anne b arnold said into the radio see you in two weeks the voice said on the video monitor they saw the crew on the decks casting off the lines arnold turned back to the main console bank he saw the land cruisers moving through fields of steam where are they now hammond said it looks like the south fields arnold said the southern end of the island had more volcanic activity than the north that means they should be almost to the stegos im sure theyll stop and see what harding is doing stegosaur as the land cruiser came to a stop ellie sattler stared through the plumes of steam at the stegosaurus it was standing quietly not moving a jeep with a red stripe was parked alongside it i have to admit thats a funnylooking animal malcolm said the stegosaurus was twenty feet long with a huge bulky body and vertical armor plates along its back the tail had dangerouslooking threefoot spikes but the neck tapered to an absurdly small head with a stupid gaze like a very dumb horse as they watched a man walked around from behind the animal thats our vet dr harding regis said over the radio hes anesthetized the stego which is why its not moving its sick grant was already getting out of the car hurrying toward the motionless stegosaur ellie got out and looked back as the second land cruiser pulled up and the two kids jumped out whats he sick with tim said theyre not sure ellie said the great leathery plates along the stegosaurs spine drooped slightly it breathed slowly laboriously making a wet sound with each breath is it contagious lex said they walked toward the tiny head of the animal where grant and the vet were on their knees peering into the stegosaurs mouth lex wrinkled her nose this thing sure is big she said and smelly yes it is ellie had already noticed the stegosaur had a peculiar odor like rotting fish it reminded her of something she knew but couldnt quite place in any case she had never smelled a stegosaur before maybe this was its characteristic odor but she had her doubts most herbivores did not have a strong smell nor did their droppings it was reserved for the meateaters to develop a real stink is that because its sick lex asked maybe and dont forget the vets tranquilized it ellie have a look at this tongue grant said the dark purple tongue drooped limply from the animals mouth the vet shone a light on it so she could see the very fine silvery blisters microvesicles ellie said interesting weve had a difficult time with these stegos the vet said theyre always getting sick what are the symptoms ellie asked she scratched the tongue with her fingernail a clear liquid exuded from the broken blisters ugh lex said imbalance disorientation labored breathing and massive diarrhea harding said seems to happen about once every six weeks or so they feed continuously oh yes harding said animal this size has to take in a minimum of five or six hundred pounds of plant matter daily just to keep going theyre constant foragers then its not likely to be poisoning from a plant ellie said constant browsers would be constantly sick if they were eating a toxic plant not every six weeks exactly the vet said may i ellie asked she took the flashlight from the vet you have pupillary effects from the tranquilizer she said shining the light in the stegosaurs eye yes theres a miotic effect pupils are constricted but these pupils are dilated she said harding looked there was no question the stegosaurs pupil was dilated and did not contract when light shone on it ill be damned he said thats a pharmacological effect yes ellie got back on her feet and looked around what is the animals range about five square miles in this general area she asked they were in an open meadow with scattered rocky outcrops and intermittent plumes of steam rising from the ground it was late afternoon and the sky was pink beneath the lowering gray clouds their range is mostly north and cast of here harding said but when they get sick theyre usually somewhere around this particular area it was an interesting puzzle she thought how to explain the periodicity of the poisoning she pointed across the field you see those low delicatelooking bushes west indian lilac harding nodded we know its toxic the animals dont eat it youre sure yes we monitor them on video and ive checked droppings just to be certain the stegos never eat the lilac bushes melia azedarach called chinaberry or west indian lilac contained a number of toxic alkaloids the chinese used the plant as a fish poison they dont eat it the vet said interesting ellie said because otherwise i would have said that this animal shows all the classic signs of melia toxicity stupor blistering of the mucous membranes and pupillary dilatation she set off toward the field to examine the plants more closely her body bent over the ground youre right she said plants are healthy no sign of being eaten none at all and theres the sixweek interval the vet reminded her the stegosaurs come here how often about once a week he said stegos make a slow loop through their homerange territory feeding as they go they complete the loop in about a week but theyre only sick once every six weeks correct harding said this is boring lex said ssshb tim said dr sattlers trying to think unsuccessfully ellie said walking farther out into the field behind her she heard lex saying anybody want to play a little pickle ellie stared at the ground the field was rocky in many places she could hear the sound of the surf somewhere to the left there were berries among the rocks perhaps the animals were just eating berries but that didnt make sense west indian lilac berries were terribly bitter finding anything grant said coming up to join her ellie sighed just rocks she said we must be near the beach because all these rocks are smooth and theyre in funny little piles funny little piles grant said all over theres one pile right there she pointed as soon as she did she realized what she was looking at the rocks were worn but it had nothing to do with the ocean these rocks were heaped in small piles almost as if they had been thrown down that way they were piles of gizzard stones many birds and crocodiles swallowed small stones which collected in a muscular pouch in the digestive tract called the gizzard squeezed by the muscles of the gizzard the stones helped crush tough plant food before it reached the stomach and thus aided digestion some scientists thought dinosaurs also had gizzard stones for one thing dinosaur teeth were too small and too little worn to have been used for chewing food it was presumed that dinosaurs swallowed their food whole and let the gizzard stones break down the plant fibers and some skeletons had been found with an associated pile of small stones in the abdominal area but it had never been verified and gizzard stones grant said i think so yes they swallow these stones and after a few weeks the stones are worn smooth so they regurgitate them leaving this little pile and swallow fresh stones and when they do they swallow berries as well and get sick ill be damned grant said im sure youre right he looked at the pile of stones brushing through them with his band following the instinct of a paleontologist then he stopped ellie he said take a look at this put it there babe right in the old mitt lex cried and gennaro threw the ball to her she threw it back so hard that his hand stung take it easy i dont have a glove you wimp she said contemptuously annoyed he fired the ball at her and heard it smack in the leather now thats more like it she said standing by the dinosaur gennaro continued to play catch as he talked to malcolm how does this sick dinosaur fit into your theory its predicted malcolm said gennaro shook his head is anything not predicted by your theory look malcolm said its nothing to do with me its chaos theory but i notice nobody is willing to listen to the consequences of the mathematics because they imply very large consequences for human life much larger than heisenbergs principle or godels theorem which everybody rattles on about those are actually rather academic considerations philosophical considerations but chaos theory concerns everyday life do you know why computers were first built no gennaro said burn it in there lex yelled computers were built in the late s because mathematicians like john von neumann thought that if you had a computera machine to handle a lot of variables simultaneouslyyou would be able to predict the weather weather would finally fall to human understanding and men believed that dream for the next forty years they believed that prediction was just a function of keeping track of things if you knew enough you could predict anything thats been a cherished scientific belief since newton and chaos theory throws it right out the window it says that you can never predict certain phenomena at all you can never predict the weather more than a few days away all the money that has been spent on longrange forecastingabout half a billion dollars in the last few decadesis money wasted its a fools errand its as pointless as trying to turn lead into gold we look back at the alchemists and laugh at what they were trying to do but future generations will laugh at us the same way weve tried the impossibleand spent a lot of money doing it because in fact there are great categories of phenomena that are inherently unpredictable chaos says that yes and it is astonishing how few people care to hear it malcolm said i gave all this information to hammond long before he broke ground on this place youre going to engineer a bunch of prehistoric animals and set them on an island fine a lovely dream charming but it wont go as planned it is inherently unpredictable just as the weather is you told him this gennaro said yes i also told him where the deviations would occur obviously the fitness of the animals to the environment was one area this stegosaur is a hundred million years old it isnt adapted to our world the air is different the solar radiation is different the land is different the insects are different the sounds are different the vegetation is different everything is different the oxygen content is decreased this poor animals like a human being at ten thousand feet altitude listen to him wheezing and the other areas broadly speaking the ability of the park to control the spread of life forms because the history of evolution is that life escapes all barriers life breaks free life expands to new territories painfully perhaps even dangerously but life finds a way malcolm shook his head i dont mean to be philosophical but there it is gennaro looked over ellie and grant were across the field waving their arms and shouting did you get my coke dennis nedry asked as muldoon came back into the control room muldoon didnt bother to answer he went directly to the monitor and looked at what was happening over the radio he heard hardings voice saying the stegofinallyhandle onnow whats that about muldoon said theyre down by the south point arnold said thats why theyre breaking up a little ill switch them to another channel but they found out whats wrong with the stegos eating some kind of berry hammond nodded i knew wed solve that sooner or later he said its not very impressive gennaro said he held the white fragment no larger than a postage stamp up on his fingertip in the fading light you sure about this alan absolutely sure grant said what gives it away is the patterning on the interior surface the interior curve turn it over and you will notice a faint pattern of raised lines making roughly triangular shapes yes i see them well ive dug out two eggs with patterns like that at my site in montana youre saying this is a piece of dinosaur eggshell absolutely grant said harding shook his head these dinosaurs cant breed evidently they can gennaro said that must be a bird egg harding said we have literally dozens of species on the island grant shook his head look at the curvature the shell is almost flat thats from a very big egg and notice the thickness of the shell unless you have ostriches on this island its a dinosaur egg but they cant possibly breed harding insisted all the animals are female all i know grant said is that this is a dinosaur egg malcolm said can you tell the species yes grant said its a velociraptor egg control absolutely absurd hammond said in the control room listening to the report over the radio it must be a bird egg thats all it can be the radio crackled he heard malcolms voice lets do a little test shall we ask mr arnold to run one of his computer tallies now yes right now i understand you can transmit it to the screen in dr hardings car do that too will you no problem arnold said a moment later the screen in the control room printed out total animals species expected found ver tyrannosaurs maiasaurs stegosaurs triceratops procompsognathids othnielia velociraptors apatosaurs hadrosaurs dilophosaurs pterosaurs hypsilophodontids euoplocepbalids styracosaurs callovosaurs total i hope youre satisfied hammond said are you receiving it down there on your screen we see it malcolm said everything accounted for as always he couldnt keep the satisfaction out of his voice now then malcolm said can you have the computer search for a different number of animals like what arnold said try two hundred thirtynine just a minute arnold said frowning a moment later the screen printed total animals species expected found ver tyrannosaurs maiasaurs stegosaurs triceratops procompsognathids othnielia velociraptors apatosaurs hadrosaurs dilophosaurs pterosaurs hypsilophodontids euoplocepbalids styracosaurs callovosaurs total hammond sat forward what the hell is that we picked up another compy from where i dont know the radio crackled now then can you ask the computer to search for let us say three hundred animals what is he talking about hammond said his voice rising three hundred animals whats he talking about just a minute arnold said tbatll take a few minutes he punched buttons on the screen the first line of the totals appeared total animals i dont understand what hes driving at hammond said im afraid i do arnold said he watched the screen the numbers on the first line were clicking total animals two hundred fortyfour hammond said whats going on the computer is counting the animals in the park wu said all the animals i thought thats what it always did he spun nedry have you screwed up again no nedry said looking up from his console computer allows the operator to enter an expected number of animals in order to make the counting process faster but its a convenience not a flaw hes right arnold said we just always used the base count of two hundred thirtyeight because we assumed there couldnt be more total animals wait a minute hammond said these animals cant breed the computer must be counting field mice or something i think so too arnold said its almost certainly an error in the visual tracking but well know soon enough hammond turned to wu they cant breed can they no wu said total animals where are they coming from arnold said damned if i know wu said they watched the numbers climb total animals over the radio they heard gennaro say holy shit how much more and they heard the girl say im getting hungry when are we going home pretty soon lex on the screen there was a flashing error message error search params animals not found an error hammond said nodding i thought so i had the feeling all along there must be an error but a moment later the screen printed total animals species expected found ver tyrannosaurs maiasaurs stegosaurs triceratops procompsognathids othnielia velociraptors apatosaurs hadrosaurs dilophosaurs pterosaurs hypsilophodontids euoplocepbalids styracosaurs callovosaurs total the radio crackled now you see the flaw in your procedures malcolm said you only tracked the expected number of dinosaurs you were worried about losing animals and your procedures were designed to advise you instantly if you had less than the expected number but that wasnt the problem the problem was you had more than the expected number christ arnold said there cant be more wu said we know how many weve released there cant be more than that afraid so henry malcolm said theyre breeding no even if you dont accept grants eggshell you can prove it with your own data take a look at the compy height graph arnold will put it up for you picture notice anything about it malcolm said its a poisson distribution wu said normal curve but didnt you say you introduced the compys in three batches at sixmonth intervals yes then you should get a graph with peaks for each of the three separate batches that were introduced malcolm said tapping the keyboard like this picture but you didnt get this graph malcolm said the graph you actually got is a graph of a breeding population your compys are breeding wu shook his head i dont see how theyre breeding and so are the othnielia the maiasaurs the hypsysand the velociraptors christ muldoon said there are raptors free in the park well its not that bad hammond said looking at the screen we have increases in just three categorieswell five categories very small increases in two of them what are you talking about wu said loudly dont you know what this means of course i know what this means henry hammond said it means you screwed up absolutely not youve got breeding dinosaurs out there henry but theyre all female wu said its impossible there must be a mistake and look at the numbers a small increase in the big animals the maiasaurs and the hypsys and big increases in the number of small animals it just doesnt make sense it must be a mistake the radio clicked actually not grant said i think these numbers confirm that breeding is taking place in seven different sites around the island breeding sites the sky was growing darker thunder rumbled in the distance grant and the others leaned in the doors of the jeep staring at the screen on the dashboard breeding sites wu said over the radio nests grant said assuming the average clutch is eight to twelve hatching eggs these data would indicate the compys have two nests the raptors have two nests the othys have one nest and the hypsys and the maias have one nest each where are these nests well have to find them grant said dinosaurs build their nests in secluded places but why are there so few big animals wu said if there is a maia nest of eight to twelve eggs there should be eight to twelve new maias not just one thats right grant said except that the raptors and the compys that are loose in the park are probably eating the eggs of the bigger animals and perhaps eating the newly hatched young as well but weve never seen that arnold said over the radio raptors are nocturnal he said is anyone watching the park at night there was a long silence i didnt think so grant said it still doesnt make sense wu said you cant support fifty additional animals on a couple of nests of eggs no grant said i assume they are eating something else as well perhaps small rodents mice and rats there was another silence let me guess grant said when you first came to the island you had a problem with rats but as time passed the problem faded away yes thats true and you never thought to investigate why well we just assumed arnold said look wu said the fact remains all the animals are female they cant breed grant had been thinking about that he had recently learned of an intriguing west german study that he suspected held the answer when you made your dinosaur dna grant said you were working with fragmentary pieces is that right yes wu said in order to make a complete strand were you ever required to include dna fragments from other species occasionally yes wu said its the only way to accomplish the job sometimes we included avian dna from a variety of birds and sometimes reptilian dna any amphibian dna specifically frog dna possibly id have to check check grant said i think youll find that holds the answer malcolm said frog dna why frog dna gennaro said impatiently listen this is all very intriguing but were forgetting the main question have any animals gotten off the island grant said we cant tell from these data then how are we going to find out theres only one way i know grant said well have to find the individual dinosaur nests inspect them and count the remaining egg fragments from that we may be able to determine how many animals were originally hatched and we can begin to assess whether any are missing malcolm said even so you wont know if the missing animals are killed or dead from natural causes or whether they have left the island no grant said but its a start and i think we can get more information from an intensive look at the population graphs how are we going to find these nests actually grant said i think the computer will be able to help us with that can we go back now lex said im hungry yes lets go grant said smiling at her youve been very patient youll be able to eat in about twenty minutes ed regis said starting toward the two land cruisers ill stay for a while ellie said and get photos of the stego with dr hardings camera those vesicles in the mouth will have cleared up by tomorrow i want to get back grant said ill go with the kids i will too malcolm said i think ill stay gennaro said and go back with harding in his jeep with dr sattler fine lets go they started walking malcolm said why exactly is our lawyer staying grant shrugged i think it might have something to do with dr sattler really the shorts you think its happened before grant said when they came to the land cruisers tim said i want to ride in the front one this time with dr grant malcolm said unfortunately dr grant and i need to talk ill just sit and listen i wont say anything tim said its a private conversation malcolm said tell you what tim ed regis said let them sit in the rear car by themselves well sit in the front car and you can use the nightvision goggles have you ever used nightvision goggles tim theyre goggles with very sensitive ccds that allow you to see in the dark neat he said and moved toward the first car hey lex said i want to use it too no tim said no fair no fair you get to do everything timmy ed regis watched them go and said to grant i can see what the ride back is going to be like grant and malcolm climbed into the second car a few raindrops spattered the windshield lets get going ed regis said im about ready for dinner and i could do with a nice banana daiquiri what do you say folks daiquiri sound good he pounded the metal panel of the car see you back at camp he said and he started running toward the first car and climbed aboard a red light on the dashboard blinked with a soft electric whirr the land cruisers started off driving back in the fading light malcolm seemed oddly subdued grant said you must feel vindicated about your theory as a matter of fact im feeling a bit of dread i suspect we are at a very dangerous point why intuition do mathematicians believe in intuition absolutely very important intuition actually i was thinking of fractals malcolm said you know about fractals grant shook his head not really no fractals are a kind of geometry associated with a man named mandelbrot unlike ordinary euclidean geometry that everybody learns in schoolsquares and cubes and spheresfractal geometry appears to describe real objects in the natural world mountains and clouds are fractal shapes so fractals are probably related to reality somehow well mandelbrot found a remarkable thing with his geometric tools he found that things looked almost identical at different scales at different scales grant said for example malcolm said a big mountain seen from far away has a certain rugged mountain shape if you get closer and examine a small peak of the big mountain it will have the same mountain shape in fact you can go all the way down the scale to a tiny speck of rock seen under a microscopeit will have the same basic fractal shape as the big mountain i dont really see why this is worrying you grant said he yawned he smelled the sulfur fumes of the volcanic steam they were coming now to the section of road that ran near the coastline overlooking the beach and the ocean its a way of looking at things malcolm said mandelbrot found a sameness from the smallest to the largest and this sameness of scale also occurs for events events consider cotton prices malcolm said there are good records of cotton prices going back more than a hundred years when you study fluctuations in cotton prices you find that the graph of price fluctuations in the course of a day looks basically like the graph for a week which looks basically like the graph for a year or for ten years and thats how things are a day is like a whole life you start out doing one thing but end up doing something else plan to run an errand but never get there and at the end of your life your whole existence has that same haphazard quality too your whole life has the same shape as a single day i guess its one way to look at things grant said no malcolm said its the only way to look at things at least the only way that is true to reality you see the fractal idea of sameness carries within it an aspect of recursion a kind of doubling back on itself which means that events are unpredictable that they can change suddenly and without warning okay but we have soothed ourselves into imagining sudden change as something that happens outside the normal order of things an accident like a car crash or beyond our control like a fatal illness we do not conceive of sudden radical irrational change as built into the very fabric of existence yet it is and chaos theory teaches us malcolm said that straight linearity which we have come to take for granted in everything from physics to fiction simply does not exist linearity is an artificial way of viewing the world real life isnt a series of interconnected events occurring one after another like beads strung on a necklace life is actually a series of encounters in which one event may change those that follow in a wholly unpredictable even devastating way malcolm sat back in his seat looking toward the other land cruiser a few yards ahead thats a deep truth about the structure of our universe but for some reason we insist on behaving as if it were not true at that moment the cars jolted to a stop whats happened grant said up ahead they saw the kids in the car pointing toward the ocean offshore beneath lowering clouds grant saw the dark outline of the supply boat making its way back toward puntarenas why have we stopped malcolm said grant turned on the radio and heard the girl saying excitedly look there timmy you see it its there malcolm squinted at the boat they talking about the boat apparently ed regis climbed out of the front car and came running back to their window im sorry he said but the kids are all worked up do you have binoculars here for what the little girl says she sees something on the boat some kind of animal regis said grant grabbed the binoculars and rested his elbows on the window ledge of the land cruiser he scanned the long shape of the supply ship it was so dark it was almost a silhouette as he watched the ships running lights came on brilliant in the dark purple twilight do you see anything regis said no grant said theyre low down lex said over the radio look low down grant tilted the binoculars down scanning the bull just above the waterline the supply ship was broadbeamed with a splash flange that ran the length of the ship but it was quite dark now and he could hardly make out details no nothing i can see them lex said impatiently near the back look near the back how can she see anything in this light malcolm said kids can see grant said theyve got visual acuity we forgot we ever had he swung the binoculars toward the stern moving them slowly and suddenly he saw the animals they were playing darting among the silhouetted stern structures he could see them only briefly but even in the fading light he could tell that they were upright animals about two feet tall standing with stiff balancing tails you see them now lex said i see them he said what are they theyre raptors grant said at least two maybe more juveniles jesus ed regis said that boats going to the mainland malcolm shrugged dont get excited just call the control room and tell them to recall the boat ed regis reached in and grabbed the radio from the dashboard they heard hissing static and clicks as he rapidly changed channels theres something wrong with this one he said its not working he ran off to the first land cruiser they saw him duck into it then he looked back at them theres something wrong with both the radios he said i cant raise the control room then lets get going grant said in the control room muldoon stood before the big windows that overlooked the park at seven oclock the quartz floodlights came on all over the island turning the landscape into a glowing jewel stretching away to the south this was his favorite moment of the day he heard the crackle of static from the radios the land cruisers have started again arnold said theyre on their way home but why did they stop hammond said and why cant we talk to them i dont know arnold said maybe they turned off the radios in the cars probably the storm muldoon said interference from the storm theyll be here in twenty minutes hammond said you better call down and make sure the dining room is ready for them those kids are going to be hungry arnold picked up the phone and heard a steady monotonous hiss whats this whats going on jesus hang that up nedry said youll screw up the data stream youve taken all the phone lines even the internal ones ive taken all the lines that communicate outside nedry said but your internal lines should still work arnold punched console buttons one after another he heard nothing but hissing on all the lines looks like youve got em all sorry about that nedry said ill clear a couple for you at the end of the next transmission in about fifteen minutes he yawned looks like a long weekend for me i guess ill go get that coke now he picked up his shoulder bag and headed for the door dont touch my console okay the door closed what a slob hammond said yeah arnold said but i guess he knows what hes doing along the side of the road clouds of volcanic steam misted rainbows in the bright quartz lights grant said into the radio how long does it take the ship to reach the mainland eighteen hours ed regis said more or less its pretty reliable he glanced at his watch it should arrive around eleven tomorrow morning grant frowned you still cant talk to the control room not so far how about harding can you reach him no ive tried he may have his radio turned off malcolm was shaking his head so were the only ones who know about the animals on the ship im trying to raise somebody ed regis said i mean christ we dont want those animals on the mainland how long until we get back to the base from here another sixteen seventeen minutes ed regis said at night the whole road was illuminated by big floodlights it felt to grant as if they were driving through a bright green tunnel of leaves large raindrops spattered the windshield grant felt the land cruiser slow then stop now what lex said i dont want to stop why did we stop and then suddenly all the floodlights went out the road was plunged into darkness lex said hey probably just a power outage or something ed regis said im sure the lightsll be on in a minute what the hell arnold said staring at his monitors what happened muldoon said you lose power yeah but only power on the perimeter everything in this buildings working fine but outside in the park the power is gone lights tv cameras everything his remote video monitors had gone black what about the two land cruisers stopped somewhere around the tyrannosaur paddock well muldoon said call maintenance and lets get the power back on arnold picked up one of his phones and heard hissing nedrys computers talking to each other no phones that damn nedry nedry where the hell is he dennis nedry pushed open the door marked fertilization with the perimeter power out all the securitycard locks were disarmed every door in the building opened with a touch the problems with the security system were high on jurassic parks bug list nedry wondered if anybody ever imagined that it wasnt a bugtbat nedry had programmed it that way he had built in a classic trap door few programmers of large computer systems could resist the temptation to leave themselves a secret entrance partly it was common sense if inept users locked up the systemand then called you for helpyou always had a way to get in and repair the mess and partly it was a kind of signature kilroy was here and partly it was insurance for the future nedry was annoyed with the jurassic park project late in the schedule ingen had demanded extensive modifications to the system but hadnt been willing to pay for them arguing they should be included under the original contract lawsuits were threatened letters were written to nedrys other clients implying that nedry was unreliable it was blackmail and in the end nedry had been forced to eat his overages on jurassic park and to make the changes that hammond wanted but later when he was approached by lewis dodgson at biosyn nedry was ready to listen and able to say that he could indeed get past jurassic park security he could get into any room any system anywhere in the park because he had programmed it that way just in case he entered the fertilization room the lab was deserted as he had anticipated all the staff was at dinner nedry unzipped his shoulder bag and removed the can of gillette shaving cream he unscrewed the base and saw the interior was divided into a series of cylindrical slots he pulled on a pair of heavy insulated gloves and opened the walkin freezer marked contents viable biological maintain c minimum the freezer was the size of a small closet with shelves from floor to ceiling most of the shelves contained reagents and liquids in plastic sacs to one side he saw a smaller nitrogen cold box with a heavy ceramic door he opened it and a rack of small tubes slid out in a cloud of white liquidnitrogen smoke the embryos were arranged by species stegosaurus apatosaurus hadrosaurus tyrannosaurus each embryo in a thin glass container wrapped in silver foil stoppered with polylene nedry quickly took two of each slipping them into the shaving cream can then he screwed the base of the can shut and twisted the top there was a hiss of releasing gas inside and the can frosted in his hands dodgson had said there was enough coolant to last thirtysix hours more than enough time to get back to san jose nedry left the freezer returned to the main lab he dropped the can back in his bag zipped it shut he went back into the hallway the theft had taken less than two minutes he could imagine the consternation upstairs in the control room as they began to realize what had happened all their security codes were scrambled and all their phone lines were jammed without his help it would take hours to untangle the messbut in just a few minutes nedry would he back in the control room setting things right and no one would ever suspect what he had done grinning dennis nedry walked down to the ground floor nodded to the guard and continued downstairs to the basement passing the neat lines of electric land cruisers he went to the gasolinepowered jeep parked against the wall he climbed into it noticing some odd gray tubing on the passenger seat it looked almost like a rocket launcher he thought as he turned the ignition key and started the jeep nedry glanced at his watch from here into the park and three minutes straight to the east dock three minutes from there back to the control room piece of cake damn it arnold said punching buttons on the console its all screwed up muldoon was standing at the windows looking out at the park the lights had gone out all over the island except in the immediate area around the main buildings he saw a few staff personnel hurrying to get out of the rain but no one seemed to realize anything was wrong muldoon looked over at the visitor lodge where the lights burned brightly uhoh arnold said we have real trouble whats that muldoon said he turned away from the window and so he didnt see the jeep drive out of the underground garage and head east along the maintenance road into the park that idiot nedry turned off the security systems arnold said the whole buildings opened up none of the doors are locked any more ill notify the guards muldoon said thats the least of it arnold said when you turn off the security you turn off all the peripheral fences as well the fences muldoon said the electrical fences arnold said theyre off all over the island you mean thats right arnold said the animals can get out now arnold lit a cigarette probably nothing will happen but you never know muldoon started toward the door i better drive out and bring in the people in those two land cruisers he said just in case muldoon quickly went downstairs to the garage he wasnt really worried about the fences going down most of the dinosaurs had been in their paddocks for nine months or more and they had brushed up against the fences more than once with notable results muldoon knew how quickly animals learned to avoid shock stimuli you could train a laboratory pigeon with just two or three stimulation events so it was unlikely the dinosaurs would now approach the fences muldoon was more concerned about what the people in the cars would do he didnt want them getting out of the land cruisers because once the power came back on the cars would start moving again whether the people were inside them or not they might be left behind of course in the rain it was unlikely they would leave the cars but still you never knew he reached the garage and hurried toward the jeep it was lucky he thought that he had had the foresight to put the launcher in it he could start right out and he out there in it was gone what the hell muldoon stared at the empty parking space astonished the jeep was gone what the hell was happening fourth iteration inevitably underlying instabilities begin to appear ian malcolm the main road rain drummed loudly on the roof of the land cruiser tim felt the nightvision goggles pressing heavily on his forehead he reached for the knob near his ear and adjusted the intensity there was a brief phosphorescent flare and then in shades of electronic green and black he could see the land cruiser behind with dr grant and dr malcolm inside neat dr grant was staring out the front windshield toward him tim saw him pick up the radio from the dash there was a burst of static and then he heard dr grants voice can you see us back here tim picked up the radio from ed regis i see you everything all right were fine dr grant stay in the car we will dont worry he clicked the radio off ed regis snorted its pouring down rain of course well stay in the car he muttered tim turned to look at the foliage at the side of the road through the goggles the foliage was a bright electronic green and beyond he could see sections of the green grid pattern of the fence the land cruisers were stopped on the downslope of a hill which must mean they were someplace near the tyrannosaur area it would be amazing to see a tyrannosaur with these nightvision goggles a real thrill maybe the tyrannosaur would come to the fence and look over at them tim wondered if its eyes would glow in the dark when he saw them that would be neat but he didnt see anything and eventually he stopped looking everyone in the cars fell silent the rain thrummed on the roof of the car sheets of water streamed down over the sides of the windows it was hard for tim to see out even with the goggles how long have we been sitting here malcolm asked i dont know four or five minutes i wonder what the problem is maybe a short circuit from the rain but it happened before the rain really started there was another silence in a tense voice lex said but theres no lightning right she had always been afraid of lightning and she now sat nervously squeezing her leather mitt in her hands dr grant said what was that we didnt quite read that just my sister talking oh tim again scanned the foliage but saw nothing certainly nothing as big as a tyrannosaur he began to wonder if the tyrannosaurs came out at night were they nocturnal animals tim wasnt sure if he had ever read that he had the feeling that tyrannosaurs were allweather day or night animals the time of day didnt matter to a tyrannosaur the rain continued to pour hell of a rain ed regis said its really coming down lex said im hungry i know that lex regis said but were stuck here sweetie the cars run on electricity in buried cables in the road stuck for how long until they fix the electricity listening to the sound of the rain tim felt himself growing sleepy he yawned and turned to look at the palm trees on the left side of the road and was startled by a sudden tbump as the ground shook he swung back just in time to catch a glimpse of a dark shape as it swiftly crossed the road between the two cars jesus what was it it was huge it was big as the car tim are you there he picked up the radio yes im here did you see it tim no tim said i missed it what the hell was it malcolm said are you wearing the nightvision goggles tim yes ill watch tim said was it the tyrannosaur ed regis asked i dont think so it was in the road but you didnt see it ed regis said no tim felt had that he had missed seeing the animal whatever it was there was a sudden white crack of lightning and his night goggles flared bright green he blinked his eyes and started counting one one thousand two one thousand the thunder crashed deafeningly loud and very close lex began to cry oh no take it easy honey ed regis said its just lightning tim scanned the side of the road the rain was coming down bard now shaking the leaves with hammering drops it made everything move everything seemed alive he scanned the leaves he stopped there was something beyond the leaves tim looked up higher behind the foliage beyond the fence he saw a thick body with a pebbled grainy surface like the bark of a tree but it wasnt a tree he continued to look higher sweeping the goggles upward he saw the huge head of the tyrannosaurus just standing there looking over the fence at the two land cruisers the lightning flashed again and the big animal rolled its head and bellowed in the glaring light then darkness and silence again and the pounding rain tim yes dr grant you see what it is yes dr grant tim had the sense that dr grant was trying to talk in a way that wouldnt upset his sister whats going on right now nothing tim said watching the tyrannosaur through his night goggles just standing on the other side of the fence i cant see much from here tim i can see fine dr grant its just standing there okay lex continued to cry snuffling there was another pause tim watched the tyrannosaur the head was huge the animal looked from one vehicle to another then back again it seemed to stare right at tim in the goggles the eyes glowed bright green tim felt a chill but then as he looked down the animals body moving down from the massive head and jaws he saw the smaller muscular forelimb it waved in the air and then it gripped the fence jesus christ ed regis said staring out the window the greatest preditor the world has ever known the most fearsome attack in human history somewhere in the back of his publicists brain ed regis was still writing copy but he could feel his knees begin to shake uncontrollably his trousers flapping like flags jesus he was frightened he didnt want to be here alone among all the people in the two cars ed regis knew what a dinosaur attack was like he knew what happened to people he had seen the mangled bodies that resulted from a raptor attack he could picture it in his mind and this was a rex much much bigger the greatest meateater that ever walked the earth jesus when the tyrannosaur roared it was terrifying a scream from some other world ed regis felt the spreading warmth in his trousers hed peed in his pants he was simultaneously embarrassed and terrified but he knew he had to do something he couldnt just stay here he had to do something something his hands were shaking trembling against the dash jesus christ he said again bad language lex said wagging her finger at him tim heard the sound of a door opening and he swung his head away from the tyrannosaurthe nightvision goggles streaked laterallyin time to see ed regis stepping out through the open door ducking his head in the rain hey lex said where are you going ed regis just turned and ran in the opposite direction from the tyrannosaur disappearing into the woods the door to the land cruiser hung open the paneling was getting wet he left lex said where did he go he left us alone shut the door tim said but she had started to scream he left us he left us tim whats going on it was dr grant on the radio tim tim leaned forward and tried to shut the door from the back seat he couldnt reach the handle he looked back at the tyrannosaur as lightning flashed again momentarily silhouetting the huge black shape against the whiteflaring sky tim whats happening he left us he left us tim blinked to recover his vision when he looked again the tyrannosaur was standing there exactly as before motionless and huge rain dripped from its jaws the forelimb gripped the fence and then tim realized the tyrannosaur was holding on to the fence the fence wasnt electrified any more lex close the door the radio crackled tim im here dr grant whats going on regis ran away tim said he what he ran away i think he saw that the fence isnt electrified tim said the fence isnt electrified malcolm said over the radio did he say the fence isnt electrified lex tim said close the door but lex was screaming he left us he left us in a steady monotonous wail and there was nothing for tim to do but climb out of the back door into the slashing rain and shut the door for her thunder rumbled and the lightning flashed again tim looked up and saw the tyrannosaur crashing down the cyclone fence with a giant hind limb timmy he jumped back in and slammed the door the sound lost in the tbunderclap the radio tim are you there he grabbed the radio im here he turned to lex lock the doors get in the middle of the car and shut up outside the tyrannosaur rolled its head and took an awkward step forward the claws of its feet had caught in the grid of the flattened fence lex saw the animal finally and became silent still she watched with wide eyes radio crackle tim yes dr grant stay in the car stay down be quiet dont move and dont make noise okay you should be all right i dont think it can open the car okay just stay quiet so you dont arouse its attention any more than necessary okay tim clicked the radio off you hear that lex his sister nodded silently she never took her eyes off the dinosaur the tyrannosaur roared in the glare of lightning they saw it pull free of the fence and take a bounding step forward now it was standing between the two cars tim couldnt see dr grants car any more because the huge body blocked his view the rain ran in rivulets down the pebbled skin of the muscular hind legs he couldnt see the animals head which was high above the roofline the tyrannosaur moved around the side of their car it went to the very spot where tim had gotten out of the car where ed regis had gotten out of the car the animal paused there the big head ducked down toward the mud tim looked back at dr grant and dr malcolm in the rear car their faces were tense as they stared forward through the windshield the huge head raised back up jaws open and then stopped by the side windows in the glare of lightning they saw the beady expressionless reptile eye moving in the socket it was looking in the car his sisters breath came in ragged frightened gasps he reached out and squeezed her arm hoping she would stay quiet the dinosaur continued to stare for a long time through the side window perhaps the dinosaur couldnt really see them he thought finally the head lifted up out of view again timmy lex whispered its okay tim whispered i dont think it saw us he was looking back toward dr grant when a jolting impact rocked the land cruiser and shattered the windshield in a spiderweb as the tyrannosaurs head crashed against the hood of the land cruiser tim was knocked flat on the seat the nightvision goggles slid off his forehead he got back up quickly blinking in the darkness his mouth warm with blood lex he couldnt see his sister anywhere the tyrannosaur stood near the front of the land cruiser its chest moving as it breathed the forelimbs making clawing movements in the air lex tim whispered then he heard her groan she was lying somewhere on the floor under the front seat then the huge head came down entirely blocking the shattered windshield the tyrannosaur banged again on the front hood of the land cruiser tim grabbed the seat as the car rocked on its wheels the tyrannosaur banged down twice more denting the metal then it moved around the side of the car the big raised tail blocked his view out of all the side windows at the back the animal snorted a deep rumbling growl that blended with the thunder it sank its jaws into the spare tire mounted on the back of the land cruiser and in a single head shake tore it away the rear of the car lifted into the air for a moment then it thumped down with a muddy splash tim dr grant said tim are you there tim grabbed the radio were okay he said there was a shrill metallic scrape as claws raked the roof of the car tims heart was pounding in his chest he couldnt see anything out of the windows on the right side except pebbled leathery flesh the tyrannosaur was leaning against the car which rocked back and forth with each breath the springs and metal creaking loudly lex groaned again tim put down the radio and started to crawl over into the front seat the tyrannosaur roared and the metal roof dented downward tim felt a sharp pain in his head and tumbled to the floor onto the transmission bump he found himself lying alongside lex and he was shocked to see that the whole side of her head was covered in blood she looked unconscious there was another jolting impact and pieces of glass fell all around him tim felt rain he looked up and saw that the front windshield had broken out there was just a jagged rim of glass and beyond the big head of the dinosaur looking down at him tim felt a sudden chill and then the head rushed forward toward him the jaws open there was the squeal of metal against teeth and he felt the hot stinking breath of the animal and a thick tongue stuck into the car through the windshield opening the tongue slapped wetly around inside the carhe felt the hot lather of dinosaur salivaand the tyrannosaur roareda deafening sound inside the car the head pulled away abruptly tim scrambled up avoiding the dent in the roof there was still room to sit on the front seat by the passenger door the tyrannosaur stood in the rain near the front fender it seemed confused by what had happened to it blood dripped freely from its jaws the tyrannosaur looked at tim cocking its head to stare with one big eye the head moved close to the car sideways and peered in blood spattered on the dented bood of the land cruiser mixing with the rain it cant get to me tim thought its too big then the head pulled away and in the flare of lightning he saw the hind leg lift up and the world tilted crazily as the land cruiser slammed over its side the windows splatting in the mud he saw lex fall helplessly against the side window and he fell down beside her banging his head tim felt dizzy then the tyrannosaurs jaws clamped onto the window frame and the whole land cruiser was lifted up into the air and shaken timmy lex shrieked so near to his ear that it hurt she was suddenly awake and he grabbed her as the tyrannosaur crashed the car down again tim felt a stabbing pain in his side and his sister fell on top of him the car went up again tilting crazily lex shouted timmy and he saw the door give way beneath her and she fell out of the car into the mud but tim couldnt answer because in the next instant everything swung crazilyhe saw the trunks of the palm trees sliding downward past himmoving sideways through the airhe glimpsed the ground very far belowthe hot roar of the tyrannosaurthe blazing eyethe tops of the palm trees and then with a metallic scraping shriek the car fell from the tyrannosaurs jaws a sickening fall and tims stomach heaved in the moment before the world became totally black and silent in the other car malcolm gasped jesus what happened to the car grant blinked his eyes as the lightning faded the other car was gone grant couldnt believe it he peered forward trying to see through the rainstreaked windshield the dinosaurs body was so large it was probably just blocking no in another flash of lightning he saw clearly the car was gone what happened malcolm said i dont know faintly over the rain grant heard the sound of the little girl screaming the dinosaur was standing in darkness on the road up ahead but they could see well enough to know that it was bending over now sniffing the ground or eating something on the ground can you see malcolm said squinting not much no grant said the rain pounded on the roof of the car he listened for the little girl but he didnt hear her any more the two men sat in the car listening was it the girl malcolm said finally it sounded like the girl it did yes was it i dont know grant said he felt a seeping fatigue overtake him blurred through the rainy windshield the dinosaur was coming toward their car slow ominous strides coming right toward them malcolm said you know at times like this one feels well perhaps extinct animals should be left extinct dont you have that feeling now yes grant said he was feeling his heart pounding umm do you ah have any suggestions about what we do now i cant think of a thing grant said malcolm twisted the handle kicked open the door and ran but even as he did grant could see he was too late the tyrannosaur too close there was another crack of lightning and in that instant of glaring white light grant watched in horror as the tyrannosaur roared and leapt forward grant was not clear about exactly what happened next malcolm was running his feet splashing in the mud the tyrannosaur bounded alongside him and ducked its massive head and malcolm was tossed into the air like a small doll by then grant was out of the car too feeling the cold rain slashing his face and body the tyrannosaur had turned its back to him the huge tail swinging through the air grant was tensing to run for the woods when suddenly the tyrannosaur spun back to face him and roared grant froze he was standing beside the passenger door of the land cruiser drenched in rain he was completely exposed the tyrannosaur no more than eight feet away the big animal roared again at so close a range the sound was terrifyingly loud grant felt himself shaking with cold and fright he pressed his trembling hands against the metal of the door panel to steady them the tyrannosaur roared once more but it did not attack it cocked its head and looked with first one eye then the other at the land cruiser and it did nothing it just stood there what was going on the powerful jaws opened and closed the tyrannosaur bellowed angrily and then the big hind leg came up and crashed down on the roof of the car the claws slid off with a metal screech barely missing grant as he stood there still unmoving the foot splashed in the mud the head ducked down in a slow arc and the animal inspected the car snorting it peered into the front windshield then moving toward the rear it banged the passenger door shut and moved right toward grant as he stood there grant was dizzy with fear his heart pounding inside his chest with the animal so close he could smell the rotten flesh in the mouth the sweetish bloodsmell the sickening stench of the carnivore he tensed his body awaiting the inevitable the big head slid past him toward the rear of the car grant blinked what had happened was it possible the tyrannosaur hadnt seen him it seemed as if it hadnt but how could that be grant looked back to see the animal sniffing the rearmounted tire it nudged the tire with its snout and then the head swung back again it approached grant this time the animal stopped the black flaying nostrils just inches away grant felt the animals startling hot breath on his face but the tyrannosaur wasnt sniffing like a dog it was just breathing and if anything it seemed puzzled no the tyrannosaur couldnt see him not if he stood motionless and in a detached academic corner of his mind he found an explanation for that a reason why the laws opened before him the massive head raised up grant squeezed his fists together and bit his lip trying desperately to remain motionless to make no sound the tyrannosaur bellowed in the night air but by now grant was beginning to understand the animal couldnt see him but it suspected he was there somewhere and was trying with its bellowing to frighten grant into some revealing movement so long as he stood his ground grant realized he was invisible in a final gesture of frustration the big hind leg lifted up and kicked the land cruiser over and grant felt searing pain and the surprising sensation of his own body flying through the air it seemed to be happening very slowly and he had plenty of time to feel the world turn colder and watch the ground rush up to strike him in the face return oh damn harding said will you look at that they were sitting in hardings gasolinepowered jeep staring forward past the flick flick of the windshield wipers in the yellow flare of the headlamps a big fallen tree blocked the road must have been the lightning gennaro said hell of a tree we cant get past it harding said i better tell arnold in control he picked up the radio and twisted the channel dial hello john are you there john there was nothing but steady hissing static i dont understand he said the radio lines seem to be down it must be the storm gennaro said i suppose harding said try the land cruisers ellie said harding opened the other channels but there was no answer nothing he said theyre probably back to camp by now and outside the range of our little set in any case i dont think we should stay here itll be hours before maintenance gets a crew out here to move that tree he turned the radio off and put the jeep into reverse wbatre you going to do ellie said go back to the turnout and get onto the maintenance road fortunately theres a second road system harding explained we have one road for visitors and a second road for animal handlers and feed trucks and so on well drive back on that maintenance road its a little longer and not so scenic but you may find it interesting if the rain lets up well get a glimpse of some of the animals at night we should be back in thirty forty minutes harding said if i dont get lost he turned the jeep around in the night and headed south again lightning flashed and every monitor in the control room went black arnold sat forward his body rigid and tense jesus not now not now that was all he neededto have everything go out now in the storm all the main power circuits were surgeprotected of course but arnold wasnt sure about the modems nedry was using for his data transmission most people didnt know it was possible to blow an entire system through a modemthe lightning pulse climbed back into the computer through the telephone line andbangno more motherboard no more ram no more file server no more computer the screens flickered and then one by one they came back on arnold sighed and collapsed back in his chair he wondered again where nedry had gone five minutes ago hed sent guards to search the building for him the fat bastard was probably in the bathroom reading a comic book but the guards hadnt come back and they hadnt called in five minutes if nedry was in the building they should have found him by now somebody took the damned jeep muldoon said as he came back in the room have you talked to the land cruisers yet cant raise them on the radio arnold said i have to use this because the main board is down its weak but it ought to work ive tried on all six channels i know they have radios in the cars but theyre not answering thats not good muldoon said if you want to go out there take one of the maintenance vehicles i would muldoon said but theyre all in the east garage more than a mile from here wheres harding i assume hes on his way back then hell pick up the people in the land cruisers on his way i assume so anybody tell hammond the kids arent back yet hell no arnold said i dont want that son of a bitch running around here screaming at me everytbings all right for the moment the land cruisers are just stuck in the rain they can sit a while until harding brings them back or until we find nedry and make that little bastard turn the systems back on you cant get them back on muldoon said arnold shook his head ive been trying but nedrys done something to the system i cant figure out what but if i have to go into the code itself thatll take hours we need nedry weve got to find the son of a bitch right away nedry the sign said electrified fence volts do not touch but nedry opened it with his bare band and unlocked the gate swinging it wide he went back to the jeep drove through the gate and then walked back to close it behind him now he was inside the park itself no more than a mile from the east dock he stepped on the accelerator and bunched forward over the steering wheel peering through the rainslashed windshield as he drove the jeep down the narrow road he was driving fasttoo fastbut he had to keep to his timetable he was surrounded on all sides by black jungle but soon he should be able to see the beach and the ocean off to his left this damned storm he thought it might screw up everything because if dodgsons boat wasnt waiting for him at the east dock when nedry got there the whole plan would be ruined nedry couldnt wait very long or he would be missed back at the control room the whole idea behind the plan was that he could drive to the east dock drop off the embryos and be back in a few minutes before anyone noticed it was a good plan a clever plan nedryd worked on it carefully refining every detail this plan was going to make him a million and a half dollars one point five meg that was ten years of income in a single taxfree shot and it was going to change his life nedryd been damned careful even to the point of making dodgson meet him in the san francisco airport at the last minute with an excuse about wanting to see the money actually nedry wanted to record his conversation with dodgson and mention him by name on the tape just so that dodgson wouldnt forget he owed the rest of the money nedry was including a copy of the tape with the embryos in short nedry had thought of everything except this damned storm something dashed across the road a white flash in his headlights it looked like a large rat it scurried into the underbrush dragging a fat tail possum amazing that a possum could survive here youd think the dinosaurs would get an animal like that where was the damned dock he was driving fast and hed already been gone five minutes he should have reached the east dock by now had he taken a wrong turn he didnt think so he hadnt seen any forks in the road at all then where was the dock it was a shock when he came around a corner and saw that the road terminated in a gray concrete barrier six feet tall and streaked dark with rain he slammed on the brakes and the jeep fishtailed losing traction in an endtoend spin and for a horrified moment he thought he was going to smash into the barrierhe knew he was going to smashand he spun the wheel frantically and the jeep slid to a stop the headlamps just a foot from the concrete wall he paused there listening to the rhythmic flick of the wipers he took a deep breath and exhaled slowly he looked back down the road hed obviously taken a wrong turn somewhere he could retrace his steps but that would take too long hed better try and find out where the hell he was he got out of the jeep feeling heavy raindrops spatter his head it was a real tropical storm raining so hard that it hurt he glanced at his watch pushing the button to illuminate the digital dial six minutes gone where the hell was he he walked around the concrete barrier and on the other side along with the rain he heard the sound of gurgling water could it be the ocean nedry hurried forward his eyes adjusting to the darkness as he went dense jungle on all sides raindrops slapping on the leaves the gurgling sound became louder drawing him forward and suddenly he came out of the foliage and felt his feet sink into soft earth and saw the dark currents of the river the river he was at the jungle river damn he thought at the river where the river ran for miles through the island he looked at his watch again seven minutes gone you have a problem dennis he said aloud as if in reply there was a soft hooting cry of an owl in the forest nedry hardly noticed he was worrying about his plan the plain fact was that time had run out there wasnt a choice any more he had to abandon his original plan all he could do was go back to the control room restore the computer and somehow try to contact dodgson to set up the drop at the east dock for the following night nedry would have to scramble to make that work but he thought he could pull it off the computer automatically logged all calls after nedry got through to dodgson hed have to go back into the computer and erase the record of the call but one thing was surehe couldnt stay out in the park any longer or his absence would be noticed nedry started back heading toward the glow of the cars headlights he was drenched and miserable he heard the soft booting cry once more and this time he paused that hadnt really sounded like an owl and it seemed to be close by in the jungle somewhere off to his right as he listened he heard a crashing sound in the underbrush then silence he waited and heard it again it sounded distinctly like something big moving slowly through the jungle toward him something big something near a big dinosaur get out of here nedry began to run he made a lot of noise as he ran but even so he could hear the animal crashing through the foliage and hooting it was coming closer stumbling over tree roots in the darkness clawing his way past dripping branches he saw the jeep ahead and the lights shining around the vertical wall of the barrier made him feel better in a moment hed be in the car and then hed get the hell out of here he scrambled around the barrier and then he froze the animal was already there but it wasnt close the dinosaur stood forty feet away at the edge of the illumination from the headlamps nedry hadnt taken the tour so he hadnt seen the different types of dinosaurs but this one was strangelooking the tenfoottall body was yellow with black spots and along the head ran a pair of red vshaped crests the dinosaur didnt move but again gave its soft hooting cry nedry waited to see if it would attack it didnt perhaps the headlights from the jeep frightened it forcing it to keep its distance like a fire the dinosaur stared at him and then snapped its head in a single swift motion nedry felt something smack wetly against his chest he looked down and saw a dripping glob of foam on his rainsoaked shirt he touched it curiously not comprehending it was spit the dinosaur had spit on him it was creepy he thought he looked back at the dinosaur and saw the head snap again and immediately felt another wet smack against his neck just above the shirt collar he wiped it away with his hand jesus it was disgusting but the skin of his neck was already starting to tingle and burn and his hand was tingling too it was almost like he had been touched with acid nedry opened the car door glancing back at the dinosaur to make sure it wasnt going to attack and felt a sudden excruciating pain in his eyes stabbing like spikes into the back of his skull and he squeezed his eyes shut and gasped with the intensity of it and threw up his hands to cover his eyes and felt the slippery foam trickling down both sides of his nose spit the dinosaur had spit in his eyes even as he realized it the pain overwhelmed him and he dropped to his knees disoriented wheezing he collapsed onto his side his cheek pressed to the wet ground his breath coming in thin whistles through the constant everscreaming pain that caused flashing spots of light to appear behind his tightly shut eyelids the earth shook beneath him and nedry knew the dinosaur was moving he could hear its soft hooting cry and despite the pain he forced his eyes open and still he saw nothing but flashing spots against black slowly the realization came to him he was blind the hooting was louder as nedry scrambled to his feet and staggered back against the side panel of the car as a wave of nausea and dizziness swept over him the dinosaur was close now he could feel it coming close he was dimly aware of its snorting breath but he couldnt see he couldnt see anything and his terror was extreme he stretched out his hands waving them wildly in the air to ward off the attack he knew was coming and then there was a new searing pain like a fiery knife in his belly and nedry stumbled reaching blindly down to touch the ragged edge of his shirt and then a thick slippery mass that was surprisingly warm and with horror he suddenly knew he was holding his own intestines in his hands the dinosaur had torn him open his guts had fallen out nedry fell to the ground and landed on something scaly and cold it was the animals foot and then there was new pain on both sides of his head the pain grew worse and as he was lifted to his feet he knew the dinosaur had his head in its jaws and the horror of that realization was followed by a final wish that it would all be ended soon bungalow more coffee hammond asked politely no thank you henry wu said leaning back in his chair i couldnt eat anything more they were sitting in the dining room of hammonds bungalow in a secluded corner of the park not far from the labs wu had to admit that the bungalow hammond had built for himself was elegant with sparse almost japanese lines and the dinner had been excellent considering the dining room wasnt fully staffed yet but there was something about hammond that wu found troubling the old man was different in some way subtly different all during dinner wu had tried to decide what it was in part a tendency to ramble to repeat himself to retell old stories in part it was an emotional lability flaring anger one moment maudlin sentimentality the next but all that could be understood as a natural concomitant of age john hammond was after all almost seventyseven but there was something else a stubborn evasiveness an insistence on having his way and in the end a complete refusal to deal with the situation that now faced the park wu had been stunned by the evidence he did not yet allow himself to believe the case was proved that the dinosaurs were breeding after grant had asked about amphibian dna wu had intended to go directly to his laboratory and check the computer records of the various dna assemblies because if the dinosaurs were in fact breeding then everything about jurassic park was called into questiontheir genetic development methods their genetic control methods everything even the lysine dependency might be suspect and if these animals could truly breed and could also survive in the wild henry wu wanted to check the data at once but hammond had stubbornly insisted wu accompany him at dinner now then henry you must save room for ice cream hammond said pushing back from the table maria makes the most wonderful ginger ice cream all right wu looked at the beautiful silent serving girl his eyes followed her out of the room and then he glanced up at the single video monitor mounted in the wall the monitor was dark your monitors out wu said is it hammond glanced over must be the storm he reached behind him for the telephone ill just check with john in control wu could hear the static crackle on the telephone line hammond shrugged and set the receiver back in its cradle lines must be down he said or maybe nedrys still doing data transmission he has quite a few bugs to fix this weekend nedrys a genius in his way but we had to press him quite hard toward the end to make sure he got things right perhaps i should go to the control room and check wu said no no hammond said theres no reason if there were any problem wed hear about it ah maria came back into the room with two plates of ice cream you must have just a little henry hammond said its made with fresh ginger from the eastern part of the island its an old mans vice ice cream but still dutifully wu dipped his spoon outside lightning flashed and there was the sharp crack of thunder that was close wu said i hope the storm isnt frightening the children i shouldnt think so hammond said he tasted the ice cream but i cant help but hold some fears about this park henry inwardly wu felt relieved perhaps the old man was going to face the facts after all what kind of fears you know jurassic parks really made for children the children of the world love dinosaurs and the children are going to delightjust delightin this place their little faces will shine with the joy of finally seeing these wonderful animals but i am afraid i may not live to see it henry i may not live to see the joy on their faces i think there are other problems too wu said frowning but none so pressing on my mind as this hammond said that i may not live to see their shining delighted faces this is our triumph this park we have done what we set out to do and you remember our original intent was to use the newly emerging technology of genetic engineering to make money a lot of money wu knew hammond was about to launch into one of his old speeches he held up his hand im familiar with this john if you were going to start a bioengineering company henry what would you do would you make products to help mankind to fight illness and disease dear me no thats a terrible idea a very poor use of new technology hammond shook his head sadly yet youll remember he said the original genetic engineering companies like genentech and cetus were all started to make pharmaceuticals new drugs for mankind noble noble purpose unfortunately drugs face all kinds of barriers fda testing alone takes five to eight yearsif youre lucky even worse there are forces at work in the marketplace suppose you make a miracle drug for cancer or heart diseaseas genentech did suppose you now want to charge a thousand dollars or two thousand dollars a dose you might imagine that is your privilege after all you invented the drug you paid to develop and test it you should be able to charge whatever you wish but do you really think that the government will let you do that no henry they will not sick people arent going to pay a thousand dollars a dose for needed medicationthey wont be grateful theyll be outraged blue cross isnt going to pay it theyll scream highway robbery so something will happen your patent application will be denied your permits will be delayed something will force you to see reasonand to sell your drug at a lower cost from a business standpoint that makes helping mankind a very risky business personally i would never help mankind wu had heard the argument before and he knew hammond was right some new bioengineered pharmaceuticals had indeed suffered inexplicable delays and patent problems now hammond said think how different it is when youre making entertainment nobody needs entertainment thats not a matter for government intervention if i charge five thousand dollars a day for my park who is going to stop me after all nobody needs to come here and far from being highway robbery a costly price tag actually increases the appeal of the park a visit becomes a status symbol and all americans love that so do the japanese and of course they have far more money hammond finished his ice cream and maria silently took the dish away shes not from here you know he said shes haitian her mother is french but in any case henry you will recall that the original purpose behind pointing my company in this direction in the first placewas to have freedom from government intervention anywhere in the world speaking of the rest of the world hammond smiled we have already leased a large tract in the azores for jurassic park europe and you know we long ago obtained an island near guam for jurassic park japan construction on the next two jurassic parks will begin early next year they will all be open within four years at that time direct revenues will exceed ten billion dollars a year and merchandising television and ancillary rights should double that i see no reason to bother with childrens pets which im told lew dodgson thinks were planning to make twenty billion dollars a year wu said softly shaking his head thats speaking conservatively hammond said he smiled theres no reason to speculate wildly more ice cream henry did you find him arnold snapped when the guard walked into the control room no mr arnold find him i dont think hes in the building mr arnold then look in the lodge arnold said look in the maintenance building look in the utility shed look everywhere but just find him the thing is the guard hesitated mr nedrys the fat man is that right thats right arnold said hes fat a fat slob well jimmy down in the main lobby said he saw the fat man go into the garage muldoon spun around into the garage when about ten fifteen minutes ago jesus muldoon said the jeep screeched to a stop sorry harding said in the headlamps ellie saw a herd of apatosaurs lumbering across the road there were six animals each the size of a house and a baby as large as a fullgrown horse the apatosaurs moved in unhurried silence never looking toward the jeep and its glowing headlamps at one point the baby stopped to lap water from a puddle in the road then moved on a comparable herd of elephants would have been startled by the arrival of a car would have trumpeted and circled to protect the baby but these animals showed no fear dont they see us she said not exactly no harding said of course in a literal sense they do see us but we dont really mean anything to them we hardly ever take cars out at night and so they have no experience of them we are just a strange smelly object in their environment representing no threat and therefore no interest ive occasionally been out at night visiting a sick animal and on my way back these fellows blocked the road for an hour or more what do you do harding grinned play a recorded tyrannosaur roar that gets them moving not that they care much about tyrannosaurs these apatosaurs are so big they dont really have any predators they can break a tyrannosaurs neck with a swipe of their tail and they know it so does the tyrannosaur but they do see us i mean if we were to get out of the car harding shrugged they probably wouldnt react dinosaurs have excellent visual acuity but they have a basic amphibian visual system its attuned to movement they dont see unmoving things well at all the animals moved on their skin glistening in the rain harding put the car in gear i think we can continue now he said wu said i suspect you may find there are pressures on your park just as there are pressures on genentechs drugs he and hammond had moved to the living room and they were now watching the storm lash the big glass windows i cant see how hammond said the scientists may wish to constrain you even to stop you well they cant do that hammond said he shook his finger at wu you know why the scientists would try to do that its because they want to do research of course thats all they ever want to do is research not to accomplish anything not to make any progress just do research well they have a surprise coming to them i wasnt thinking of that wu said hammond sighed im sure it would be interesting for the scientists to do research but you arrive at the point where these animals are simply too expensive to be used for research this is wonderful technology henry but its also frightfully expensive technology the fact is it can only be supported as entertainment hammond shrugged thats just the way it is but if there are attempts to close down face the damn facts henry hammond said irritably this isnt america this isnt even costa rica this is my island i own it and nothing is going to stop me from opening jurassic park to all the children of the world he chuckled or at least to the rich ones and i tell you theyll love it in the back seat of the jeep ellie sattler stared out the window they had been driving through raindrenched jungle for the last twenty minutes and had seen nothing since the apatosaurs crossed the road were near the jungle river now harding said as he drove its off there somewhere to our left abruptly he slammed on the brakes again the car skidded to a stop in front of a flock of small green animals well youre getting quite a show tonight he said those are compys procompsognathids ellie thought wishing that grant were here to see them this was the animal they had seen in the fax back in montana the little dark green procompsognathids scurried to the other side of the road then squatted on their hind legs to look at the car chattering briefly before hurrying onward into the night odd harding said wonder where theyre off to compys dont usually move at night you know they climb up in a tree and wait for daylight then why are they out now ellie said i cant imagine you know compys are scavengers like buzzards theyre attracted to a dying animal and they have tremendously sensitive smell they can smell a dying animal for miles then theyre going to a dying animal dying or already dead should we follow them ellie said id be curious harding said yes why not lets go see where theyre going he turned the car around and headed back toward the compys tim tim murphy lay in the land cruiser his cheek pressed against the car door handle he drifted slowly back to consciousness he wanted only to sleep he shifted his position and felt the pain in his cheekbone where it lay against the metal door his whole body ached his arms and his legs and most of all his headthere was a terrible pounding pain in his head all the pain made him want to go back to sleep he pushed himself up on one elbow opened his eyes and retched vomiting all over his shirt he tasted sour bile and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand his head throbbed he felt dizzy and seasick as if the world were moving as if he were rocking back and forth on a boat tim groaned and rolled onto his back turning away from the puddle of vomit the pain in his head made him breathe in short shallow gasps and he still felt sick as if everything were moving he opened his eyes and looked around trying to get his bearings he was inside the land cruiser but the car must have flipped over on its side because he was lying on his back against the passenger door looking up at the steering wheel and beyond at the branches of a tree moving in the wind the rain had nearly stopped but water drops still fell on him through the broken front windshield he stared curiously at the fragments of glass he couldnt remember how the windshield had broken he couldnt remember anything except that they had been parked on the road and he had been talking to dr grant when the tyrannosaur came toward them that was the last thing he remembered he felt sick again and closed his eyes until the nausea passed he was aware of a rhythmic creaking sound like the rigging of a boat dizzy and sick to his stomach he really felt as if the whole car were moving beneath him but when he opened his eyes again he saw it was truethe land cruiser was moving lying on its side swaying back and forth the whole car was moving tentatively tim rose to his feet standing on the passenger door he peered over the dashboard looking out through the shattered windshield at first he saw only dense foliage moving in the wind but here and there he could see gaps and beyond the foliage the ground was the ground was twenty feet below him he stared uncomprehendingly the land cruiser was lying on its side in the branches of a large tree twenty feet above the ground swaying back and forth in the wind oh shit he said what was he going to do he stood on his tiptoes and peered out trying to see better grabbing the steering wheel for support the wheel spun free in his hand and with a loud crack the land cruiser shifted position dropping a few feet in the branches of the tree he looked down through the shattered glass of the passengerdoor window at the ground below oh shit oh shit he kept repeating it oh shit oh shit another loud crackthe land cruiser jolted down another foot he had to get out of here he looked down at his feet he was standing on the door handle he crouched back down on his bands and knees to look at the handle he couldnt see very well in the dark but he could tell that the door was dented outward so the handle couldnt turn hed never get the door open he tried to roll the window down but the window was stuck too then he thought of the back door maybe he could open that he leaned over the front seat and the land cruiser lurched with the shift in weight carefully tim reached back and twisted the handle on the rear door it was stuck too how was he going to get out he heard a snorting sound and looked down a dark shape passed below him it wasnt the tyrannosaur this shape was tubby and it made a kind of snuffling as it waddled along the tail flopped back and forth and tim could see the long spikes it was the stegosaur apparently recovered from its illness tim wondered where the other people were gennaro and sattler and the vet he had last seen them near the stegosaur how long ago was that he looked at his watch but the face was cracked he couldnt see the numbers he took the watch off and tossed it aside the stegosaur snuffled and moved on now the only sound was the wind in the trees and the creaking of the land cruiser as it shifted back and forth he had to get out of here tim grabbed the handle tried to force it but it was stuck solid it wouldnt move at all then he realized what was wrong the rear door was locked tim pulled up the pin and twisted the handle the rear door swung open downwardand came to rest against the branch a few feet below the opening was narrow but tim thought he could wriggle through it holding his breath he crawled slowly back into the rear seat the land cruiser creaked but held its position gripping the doorposts on both sides tim slowly lowered himself down through the narrow angled opening of the door soon he was lying flat on his stomach on the slanted door his legs sticking out of the car he kicked in the airhis feet touched something solida branchand he rested his weight on it as soon as he did the branch bent down and the door swung wider spilling him out of the land cruiser and he fellleaves scratching his facehis body bouncing from branch to brancha joltsearing pain bright light in his head he slammed to a stop the wind knocked from him tim lay doubled over a large branch his stomach burning pain tim heard another crack and looked up at the land cruiser a big dark shape five feet above him another crack the car shifted tim forced himself to move to climb down he used to like to climb trees he was a good treeclimber and this was a good tree to climb the branches spaced close together almost like a staircase crackkkk the car was definitely moving tim scrambled downward slipping over the wet branches feeling sticky sap on his hands hurrying he had not descended more than a few feet when the land cruiser creaked a final time and then slowly very slowly nosed over tim could see the big green grille and the front headlights swinging down at him and then the land cruiser fell free gaining momentum as it rushed toward him slamming against the branch where tim had just been and it stopped his face just inches from the dented grille bent inward like an evil mouth headlamps for eyes oil dripped on tims face he was still twelve feet above the ground he reached down found another branch and moved down above he saw the branch bending under the weight of the land cruiser and then it cracked and the land cruiser came rushing down toward him and he knew he could never escape it he could never get down fast enough so tim just let go he fell the rest of the way tumbling banging feeling pain in every part of his body hearing the land cruiser smashing down through the branches after him like a pursuing animal and then tims shoulder hit the soft ground and he rolled as hard as he could and pressed his body against the trunk of the tree as the land cruiser tumbled down with a loud metallic crash and a sudden hot burst of electrical sparks that stung his skin and sputtered and sizzled on the wet ground around him slowly tim got to his feet in the darkness he heard the snuffling and saw the stegosaur coming back apparently attracted by the crash of the land cruiser the dinosaur moved dumbly the low head thrust forward and the big cartilaginous plates running in two rows along the bump of the back it behaved like an overgrown tortoise stupid like that and slow tim picked up a rock and threw it get away the rock tbunked dully off the plates the stegosaur kept coming go on co he threw another rock and hit the stegosaur in the head the animal grunted turned slowly away and shuffled off in the direction it had come tim leaned against the crumpled land cruiser and looked around in the darkness he had to get back to the others but he didnt want to get lost he knew he was somewhere in the park probably not far from the main road if he could only get his hearings he couldnt see much in the dark but then he remembered the goggles he climbed through the shattered front windshield into the land cruiser and found the nightvision goggles and the radio the radio was broken and silent so he left it behind but the goggles still worked he flicked them on saw the reassuringly familiar phosphorescent green image wearing the goggles he saw the battered fence off to his left and walked toward it the fence was twelve feet high but the tyrannosaur had flattened it easily tim hurried across it moved through an area of dense foliage and came out onto the main road through his goggles he saw the other land cruiser turned on its side he ran toward it took a breath and looked inside the car was empty no sign of dr grant and dr malcolm where had they gone where had everybody gone he felt sudden panic standing alone in the jungle road at night with that empty car and turned quickly in circles seeing the bright green world in the goggles swirl something pale by the side of the road caught his eye it was lexs baseball he wiped the mud off it lex tim shouted as loud as he could not caring if the animals heard him he listened but there was only the wind and the plink of raindrops falling from the trees lex he vaguely remembered that she had been in the land cruiser when the tyrannosaur attacked had she stayed there or had she gotten away the events of the attack were confused in his mind he wasnt exactly sure what had happened just to think of it made him uneasy he stood in the road gasping with panic lex the night seemed to close in around him feeling sorry for himself he sat in a cold rainy puddle in the road and whimpered for a while when he finally stopped he still heard whimpering it was faint and it was coming from somewhere farther up the road how long has it been muldoon said coming back into the control room he was carrying a black metal case half an hour hardings jeep should he back here by now arnold stubbed out his cigarette im sure theyll arrive any minute now still no sign of nedry muldoon said no not yet muldoon opened the case which contained six portable radios im going to distribute these to people in the building he handed one to arnold take the charger too these are our emergency radios but nobody had them plugged in naturally let it charge about twenty minutes and then try and raise the cars henry wu opened the door marked fertilization and entered the darkened lab there was nobody here apparently all the technicians were still at dinner wu went directly to the computer terminal and punched up the dna logbooks the logbooks had to be kept on computer dna was such a large molecule that each species required ten gigabytes of optical disk space to store details of all the iterations he was going to have to check all fifteen species that was a tremendous amount of information to search through he still wasnt clear about why grant thought frog dna was important wu himself didnt often distinguish one kind of dna from another after all most dna in living creatures was exactly the same dna was an incredibly ancient substance human beings walking around in the streets of the modern world bouncing their pink new babies hardly stopped to think that the substance at the center of it allthe substance that began the dance of lifewas a chemical almost as old as the earth itself the dna molecule was so old that its evolution had essentially finished more than two billion years ago there had been little new since that time just a few recent combinations of the old genesand not much of that when you compared the dna of man and the dna of a lowly bacterium you found that only about percent of the strands were different this innate conservatism of dna emboldened wu to use whatever dna he wished in making his dinosaurs wu had manipulated the dna as a sculptor might clay or marble he had created freely he started the computer search program knowing it would take two or three minutes to run he got up and walked around the lab checking instruments out of longstanding habit he noted the recorder outside the freezer door which tracked the freezer temperature he saw there was a spike in the graph that was odd he thought it meant somebody had been in the freezer recently toowitbin the last halfhour but who would go in there at night the computer beeped signaling that the first of the data searches was complete wu went over to see what it had found and when he saw the screen he forgot all about the freezer and the graph spike leitzke dna search algorithm dna version search criteria rana all fragment len dna incorporating rana fragments versions maiasaurs procompsognathids othnielia velociraptors hypsilopbodontids the result was clear all breeding dinosaurs incorporated rana or frog dna none of the other animals did wu still did not understand why this had caused them to breed but he could no longer deny that grant was right the dinosaurs were breeding he hurried up to the control room lex she was curled up inside a big onemeter drainage pipe that ran under the road she had her baseball glove in her mouth and she was rocking back and forth banging her head repeatedly against the back of the pipe it was dark in there but he could see her clearly with his goggles she seemed unhurt and he felt a great burst of relief lex its me tim she didnt answer she continued to bang her head on the pipe come on out she shook her head no he could see she was badly frightened lex he said if you come out ill let you wear these night goggles she just shook her head look what i have he said holding up his band she stared uncomprehendingly it was probably too dark for her to see its your ball lex i found your ball so what he tried another approach it must be uncomfortable in there cold too wouldnt you like to come out she resumed banging her head against the pipe why not theres aminals out there that threw him for a moment she hadnt said aminals for years the aminals are gone he said theres a big one a tyrannosaurus rex hes gone where did he go i dont know but hes not around here now tim said hoping it was true lex didnt move he heard her hanging again tim sat down in the grass outside the pipe where she could see him the ground was wet where he sat he hugged his knees and waited he couldnt think of anything else to do im just going to sit here he said and rest is daddy out there no he said feeling strange hes back at home lex is mommy no lex are there any grownups out there lex said not yet but im sure theyll come soon theyre probably on their way right now then he heard her moving inside the pipe and she came out shivering with cold and with dried blood on her forehead but otherwise all right she looked around in surprise and said wheres dr grant i dont know well he was here before he was when before lex said i saw him when i was in the pipe whered he go how am i supposed to know lex said wrinkling her nose she began to shout hellooo helloooo dr grant dr grant tim was uneasy at the noise she was makingit might bring back the tyrannosaurbut a moment later he heard an answering shout it was coming from the right over toward the land cruiser that tim had left a few minutes before with his goggles tim saw with relief that dr grant was walking toward them he had a big tear in his shirt at the shoulder but otherwise he looked okay thank god he said ive been looking for you shivering ed regis got to his feet and wiped the cold mud off his face and hands he had spent a very had half hour wedged among big boulders on the slope of a hill below the road he knew it wasnt much of a hiding place but he was panicked and he wasnt thinking clearly he had lain in this muddy cold place and he had tried to get hold of himself but he kept seeing that dinosaur in his mind that dinosaur coming toward him toward the car ed regis didnt remember exactly what had happened after that he remembered that lex had said something but he hadnt stopped he couldnt stop he had just kept running and running beyond the road he had lost his footing and tumbled down the hill and come to rest by some boulders and it had seemed to him that he could crawl in among the boulders and hide there was enough room so that was what he had done gasping and terrified thinking of nothing except to get away from the tyrannosaur and finally when he was wedged in there like a rat between the boulders he had calmed down a little and he had been overcome with horror and shame because hed abandoned those kids he had just run away he had just saved himself he knew he should go back up to the road he should try to rescue them because he had always imagined himself as brave and cool under pressure but whenever he tried to get control of himself to make himself go back up theresomehow he just couldnt he started to feel panicky and he had trouble breathing and he didnt move he told himself it was hopeless anyway if the kids were still up there on the road they could never survive and certainly there was nothing ed regis could do for them and he might as well stay where he was no one was going to know what had happened except him and there was nothing he could do nothing he could have done and so regis had remained among the boulders for half an hour fighting off panic carefully not thinking about whether the kids had died or about what hammond would have to say when he found out what finally made him move was the peculiar sensation he noticed in his mouth the side of his mouth felt funny kind of numb and tingling and he wondered if he had hurt it during the fall regis touched his face and felt swollen flesh on the side of his mouth it was funny but it didnt hurt at all then he realized the swollen flesh was a leech growing fat as it sucked his lips it was practically in his mouth shivering with nausea regis pulled the leech away feeling it tear from the flesh of his lips feeling the gush of warm blood in his mouth he spat and flung it with disgust into the forest he saw another leech on his forearm and pulled it off leaving a dark bloody streak behind jesus he was probably covered with them that fall down the hillside these jungle hills were full of leeches so were the dark rocky crevices what did the workmen say the leeches crawled up your underwear they liked dark warm places they liked to crawl right up your hellooo he stopped it was a voice carried by the wind helloo dr grant jesus that was the little girl ed regis listened to the tone of her voice she didnt sound frightened or in pain she was just calling in her insistent way and it slowly dawned on him that something else must have happened that the tyrannosaur must have gone awayor at least hadnt attackedand that the other people might still be alive grant and malcolm everybody might be alive an the realization made him pull himself together in an instant the way you got sober in an instant when the cops pulled you over and he felt better because now he knew what he had to do and as he crawled out from the boulders he was already formulating the next step already figuring out what he would say how to handle things from this point regis wiped the cold mud off his face and hands the evidence that he had been hiding he wasnt embarrassed that he had been hiding but now he had to take charge he scrambled back up toward the road but when he emerged from the foliage he had a moment of disorientation he didnt see the cars at all he was somehow at the bottom of the hill the land cruisers must be at the top he started walking up the hill back toward the land cruisers it was very quiet his feet splashed in the muddy puddles he couldnt bear the little girl any more why had she stopped calling as he walked he began to think that maybe something had happened to her in that case he shouldnt walk back there maybe the tyrannosaur was still hanging around here he was already at the bottom of the hill that much closer to home and it was so quiet spooky it was so quiet ed regis turned around and started walking back toward the camp alan grant ran his hands over her limbs squeezing the arms and legs briefly she didnt seem to have any pain it was amazing aside from a cut on her head she was fine i told you i was she said well i had to check the boy was not quite so fortunate tims nose was swollen and painful grant suspected it was broken his right shoulder was badly bruised and swollen but his legs seemed to be all right both kids could walk that was the important thing grant himself was all right except for a claw abrasion down his right chest where the tyrannosaur had kicked him it burned with every breath but it didnt seem to be serious and it didnt limit his movement he wondered if he had been knocked unconscious because he had only dim recollections of events immediately preceding the moment he had sat up groaning in the woods ten yards from the land cruiser at first his chest had been bleeding so he had stuck leaves on the wound and after a while it clotted then he had started walking around looking for malcolm and the kids grant couldnt believe he was still alive and as scattered images began to come back to him he tried to make sense of them the tyrannosaur should have killed them all easily why hadnt it im hungry lex said me too grant said weve got to get ourselves back to civilization and weve got to tell them about the ship were the only ones who know tim said yes weve got to get back and tell them then lets walk down the road toward the hotel tim said pointing down the hill that way well meet them when they come for us grant considered that and he kept thinking about one thing the dark shape that had crossed between the land cruisers even before the attack started what animal had that been he could think of only one possibilitythe little tyrannosaur i dont think so tim the road has high fences on both sides grant said if one of the tyrannosaurs is farther down on the road well he trapped then should we wait here tim said yes grant said lets just wait here until someone comes im hungry lex said i hope it wont be very long grant said i dont want to stay here lex said then from the bottom of the hill they heard the sound of a man coughing stay here grant said he ran forward to look down the hill stay here tim said and he ran forward after him lex followed her brother dont leave me dont leave me here you guys grant clapped his band over her mouth she struggled to protest he shook his head and pointed over the hill for her to look at the bottom of the hill grant saw ed regis standing rigid unmoving the forest around them had become deadly silent the steady background drone of cicadas and frogs had ceased abruptly there was only the faint rustle of leaves and the whine of the wind lex started to speak but grant pulled her against the trunk of the nearest tree ducking down among the heavy gnarled roots at the base tim came in right after them grant put his hands to his lips signaling them to be quiet and then he slowly looked around the tree the road below was dark and as the branches of the big trees moved in the wind the moonlight filtering through made a dappled shifting pattern ed regis was gone it took grant a moment to locate him the publicist was pressed up against the trunk of a big tree hugging it regis wasnt moving at all the forest remained silent lex tugged impatiently at grants shirt she wanted to know what was happening then from somewhere very near they heard a soft snorting exhalation hardly louder than the wind lex heard it too because she stopped struggling the sound floated toward them again soft as a sigh grant thought it was almost like the breathing of a horse grant looked at regis and saw the moving shadows cast by the moonlight on the trunk of the tree and then grant realized there was another shadow superimposed on the others but not moving a strong curved neck and a square head the exhalation came again tim leaned forward cautiously to look lex did too they heard a crack as a branch broke and into the path stepped a tyrannosaur it was the juvenile about eight feet tall and it moved with the clumsy gait of a young animal almost like a puppy the juvenile tyrannosaur shuffled down the path stopping with every step to sniff the air before moving on it passed the tree where regis was hiding and gave no indication that it had seen him grant saw regiss body relax slightly regis turned his head trying to watch the tyrannosaur on the far side of the tree the tyrannosaur was now out of view down the road regis started to relax releasing his grip on the tree but the jungle remained silent regis remained close to the tree trunk for another half a minute then the sounds of the forest returned the first tentative croak of a tree frog the buzz of one cicada and then the full chorus regis stepped away from the tree shaking his shoulders releasing the tension he walked into the middle of the road looking in the direction of the departed tyrannosaur the attack came from the left the juvenile roared as it swung its head forward knocking regis flat to the ground he yelled and scrambled to his feet but the tyrannosaur pounced and it must have pinned him with its hind leg because suddenly regis wasnt moving he was sitting up in the path shouting at the dinosaur and waving his hands at it as if he could scare it off the young dinosaur seemed perplexed by the sounds and movement coming from its tiny prey the juvenile bent its head over sniffing curiously and regis pounded on the snout with his fists get away back off go on back off regis was shouting at the top of his lungs and the dinosaur backed away allowing regis to get to his feet regis was shouting yeah you heard me back off get away as he moved away from the dinosaur the juvenile continued to stare curiously at the odd noisy little animal before it but when regis had gone a few paces it lunged and knocked him down again its playing with him grant thought hey regis shouted as he fell but the juvenile did not pursue him allowing him to get to his feet he jumped to his feet and continued backing away you stupidback back you heard meback he shouted like a lion tamer the juvenile roared but it did not attack and regis now edged toward the trees and high foliage to the right in another few steps he would be in hiding back you back regis shouted and then at the last moment the juvenile pounced and knocked regis flat on his back cut that out regis yelled and the juvenile ducked his head and regis began to scream no words just a highpitched scream the scream cut off abruptly and when the juvenile lifted his head grant saw ragged flesh in his jaws oh no lex said softly beside her tim had turned away suddenly nauseated his nightvision goggles slipped from his forehead and landed on the ground with a metallic clink the juveniles head snapped up and it looked toward the top of the hill tim picked up his goggles as grant grabbed both the childrens hands and began to run control in the night the compys scurried along the side of the road hardings jeep followed a short distance behind ellie pointed farther up the road is that a light could be harding said looks almost like headlights the radio suddenly bummed and crackled they heard john arnold say you there ah there he is harding said finally he pressed the button yes john were here were near the river following the compys its quite interesting more crackling then eed your car whatd he say gennaro said something about a car ellie said at grants dig in montana ellie was the one who operated the radiophone after years of experience she had become skilled at picking up garbled transmissions i think he said he needs your car harding pressed the button john are you there we cant read you very well john there was a flash of lightning followed by a long sizzle of radio static then arnolds tense voice where areou were one mile north of the hypsy paddock near the river following some compys nodamn wellget back hereow sounds like hes got a problem ellie said frowning there was no mistaking the tension in the voice maybe we should go back harding shrugged johns frequently got a problem you know how engineers are they want everything to go by the book he pressed the button on the radio john say again please more crackling more static the loud crash of lightning then muldooneed your carow gennaro frowned is he saying muldoon needs our car thats what it sounded like ellie said well that doesnt make any sense harding said otherstuckmuldoon wantscar i get it ellie said the other cars are stuck on the road in the storm and muldoon wants to go get them harding shrugged why doesnt muldoon take the other car he pushed the radio button john tell muldoon to take the other car its in the garage the radio crackled notlistencrazy bastardscar harding pressed the radio button i said its in the garage john the car is in the garage more static edry hasssingone im afraid this isnt getting us anywhere harding said all right john were coming in now he turned the radio off and turned the car around i just wish i understood what the urgency is harding put the jeep in gear and they rumbled down the road in the darkness it was another ten minutes before they saw the welcoming lights of the safari lodge and as harding pulled to a stop in front of the visitor center they saw muldoon coming toward them he was shouting and waving his arms god damn it arnold you son of a bitch god damn it get this park back on track now get my grandkids back here now john hammond stood in the control room screaming and stamping his little feet he had been carrying on this way for the last two minutes while henry wu stood in the corner looking stunned well mr hammond arnold said muldoons on his way out right now to do exactly that arnold turned away and lit another cigarette hammond was like every other management guy arnold had ever seen whether it was disney or the navy management guys always behaved the same they never understood the technical issues and they thought that screaming was the way to make things happen and maybe it was if you were shouting at your secretaries to get you a limousine but screaming didnt make any difference at all to the problems that arnold now faced the computer didnt care if it was screamed at the power network didnt care if it was screamed at technical systems were completely indifferent to all this explosive human emotion if anything screaming was counterproductive because arnold now faced the virtual certainty that nedry wasnt coming back which meant that arnold himself had to go into the computer code and try and figure out what had gone wrong it was going to be a painstaking job hed need to be calm and careful why dont you go downstairs to the cafeteria arnold said and get a cup of coffee well call you when we have more news i dont want a malcolm effect here hammond said dont worry about a malcolm effect arnold said will you let me go to work god damn you hammond said ill call you sir when i have news from muldoon arnold said he pushed buttons on his console and saw the familiar control screens change jurassic park main modules call

the scenes to look at the codethe linebyline instructions that told the computer how to behave arnold was unhappily aware that the complete jurassic park program contained more than half a million lines of code most of it undocumented without explanation wu came forward what are you doing john checking the code by inspection thatll take forever tell me arnold said tell me the road muldoon took the curve very fast the jeep sliding on the mud sitting beside him gennaro clenched his fists they were racing along the cliff road high above the river now hidden below them in darkness muldoon accelerated forward his face was tense how much farther gennaro said two maybe three miles ellie and harding were back at the visitor center gennaro had offered to accompany muldoon the car swerved its been an hour muldoon said an hour with no word from the other cars but they have radios gennaro said we havent been able to raise them muldoon said gennaro frowned if i was sitting in a car for an hour in the rain id sure try to use the radio to call for somebody so would i muldoon said gennaro shook his head you really think something could have happened to them chances are muldoon said that theyre perfectly fine but ill he happier when i finally see them should be any minute now the road curved and then ran up a hill at the base of the hill gennaro saw something white lying among the ferns by the side of the road hold it gennaro said and muldoon braked gennaro jumped out and ran forward in the headlights of the jeep to see what it was it looked like a piece of clothing but there was gennaro stopped even from six feet away he could see clearly what it was he walked forward more slowly muldoon leaned out of the car and said what is it its a leg gennaro said the flesh of the leg was pale bluewbite terminating in a ragged bloody stump where the knee had been below the calf he saw a white sock and a brown slipon shoe it was the kind of sboe ed regis had been wearing by then muldoon was out of the car running past him to crouch over the leg jesus he lifted the leg out of the foliage raising it into the light of the headlamps and blood from the stump gushed down over his band gennaro was still three feet away he quickly bent over put his hands on his knees squeezed his eyes shut and breathed deeply trying not to be sick gennaro muldoons voice was sharp what move youre blocking the light gennaro took a breath and moved when he opened his eyes he saw muldoon peering critically at the stump torn at the joint line muldoon said didnt bite ittwisted and ripped it just ripped his leg off muldoon stood up holding the severed leg upside down so the remaining blood dripped onto the ferns his bloody hand smudged the white sock as fie gripped the ankle gennaro felt sick again no question what happened muldoon was saying the trex got him muldoon looked up the hill then back to gennaro you all right can you go on yes gennaro said i can go on muldoon was walking back toward the jeep carrying the leg i guess we better bring this along he said doesnt seem right to leave it here christ its going to make a mess of the car see if theres anything in the back will you a tarp or newspaper gennaro opened the back door and rummaged around in the space behind the rear seat he felt grateful to think about something else for a moment the problem of how to wrap the severed leg expanded to fill his mind crowding out all other thoughts he found a canvas bag with a tool kit a wheel rim a cardboard box and two tarps he said they were neatly folded plastic give me one muldoon said still standing outside the car muldoon wrapped the leg and passed the now shapeless bundle to gennaro holding it in his hand gennaro was surprised at how heavy it felt just put it in the back muldoon said if theres a way to wedge it you know so it doesnt roll around okay gennaro put the bundle in the back and muldoon got behind the wheel he accelerated the wheels spinning in the mud then digging in the jeep rushed up the hill and for a moment at the top the headlights still pointed upward into the foliage and then they swung down and gennaro could see the road before them jesus muldoon said gennaro saw a single land cruiser lying on its side in the center of the road he couldnt see the second land cruiser at all wheres the other car muldoon looked around briefly pointed to the left there the second land cruiser was twenty feet away crumpled at the foot of a tree whats it doing there the trex threw it threw it gennaro said muldoons face was grim lets get this over with he said climbing out of the jeep they hurried forward to the second land cruiser their flashlights swung back and forth in the night as they came closer gennaro saw how battered the car was he was careful to let muldoon look inside first i wouldnt worry muldoon said its very unlikely well find anyone no no he said he explained that during his years in africa he had visited the scenes of a halfdozen animal attacks on humans in the bush one leopard attack the leopard had torn open a tent in the night and taken a threeyearold child then one buffalo attack in amboseli two lion attacks one croc attack in the north near meru in every case there was surprisingly little evidence left behind inexperienced people imagined horrific proofs of an animal attacktorn limbs left behind in the tent trails of dripping blood leading away into the bush bloodstained clothing not far from the campsite but the truth was there was usually nothing at all particularly if the victim was small an infant or a young child the person just seemed to disappear as if he had walked out into the bush and never come back a predator could kill a child just by shaking it snapping the neck usually there wasnt any blood and most of the time you never found any other remains of the victims sometimes a button from a shirt or a sliver of rubber from a shoe but most of the time nothing predators took childrenthey preferred childrenand they left nothing behind so muldoon thought it highly unlikely that they would ever find any remains of the children but as he looked in now he had a surprise ill be damned he said muldoon tried to put the scene together the front windshield of the land cruiser was shattered but there wasnt much glass nearby he had noticed shards of glass back on the road so the windshield must have broken back there before the tyrannosaur picked the car up and threw it here but the car had taken a tremendous beating muldoon shone his light inside empty gcnnaro said tensely not quite muldoon said his flashlight glinted off a crushed radio handset and on the floor of the car he saw something else something curved and black the front doors were dented and jammed shut but he climbed in through the back door and crawled over the seat to pick up the black object its a watch he said peering at it in the beam of his flashlight a cheap digital watch with a molded black rubber strap the lcd face was shattered he thought the boy might have been wearing it though he wasnt sure but it was the kind of watch a kid would have what is it a watch gennaro said yes and theres a radio but its broken is that significant yes and theres something else muldoon sniffed there was a sour odor inside the car he shone the light around until he saw the vomit dripping off the side door panel he touched it still fresh one of the kids may still be alive muldoon said gennaro squinted at him what makes you think so the watch muldoon said the watch proves it he banded the watch to gennaro who held it in the glow of the flashlight and turned it over in his hands crystal is cracked gennaro said thats right muldoon said and the band is uninjured which means the kid took it off that could have happened anytime gennaro said anytime before the attack no muldoon said those lcd crystals are tough it takes a powerful blow to break them the watch face was shattered during the attack so the kid took his watch off think about it muldoon said if you were being attacked by a tyrannosaur would you stop to take your watch off maybe it was torn off its almost impossible to tear a watch off somebodys wrist without tearing the band off too anyway the band is intact no muldoon said the kid took it off himself he looked at his watch saw it was broken and took it off he had the time to do that when it could only have been after the attack muldoon said the kid must have been in this car after the attack and the radio was broken so he left it behind too hes a bright kid and he knew they werent useful if hes so bright gennaro said whered he go because id stay right here and wait to be picked up yes muldoon said but perhaps he couldnt stay here may the tyrannosaur came back or some other animal anyway something made him leave then whered he go gennaro said lets see if we can determine that muldoon said and he strode off toward the main road gennaro watched muldoon peering at the ground with his flashlight his face was just inches from the mud intent on his search muldoon really believed he was on to something that at least one of the kids was still alive gennaro remained unimpressed the shock of finding the severed leg had left him with a grim determination to close the park and destroy it no matter what muldoon said gennaro suspected him of unwarranted enthusiasm and hopefulness and you notice these prints muldoon asked still looking at the ground what prints gennaro said these footprintssee them coming toward us from up the roadand theyre adultsize prints some kind of rubbersole sboe notice the distinctive tread pattern gennaro saw only mud puddles catching the light from the flashlights you can see muldoon continued the adult prints come to here where theyre joined by other prints small and mediumsize moving around in circles overlapping almost as if theyre standing together talking but now here they are they seem to be running he pointed off there into the park gennaro shook his head you can see whatever you want in this mud muldoon got to his feet and stepped back he looked down at the ground and sighed say what you like ill wager one of the kids survived and maybe both perhaps even an adult as well if these big prints belong to someone other than regis weve got to search the park tonight gennaro said but muldoon wasnt listening he had walked away toward an embankment of soft earth near a drainpipe for rain he crouched again what was that little girl wearing christ gennaro said i dont know proceeding slowly muldoon moved farther toward the side of the road and then they heard a wheezing sound it was definitely an animal sound listen gennaro said feeling panic i think we better shhh muldoon said he paused listening its just the wind gennaro said they heard the wheezing again distinctly this time it wasnt the wind it was coming from the foliage directly ahead of him by the side of the road it didnt sound like an animal but muldoon moved forward cautiously he waggled his light and shouted but the wheezing did not change character muldoon pushed aside the fronds of a palm what is it gennaro said its malcolm muldoon said ian malcolm lay on his back his skin graywhite mouth slackly open his breath came in wheezing gasps muldoon handed the flashlight to gennaro and then bent to examine the body i cant find the injury he said head okay chest arms then gennaro shone the light on the legs he put a tourniquet on malcolms belt was twisted tight over the right thigh gennaro moved the light down the leg the right ankle was bent outward at an awkward angle from the leg the trousers flattened soaked in blood muldoon touched the ankle gently and malcolm groaned muldoon stepped back and tried to decide what to do next malcolm might have other injuries his back might be broken it might kill him to move him but if they left him here he would die of shock it was only because he had had the presence of mind to put a tourniquet on that he hadnt already bled to death and probably he was doomed they might as well move him gennaro helped muldoon pick the man up hoisting him awkwardly over their shoulders malcolm moaned and breathed in ragged gasps lex he said lex went lex whos lex muldoon said the little girl gennaro said they carried malcolm back to the jeep and wrested him into the back seat gennaro tightened the tourniquet around his leg malcolm groaned again muldoon slid the trouser cuff up and saw the pulpy flesh beneath the dull white splinters of protruding bone weve got to get him back muldoon said you going to leave here without the kids gennaro said if they went into the park its twenty square miles muldoon said shaking his head the only way we can find anything out there is with the motion sensors if the kids are alive and moving around the motion sensors will pick them up and we can go right to them and bring them back but if we dont take dr malcolm back right now hell die then we have to go back gennaro said yes i think so they climbed into the car gennaro said are you going to tell hammond the kids are missing no muldoon said you are control donald gennaro stared at hammond sitting in the deserted cafeteria the man was spooning ice cream calmly eating it so muldoon believes the children are somewhere in the park he thinks so yes then im sure well find them i hope so gennaro said he watched the old man deliberately eating and he felt a chill oh i am sure well find them after all i keep telling everyone this park is made for kids gennaro said just so you understand that theyre missing sir missing he snapped of course i know theyre missing im not senile he sighed and changed tone again look donald hammond said lets not get carried away weve had a little breakdown from the storm or whatever and as a result weve suffered a regrettable unfortunate accident and thats all thats happened were dealing with it arnold will get the computers cleaned up muldoon will pick up the kids and i have no doubt hell be back with them by the time we finish this ice cream so lets just wait and see what develops shall we whatever you say sir gennaro said why henry wu said looking at the console screen because i think nedry did something to the code arnold said thats why im checking it all right wu said but have you tried your options like what arnold said i dont know arent the safety systems still running wu said keychecks all that jesus arnold said snapping his fingers they must be safety systems cant be turned off except at the main panel well wu said if keycheeks is active you can trace what he did i sure as hell can arnold said he started to press buttons why hadnt he thought of it before it was so obvious the computer system at jurassic park had several tiers of safety systems built into it one of them was a keycheck program which monitored all the keystrokes entered by operators with access to the system it was originally installed as a debugging device but it was retained for its security value in a moment all the keystrokes that nedry had entered into the computer earlier in the day were listed in a window on the screen system nedry goto command level nedry xy amp mr goodbytes security keycheck off safety off sl off security whterbtobj thats it arnold said he was screwing around here for hours it seemed like probably just killing time wu said until he finally decided to get down to it the initial list of numbers represented the asci keyboard codes for the keys nedry had pushed at his console those numbers meant he was still within the standard user interface like any ordinary user of the computer so initially nedry was just looking around which you wouldnt have expected of the programmer who had designed the system maybe he was trying to see if there were changes before he went in wu said maybe arnold said arnold was now looking at the list of commands which allowed him to follow nedrys progression through the system line by line at least we can see what he did system was nedrys request to leave the ordinary user interface and access the code itself the computer asked for his name and he replied nedry that name was authorized to access the code so the computer allowed him into the system nedry asked to goto command level the computers highest level of control the command level required extra security and asked nedry for his name access number and password nedry xy amp mr goodbytes those entries got nedry into the command level from there he wanted security and since he was authorized the computer allowed him to go there once at the security level nedry tried three variations keycheck off safety off sl off hes trying to turn off the safety systems wu said he doesnt want anybody to see what hes about to do exactly arnold said and apparently he doesnt know its no longer possible to turn the systems off except by manually flipping switches on the main board after three failed commands the computer automatically began to worry about nedry but since he had gotten in with proper authorization the computer would assume that nedry was lost trying to do something he couldnt accomplish from where he was so the computer asked him again where he wanted to be and nedry said security and he was allowed to remain there finally wu said heres the kicker he pointed to the last of the commands nedry had entered whterbtobj what the hell is that arnold said white rabbit is that supposed to be his private joke its marked as an object wu said in computer terminology an object was a block of code that could be moved around and used the way you might move a chair in a room an object might be a set of commands to draw a picture or to refresh the screen or to perform a certain calculation lets see where it is in the code arnold said maybe we can figure out what it does he went to the program utilities and typed find whterbtobj the computer flashed back object not found in libraries it doesnt exist arnold said then search the code listing wu said arnold typed findlistings whterbtobj the screen scrolled rapidly the lines of code blurring as they swept past it continued this way for almost a minute and then abruptly stopped there it is wu said its not an object its a command the screen showed an arrow pointing to a single line of code curv gethandl ssmdt temprgn itmdd curh

arnold said wu shook his head it isnt a bug in the code at all no arnold said its a trap door the fat bastard put in what looked like an object call but its actually a command that links the security and perimeter systems and then turns them off gives him complete access to every place in the park then we must be able to turn them back on wu said yeah we must arnold frowned at the screen all we have to do is figure out the command ill run an execution trace on the link he said well see where that gets us wu got up from his chair meanwhile he said meanwhile that somebody went into the freezer about an hour ago i think i better go count my embryos ellie was in her room about to change out of her wet clothes when there was a knock on the door alan she said but when she opened the door she saw muldoon standing there with a plasticwrapped package under his arm muldoon was also soaking wet and there were streaks of dirt on his clothes im sorry but we need your help muldoon said briskly the land cruisers were attacked an hour ago we brought malcolm back but hes in shock hes got a very bad injury to his leg hes still unconscious but i put him in the bed in his room harding is on his way over harding she said what about the others we havent found the others yet dr sattler muldoon said he was speaking slowly now oh my god but we think that dr grant and the children are still alive we think they went into the park dr sattler went into the park we think so meanwhile malcolm needshelp ive called harding shouldnt you call the doctor theres no doctor on the island hardings the best we have but surely you can call for a doctor she said no muldoon shook his head phone lines are down we cant call out he shifted the package in his arm whats that she said nothing just go to malcolms room and help harding if you will and muldoon was gone she sat on her bed shocked ellie sattler was not a woman disposed to unnecessary panic and she had known grant to get out of dangerous situations before once hed been lost in the badlands for four days when a cliff gave way beneath him and his truck fell a hundred feet into a ravine grants right leg was broken he had no water but he walked back on a broken leg on the other hand the kids she shook her head pushing the thought away the kids were probably with grant and if grant was out in the park well what better person to get them safely through jurassic park than a dinosaur expert in the park im tired lex said carry me dr grant youre too big to carry tim said but im tired she said okay lex grant said picking her up oof youre heavy it was almost pm the full moon was blurred by drifting mist and their blunted shadows led them across an open field toward dark woods beyond grant was lost in thought trying to decide where he was since they had originally crossed over the fence that the tyrannosaur had battered down grant was reasonably sure they were now somewhere in the tyrannosaur paddock which was a place he did not want to be in his mind he kept seeing the computer tracing of the tyrannosaurs home range the tight squiggle of lines that traced his movements within a small area he and the kids were in that area now but grant also remembered that the tyrannosaurs were isolated from all the other animals which meant they would know they had left the paddock when they crossed a barriera fence or a moat or both he had seen no barriers so far the girl put her head on his shoulder and twirled her hair in her fingers soon she was snoring tim trudged alongside grant how you holding up tim okay he said but i think we might be in the tyrannosaur area im pretty sure we are i hope we get out soon you going to go into the woods tim said as they came closer the woods seemed dark and forbidding yes grant said i think we can navigate by the numbers on the motion sensors the motion sensors were green boxes set about four feet off the ground some were freestanding most were attached to trees none of them were working because apparently the power was still off each sensor box had a glass lens mounted in the center and a painted code number beneath that up ahead in the miststreaked moonlight grant could see a box marked ts they entered the forest huge trees loomed on all sides in the moonlight a low mist clung to the ground curling around the roots of the trees it was beautiful but it made walking treacherous and grant was watching the sensors they seemed to be numbered in descending order he passed ts and ts eventually they reached ts he was tired from carrying the girl and he had hoped this would coincide with a boundary for the tyrannosaur paddock but it was just another box in the middle of the woods the next box after that was marked tn followed by tn grant realized the numbers must be arranged geographically around a central point like a compass they were going from soutb to north so the numbers got smaller as they approached the center then got larger again at least were going the right way tim said good for you grant said tim smiled and stumbled over vines in the mist he got quickly to his feet they walked on for a while my parents are getting a divorce he said uhhuh grant said my dad moved out last month he has his own place in mill valley now uhhuh he never carries my sister any more he never even picks her up and he says you have dinosaurs on the brain grant said tim sighed yeah you miss him grant said not really tim said sometimes she misses him more who your mother no lex my mom has a boyfriend she knows him from work they walked in silence for a while passing tn and tn have you met him grant said yeah how is he hes okay tim said hes younger than my dad but hes bald how does he treat you i dont know okay i think he just tries to get on my good side i dont know whats going to happen sometimes my mom says well have to sell the house and move sometimes he and my mom fight late at night i sit in my room and play with my computer but i can still hear it uhhuh grant said are you divorced no grant said my wife died a long time ago and now youre with dr sattler grant smiled in the darkness no shes my student you mean shes still in school graduate school yes grant paused long enough to shift lex to his other shoulder and then they continued on past tn and tn there was the rumble of thunder in the distance the storm had moved to the south there was very little sound in the forest except for the drone of cicadas and the soft croaking of tree frogs you have children tim asked no crant said are you going to marry dr sattler no shes marrying a nice doctor in chicago sometime next year oh tim said he seemed surprised to hear it they walked along for a while then who are you going to marry i dont think im going to marry anybody grant said me neither tim said they walked for a while tim said are we going to walk all night i dont think i can grant said well have to stop at least for a few hours he glanced at his watch were okay weve got almost fifteen hours before we have to be back before the ship reaches the mainland where are we going to stop tim asked immediately grant was wondering the same thing his first thought was that thev might climb a tree and sleep up there but they would have to climb very high to get safely away from the animals and lex might fall out while she was asleep and tree branches were hard they wouldnt get any rest at least he wouldnt they needed someplace really safe he thought back to the plans he had seen on the jet coming down he remembered that there were outlying buildings for each of the different divisions grant didnt know what they were like because plans for the individual buildings werent included and he couldnt remember exactly where they were but he remembered they were scattered all around the park there might be buildings somewhere nearby but that was a different requirement from simply crossing a barrier and getting out of the tyrannosaur paddock finding a building meant a search strategy of some kind and the best strategies were tim can you hold your sister for me im going to climb a tree and have a look around high in the branches he had a good view of the forest the tops of the trees extending away to his left and right they were surprisingly near the edge of the forestdirectly ahead the trees ended before a clearing with an electrified fence and a pale concrete moat beyond that a large open field in what he assumed was the sauropod paddock in the distance more trees and misty moonlight sparkling on the ocean somewhere he heard the bellowing of a dinosaur but it was far away he put on tims nightvision goggles and looked again he followed the gray curve of the moat and then saw what he was looking for the dark strip of a service road leading to the flat rectangle of a roof the roof was barely above ground level but it was there and it wasnt far maybe a quarter of a mile or so from the tree when he came back down lex was sniffling whats the matter i heard an aminal it wont bother us are you awake now come on he led her to the fence it was twelve feet high with a spiral of barbed wire at the top it seemed to stretch far above them in the moonligbt the moat was immediately on the other side lex looked up at the fence doubtfully can you climb it grant asked her she handed him her glove and her baseball sure easy she started to climb but i bet timmy cant tim spun in fury you shut up timmys afraid of heights i am not she climbed higher are so am not then come and get me grant turned to tim pale in the darkness the boy wasnt moving you okay with the fence tim sure want some help timmys a fraidycat lex called what a stupid jerk tim said and he started to climb its freezing lex said they were standing waistdeep in smelly water at the bottom of a deep concrete moat they had climbed the fence without incident except that tim had torn his shirt on the coils of barbed wire at the top then they had all slid down into the moat and now grant was looking for a way out at least i got timmy over the fence for you lex said he really is scared most times thanks for your help tim said sarcastically in the moonlight he could see floating lumps on the surface he moved along the moat looking at the concrete wall on the far side the concrete was smooth they couldnt possibly climb it eww lex said pointing to the water it wont hurt you lex grant finally found a place where the concrete had cracked and a vine grew down toward the water he tugged on the vine and it held his weight lets go kids they started to climb the vine back to the field above it took only a few minutes to cross the field to the embankment leading to the belowgrade service road and the maintenance building off to the right they passed two motion sensors and grant noticed with some uneasiness that the sensors were still not working nor were the lights more than two hours had passed since the power first went out and it was not yet restored somewhere in the distance they heard the tyrannosaur roar is he around here lex said no grant said were in another section of park from him they slid down a grassy embankment and moved toward the concrete building in the darkness it was forbidding bunkerlike what is this place lex said its safe grant said hoping that was true the entrance gate was large enough to drive a truck through it was fitted with heavy bars inside they could see the building was an open shed with piles of grass and bales of bay stacked among equipment the gate was locked with a heavy padlock as grant was examining it lex slipped sideways between the bars come on you guys tim followed her i think you can do it dr grant he was right it was a tight squeeze but grant was able to ease his body between the bars and get into the shed as soon as he was inside a wave of exhaustion struck him i wonder if theres anything to eat lex said just hay grant broke open a bale and spread it around on the concrete the hay in the center was warm they lay down feeling the warmth lex curled up beside him and closed her eyes tim put his arm around her he heard the sauropods trumpeting softly in the distance neither child spoke they were almost immediately snoring grant raised his arm to look at his watch but it was too dark to see he felt the warmth of the children against his own body grant closed his eves and slept control muldoon and gennaro came into the control room just as arnold clapped his bands and said got you you little son of a bitch what is it gennaro said arnold pointed to

the windows look outside the big quartz lights were coming on throughout the park they went to the windows and looked out hot damn arnold said gennaro said does this mean the electrified fences are back on you bet it does arnold said itll take a few seconds to get up to full power because weve got fifty miles of fence out there and the generator has to charge the capacitors along the way but in half a minute well be back in business arnold pointed to the vertical glass seethrough map of the park on the map bright red lines were snaking out from the power station moving throughout the park as electricity surged through the fences and the motion sensors gennaro said yes them too itll be a few minutes while the computer counts but everythings working arnold said half past nine and weve got the whole damn thing back up and running grant opened his eyes brilliant blue light was streaming into the building through the bars of the gate quartz light the power was back on groggily he looked at his watch it was just ninethirty hed been asleep only a couple of minutes he decided he could sleep a few minutes more and then he would go back up to the field and stand in front of the motion sensors and wave setting them off the control room would spot him theyd send a car out to pick him and the kids up hed tell arnold to recall the supply ship and theyd all finish the night in their own beds back in the lodge he would do that right away in just a couple of minutes he yawned and closed his eyes again not bad arnold said in the control room staring at the glowing map theres only three cutouts in the whole park much better than i hoped for cutouts gennaro said the fence automatically cuts out shortcircuited sections he explained you can see a big one here in sector twelve near the main road thats where the rex knocked the fence down muldoon said exactly and another one is here in sector eleven near the sauropod maintenance building why would that section be out gennaro said god knows arnold said probably storm damage or a fallen tree we can check it on the monitor in a while the third one is over there by the jungle river dont know why that should be out either as gennaro looked the map became more complex filling with green spots and numbers whats all this the animals the motion sensors are working again and the computers starting to identify the location of all the animals in the park and anybody else too gennaro stared at the map you mean grant and the kids yes weve reset our search number above four hundred so if theyre out there moving around arnold said the motion sensors will pick them up as additional animals he stared at the map but i dont see any additionals yet why does it take so long gennaro said you have to realize mr gennaro arnold said that theres a lot of extraneous movement out there branches blowing in the wind birds flying around all kinds of stuff the computer has to eliminate all the background movement it may takeah okay counts finished gennaro said you dont see the kids arnold twisted in his chair and looked back to the map no he said at the moment there are no additionals on the map at all everything out there has been accounted for as a dinosaur theyre probably up in a tree or somewhere else where we cant see them i wouldnt worry yet several animals havent shown up like the big rex thats probably because its sleeping somewhere and not moving the people may be sleeping too we just dont know muldoon shook his head we better get on with it he said we need to repair the fences and get the animals back into their paddocks according to that computer weve got five to herd back to the proper paddocks ill take the maintenance crews out now arnold turned to gennaro you may want to see how dr malcolm is doing tell dr harding that muldoon will need him in about an hour to supervise the herding and ill notify mr hammond that were starting our final cleanup gennaro passed through the iron gates and went in the front door of the safari lodge he saw ellie sattler coming down the hallway carrying towels and a pan of steaming water theres a kitchen at the other end she said were using that to boil water for the dressings how is he gennaro asked surprisingly good she said gennarro followed ellie down to malcolms room and was startled to hear the sound of laughter the mathematician lay on his back in the bed with harding adjusting an iv line so the other man says ill tell you frankly i didnt like it bill i went back to toilet paper harding was laughing its not bad is it malcolm said smiling ah mr gennaro youve come to see me now you know what happens from trying to get a leg up on the situation gennaro came in tentatively harding said hes on fairly high doses of morphine not high enough i can tell you malcolm said christ hes stingy with his drugs did they find the others yet no not yet gennaro said but im glad to see you doing so well how else should i be doing malcolm said with a compound fracture of the leg that is likely septic and beginning to smell rather ah pungent but i always say if you cant keep a sense of humor gennaro smiled do you remember what happened of course i remember malcolm said do you think you could be bitten by a tyrannosaurus rex and it would escape your mind no indeed ill tell you youd remember it for the rest of your life in my case perhaps not a terribly long time but stillyes i remember malcolm described running from the land cruiser in the rain and being chased down by the rex it was my own damned fault he was too close but i was panicked in any case he picked me up in his jaws how gennaro said torso malcolm said and lifted his shirt a broad semicircle of bruised punctures ran from his shoulder to his navel lifted me up in his jaws shook me bloody hard and threw me down and i was fineterrified of course but still and all fineright up to the moment he threw me i broke the leg in the fall but the bite was not half bad he sighed considering harding said most of the big carnivores dont have strong jaws the real power is in the neck musculature the jaws just hold on while they use the neck to twist and rip but with a small creature like dr malcolm the animal would just shake him and then toss him im afraid thats right malcolm said i doubt id have survived except the big chaps heart wasnt in it to tell the truth he struck me as a rather clumsy attacker of anything less than an automobile or a small apartment building you think he attacked halfheartedly it pains me to say it malcolm said but i dont honestly feel i had his full attention he had mine of course but then he weighs eight tons i dont gennaro turned to harding and said theyre going to repair the fences now arnold says muldoon will need your help herding animals okay harding said so long as you leave me dr sattler and ample morphine malcolm said and so long as we do not have a malcolm effect here whats a malcolm effect gennaro said modesty forbids me malcolm said from telling you the details of a phenomenon named after me he sighed again and closed his eyes in a moment he was sleeping ellie walked out into the hallway with gennaro dont be fooled she said its a great strain on him when will you have a helicopter here a helicopter he needs surgery on that leg make sure they send for a helicopter and get him off this island the park the portable generator sputtered and roared to life and the quartz floodlights glowed at the ends of their telescoping arms muldoon heard the soft gurgle of the jungle river a few yards to the north he turned back to the maintenance van and saw one of the workmen coming out with a big power saw no no he said just the ropes carlos we dont need to cut it he turned back to look at the fence they had difficulty finding the shorted section at first because there wasnt much to see a small protocarpus tree was leaning against the fence it was one of several that had been planted in this region of the park their featherv branches intended to conceal the fence from view but this particular tree had been tied down with guy wires and turnbuckles the wires had broken free in the storm and the metal turnbuckles had blown against the fence and shorted it out of course none of this should have happened grounds crews were supposed to use plasticcoated wires and ceramic turnbuckles near fences but it had happened anyway in any case it wasnt going to be a big job all they had to do was pull the tree off the fence remove the metal fittings and mark it for the gardeners to fix in the morning it shouldnt take more than twenty minutes and that was just as well because muldoon knew the dilophosaurs always stayed close to the river even though the workmen were separated from the river by the fence the dilos could spit right through it delivering their blinding poison ramon one of the workmen came over senor muldoon he said did you see the lights what lights muldoon said ramon pointed to the east through the jungle i saw it as we were coming out it is there very faint you see it it looks like the lights of a car but it is not moving muldoon squinted it probably was just a maintenance light after all power was back on well worry about it later he said right now lets just get that tree off the fence arnold was in an expansive mood the park was almost back in order muldoon was repairing the fences hammond had gone off to supervise the transfer of the animals with harding although he was tired arnold was feeling good he was even in a mood to indulge the lawyer gennaro the malcolm effect arnold said you worried about that im just curious gennaro said you mean you want me to tell you why ian malcolm is wrong sure arnold lit another cigarette its technical try me okay arnold said chaos theory describes nonlinear systems its now become a very broad theory thats been used to study everything from the stock market to rioting crowds to brain waves during epilepsy a very fashionable theory very trendy to apply it to any complex system where there might be unpredictability okay okay gennaro said ian malcolm is a mathematician specializing in chaos theory quite amusing and personable but basically what he does besides wear black is use computers to model the behavior of complex systems and john hammond loves the latest scientific fad so he asked malcolm to model the system at jurassic park which malcolm did malcolms models are all phasespace shapes on a computer screen have you seen them no gennaro said well they look like a weird twisted ships propeller according to malcolm the behavior of any system follows the surface of the propeller you with me not exactly gennaro said arnold held his hand in the air lets say i put a drop of water on the back of my hand that drop is going to run off my hand maybe itll run toward my wrist maybe itll run toward my thumb or down between my fingers i dont know for sure where it will go but i know it will run somewhere along the surface of my hand it has to okay gennaro said chaos theory treats the behavior of a whole system like a drop of water moving on a complicated propeller surface the drop may spiral down or slip outward toward the edge it may do many different things depending but it will always move along the surface of the propeller okay malcolms models tend to have a ledge or a sharp incline where the drop of water will speed up greatly he modestly calls this speedingup movement the malcolm effect the whole system could suddenly collapse and that was what he said about jurassic park that it had inherent instability inherent instability gennaro said and what did you do when you got his report we disagreed with it and ignored it of course arnold said was that wise its selfevident arnold said were dealing with living systems after all this is life not computer models in the harsh quartz lights the hypsilophodonts green head hung down out of the sling the tongue dangling the eyes dull careful careful hammond shouted as the crane began to lift harding grunted and eased the head back onto the leather straps he didnt want to impede circulation through the carotid artery the crane hissed as it lifted the animal into the air onto the waiting flatbed truck the hypsy was a small dryosaur seven feet long weighing about five hundred pounds she was dark green with mottled brown spots she was breathing slowly but she seemed all right harding had shot her a few moments before with the tranquilizer gun and apparently he had guessed the correct dose there was always a tense moment dosing these big animals too little and they would run off into the forest collapsing where you couldnt get to them too much and they went into terminal cardiac arrest this one had taken a single bounding leap and keeled over perfectly dosed watch it easy hammond was shouting to the workmen mr hammond harding said please well they should be careful they are being careful harding said he climbed up onto the back of the flatbed as the hypsy came down and he set her into the restraining harness harding slipped on the cardiogram collar that monitored heartbeat then picked up the big electronic thermometer the size of a turkey baster and slipped it into the rectum it beeped degrees how is she hammond asked fretfully shes fine harding said shes only dropped a degree and a half thats too much hammond said too deep you dont want her waking up and jumping off the truck harding snapped before coming to the park harding had been the chief of veterinary medicine at the san diego zoo and the worlds leading expert on avian care he flew all over the world consulting with zoos in europe india and japan on the care of exotic birds hed had no interest when this peculiar little man showed up offering him a position in a private game park but when he learned what hammond had done it was impossible to pass up harding had an academic bent and the prospect of writing the first textbook of veterinary internal medicine diseases of dinosauria was compelling in the late twentieth century veterinary medicine was scientifically advanced the best zoos ran clinics little different from hospitals new textbooks were merely refinements of old for a worldclass practitioner there were no worlds left to conquer but to be the first to care for a whole new class of animals that was something and harding had never regretted his decision he had developed considerable expertise with these animals and he didnt want to hear from hammond now the hypsy snorted and twitched she was still breathing shallowly there was no ocular reflex yet but it was time to get moving all aboard harding shouted lets get this girl back to her paddock living systems arnold said are not like mechanical systems living systems are never in equilibrium they are inherently unstable they may seem stable but theyre not everything is moving and changing in a sense everything is on the edge of collapse gennaro was frowning but lots of things dont change body temperature doesnt change all kinds of other body temperature changes constantly arnold said constantly it changes cyclically over twentyfour hours lowest in the morning highest in the afternoon it changes with mood with disease with exercise with outside temperature with food it continuously fluctuates up and down tiny jiggles on a graph because at any moment some forces are pushing temperature up and other forces are pulling it down it is inherently unstable and every other aspect of living systems is like that too so youre saying malcolms just another theoretician arnold said sitting in his office he made a nice mathematical model and it never occurred to him that what he saw as defects were actually necessities look when i was working on missiles we dealt with something called resonant yaw resonant yaw meant that even though a missile was only slightly unstable off the pad it was hopeless it was inevitably going to go out of control and it couldnt be brought back thats a feature of mechanical systems a little wobble can get worse until the whole system collapses but those same little wobbles are essential to a living system they mean the system is healthy and responsive malcolm never understood that are you sure he didnt understand that he seems pretty clear on the difference between living and nonliving look arnold said the proof is right here he pointed to the screens in less than an hour he said the park will all be back on line the only thing ive got left to clear is the telephones for some reason theyre still out but everything else will be working and thats not theoretical thats a fact the needle went deep into the neck and harding injected the medrine into the anesthetized female dryosaur as she lay on her side on the ground immediately the animal began to recover snorting and kicking her powerful hind legs back everybody harding said scrambling away get back the dinosaur staggered to her feet standing drunkenly she shook her lizard head stared at the people standing back in the quartz lights and blinked shes drooling hammond said worried temporary harding said itll stop the dryosaur coughed and then moved slowly across the field away from the lights why isnt she hopping she will harding said itll take her about an hour to recover fully shes fine he turned back to the car okay boys lets go deal with the stego muldoon watched as the last of the stakes was pounded into the ground the lines were pulled taut and the protocarpus tree was lifted clear muldoon could see the blackened charred streaks on the silver fence where the short had occurred at the base of the fence several ceramic insulators had burst they would have to be replaced but before that could be done arnold would to have to shut down all the fences control this is muldoon were ready to begin repair all right arnold said shutting out your section now muldoon glanced at his watch somewhere in the distance he heard soft hooting it sounded like owls but he knew it was the dilophosaurs he went over to ramon and said lets finish this up i want to get to those other sections of fence an hour went by donald gennaro stared at the glowing map in the control room as the spots and numbers flickered and changed whats happening now arnold worked at the console im trying to get the phones back so we can call about malcolm no i mean out there arnold glanced up at the board it looks as if theyre about done with the animals and the two sections just as i told you the park is back in band with no catastrophic malcolm effect in fact theres just that third section of fence arnold it was muldoons voice yes have you seen this bloody fence just a minute on one of the monitors gennaro saw a high angle down on a field of grass blowing in the wind in the distance was a low concrete roof thats the sauropod maintenance building arnold explained its one of the utility structures we use for equipment feed storage and so on we have them all around the park in each of the paddocks on the monitor the video image panned were turning the camera now to get a look at the fence gennaro saw a shining wall of metallic mesh in the light one section had been trampled knocked flat muldoons jeep and work crew were there huh arnold said looks like the rex went into the sauropod paddock muldoon said fine dining tonight well have to get him out of there arnold said with what muldoon said we havent got anything to use on a rex ill fix this fence but im not going in there until daylight hammond wont like it well discuss it when i get back muldoon said how many sauropods will the rex kill hammond said pacing around the control room probably just one harding said sauropods are big the rex can feed off a single kill for several days we have to go out and get him tonight hammond said muldoon shook his head im not going in there until daylight hammond was rising up and down on the balls of his feet the way he did whenever he was angry are you forgetting you work for me no mr hammond im not forgetting but thats a fullgrown adult tyrannosaur out there how do you plan to get him we have tranquilizer guns we have tranquilizer guns that shoot a twentycc dart muldoon said fine for an animal that weighs four or five hundred pounds that tyrannosaur weighs eight tons it wouldnt even feel it you ordered a larger weapon i ordered three larger weapons mr hammond but you cut the requisition so we got only one and its gone nedry took it when he left that was pretty stupid who let that happen nedrys not my problem mr hammond muldoon said youre saying hammond said that as of this moment there is no way to stop the tyrannosaur thats exactly what im saying muldoon said thats ridiculous hammond said its your park mr hammond you didnt want anybody to be able to injure your precious dinosaurs well now youve got a rex in with the sauropods and theres not a damned thing you can do about it he left the room just a minute hammond said hurrying after him gennaro stared at the screens and listened to the shouted argument in the hallway outside he said to arnold i guess you dont have control of the park yet after all dont kid yourself arnold said lighting another cigarette we have the park itll be dawn in a couple of hours we may lose a couple of dinos before we get the rex out of there but believe me we have the park dawn grant was awakened by a loud grinding sound followed by a mechanical clanking he opened his eyes and saw a bale of bay rolling past him on a conveyor belt up toward the ceiling two more bales followed it then the clanking stopped as abruptly as it had begun and the concrete building was silent again grant yawned he stretched sleepily winced in pain and sat up soft yellow light came through the side windows it was morning he had slept the whole night he looked quickly at his watch am still almost six hours to go before the boat had to be recalled he rolled onto his back groaning his head throbbed and his body ached as if he had been beaten up from around the corner he heard a squeaking sound like a rusty wheel and then lex giggling grant stood slowly and looked at the building now that it was daylight he could see it was some kind of a maintenance building with stacks of hay and supplies on the wall he saw a gray metal box and a stenciled sign sauropod maintenance bldg this must be the sauropod paddock as he had thought he opened the box and saw a telephone but when he lifted the receiver he heard only hissing static apparently the phones werent working yet chew your food lex was saying dont be a piggy ralph grant walked around the corner and found lex by the bars holding out handfuls of bay to an animal outside that looked like a large pink pig and was making the squeaking sounds grant had heard it was actually an infant triceratops about the size of a pony the infant didnt have horns on its head yet just a curved bony frill behind big soft eyes it poked its snout through the bars toward lex its eyes watching her as she fed it more hay thats better lex said theres plenty of hay dont worry she patted the baby on the head you like hay dont you ralph lex turned back and saw him this is ralph lex said hes my friend he likes hay grant took a step and stopped wincing you look pretty bad lex said i feel pretty bad tim too his nose is all swollen up where is tim peeing she said you want to help me feed ralph the baby triceratops looked at grant hay stuck out of both sides of its mouth dropping on the floor as it chewed hes a very messy eater lex said and hes very hungry the baby finished chewing and licked its lips it opened its mouth waiting for more grant could see the slender sharp teeth and the beaky upper jaw like a parrot okay just a minute lex said scooping up more straw from the concrete floor honestly ralph she said youd think your mother never fed you why is his name ralph because he looks like ralph at school grant came closer and touched the skin of the neck gently its okay you can pet him lex said he likes it when you pet him dont you ralph the skin felt dry and warm with the pebbled texture of a football ralph gave a little squeak as grant petted it outside the bars its thick tail swung back and forth with pleasure hes pretty tame ralph looked from lex to grant as it ate and showed no sign of fear it reminded grant that the dinosaurs didnt have ordinary responses to people maybe i can ride him lex said lets not i bet hed let me lex said itd be fun to ride a dinosaur grant looked out the bars past the animal to the open fields of the sauropod compound it was growing lighter every minute he should go outside he thought and set off one of the motion sensors on the field above after all it might take the people in the control room an hour to get out here to him and he didnt like the idea that the phones were still down he heard a deep snorting sound like the snort of a very large horse and suddenly the baby became agitated it tried to pull its head back through the bars but got caught on the edge of its frill and it squeaked in fright tle snorting came again it was closer this time ralph reared up on its hind legs frantic to get out from between the bars it wriggled its head back and forth rubbing against the bars ralph take it easy lex said push him out grant said he reached up to ralphs head and leaned against it pushing the animal sideways and backward the frill popped free and the baby fell outside the bars losing its balance and flopping on its side then the baby was covered in shadow and a huge leg came into view thicker than a tree trunk the foot had five curved toenails like an elephants ralph looked up and squeaked a head came down into view six feet long with three long white horns one above each of the large brown eyes and a smaller horn at the tip of the nose it was a fullgrown triceratops the big animal peered at lex and grant blinking slowly and then turned its attention to ralph a tongue came out and licked the baby ralph squeaked and rubbed up against the big leg happily is that his mom lex said looks like it grant said should we feed the mom too lex said but the big triceratops was already nudging ralph with her snout pushing the baby away from the bars guess not the infant turned away from the bars and walked off from time to time the big mother nudged her baby guiding it away as they both walked out into the fields goodbye ralph lex said waving tim came out of the shadows of the building tell you what grant said im going up on the hill to set off the motion sensors so theyll know to come get us you two stay here and wait for me no lex said why stay here its safe here youre not leaving us she said right timmy right tim said okay grant said they crawled through the bars stepping outside it was just before dawn the air was warm and humid the sky soft pink and purple a white mist clung low to the ground some distance away they saw the mother triceratops and the baby moving away toward a herd of large duckbilled hadrosaurs eating foliage from trees at the edge of the lagoon some of the hadrosaurs stood kneedeep in the water they drank lowering their flat heads meeting their own reflections in the still water then they looked up again their heads swiveling at the waters edge one of the babies ventured out squeaked and scrambled back while the adults watched indulgently farther south other hadrosaurs were eating the lower vegetation sometimes they reared up on their hind legs resting their forelegs on the tree trunks so they could reach the leaves on higher branches and in the far distance a giant apatosaur stood above the trees the tiny head swiveling on the long neck the scene was so peaceful grant found it bard to imagine any danger yew lex shouted ducking two giant red dragonflies with sixfoot wingspans bummed past them what was that dragonflies he said the jurassic was a time of huge insects do they bite lex said i dont think so grant said tim held out his band one of the dragonflies lighted on it he could feel the weight of the huge insect hes going to bite you lex warned but the dragonfly just slowly flapped its redveined transparent wings and then when tim moved his arm flew off again which way do we go lex said there they started walking across the field they reached a black box mounted on a heavy metal tripod the first of the motion sensors grant stopped and waved his band in front of it back and forth but nothing happened if the phones didnt work perhaps the sensors didnt work either well try another one he said pointing across the field somewhere in the distance they heard the roar of a large animal ah hell arnold said i just cant find it he sipped coffee and stared blearyeyed at the screens he had taken all the video monitors off line in the control room he was searching the computer code he was exhausted hed been working for twelve straight hours he turned to wu who had come up from the lab find what the phones are still out i cant get them back on i think nedry did something to the phones wu lifted one phone heard hissing sounds like a modem but its not arnold said because i went down into the basement and shut off all the modems what youre hearing is just white noise that sounds like a modem transmitting so the phone lines are jammed basically yes nedry jammed them very well hes inserted some kind of a lockout into the program code and now i cant find it because i gave that restore command which erased part of the program listings but apparently the command to shut off the phones is still resident in the computer memory wu shrugged so just reset shut the system down and youll clear memory ive never done it before arnold said and im reluctant to do it maybe all the systems will come back on startupbut maybe they wont im not a computer expert and neither are you not really and without an open phone line we cant talk to anybody who is if the command is ramresident it wont show up in the code you can do a ram dump and search that but you dont know what youre searching for i think all you can do is reset gennaro stormed in we still dont have any telephones working on it youve been working on it since midnight and malcolm is worse he needs medical attention it means ill have to shut down arnold said i cant be sure everything will come back on gennaro said look theres a sick man over in that lodge he needs a doctor or hell die you cant call for a doctor unless you have a phone four people have probably died already now shut down and get the phones working arnold hesitated well gennaro said well its just the safety systems dont allow the computer to be shut down and then turn the goddamn safety systems off cant you get it through your head that hes going to die unless he gets help okay arnold said he got up and went to the main panel he opened the doors and uncovered the metal swinglatches over the safety switches he popped them off one after another you asked for it arnold said and you got it he threw the master switch the control room was dark all the monitors were black the three men stood there in the dark how long do we have to wait gennaro said thirty seconds arnold said pu lex said as they crossed the field what grant said that smell lex said it stinks like rotten garbage grant hesitated he stared across the field toward the distant trees looking for movement he saw nothing there was hardly a breeze to stir the branches it was peaceful and silent in the early morning i think its your imagination he said is not then he heard the honking sound it came from the herd of duckbilled hadrosaurs behind them first one animal then another and another until the whole herd had taken up the honking cry the duckbills were agitated twisting and turning hurrying out of the water circling the young ones to protect them they smell it too grant thought with a roar the tyrannosaur burst from the trees fifty yards away near the lagoon it rushed out across the open field with huge strides it ignored them heading toward the herd of hadrosaurs i told you lex screamed nobody listens to me in the distance the duckbills were honking and starting to run grant could feel the earth shake beneath his feet come on kids he grabbed lex lifting her bodily off the ground and ran with tim through the grass he had glimpses of the tyrannosaur down by the lagoon lunging at the hadrosaurs which swung their big tails in defense and bonked loudly and continuously he heard the crashing of foliage and trees and when he looked over again the duckbills were charging in the darkened control room arnold checked his watch thirty seconds the memory should be cleared by now he pushed the main power switch back on nothing happened arnolds stomach heaved he pushed the switch off then on again still nothing happened he felt sweat on his brow whats wrong gennaro said oh hell arnold said then he remembered you had to turn the safety swiitches back on before you restarted the power he flipped on the three safeties and covered them again with the latch covers then he held his breath and turned the main power switch the room lights came on the computer beeped the screens hummed thank god arnold said he hurried to the main monitor there were rows of labels on the screen picture gennaro reached for the phone but it was dead no static hissing this timejust nothing at all whats this give me a second arnold said after a reset all the system modules have to be brought on line manually quickly he went back to work why manually gennaro said will you just let me work for christs sake wu said the system is not intended to ever shut down so if it does shut down it assumes that there is a problem somewhere it requires you to start up everything manually otherwise if there were a short somewhere the system would start up short out start up again short out again in an endless cycle okay arnold said were going gennaro picked up the phone and started to dial when he suddenly stopped jesus look at that he said he pointed to one of the video monitors but arnold wasnt listening he was staring at the map where a tight cluster of dots by the lagoon had started to move in a coordinated way moving fast in a kind of swirl whats happening gennaro said the duckbills arnold said tonelessly theyve stampeded the duckbills charged with surprising speed their enormous bodies in a tight cluster honking and roaring the infants squealing and trying to stay out from underfoot the herd raised a great cloud of yellow dust grant couldnt see the tyrannosaur the duckbills were running right toward them still carrying lex he ran with tim toward a rocky outcrop with a stand of big conifers they ran hard feeling the ground shake beneath their feet the sound of the approaching herd was deafening like the sound of jets at an airport it filled the air and hurt their ears lex was shouting something but he couldnt hear what she was saying and as they scrambled onto the rocks the herd closed in around them grant saw the immense legs of the first hadrosaurs that charged past each animal weighing five tons and then they were enveloped in a cloud so dense he could see nothing at all he had the impression of huge bodies giant limbs bellowing cries of pain as the animals wheeled and circled one duckbill struck a boulder and it rolled past them out into the field beyond in the dense cloud of dust they could see almost nothing beyond the rocks they clung to the boulders listening to the screams and honks the menacing roar of the tyrannosaur lex dug her fingers into grants shoulder another hadrosaur slammed its big tail against the rocks leaving a splash of hot blood grant waited until the sounds of the fighting had moved off to the left and then he pushed the kids to start climbing the largest tree they climbed swiftly feeling for the branches as the animals stampeded all around them in the dust they went up twenty feet and then lex clutched at grant and refused to go farther tim was tired too and grant thought they were high enough through the dust they could see the broad backs of the animals below as they wheeled and bonked grant propped himself against the coarse bark of the trunk coughed in the dust closed his eyes and waited arnold adjusted the camera as the herd moved away the dust slowly cleared he saw that the hadrosaurs had scattered and the tyrannosaur had stopped running which could only mean it had made a kill the tyrannosaur was now near the lagoon arnold looked at the video monitor and said better get muldoon to go out there and see how bad it is ill get him gennaro said and left the room the park a faint crackling sound like a fire in a fireplace something warm and wet tickled grants ankle he opened his eyes and saw an enormous beige head the head tapered to a flat mouth shaped like the bill of a duck the eyes protruding above the flat duckbill were gentle and soft like a cows the duck mouth opened and chewed branches on the limb where grant was sitting he saw large flat teeth in the check the warm lips touched his ankle again as the animal chewed a duckbilled hadrosaur he was astonished to see it up close not that he was afraid all the species of duckbilled dinosaurs were herbivorous and this one acted exactly like a cow even though it was huge its manner was so calm and peaceful grant didnt feel threatened he stayed where he was on the branch careful not to move and watched as it ate the reason grant was astonished was that he had a proprietary feeling about this animal it was probably a maiasaur from the late cretaceous in montana with john horner grant had been the first to describe the species maiasaurs had an upcurved lip which gave them the appearance of smiling the name meant good mother lizard maiasaurs were thought to protect their eggs until the babies were born and could take care of themselves grant heard an insistent chirping and the big head swung down he moved just enough to see the baby hadrosaur scampering around the feet of the adult the baby was dark beige with black spots the adult bent her head low to the ground and waited unmoving while the baby stood up on its hind legs resting its front legs on the mothers jaw and ate the branches that protruded from the side of the mothers mouth the mother waited patiently until the baby had finished eating and dropped back down to all fours again then the big head came back up toward grant the hadrosaur continued to eat just a few feet from him grant looked at the two elongated airholes on top of the flat upper bill apparently the dinosaur couldnt smell grant and even though the left eye was looking right at him for some reason the hadrosaur didnt react to him he remembered how the tyrannosaur had failed to see him the previous night grant decided on an experiment he coughed instantly the hadrosaur froze the big head suddenly still the jaws no longer chewing only the eye moved looking for the source of the sound then after a moment when there seemed to be no danger the animal resumed chewing amazing grant thought sitting in his arms lex opened her eyes and said hey whats that the hadrosaur trumpeted in alarm a loud resonant bonk that so startled lex that she nearly fell out of the tree the hadrosaur pulled its head away from the branch and trumpeted again dont make her mad tim said from the branch above the baby chirped and scurried beneath the mothers legs as the hadrosaur stepped away from the tree the mother cocked her head and peered inquisitively at the branch where grant and lex were sitting with its upturned smiling lips the dinosaur had a comical appearance is it dumb lex said no grant said you just surprised her well lex said is she going to let us get down or what the hadrosaur had backed ten feet away from the tree she bonked again grant had the impression she was trying to frighten them away but the dinosaur didnt really seem to know what to do she acted confused and uneasy they waited in silence and after a minute the hadrosaur approached the branch again jaws moving in anticipation she was clearly going to resume eating forget it lex said im not staying here she started to climb down the branches at her movement the hadrosaur trumpeted in fresh alarm grant was amazed he thought it really cant see us when we dont move and after a minute it literally forgets that were here this was just like the tyrannosauranother classic example of an amphibian visual cortex studies of frogs had shown that amphibians only saw moving things like insects if something didnt move they literally didnt see it the same thing seemed to be true of dinosaurs in any case the maiasaur now seemed to find these strange creatures climbing down the tree too upsetting with a final honk she nudged her baby and lumbered slowly away she paused once and looked back at them then continued on they reached the ground lex shook herself off both children were covered in a layer of fine dust all around them the grass had been flattened there were streaks of blood and a sour smell grant looked at his watch we better get going kids he said not me lex said im not walking out there any more we have to why because grant said we have to tell them about the boat since they cant seem to see us on the motion sensors we have to go all the way back ourselves its the only way why cant we take the raft tim said what raft tim pointed to the low concrete maintenance building with the bars where they had spent the night it was twenty yards away across the field i saw a raft back there he said grant immediately understood the advantages it was now seven oclock in the morning they had at least eight miles to go if they could take a raft along the river they would make much faster progress than going overland lets do it grant said arnold punched the visual search mode and watched as the monitors began to scan throughout the park the images changing every two seconds it was tiring to watch but it was the fastest way to find nedrys jeep and muldoon had been adamant about that he had gone out with gennaro to look at the stampede but now that it was daylight he wanted the car found he wanted the weapons his intercom clicked mr arnold may i have a word with you please it was hammond he sounded like the voice of god you want to come here mr hammond no mr arnold hammond said come to me im in the genetics lab with dr wu well be waiting for you arnold sighed and stepped away from the screens grant stumbled deep in the gloomy recesses of the building he pushed past fivegallon containers of herbicide treepruning equipment spare tires for a jeep coils of cyclone fencing hundredpound fertilizer bags stacks of brown ceramic insulators empty motoroil cans work lights and cables i dont see any raft keep going bags of cement lengths of copper pipe green mesb and two plastic oars bung on clips on the concrete wall okay he said but wheres the raft it must be here somewhere tim said you never saw a raft no i just assumed it was here poking among the junk grant found no raft but he did find a set of plans rolled up and speckled with mold from humidity stuck back in a metal cabinet on the wall he spread the plans on the floor brushing away a big spider he looked at them for a long time im hungry just a minute they were detailed topographical charts for the main area of the island where they now were according to this the lagoon narrowed into the river they had seen earlier which twisted northward right through the aviary and on to within a halfmile of the visitor lodge he flipped back through the pages how to get to the lagoon according to the plans there should be a door at the back of the building they were in grant looked up and saw it recessed back in the concrete wall the door was wide enough for a car opening it he saw a paved road running straight down toward the lagoon the road was dug below ground level so it couldnt be seen from above it must be another service road and it led to a dock at the edge of the lagoon and clearly stenciled on the dock was raft storage hey tim said look at this he held out a metal case to grant opening it grant found a compressedair pistol and a cloth belt that held darts there were six darts in all each as thick as his finger labeled moro good work tim he slung the belt around his shoulder and stuck the gun in his trousers is it a tranquilizer gun id say so what about the boat lex said i think its on the dock grant said they started down the road grant carried the oars on his shoulder i hope its a big raft lex said because i cant swim dont worry he said maybe we can catch some fish she said they walked down the road with the sloping embankment rising up on both sides of them they heard a deep rhythmic snorting sound but grant could not see where it was coming from are you sure theres a raft down here lex said wrinkling her nose probably grant said the rhythmic snorting became louder as they walked but they also heard a steady droning buzzing sound when they reached the end of the road at the edge of the small concrete dock grant froze in shock the tyrannosaur was right there it was sitting upright in the shade of a tree its hind legs stretched out in front its eyes were open but it was not moving except for its head which lifted and fell gently with each snorting sound the buzzing came from the clouds of flies that surrounded it crawling over its face and slack jaws its bloody fangs and the red haunch of a killed hadrosaur that lay on its side behind the tyrannosaur the tyrannosaur was only twenty yards away grant felt sure it must have seen him but the big animal did not respond it just sat there it took him a moment to realize the tyrannosaur was asleep sitting up but asleep he signaled to tim and lex to stay where they were grant walked slowly forward onto the dock in full view of the tyrannosaur the big animal continued to sleep snoring softly near the end of the dock a wooden shed was painted green to blend with the foliage grant quietly unlatched the door and looked inside he saw a halfdozen orange life vests hanging on the wall several rolls of wiremesh fencing some coils of rope and twob ig rubber cubes sitting on the floor the cubes were strapped tight with flat rubber belts rafts he looked back at lex she mouthed no boat he nodded yes the tyrannosaur raised its forelimb to swipe at the flies buzzing around its snout but otherwise it did not move grant pulled one of the cubes out onto the dock it was surprisingly heavy he freed the straps found the inflation cylinder with a loud hiss the rubber began to expand and then with a hisswhap it popped fully open on the dock the sound was fearfully loud in their ears grant turned stared up at the dinosaur the tyrannosaur grunted and snorted it began to move grant braced himself to run but the animal shifted its ponderous bulk and then it settled back against the tree trunk and gave a long growling belch lex looked disgusted waving her hand in front of her face grant was soaked in sweat from the tension he dragged the rubber raft across the dock it flopped into the water with a loud splash the dinosaur continued to sleep grant tied the boat up to the dock and returned to the shed to take out two life preservers he put these in the boat and then waved for the kids to come out onto the dock pale with fear lex waved back no he gestured yes the tyrannosaur continued to sleep grant stabbed in the air with an emphatic finger lex came silently and he gestured for her to get into the raft then tim got in and they both put on their life vests grant got in and pushed off the raft drifted silently out into the lagoon grant picked up his paddles and fitted them into the oarlocks they moved farther from the dock lex sat back and sighed loudly with relief then she looked stricken and put her band over her mouth her body shook with muffled sounds she was suppressing a cough she always coughed at the wrong times lex tim whispered fiercely looking back toward the shore she shook her head miserably and pointed to her throat he knew what she meant a tickle in her throat what she needed was a drink of water grant was rowing and tim leaned over the side of the raft and scooped his hand in the lagoon holding his cupped hand toward her lex coughed loudly explosively in tims ears the sound echoed across the water like a gunshot the tyrannosaur yawned lazily and scratched behind its ear with its hind foot just like a dog it yawned again it was groggy after its big meal and it woke up slowly on the boat lex was making little gargling sounds lex shut up tim said i cant help it she whispered and then she coughed again grant rowed hard moving the raft powerfully into the center of the lagoon on the shore the tyrannosaur stumbled to its feet i couldnt help it timmy lex shrieked miserably i couldnt help it shhhh grant was rowing as fast as he could anyway it doesnt matter she said were far enough away he cant swim of course he can swim you little idiot tim shouted at her on the shore the tyrannosaur stepped off the dock and plunged into the water it moved strongly into the lagoon after them well how should i know she said everybody knows tyrannosaurs can swim its in all the books anyway all reptiles can swim snakes cant of course snakes can you idiot settle down grant said hold on to something grant was watching the tyrannosaur noticing how the animal swam the tyrannosaur was now chestdeep in the water but it could hold its big head high above the surface then grant realized the animal wasnt swimming it was walking because moments later only the very top of the headthe eyes and nostrilsprotruded above the surface by then it looked like a crocodile and it swam like a crocodile swinging its big tail back and forth so the water churned behind it behind the head grant saw the hump of the back and the ridges along the length of tail as it occasionally broke the surface exactly like a crocodile he thought unhappily the biggest crocodile in the world im sorry dr grant lex wailed i didnt mean it grant glanced over his shoulder the lagoon was no more than a hundred yards wide here and they had almost reached the center if he continued the water would become shallow again the tyrannosaur would be able to walk again and he would move faster in shallow water grant swung the boat around and began to row north what are you doing the tyrannosaur was now just a few yards away grant could hear its sharp snorting breaths as it came closer grant looked at the paddles in his hands but they were light plasticnot weapons at all the tyrannosaur threw its head back and opened its jaws wide showing rows of curved teeth and then in a great muscular spasm lunged forward to the raft just missing the rubber gunwale the huge skull slapping down the raft rocking away on the crest of the splash the tyrannosaur sank below the surface leaving gurgling bubbles the lagoon was still lex gripped the gunwale handles and looked back did he drown no grant said he saw bubblesthen a faint ripple along the surfacecoming toward the boat hang on he shouted as the head bucked up beneath the rubber bending the boat and lifting it into the air spinning them crazily before it splashed down again do something alexis screamed do something grant pulled the air pistol out of his belt it looked pitifully small in his hands but there was the chance that if he shot the animal in a sensitive spot in the eye or the nose the tyrannosaur surfaced beside the boat opened its jaws and roared grant aimed and fired the dart flashed in the light and smacked into the cheek the tyrannosaur shook its head and roared again and suddenly they heard an answering roar floating across the water toward them looking back grant saw the juvenile trex on the shore crouched over the killed sauropod claiming the kill as its own the juvenile slashed at the carcass then raised its head high and bellowed the big tyrannosaur saw it too and the response was immediateit turned back to protect its kill swimming strongly toward the shore hes going away lex squealed clapping her hands hes going away naahnaahnananaah stupid dinosaur from the shore the juvenile roared defiantly enraged the big tyrannosaur burst from the lagoon at full speed water streaming from its enormous body as it raced up the hill past the dock the juvenile ducked its head and fled its jaws still filled with ragged flesh the big tyrannosaur chased it racing past the dead sauropod disappearing over the hill they heard its final threatening bellow and then the raft moved to the north around a bend in the lagoon to the river exhausted from rowing grant collapsed back his chest heaving he couldnt catch his breath he lay gasping in the raft are you okay dr grant lex asked from now on will you just do what i tell you ohkay she sighed as if he had just made the most unreasonable demand in the world she trailed her arm in the water for a while you stopped rowing she said im tired grant said then how come were still moving grant sat up she was right the raft drifted steadily north there must be a current the current was carrying them north toward the hotel he looked at his watch and was astonished to see it was fifteen minutes past seven only fifteen minutes had passed since he had last looked at his watch it seemed like two hours grant lay back against the rubber gunwales closed his eyes and slept fifth iteration flaws in the system will now become severe ian malcom search gennaro sat in the jeep and listened to the buzzing of the flies and stared at the distant palm trees wavering in the heat he was astonished by what looked like a battleground the grass was trampled flat for a hundred yards in every direction one big palm tree was uprooted from the ground there were great washes of blood in the grass and on the rocky outcropping to their right sitting beside him muldoon said no doubt about it rexys been among the hadrosaurs he took another drink of whiskey and capped the bottle damn lot of flies he said they waited and watched gennaro drummed his fingers on the dashboard what are we waiting for muldoon didnt answer immediately the rex is out there somewhere he said squinting at the landscape in the morning sun and we dont have any weapons worth a damn were in a jeep oh he can outrun the jeep mr gennaro muldoon said shaking his head once we leave this road and go onto open terrain the best we can do in a fourwheel drive is thirty forty miles an hour hell run us right down no problem for him muldoon sighed but i dont see much moving out there now you ready to live dangerously sure gennaro said muldoon started the engine and at the sudden sound two small othnielians leapt up from the matted grass directly ahead muldoon put the car in gear he drove in a wide circle around the trampled site and then moved inward driving in decreasing concentric circles until he finally came to the place in the field where the little othnielians had been then he got out and walked forward in the grass away from the jeep he stopped as a dense cloud of flies lifted into the air what is it gennaro called bring the radio muldoon said gennaro climbed out of the jeep and hurried forward even from a distance he could smell the soursweet odor of early decay he saw a dark shape in the grass crusted with blood legs askew young hadrosaur muldoon said staring down at the carcass the whole herd stampeded and the young one got separated and the trex brought it down how do you know gennaro said the flesh was ragged from many bites you can tell from the excreta muldoon said see those chalky white bits there in the grass thats hadro spoor uric acid makes it white but you look therehe pointed to a large mound rising kneehigh in the grassthats tyrannosaur spoor how do you know the tyrannosaur didnt come later the bite pattern muldoon said see those little ones there he pointed along the belly those are from the othys those bites havent bled theyre postmortem from scavengers othys did that but the hadro was brought down by a bite on the neckyou see the big slash there above the shoulder bladesand thats the trex no question gennaro bent over the carcass staring at the awkward trampled limbs with a sense of unreality beside him muldoon flicked on his radio control yes john arnold said over the radio we got another hadro dead juvenile muldoon bent down among the flies and checked the skin on the sole of the right foot a number was tattooed there specimen is number hd the radio crackled ive got something for you arnold said oh whats that i found nedry the jeep burst through the line of palm trees along the east road and came out into a narrower service road leading toward the jungle river it was hot in this area of the park the jungle close and fetid around them muldoon was fiddling with the computer monitor in the jeep which now showed a map of the resort with overlaid grid lines they found him up on remote video he said sector is just ahead farther up the road gennaro saw a concrete barrier and the jeep parked alongside it he must have taken the wrong turnoff muldoon said the little bastard whatd he take gennaro asked wu says fifteen embryos know what thats worth gennaro shook his head somewhere between two and ten million muldoon said he shook his head big stakes as they came closer gennaro saw the body lying beside the car the body was indistinct and greenbut then green shapes scattered away as the jeep pulled to a stop compys muldoon said the compys found him a dozen procompsognathids delicate little predators no larger than ducks stood at the edge of the jungle chittering excitedly as the men climbed out of the car dennis nedry lay on his back the chubby boyish face now red and bloated flies buzzed around the gaping mouth and thick tongue his body was mangledthe intestines torn open one leg chewed through gennaro turned away quickly to look at the little compys which squatted on their hind legs a short distance away and watched the men curiously the little dinosaurs had fivefingered hands he noticed they wiped their faces and chins giving them an eerily human quality which ill be damned muldoon said wasnt the compys what muldoon was shaking his head see these blotches on his shirt and his face smell that sweet smell like old dried vomit gennaro rolled his eyes he smelled it thats dilo saliva muldoon said spit from the dilophosaurs you see the damage on the corneas all that redness in the eyes its painful but not fatal youve got about two hours to wash it out with the antivenin we keep it all around the park just in case not that it mattered to this bastard they blinded him then ripped him down the middle not a nice way to go maybe theres justice in the world after all the procompsognatbids squeaked and hopped up and down as gennaro opened the back door and took out gray metal tubing and a stainlesssteel case its all still there he said he handed two dark cylinders to gennaro whatre these gennaro said just what they look like muldoon said rockets as gennaro backed away he said watch ityou dont want to step in something gennaro stepped carefully over nedrys body muldoon carried the tubing to the other jeep and placed it in the back he climbed behind the wheel lets go what about him gennaro said pointing to the body what about him muldoon said weve got things to do he put the car in gear looking back gennaro saw the compys resume their feeding one jumped up and squatted on nedrys open mouth as it nibbled the flesh of his nose the jungle river became narrower the banks closed in on both sides until the trees and foliage overhanging the banks met high above to block out the sun tim heard the cry of birds and saw small chirping dinosaurs leaping among the branches but mostly it was silent the air hot and still beneath the canopy of trees grant looked at his watch it was eight oclock they drifted along peacefully among dappled patches of light if anything they seemed to be moving faster than before awake now grant lay on his back and stared up at the branches overhead in the how he saw her reaching up hey wbatre you doing he said you think we can eat these berries she pointed to the trees some of the overhanging branches were close enough to touch tim saw clusters of bright red berries on the branches no grant said why those little dinosaurs are eating them she pointed to small dinosaurs scampering in the branches no lex she sighed dissatisfied with his authority i wish daddy was here she said daddy always knows what to do whatre you talking about tim said he never knows what to do yes he does she sighed lex stared at the trees as they slid past their big roots twisting toward the waters edge just because youre not his favorite tim turned away said nothing but dont worry daddy likes you too even if youre into computers and not sports dads a real sports nut tim explained to grant grant nodded up in the branches small pale yellow dinosaurs barely two feet tall hopped from tree to tree they had beaky heads like parrots you know what they call those tim said microceratops big deal lex said i thought you might be interested only very young boys she said are interested in dinosaurs says who daddy tim started to yell but grant raised his band kids he said shut up why lex said i can do what i want if i then she fell silent because she heard it too it was a bloodcurdling shriek from somewhere downriver well where the hell is the damn rex muldoon said talking into the radio because we dont see him here they were back at the sauropod compound looking out at the trampled grass where the hadrosaurs had stampeded the tyrannosaur was nowhere to be found checking now arnold said and clicked off muldoon turned to gennaro checking now he repeated sarcastically why the hell didnt he check before why didnt he keep track of him i dont know gennaro said hes not showing up arnold said a moment later what do you mean hes not showing up hes not on the monitors motion sensors arent finding him hell muldoon said so much for the motion sensors you see grant and the kids motion sensors arent finding them either well what are we supposed to do now muldoon said wait arnold said look look directly ahead the big dome of the aviary rose above them grant had seen it only from a distance now he realized it was enormousa quarter of a mile in diameter or more the pattern of geodesic struts shone dully through the light mist and his first thought was that the glass must weigh a ton then as they came closer he saw there wasnt any glassjust struts a thin mesh hung inside the elements it isnt finished lex said i think its meant to be open like that grant said then all the birds can fly out not if theyre big birds grant said the river carried them beneath the edge of the dome they stared upward now they were inside the dome still drifting down the river but thin minutes the dome was so high above them that it was hardly visible in the mist grant said i seem to remember theres a second lodge here moments later he saw the roof of a building over the tops of the trees to the north you want to stop tim said maybe theres a phone or motion sensors grant steered toward the shore we need to try to contact the control room its getting late they clambered out slipping on the muddy bank and grant hauled the raft out of the water then he tied the rope to a tree and they set off through a dense forest of palm trees aviary i just dont understand john arnold said speaking into the phone i dont see the rex and i dont see grant and the kids anywhere either he sat in front of the consoles and gulped another cup of coffee all around him the control room was strewn with paper plates and halfeaten sandwiches arnold was exhausted it was am on saturday in the fourteen hours since nedry destroyed the computer that ran jurassic park arnold had patiently pulled systems back on line one after another all the park systems are back and functioning correctly the phones are working ive called for a doctor for you on the other end of the line malcolm coughed arnold was talking to him in his room at the lodge but youre having trouble with the motion sensors well im not finding what i am looking for like the rex hes not reading at all now he started north about twenty minutes ago following along the edge of the lagoon and then i lost him i dont know why unless hes gone to sleep again and you cant find grant and the kids no i think its quite simple malcolm said the motion sensors cover an inadequate area inadequate arnold bristled they cover ninetytwo ninetytwo percent of the land area i remember malcolm said but if you put the remaining areas up on the board i think youll find that the eight percent is topologically unified meaning that those areas are contiguous in essence an animal can move freely anywhere in the park and escape detection by following a maintenance road or the jungle river or the beaches or whatever even if that were so arnold said the animals are too stupid to know that its not clear how stupid the animals are malcolm said you think thats what grant and the kids are doing arnold said definitely not malcolm said coughing again grants no fool he clearly wants to be detected by you he and the kids are probably waving at every motion sensor in sight but maybe they have other problems we dont know about or maybe theyre on the river i cant imagine theyd be on the river the banks are very narrow its impossible to walk along there would the river bring them all the way back here yes but its not the safest way to go because it passes through the aviary why wasnt the aviary on the tour malcolm said weve had problems setting it up originally the park was intended to have a treetop lodge built high above the ground where visitors could observe the pterodactyls at flight level weve got four dactyls in the aviary nowactually theyre cearadactyls which are big fisheating dactyls what about them well while we finished the lodge we put the dactyls in the aviary to acclimate them but that was a big mistake it turns out our fishhunters are territorial territorial fiercely territorial arnold said they fight among themselves for territoryand theyll attack any other animal that comes into the area theyve marked out attack its impressive arnold said the dactyls glide to the top of the aviary fold up their wings and dive a thirtypound animal will strike a man on the ground like a ton of bricks they were knocking the workmen unconscious cutting them up pretty badly that doesnt injure the dactyls not so far so if those kids are in the aviary theyre not arnold said at least i hope theyre not is that the lodge lex said what a dump beneath the aviary dome pteratops lodge was built high above the ground on big wooden pylons in the middle of a stand of fir trees but the building was unfinished and unpainted the windows were boarded up the trees and the lodge were splattered with broad white streaks i guess they didnt finish it for some reason grant said hiding his disappointment he glanced at his watch come on lets go back to the boat the sun came out as they walked along making the morning more cheerful grant looked at the latticework shadows on the ground from the dome above he noticed that the ground and the foliage were spattered with broad streaks of the same white chalky substance that had been on the building and there was a distinctive sour odor in the morning air stinks here lex said whats all the white stuff looks like reptile droppings probably from the birds how come they didnt finish the lodge i dont know they entered a clearing of low grass dotted with wild flowers they heard a long low whistle then an answering whistle from across the forest whats that i dont know then grant saw the dark shadow of a cloud on the grassy field ahead the shadow was moving fast in moments it had swept over them he looked up and saw an enormous dark shape gliding above them blotting out the sun yew lex said is it a pterodactyl yes tim said grant didnt answer he was entranced by the sight of the huge flying creature in the sky above the pterodactyl gave a low whistle and wheeled gracefully turning back toward them how come theyre not on the tour tim said grant was wondering the same thing the flying dinosaurs were so beautiful so graceful as they moved through the air as grant watched he saw a second pterodactyl appear in the sky and a third and a fourth maybe because they didnt finish the lodge lex said grant was thinking these werent ordinary pterodactyls they were too large they must cearadactyls big flying reptiles from the early cretaceous when they were high these looked like small airplanes when they came lower he could see the animals had fifteenfoot wingspans furry bodies and heads like crocodiles they ate fish he remembered south america and mexico lex shaded her eyes and looked up at the sky can they hurt us i dont think so they eat fish one of the dactyls spiraled down a flashing dark shadow that whooshed past them with a rush of warm air and a lingering sour odor wow lex said theyre really big and then she said are you sure they cant hurt us pretty sure a second dactyl swooped down moving faster than the first it came from behind streaked over their heads grant had a glimpse of its toothy beak and the furry body it looked like a huge bat he thought but grant was impressed with the frail appearance of the animals their huge wingspansthe delicate pink membranes stretched across themso thin they were translucenteverything reinforced the delicacy of the dactyls ow lex shouted grabbing her hair he bit me he what grant said he bit me he bit me when she took her band away he saw blood on her fingers up in the sky two more dactyls folded their wings collapsing into small dark shapes that plummeted toward the ground they made a kind of scream as they hurtled downward come on grant said grabbing their hands they ran across the meadow bearing the approaching scream and he flung himself on the ground at the last moment pulling the kids down with him as the two dactyls whistled and squeaked past them flapping their wings grant felt claws tear the shirt along his back then he was up pulling lex back onto her feet and running with tim a few feet forward while overhead two more birds wheeled and dove toward them screaming at the last moment he pushed the kids to the ground and the big shadows flapped past uck lex said disgusted he saw that she was streaked with white droppings from the birds grant scrambled to his feet come on he was about to run when lex shrieked in terror he turned back and saw that one of the dactyls had grabbed her by the shoulders with its hind claws the animals huge leathery wings translucent in the sunlight flapped broadly on both sides of her the dactyl was trying to take off but lex was too heavy and while it struggled it repeatedly jabbed at her head with its long pointed jaw lex was screaming waving her arms wildly grant did the only thing he could think to do he ran forward and jumped up throwing himself against the body of the dactyl he knocked it onto its back on the ground and fell on top of the furry body the animal screamed and snapped grant ducked his head away from the jaws and pushed back as the giant wings beat around his body it was like being in a tent in a windstorm he couldnt see he couldnt hear there was nothing but the flapping and shrieking and the leathery membranes the clawed legs scratched frantically at his chest lex was screaming grant pushed away from the dactyl and it squeaked and gibbered as it flapped its wings and struggled to turn over to right itself finally it pulled in its wings like a bat and rolled over lifted itself up on its little wing claws and began to walk that way he paused astonished it could walk on its wings lederers speculation was right but then the other dactyls were diving down at them and grant was dizzy off balance and in horror he saw lex run away her arms over her head tim shouting at the top of his lungs the first of them swooped down and she threw something and suddenly the dactyl whistled and climbed the other dactyls immediately climbed and chased the first into the sky the fourth dactyl flapped awkwardly into the air to join the others grant looked upward squinting to see what had happened the three dactyls chased the first screaming angrily they were alone in the field what happened grant said they got my glove lex said my darryl strawberry special they started walking again tim put his arm around her shoulders are you all right of course stupid she said shaking him off she looked upward i hope they choke and die she said yeah tim said me too up ahead they saw the boat on the shore grant looked at his watch it was eightthirty he now had two and a half hours to get back lex cheered as they drifted beyond the silver aviary dome then the banks of the river closed in on both sides the trees meeting overhead once more the river was narrower than ever in some places only ten feet wide and the current flowed very fast lex reached up to touch the branches as they went past grant sat back in the raft and listened to the gurgle of the water through the warm rubber they were moving faster now the branches overhead slipping by more rapidly it was pleasant it gave a little breeze in the hot confines of the overhanging branches and it meant they would get back that much sooner grant couldnt guess how far they had come but it must be several miles at least from the sauropod building where they had spent the night perhaps four or five miles maybe even more that meant they might be only an hours walk from the hotel once they left the raft but after the aviary grant was in no hurry to leave the river again for the moment they were making good time i wonder how ralph is lex said hes probably dead or something im sure hes fine i wonder if hed let me ride him she sighed sleepy in the sun that would be fun to ride ralph tim said to grant remember back at the stegosaurus last night yes how come you asked them about frog dna because of the breeding grant said they cant explain why the dinosaurs are breeding since they irradiate them and since theyre all females right well irradiation is notoriously unreliable and probably doesnt work i think thatll eventually be shown here but there is still the problem of the dinosaurs being female how can they breed when theyre all female right tim said well across the animal kingdom sexual reproduction exists in extraordinary variety tims very interested in sex lex said they both ignored her for example grant said many animals have sexual reproduction without ever having what we would call sex the male releases a spermatophore which contains the sperm and the female picks it up at a later time this kind of exchange does not require quite as much physical differentiation between male and female as we usually think exists male and female are more alike in some animals than they are in human beings tim nodded but what about the frogs grant heard sudden shrieks from the trees above as the microceratopsians scattered in alarm shaking the branches the big head of the tyrannosaur lunged through the foliage from the left the jaws snapping at the raft lex howled in terror and grant paddled away toward the opposite bank but the river here was only ten feet wide the tyrannosaur was caught in the heavy growth it butted and twisted its head and roared then it pulled its head back through the trees that lined the riverbank they saw the huge dark form of the tyrannosaur moving north looking for a gap in the trees that lined the bank the microceratopsians had all gone to the opposite bank where they shrieked and scampered and jumped up and down in the raft grant tim and lex stared helplessly as the tyrannosaur tried to break through again but the trees were too dense along the banks of the river the tyrannosaur again moved downstream ahead of the boat and tried again shaking the branches furiously but again it failed then it moved off heading farther downstream i hate him lex said grant sat back in the boat badly shaken if the tyrannosaur had broken through there was nothing be could have done to save them the river was so narrow that it was hardly wider than the raft it was like being in a tunnel the rubber gunwales often scraped on the mud as the boat was pulled along by the swift current he glanced at his watch almost nine the raft continued downstream hey lex said listen he heard snarling interspersed by a repeated hooting cry the cries were coming from beyond a curve farther downriver he listened and heard the hooting again what is it lex said i dont know grant said but theres more than one of them he paddled the boat to the opposite bank grabbed a branch to stop the raft the snarling was repeated then more hooting it sounds like a bunch of owls tim said malcolm groaned isnt it time for more morphine yet not yet ellie said malcolm sighed how much water have we got here i dont know theres plenty of running water from the tap no i mean how much stored any ellie shrugged none go into the rooms on this floor malcolm said and fill the bathtubs with water ellie frowned also malcolm said have we got any walkietalkies flashlights matches sterno stoves things like that ill look around you planning for an earthquake something like that malcolm said malcolm effect implies catastrophic changes but arnold says all the systems are working perfectly thats when it happens malcolm said ellie said you dont think much of arnold do you hes all right hes an engineer wus the same theyre both technicians they dont have intelligence they have what i call thintelligence they see the immediate situation they think narrowly and they call it being focused they dont see the surround they dont see the consequences thats how you get an island like this from thintelligent thinking because you cannot make an animal and not expect it to act alive to be unpredictable to escape but they dont see that dont you think its just human nature ellie said god no malcolm said thats like saying scrambled eggs and bacon for breakfast is human nature its nothing of the sort its uniquely western training and much of the rest of the world is nauseated by the thought of it he winced in pain the morphines making me philosophical you want some water no ill tell you the problem with engineers and scientists scientists have an elaborate line of bullshit about how they are seeking to know the truth about nature which is true but thats not what drives them nobody is driven by abstractions like seeking truth scientists are actually preoccupied with accomplishment so they are focused on whether they can do something they never stop to ask if they should do something they conveniently define such considerations as pointless if they dont do it someone else will discovery they believe is inevitable so they just try to do it first thats the game in science even pure scientific discovery is an aggressive penetrative act it takes big equipment and it literally changes the world afterward particle accelerators sear the land and leave radioactive byproducts astronauts leave trash on the moon there is always some proof that scientists were there making their discoveries discovery is always a rape of the natural world always the scientists want it that way they have to stick their instruments in they have to leave their mark they cant just watch they cant just appreciate they cant just fit into the natural order they have to make something unnatural happen that is the scientists job and now we have whole societies that try to be scientific he sighed and sank back ellie said dont you think youre overstating what does one of your excavations look like a year later pretty had she admitted you dont replant you dont restore the land after you dig no why not she shrugged theres no money i guess theres only enough money to dig but not to repair well were just working in the badlands just the badlands malcolm said shaking his head just trash just byproducts just side effects im trying to tell you that scientists want it this way they want byproducts and trash and scars and side effects its a way of reassuring themselves its built into the fabric of science and its increasingly a disaster then whats the answer get rid of the thintelligent ones take them out of power but then wed lose all the advances what advances malcolm said irritably the number of hours women devote to housework has not changed since despite all the advances all the vacuum cleaners washerdryers trash compactors garbage disposals washandwear fabrics why does it still take as long to clean the house as it did in ellie said nothing because there havent been any advances malcolm said not really thirty thousand years ago when men were doing cave paintings at lascaux they worked twenty hours a week to provide themselves with food and shelter and clothing the rest of the time they could play or sleep or do whatever they wanted and they lived in a natural world with clean air clean water beautiful trees and sunsets think about it twenty hours a week thirty thousand years ago ellie said you want to turn back the clock no malcolm said i want people to wake up weve had four hundred years of modern science and we ought to know by now what its good for and what its not good for its time for a change before we destroy the planet she said he sighed and closed his eyes oh dear he said thats the last thing i would worry about in the dark tunnel of the jungle river grant went hand over hand holding branches moving the raft cautiously forward he still heard the sounds and finally he saw the dinosaurs arent those the ones that are poison yes grant said dilophosaurus standing on the riverbank were two dilophosaurs the tenfoottall bodies were spotted yellow and black underneath the bellies were bright green like lizards twin red curving crests ran along the top of the head from the eyes to the nose making a v shape above the head the birdlike quality was reinforced by the way they moved bending to drink from the river then rising to snarl and hoot lex whispered should we get out and walk grant shook his head no the dilophosaurs were smaller than the tyrannosaur small enough to slip through the dense foliage at the banks of the river and they seemed quick as they snarled and hooted at each other but we cant get past them in the boat lex said theyre poison we have to grant said somehow the dilophosaurs continued to drink and hoot they seemed to be interacting with each other in a strangely ritualistic repetitive way the animal on the left would bend to drink opening its mouth to bare long rows of sharp teeth and then it would hoot the animal on the right would boot in reply and bend to drink in a mirror image of the first animals movements then the sequence would be repeated exactly the same way grant noticed that the animal on the right was smaller with smaller spots on its back and its crest was a duller red ill be damned he said its a mating ritual can we get past them tim asked not the way they are now theyre right by the edge of the water grant knew animals often performed such mating rituals for hours at a time they went without food they paid attention to nothing else he glanced at his watch ninetwenty what do we do tim said grant sighed i have no idea he sat down in the raft and then the dilopbosaurs began to bonk and roar repeatedly in agitation he looked up the animals were both facing away from the river what is it lex said grant smiled i think were finally getting some help he pushed off from the bank i want you two kids to lie flat on the rubber well go past as fast as we can but just remember whatever happens dont say anything and dont move okay the raft began to drift downstream toward the hooting dilophosaurs it gained speed lex lay at grants feet staring at him with friehtened eyes they were coming closer to the dilophosaurs which were still turned away from the river but he pulled out his air pistol checked the chamber the raft continued on and they smelled a peculiar odor sweet and nauseating at the same time it smelled like dried vomit the hooting of the dilophosaurs was louder the raft came around a final bend and grant caught his breath the dilophosaurs were just a few feet away honking at the trees beyond the river as grant had suspected they were honking at the tyrannosaur the tyrannosaur was trying to break through the foliage and the dilos hooted and stomped their feet in the mud the raft drifted past them the smell was nauseating the tyrannosaur roared probably because it saw the raft but in another moment a thump the raft stopped moving they were aground against the riverbank just a few feet downstream from the dilophosaurs lex whispered oh great there was a long slow scraping sound of the raft against the mud then the raft was moving again they were going down the river the tyrannosaur roared a final time and moved off one dilophosaur looked surprised then hooted the other dilophosaur hooted in reply the raft floated downriver tyrannosaur the jeep bounced along in the glaring sun muldoon was driving with gennaro at his side they were in an open field moving away from the dense line of foliage and palm trees that marked the course of the river a hundred yards to the east they came to a rise and muldoon stopped the car christ its hot he said wiping his forehead with the back of his arm he drank from the bottle of whiskey between his knees then offered it to gennaro gennaro shook his head he stared at the landscape shimmering in the morning heat then he looked down at the onboard computer and video monitor mounted in the dashboard the monitor showed views of the park from remote cameras still no sign of grant and the children or of the tyrannosaur the radio crackled muldoon muldoon picked up the handset yeah you got your onboards i found the rex hes in grid going to just a minute muldoon said adjusting the monitor yeah i got him now following the river the animal was slinking along the foliage that lined the banks of the river going north take it easy with him just immobilize him dont worry muldoon said squinting in the sun i wont hurt him remember arnold said the tyrannosaurs our main tourist attraction muldoon turned off his radio with a crackle of static bloody fool he said theyre still talking about tourists muldoon started the engine lets go see rexy and give him a dose the jeep jolted over the terrain youre looking forward to this gennaro said ive wanted to put a needle in this big bastard for a while muldoon said and there he is they came to a wrenching stop through the windshield gennaro saw the tyrannosaur directly ahead of them moving among the palm trees along the river muldoon drained the whiskey bottle and threw it in the back seat he reached back for his tubing gennaro looked at the video monitor which showed their jeep and the tyrannosaur there must be a closedcircuit camera in the trees somewhere behind you want to help muldoon said you can break out those canisters by your feet gennaro bent over and opened a stainlesssteel halliburton case it was padded inside with foam four cylinders each the size of a quart milk bottle were nestled in the foam they were all labeled moro he took one out you snap off the tip and screw on a needle muldoon explained gennaro found a plastic package of large needles each the diameter of his fingertip he screwed one onto the canister the opposite end of the canister had a circular lead weight thats the plunger compresses on impact muldoon sat forward with the air rifle across his knees it was made of heavy gray tubular metal and looked to gennaro like a bazooka or a rocket launcher whats moro standard animal trank muldoon said zoos around the world use it well try a thousand ccs to start muldoon cracked open the chamber which was large enough to insert his fist he slipped the canister into the chamber and closed it that should do it muldoon said standard elephant gets about two hundred ccs but theyre only two or three tons each tyrannosaurus rex is eight tons and a lot meaner that matters to the dose why animal dose is partly body weight and partly temperament you shoot the same dose of into an elephant a hippo and a rhinoyoull immobilize the elephant so it just stands there like a statue youll slow down the hippo so it gets kind of sleepy but it keeps moving and the rhino will just get fighting mad but on the other hand you chase a rhino for more than five minutes in a car and hell drop dead from adrenaline shock strange combination of tough and delicate muldoon drove slowly toward the river moving closer to the tyrannosaur but those are all mammals we know a lot about handling mammals because zoos are built around the big mammalian attractionslions tigers bears elephants we know a lot less about reptiles and nobody knows anything about dinosaurs the dinosaurs are new animals you consider them reptiles gennaro said no muldoon said shifting gears dinosaurs dont fit existing categories he swerved to avoid a rock actually what we find is the dinosaurs were as variable as mammals are today some dinos are tame and cute and some are mean and nasty some of them see well and some of them dont some of them are stupid and some of them are very very intelligent like the raptors gennaro said muldoon nodded raptors are smart very smart believe me all the problems we have so far he said are nothing compared with what wed have if the raptors ever got out of their holding pen ah i think this is as close as we can get to our rexy up ahead the tyrannosaur was poking its head through the branches peering toward the river trying to get through then the animal moved a few yards downstream to try again wonder what he sees in there gennaro said hard to know muldoon said maybe hes trying to get to the microceratopsians that scramble around in the branches theyll run him a merry chase muldoon stopped the jeep about fifty yards away from the tyrannosaur and turned the vehicle around he left the motor running get behind the wheel muldoon said and put your seat belt on he took another canister and booked it onto his shirt then he got out gennaro slid behind the wheel you done this very often before muldoon belched never ill try to get him just behind the auditory meatus well see how it goes from there he walked ten yards behind the jeep and crouched down in the grass on one knee he steadied the big gun against his shoulder and flipped up the thick telescopic sight muldoon aimed at the tyrannosaur which still ignored them there was a burst of pale gas and gennaro saw a white streak shoot forward in the air toward the tyrannosaur but nothing seemed to happen then the tyrannosaur turned slowly curiously to peer at them it moved its head from side to side as if looking at them with alternate eyes muldoon had taken down the launcher and was loading the second canister you hit him gennaro said muldoon shook his head missed damn laser sights see if theres a battery in the case a what gennaro said a battery muldoon said its about as big as your finger gray markings gennaro bent over to look in the steel case he felt the vibration of the jeep heard the motor ticking over he didnt see a battery the tyrannosaur roared to gennaro it was a terrifying sound rumbling from the great chest cavity of the animal bellowing out over the landscape he sat up sharply and reached for the steering wheel put his hand on the gearshift on the radio he heard a voice say muldoon this is arnold get out of there over i know what im doing muldoon said the tyrannosaur charged muldoon stood his ground despite the creature racing toward him he slowly and methodically raised his launcher aimed and fired once again gennaro saw the puff of smoke and the white streak of the canister going toward the animal nothing happened the tyrannosaur continued to charge now muldoon was on his feet and running shouting go go gennaro put the jeep in gear and muldoon threw himself onto the side door as the jeep lurched forward the tyrannosaur was closing rapidly and muldoon swung the door open and climbed inside go damn it go gennaro floored it the jeep bounced precariously the front end nosing so high they saw only sky through the windshield then slamming down again toward the ground and racing forward again gennaro headed for a stand of trees to the left until in the rearview mirror he saw the tyrannosaur give a final roar and turn away gennaro slowed the car jesus muldoon was shaking his head i could have sworn i hit him the second time id say you missed gennaro said needle must have broken off before the plunger injected admit it you missed yeah muldoon said he sighed i missed battery was dead in the damned laser sights my fault i should have checked it after it was out all last night lets go back and get more canisters the jeep headed north toward the hotel muldoon picked up the radio control yes arnold said were heading back to base the river was now very narrow and flowing swiftly the raft was going faster all the time it was starting to feel like an amusement park ride whee lex yelled holding on to the gunwale faster faster grant squinted looking forward the river was still narrow and dark but farther ahead he could see the trees ended and there was bright sunlight beyond and a distant roaring sound the river seemed to end abruptly in a peculiar flat line the raft was going still faster rushing forward grant grabbed for his paddles what is it its a waterfall grant said the raft swept out of the overhanging darkness into brilliant morning sunlight and raced forward on the swift current toward the lip of the waterfall the roar was loud in their ears grant paddled as strongly as he could but he only succeeded in spinning the boat in circles it continued inexorably toward the lip lex leaned toward him i cant swim grant saw that she did not have her life vest clasped but there was nothing he could do about it with frightening speed they came to the edge and the roar of the waterfall seemed to fill the world grant jammed his oar deep into the water it catch and hold right at the lip the rubber raft shuddered in the current but they did not go over grant strained against the oar and looking over the edge saw the sheer drop of fifty feet down to the surging pool below and standing in the surging pool waiting for them was the tyrannosaur lex was screaming in panic and then the boat spun and the rear end dropped away spilling them out into air and roaring water and they fell sickeningly grant flailed his arms in the air and the world went suddenly silent and slow it seemed to him he fell for long minutes he had time to observe lex clutching her orange jacket falling alongside him he had time to observe tim looking down at the bottom he had time to observe the frozen white sheet of the waterfall he had time to observe the bubbling pool beneath him as he fell slowly silently toward it then with a stinging slap grant plunged into cold water surrounded by white boiling bubbles he tumbled and spun and glimpsed the leg of the tyrannosaur as he was swirled past it swept down through the pool and out into the stream beyond grant swam for the shore clutched warm rocks slipped off caught a branch and finally pulled himself out of the main current gasping he dragged himself on his belly onto the rocks and looked at the river just in time to see the brown rubber raft tumble past him then he saw tim battling the current and he reached out and pulled him coughing and shivering onto the shore beside him grant turned back to the waterfall and saw the tyrannosaur plunge its head straight down into the water of the pool at his feet the great head shook splashing water to either side it had something between its teeth and then the tyrannosaur lifted its head back up dangling from the jaws was lexs orange life vest a moment later lex bobbed to the surface beside the dinosaurs long tail she lay face down in the water her little body swept downstream by the current grant plunged into the water after her was again immersed in the churning torrent a moment later he pulled her up onto the rocks a heavy lifeless weight her face was gray water poured from her mouth grant bent over her to give her mouthtomouth but she coughed then she vomited yellowgreen liquid and coughed again her eyelids fluttered hi she said she smiled weakly we did it tim started to cry she coughed again will you stop it whatre you crying for because we were worried about you grant said small flecks of white were drifting down the river the tyrannosaur was tearing up the life vest still turned away from them facing the waterfall but at any minute the animal might turn and see them come on kids he said where are we going lex said coughing come on he was looking for a hiding place downstream he saw only an open grassy plain affording no protection upstream was the dinosaur then grant saw a dirt path by the river it seemed to lead up toward the waterfall and in the dirt he saw the clear imprint of a mans shoe leading up the path the tyrannosaur finally turned around growling and looking out toward the grassy plain it seemed to have figured out that they had gotten away it was looking for them downstream grant and the kids ducked among the big ferns that lined the riverbanks cautiously he led them upstream where are we going lex said were going back i know they were closer to the waterfall now the roar much louder the rocks became slippery the path muddy there was a constant hanging mist it was like moving through a cloud the path seemed to lead right into the rushing water but as they came closer they saw that it actually went behind the waterfall the tyrannosaur was still looking downstream its back turned to them they hurried along the path to the waterfall and had almost moved behind the sheet of falling water when grant saw the tyrannosaur turn then they were completely behind the waterfall and grant was unable to see out through the silver sheet grant looked around in surprise there was a little recess here hardly larger than a closet and filled with machinery humming pumps and big filters and pipes everything was wet and cold did he see us lex said she had to shout over the noise of the falling water where are we what is this place did he see us just a minute grant said he was looking at the equipment this was clearly park machinery and there must be electricity to run it so perhaps there was also a telephone for communication he poked among the filters and pipes what are you doing lex shouted looking for a telephone it was now nearly am they had just a little more than an hour to contact the ship before it reached the mainland in the back of the recess he found a metal door marked maint but it was firmly locked next to it was a slot for a security card alongside the door he saw a row of metal boxes he opened the boxes one after another but they contained only switches and timers no telephone and nothing to open the door he almost missed the box to the left of the door on opening it he found a ninebutton keypad covered with spots of green mold but it looked as if it was a way to open the door and he had the feeling that on the other side of that door was a phone scratched in the metal of the box was the number he punched it in with a hiss the door came open gaping darkness beyond concrete steps leading downward on the back wall he saw stenciled maint vehicle charger and an arrow pointing down the stairs could it really mean there was a car come on kids forget it lex said im not going in there come on lex tim said forget it lex said theres no lights or anything im not going never mind grant said there wasnt time to argue stay here and ill be right back wherere you going lex said suddenly alarmed grant stepped through the door it gave an electronic beep and snapped shut behind him on a spring grant was plunged into total darkness after a moment of surprise he turned to the door and felt its damp surface there was no knob no latch he turned to the walls on either side of the door feeling for a switch a control box anything at all there was nothing he was fighting panic when his fingers closed over a cold metal cylinder he ran his hands over a swelling edge a flat surface a flashlight he clicked it on and the beam was surprisingly bright he looked back at the door but saw that it would not open he would have to wait for the kids to unlock it meantime he started for the steps they were damp and slippery with mold and he went down carefully partway down the stairs he heard a sniffing and the sound of claws scratching on concrete he took out his dart pistol and proceeded cautiously the steps bent around the corner and as he shone his light an odd reflection glinted back and then a moment later he saw it a car it was an electric car like a golf cart and it faced a long tunnel that seemed to stretch away for miles a bright red light glowed by the steering wheel of the car so perhaps it was charged grant heard the sniffing again and he wheeled and saw a pale shape rise up toward him leaping through the air its laws open and without thinking grant fired the animal landed on him knocking him down and he rolled away in fright his flashlight swinging wildly but the animal didnt get up and he felt foolish when he saw it it was a velociraptor but very young less than a year old it was about two feet tall the size of a medium dog and it lay on the ground breathing shallowly the dart sticking from beneath its jaw there was probably too much anesthetic for its body weight and grant pulled the dart out quickly the velociraptor looked at him with slightly glazed eyes grant had a clear feeling of intelligence from this creature a kind of softness which contrasted strangely with the menace he had felt from the adults in the pen he stroked the head of the velociraptor hoping to calm it he looked down at the body which was shivering slightly as the tranquilizer took hold and then he saw it was a male a young juvenile and a male there was no question what he was seeing this velociraptor had been bred in the wild excited by this development he hurried back up the stairs to the door with his flashlight he scanned the flat featureless surface of the door and the interior walls as he ran his hands over the door it slowly dawned on him that he was locked inside and unable to open it unless the kids had the presence of mind to open it for him he could hear them faintly on the other side of the door dr grant lex shouted pounding the door dr grant take it easy tim said hell be back but where did he go listen dr grant knows what hes doing tim said hell be back in a minute he should come back now lex said she bunched her fists on her hips pushed her elbows wide she stamped her foot angrily and then with a roar the tyrannosaurs head burst through the waterfall toward them tim stared in horror as the big mouth gaped wide lex shrieked and threw herself on the ground the head swung back and forth and pulled out again but tim could see the shadow of the animals head on the sheet of falling water he pulled lex deeper into the recess just as the jaws burst through again roaring the thick tongue flicking in and out rapidly water sprayed in all directions from the head then it pulled out again lex huddled next to tim shivering i hate him she said she huddled back but the recess was only a few feet deep and crammed with machinery there wasnt any place for them to hide the head came through the water again but slowly this time and the jaw came to rest on the ground the tyrannosaur snorted flaring its nostrils breathing the air but the eyes were still outside the sheet of water tim thought he cant see us he knows were in here but he cant see through the water the tyrannosaur sniffed what is he doing lex said again sshhbh with a low growl the jaws slowly opened and the tongue snaked out it was thick and blueblack with a little forked indentation at the tip it was four feet long and easily reached back to the far wall of the recess the tongue slid with a rasping scrape over the filter cylinders tim and lex pressed back against the pipes the tongue moved slowly to the left then to the right slapping wetly against the machinery the tip curled around the pipes and valves sensing them tim saw that the tongue had muscular movements like an elephants trunk the tongue drew back along the right side of the recess it dragged against lexs legs eeww lex said the tongue stopped it curled then began to rise like a snake up the side of her body dont move tim whispered past her face then up along tims shoulder and finally wrapping around his head tim squeezed his eyes shut as the slimy muscle covered his face it was hot and wet and it stunk like urine wrapped around him the tongue began to drag him very slowly toward the open laws timmy tim couldnt answer his mouth was covered by the flat black tongue he could see but he couldnt talk lex tugged at his hand come on timmy the tongue dragged him toward the snorting mouth he felt the hot panting breath on his legs lex was tugging at him but she was no match for the muscular power that held him tim let go of her and pressed the tongue with both hands trying to shove it over his head he couldnt move it he dug his heels into the muddy ground but he was dragged forward anyway lex had wrapped her arms around his waist and was pulling backward shouting to him but he was powerless to do anything he was beginning to see stars a kind of peacefulness overcame him a sense of peaceful inevitability as he was dragged along timmy and then suddenly the tongue relaxed and uncoiled tim felt it slipping off his face his body was covered in disgusting white foamy slime and the tongue fell limply to the ground the jaws slapped shut biting down on the tongue dark blood gushed out mixing with the mud the nostrils still snorted in ragged breaths whats he doing lex cried and then slowly very slowly the head began to slide backward out of the recess leaving a long scrape in the mud and finally it disappeared entirely and they could see only the silver sheet of falling water control okay arnold said in the control room the rex is down he pushed back in his chair and grinned as he lit a final cigarette and crumpled the pack that did it the final step in putting the park back in order now all they had to do was go out and move it son of a bitch muldoon said looking at the monitor i got him after all he turned to gennaro it just took him an hour to feel it henry wu frowned at the screen but he could drown in that position he wont drown muldoon said never seen an animal that was harder to kill i think we have to go out and move him arnold said we will muldoon said he didnt sound enthusiastic thats a valuable animal i know its a valuable animal muldoon said arnold turned to gennaro he couldnt resist a moment of triumph id point out to you he said that the park is now completely back to normal whatever malcolms mathematical model said was going to happen we are completely under control again gennaro pointed to the screen behind arnolds head and said whats that arnold turned it was the system status box in the upper corner of the screen ordinarily it was empty arnold was surprised to see that it was now blinking yellow aux pwr low for a moment he didnt understand why should auxiliary power be low they were running on main power not auxiliary power he thought perhaps it was just a routine status check on the auxiliary power perhaps a check on the fuel tank levels or the battery charge henry arnold said to wu look at this wu said why are you running on auxiliary power im not arnold said it looks like you are i cant be print the system status log wu said the log was a record of the system over the last few hours arnold pressed a button and they heard the hum of a printer in the corner wu walked over to it arnold stared at the screen the box now turned from flashing yellow to red and the message now read aux pwr fail numbers began to count backward from twenty what the hell is going on arnold said cautiously tim moved a few yards out along the muddy path into the sunshine he peered around the waterfall and saw the tyrannosaur lying on its side floating in the pool of water below i hope hes dead lex said tim could see he wasnt the dinosaurs chest was still moving and one forearm twitched in spasms but something was wrong with him then tim saw the white canister sticking in the back of the head by the indentation of the ear hes been shot with a dart tim said good lex said he practically ate us tim watched the labored breathing he felt unexpectedly distressed to see the huge animal humbled like this he didnt want it to die its not his fault he said oh sure lex said he practically ate us and its not his fault hes a carnivore he was just doing what he does you wouldnt say that lex said if you were in his stomach right now then the sound of the waterfall changed from a deafening roar it became softer quieter the thundering sheet of water thinned became a trickle and stopped timmy the waterfall stopped lex said it was now just dripping like a tap that wasnt completely turned off the pool at the base of the waterfall was still they stood near the top in the cavelike indentation filled with machinery looking down waterfalls arent supposed to stop lex said tim shook his head it must be the power somebody turned off the power behind them all the pumps and filters were shutting down one after another the lights blinking off and the machinery becoming quiet and then there was the thunk of a solenoid releasing and the door marked maint swung slowly open grant stepped out blinking in the light and said good work kids you got the door open we didnt do anything lex said the power went out tim said never mind that grant said come and see what ive found arnold stared in shock one after another the monitors went black and then the room lights went out plunging the control room into darkness and confusion everyone started yelling at once muldoon opened the blinds and let light in and wu brought over the printout look at this wu said time event system status code safety i off operative av safety off operative av safety off operative av shutdown command shutdown av startup command shutdown av safety on shutdown av safety on shutdown av safety on shutdown av startup

avzz warning aux fuel operative aux power avz warning aux fuel operative aux power avz warning aux fuel shutdown av wu said you shut down at fivethbirteen this morning and when you started back up you started with auxiliary power jesus arnold said apparently main power had not been on since shutdown when he powered back up only the auxiliary power came on arnold was thinking that was strange when he suddenly realized that that was normal that was what was supposed to happen it made perfect sense the auxiliary generator fired up first and it was used to turn on the main generator because it took a heavy charge to start the main power generator that was the way the system was designed but arnold had never before had occasion to turn the main power off and when the lights and screens came back on in the control room it never occurred to him that main power hadnt also been restored but it hadnt and all during the time since then while they were looking for the rex and doing one thing and another the park had been running on auxilary power and that wasnt a good idea in fact the implications were just beginning to hit him what does this line mean muldoon said pointing to the list warning fence status nb operative aux power av it means a system status warning was sent to the monitors in the control room arnold said concerning the fences did you see that warning arnold shook his head no i must have been talking to you in the field anyway no i didnt see it what does it mean warning fence status well i didnt know it at the time but we were running on backup power arnold said and backup doesnt generate enough amperage to power the electrified fences so they were automatically kept off muldoon scowled the electrified fences were off yes all of them since five this morning for the last five hours yes including the velociraptor fences arnold sighed yes jesus christ muldoon said five hours those animals could be out and then from somewhere in the distance they heard a scream muldoon began to talk very fast he went around the room handing out the portable radios mr arnold is going to the maintenance shed to turn on main power dr wu stay in the control room youre the only other one who can work the computers mr hammond go back to the lodge dont argue with me go now lock the gates and stay behind them until you hear from me ill help arnold deal with the raptors he turned to gennaro like to live dangerously again not really gennaro said he was very pale fine then go with the others to the lodge muldoon turned away thats it everybody now move hammond whined but what are you going to do to my animals thats not really the question mr hammond muldoon said the question is what are they going to do to us he went through the door and hurried down the hall toward his office gennaro fell into step alongside him change your mind muldoon growled youll need help gennaro said i might muldoon went into the room marked animal supervisor picked up the gray shoulder launcher and unlocked a panel in the wall behind his desk there were six cylinders and six canisters the thing about these damn dinos muldoon said is that they have distributed nervous systems they dont die fast even with a direct hit to the brain and theyre built solidly thick ribs make a shot to the heart dicey and theyre difficult to cripple in the legs or hindquarters slow bleeders slow to die he was opening the cylinders one after another and dropping in the canisters he tossed a thick webbed belt to gennaro put that on gennaro tightened the belt and muldoon passed him the shells about all we can hope to do is blow them apart unfortunately weve only got six shells here theres eight raptors in that fenced compound lets go stay close you have the shells muldoon went out and ran along the hallway looking down over the balcony to the path leading toward the maintenance shed gennaro was puffing alongside him they got to the ground floor and went out through the glass doors and muldoon stopped arnold was standing with his back to the maintenance shed three raptors approached him arnold had picked up a stick and he was waving it at them shouting the raptors fanned out as they came closer one staying in the center the other two moving to each side coordinated smooth gennaro shivered pack behavior muldoon was already crouching setting the launcher on his shoulder load he said gennaro slipped the shell in the back of the launcher there was an electric sizzle nothing happened christ youve got it in backward muldoon said tilting the barrel so the shell fell into gennaros hands gennaro loaded again the raptors were snarling at arnold when the animal on the left simply exploded the upper part of the torso flying into the air blood spattering like a burst tomato on the walls of the building the lower torso collapsed on the ground the legs kicking in the air the tail flopping thatll wake em up muldoon said arnold ran for the door of the maintenance shed the velociraptors turned and started toward muldoon and gennaro they fanned out as they came closer in the distance somewhere near the lodge he heard screams gennaro said this could be a disaster load muldoon said henry wu heard the explosions and looked toward the door of the control room he circled around the consoles then paused he wanted to go out but he knew he should stay in the room if arnold was able to get the power back onif only for a minutethen wu could restart the main generator he had to stay in the room he heard someone screaming it sounded like muldoon muldoon felt a wrenching pain in his ankle tumbled down an embankment and hit the ground running looking back he saw gennaro running in the other direction into the forest the raptors were ignoring gennaro but pursuing muldoon they were now less than twenty yards away muldoon screamed at the top of his lungs as he ran wondering vaguely where the hell he could go because he knew he had perhaps ten seconds before they got him ten seconds maybe less ellie had to help malcolm turn over as harding jabbed the needle and injected morphine malcolm sighed and collapsed back it seemed be was growing weaker by the minute over the radio they heard tinny screaming and muffled explosions coming from the visitor center hammond came into the room and said how is he hes holding harding said a bit delirious i am nothing of the sort malcolm said i am utterly clear they listened to the radio it sounds like a war out there the raptors got out hammond said did they malcolm said breathing shallowly how could that possibly happen it was a system screwup arnold didnt realize that the auxiliary power was on and the fences cut out did they go to hell you supercilious bastard if i remember malcolm said i predicted fence integrity would fail hammond sighed and sat down heavily damn it all he said shaking his head it must surely not have escaped your notice that at heart what we are attempting here is an extremely simple idea my colleagues and i determined several years ago that it was possible to clone the dna of an extinct animal and to grow it that seemed to us a wonderful idea it was a kind of time travelthe only time travel in the world bring them back alive so to speak and since it was so exciting and since it was possible to do it we decided to go forward we got this island and we proceeded it was all very simple simple malcolm said somehow he found the energy to sit up in the bed simple youre a bigger fool than i thought you were and i thought you were a very substantial fool ellie said dr malcolm and tried to ease him back down but malcolm would have none of it he pointed toward the radio the shouts and the cries what is that going on out there he said thats your simple idea simple you create new life forms about which you know nothing at all your dr wu does not even know the names of the things he is creating he cannot be bothered with such details as what the thing is called let alone what it is you create many of them in a very short time you never learn anything about them yet you expect them to do your bidding because you made them and you therefore think you own them you forget that they are alive they have an intelligence of their own and they may not do your bidding and you forget how little you know about them how incompetent you are to do the things that you so frivolously call simple dear god he sank back coughing you know whats wrong with scientific power malcolm said its a form of inherited wealth and you know what assholes congenitally rich people are it never fails hammond said what is he talking about harding made a sign indicating delirium malcolm cocked his eye i will tell you what i am talking about he said most kinds of power require a substantial sacrifice by whoever wants the power there is an apprenticeship a discipline lasting many years whatever kind of power you want president of the company black belt in karate spiritual guru whatever it is you seek you have to put in the time the practice the effort you must give up a lot to get it it has to be very important to you and once you have attained it it is your power it cant be given away it resides in you it is literally the result of your discipline now what is interesting about this process is that by the time someone has acquired the ability to kill with his bare hands he has also matured to the point where he wont use it unwisely so that kind of power has a builtin control the discipline of getting the power changes you so that you wont abuse it but scientific power is like inherited wealth attained without discipline you read what others have done and you take the next step you can do it very young you can make progress very fast there is no discipline lasting many decades there is no mastery old scientists are ignored there is no humility before nature there is only a getrichquick makeanameforyourselffast philosophy cheat lie falsifyit doesnt matter not to you or to your colleagues no one will criticize you no one has any standards they are all trying to do the same thing to do something big and do it fast and because you can stand on the shoulders of giants you can accomplish something quickly you dont even know exactly what you have done but already you have reported it patented it and sold it and the buyer will have even less discipline than you the buyer simply purchases the power like any commodity the buyer doesnt even conceive that any discipline might be necessary hammond said do you know what he is talking about ellie nodded i havent a clue hammond said ill make it simple malcolm said a karate master does not kill people with his bare hands he does not lose his temper and kill his wife the person who kills is the person who has no discipline no restraint and who has purchased his power in the form of a saturday night special and that is the kind of power that science fosters and permits and that is why you think that to build a place like this is simple it was simple hammond insisted then why did it go wrong dizzy with tension john arnold threw open the door to the maintenance shed and stepped into the darkness inside jesus it was black he should have realized the lights would be out he felt the cool air the cavernous dimensions of the space extending two floors below him he had to find the catwalk he had to be careful or hed break his neck the catwalk he groped like a blind man until he realized it was futile somehow he had to get light into the shed he went back to the door and cracked it open four inches that gave enough light but there was no way to keep the door open quickly he kicked off his shoe and stuck it in the door he went toward the catwalk seeing it easily he walked along the corrugated metal hearing the difference in his feet one loud one soft but at least he could see up ahead was the stairway leading down to the generators another ten yards darkness the light was gone arnold looked back to the door and saw the light was blocked by the body of a velociraptor the animal bent over and carefully sniffed the shoe henry wu paced he ran his hands over the computer consoles he touched the screens he was in constant movement he was almost frantic witb tension he reviewed the steps he would take he must be quick the first screen would come up and he would press wu the radio hissed he grabbed for it yes im here got any bloody power yet it was muldoon there was something odd about his voice something hollow no wu said he smiled glad to know muldoon was alive i think arnold made it to the shed muldoon said after that i dont know where are you wu said im stuffed what stuffed in a bloody pipe muldoon said and im very popular at the moment wedged in a pipe was more like it muldoon thought there had been a stack of drainage pipes piled behind the visitor center and hed backed himself into the nearest one scrambling like a poor bastard meter pipes very tight fit for him but they couldnt come in after him at least not after hed shot the leg off one when the nosy bastard came too close to the pipe the raptor had gone howling off and the others were now respectful his only regret was that he hadnt waited to see the snout at the end of the tube before hed squeezed the trigger but he might still have his chance because there were three or four outside snarling and growling around him yes very popular he said into the radio wu said does arnold have a radio dont think so muldoon said just sit tight wait it out he hadnt seen what the other end of the pipe was likehed backed in too quicklyand he couldnt see now he was wedged tight he could only hope that the far end wasnt open christ he didnt like the thought of one of those bastards taking a bite of his hindquarters arnold backed away down the catwalk the velociraptor was barely ten feet away stalking him coming forward into the gloom arnold could hear the click of its deadly claws on the metal but he was going slowly he knew the animal could see well but the grille of the catwalk the unfamiliar mechanical odors had made it cautious that caution was his only chance arnold thought if he could get to the stairs and then move down to the floor below because he was pretty sure velociraptors couldnt climb stairs certainly not narrow steep stairs arnold glanced over his shoulder the stairs were just a few feet away another few steps he was there reaching back he felt the railing started scrambling down the almost vertical steps his feet touched flat concrete the raptor snarled in frustration twenty feet above him on the catwalk too bad buddy arnold said he turned away he was now very close to the auxiliary generator just a few more steps and he would see it even in this dim light there was a dull thump behind him arnold turned the raptor was standing there on the concrete floor snarling it had jumped down he looked quickly for a weapon but suddenly he found he was slammed onto his back on the concrete something heavy was pressing on his chest it was impossible to breathe and he realized the animal was standing on top of him and he felt the big claws digging into the flesh of his chest and smelled the foul breath from the head moving above him and he opened his mouth to scream ellie held the radio in her hands listening two more tican workmen had arrived at the lodge they seemed to know it was safe here but there had been no others in the last few minutes and it sounded quieter outside over the radio muldoon said how long has it been wu said four five minutes arnold should have done it by now muldoon said if hes going to you got any ideas no wu said we heard from gennaro gennaro pressed the button im here where the hell are you muldoon said im going to the maintenance building gennaro said wish me luck gennaro crouched in the foliage listening directly ahead he saw the planted pathway leading toward the visitor center gennaro knew the maintenance shed was somewhere to the east he heard the chirping of birds in the trees a soft mist was blowing one of the raptors roared but it was some distance away it sounded off to his right gennaro set out leaving the path plunging into the foliage like to live dangerously not really it was true he didnt but gennaro thought he had a plan or at least a possibility that might work if he stayed north of the main complex of buildings he could approach the maintenance shed from the rear all the raptors were probably around the other buildings to the south there was no reason for them to be in the jungle at least he hoped not he moved as quietly as he could unhappily aware he was making a lot of noise he forced himself to slow his pace feeling his heart pound the foliage here was very dense he couldnt see more than six or seven feet ahead of him he began to worry that hed miss the maintenance shed entirely but then he saw the roof to his right above the palms he moved toward it went around the side he found the door opened it and slipped inside it was very dark he stumbled over something a mans shoe gennaro frowned he propped the door wide open and continued deeper into the building he saw a catwalk directly ahead of him suddenly he realized he didnt know where to go and he had left his radio behind damn there might be a radio somewhere in the maintenance building or else hed just look for the generator he knew what a generator looked like probably it was somewhere down on the lower floor he found a staircase leading down it was darker below and it was difficult to see anything he felt his way along among the pipes holding his bands out to keep from banging his head he heard an animal snarl and froze he listened but the sound did not come again he moved forward cautiously something dripped on his shoulder and his bare arm it was warm like water he touched it in the darkness sticky he smelled it blood he looked up the raptor was perched on pipes just a few feet above his head blood was trickling from its claws with an odd sense of detachment he wondered if it was injured and then he began to run but the raptor jumped onto his back pushing him to the ground gennaro was strong he heaved up knocking the raptor away and rolled off across the concrete when he turned back he saw that the raptor had fallen on its side where it lay panting yes it was injured its leg was hurt for some reason kill it gennaro scrambled to his feet looking for a weapon the raptor was still panting on the concrete he looked frantically for sometbinganythingto use as a weapon when he turned back the raptor was gone it snarled the sound echoing in the darkness gennaro turned in a full circle feeling with his outstretched hands and then he felt a sharp pain in his right hand teeth it was biting him the raptor jerked his head and donald gennaro was yanked off his feet and he fell lying in bed soaked in sweat malcolm listened as the radio crackled anything muldoon said you getting anything no word wu said hell muldoon said there was a pause malcolm sighed i cant wait he said to hear his new plan what i would like muldoon said is to get everybody to the lodge and regroup but i dont see how theres a jeep in front of the visitor center wu said if i drove over to you could you get yourself into it maybe but youd be abandoning the control room i cant do anything here anyway god knows thats true malcolm said a control room without electricity is not much of a control room all right muldoon said lets try this isnt looking good lying in his bed malcolm said no its not looking good its looking like a disaster wu said the raptors are going to follow us over there were still better off malcolm said lets go the radio clicked off malcolm closed his eyes and breathed slowly marshaling his strength just relax ellie said just take it easy you know what we are really talking about here malcolm said all this attempt to control we are talking about western attitudes that are five hundred years old they began at the time when florence italy was the most important city in the world the basic idea of sciencethat there was a new way to look at reality that it was objective that it did not depend on your beliefs or your nationality that it was rationalthat idea was fresh and exciting back then it offered promise and hope for the future and it swept away the old medieval system which was hundreds of years old the medieval world of feudal politics and religious dogma and hateful superstitions fell before science but in truth this was because the medieval world didnt really work any more it didnt work economically it didnt work intellectually and it didnt fit the new world that was emerging malcolm coughed but now he continued science is the belief system that is hundreds of years old and like the medieval system before it science is starting not to fit the world any more science has attained so much power that its practical limits begin to be apparent largely through science billions of us live in one small world densely packed and intercommunicating but science cannot help us decide what to do with that world or how to live science can make a nuclear reactor but it cannot tell us not to build it science can make pesticide but cannot tell us not to use it and our world starts to seem polluted in fundamental waysair and water and landbecause of ungovernable science he sighed this much is obvious to everyone there was a silence malcolm lay with his eyes closed his breathing labored no one spoke and it seemed to ellie that malcolm had finally fallen asleep then he sat up again abruptly at the same time the great intellectual justification of science has vanished ever since newton and descartes science has explicitly offered us the vision of total control science has claimed the power to eventually control everything through its understanding of natural laws but in the twentieth century that claim has been shattered beyond repair first heisenbergs uncertainty principle set limits on what we could know about the subatomic world oh well we say none of us lives in a subatomic world it doesnt make any practical difference as we go through our lives then godels theorem set similar limits to mathematics the formal language of science mathematicians used to think that their language had some special inherent trueness that derived from the laws of logic now we know that what we call reason is just an arbitrary game its not special in the way we thought it was and now chaos theory proves that unpredictability is built into our daily lives it is as mundane as the rainstorm we cannot predict and so the grand vision of science hundreds of years oldthe dream of total controlhas died in our century and with it much of the justification the rationale for science to do what it does and for us to listen to it science has always said that it may not know everything now but it will know eventually but now we see that isnt true it is an idle boast as foolish and as misguided as the child who jumps off a building because he believes he can fly this is very extreme hammond said shaking his head we are witnessing the end of the scientific era science like other outmoded systems is destroying itself as it gains in power it proves itself incapable of handling the power because things are going very fast now fifty years ago everyone was gaga over the atomic bomb that was power no one could imagine anything more yet a bare decade after the bomb we began to have genetic power and genetic power is far more potent than atomic power and it will be in everyones hands it will be in kits for backyard gardeners experiments for schoolchildren cheap labs for terrorists and dictators and that will force everyone to ask the same questionwhat should i do with my powerwhich is the very question science says it cannot answer so what will happen ellie said malcolm shrugged a change what kind of change all major changes are like death he said you cant see to the other side until you are there and he closed his eyes the poor man hammond said shaking his head malcolm sighed do you have any idea he said how unlikely it is that you or any of us will get off this island alive sixth iteration system recovery may prove impossible ian malcolm return its electric motor whirring the cart raced forward down the dark underground tunnel grant drove his foot to the floor the tunnel was featureless except for the occasional air vent above shaded to protect against rainfall and thus permitting little light to enter but he noticed that there were crusty white animal droppings in many places obviously lots of animals had been in here sitting beside him in the cart lex shone the flashlight to the back where the velociraptor lay why is it having trouble breathing because i shot it with tranquilizer he said is it going to die she said i hope not why are we taking it lex said to prove to the people back at the center that the dinosaurs are really breeding grant said how do you know theyre breeding because this one is young grant said and because its a boy dinosaur is it lex said peering along the flashlight beam yes now shine that light forward will you he held out his wrist turning the watch to her what does it say it says tenfifteen okay tim said that means we have only fortyfive minutes to contact the boat we should be close grant said i figure we should be almost to the visitor center right now he wasnt sure but be sensed the tunnel was gently tilting upward leading them back to the surface and wow tim said they burst out into daylight with shocking speed there was a light mist blowing partially obscuring the building that loomed directly above them grant saw at once that it was the visitor center they had arrived right in front of the garage yay lex shouted we did it yay she bounced up and down in the seat as grant parked the cart in the garage along one wall were stac animal cages they put the velociraptor in one with a dish of water then they started climbing the stairs to the groundfloor entrance of the visitor center im going to get a hamburger and french fries chocolate milk shake no more dinosaurs yay they came to the lobby and they opened the door and they fell silent in the lobby of the visitor center the glass doors had been shattered and a cold gray mist blew through the cavernous main hall a sign that read when dinosaurs ruled the earth dangled from one hinge creaking in the wind the big tyrannosaur robot was upended and lay with its legs in the air its tubing and metal innards exposed outside through the glass they saw rows of palm trees shadowy shapes in the fog tim and lex huddled against the metal desk of the security guard grant took the guards radio and tried all the channels hello this is grant is anybody there hello this is grant lex stared at the body of the guard lying on the floor to the right she couldnt see anything but his legs and feet hello this is grant hello lex was leaning forward peering around the edge of the desk grant grabbed her sleeve hey stop that is he dead whats that stuff on the floor blood yes how come it isnt real red youre morbid tim said whats morbid i am not the radio crackled my god came a voice grant is that you and then alan alan it was ellie im here grant said thank god ellie said are you all right im all right yes what about the kids have you seen them i have the kids with me grant said theyre okay thank god lex was crawling around the side of the desk grant slapped her ankle get back here the radio crackled n where are you in the lobby in the lobby of the main building over the radio he heard wu say my god theyre here alan listen ellie said the raptors have gotten loose they can open doors they may be in the same building as you great where are you grant said were in the lodge grant said and the others muldoon everybody else weve lost a few people but we got everybody else over to the lodge and are the telephones working no the whole system is shut off nothing works how do we get the system back on weve been trying we have to get it back on grant said right away if we dont within half an hour the raptors will reach the mainland he started to explain about the boat when muldoon cut him off i dont think you understand dr grant we havent got half an hour left over here hows that some of the raptors followed us weve got two on the roof now so what the buildings impregnable muldoon coughed apparently not it was never expected that animals would get up on the roof the radio crackled must have planted a tree too close to the fence the raptors got over the fence and onto the roof anyway the steel bars on the skylight are supposed to be electrified but of course the powers off theyre biting through the bars of the skylight grant said biting through the bars he frowned trying to imagine it how fast yes muldoon said they have a bite pressure of fifteen thousand pounds a square inch theyre like hyenas they can bite through steel and the transmission was lost for a moment how fast grant said again muldoon said id guess weve got another ten fifteen minutes before they break through completely and come through the skylight into the building and once theyre in ah just a minute dr grant the radio clicked off in the skylight above malcolms bed the raptors had chewed through the first of the steel bars one raptor gripped the end of the bar and tugged pulling it back it put its powerful hind limb on the skylight and the glass shattered glittering down on malcolms bed below ellie reached over and removed the largest fragments from the sheets god theyre ugly malcolm said looking up now that the glass was broken they could hear the snorts and snarls of the raptors the squeal of their teeth on the metal as they chewed the bars there were silver thinned sections where they had chewed foamy saliva spattered onto the sheets and the bedside table at least they cant get in yet ellie said not until they chew through another bar wu said if grant could somehow get to the maintenance shed bloody hell muldoon said he limped around the room on his sprained ankle he cant get there fast enough he cant get the power on fast enough not to stop this malcolm coughed yes his voice was soft almost a wheeze whatd he say muldoon said yes malcolm repeated can can what distraction he winced what kind of a distraction go to the fence yes and do what malcolm grinned weakly stick your hands through oh christ muldoon said turning away wait a minute wu said hes right there are only two raptors here which means there are at least four more out there we could go out and provide a distraction and then what and then grant would be free to go to the maintenance building and turn on the generator and then go back to the control room and start up the system exactly no time muldoon said no time but if we can lure the raptors down here wu said maybe even get them away from that skylight it might work worth a try bait muldoon said exactly whos going to be the bait im no good my ankles shot ill do it wu said no muldoon said youre the only one who knows what to do about the computer you need to talk grant through the startup then ill do it harding said no ellie said malcolm needs you ill do it hell i dont think so muldoon said youd have raptors all around you raptors on the roof but she was already bending over lacing her running shoes just dont tell grant she said itll make him nervous the lobby was quiet chilly fog drifting past them the radio had been silent for several minutes tim said why arent they talking to us im hungry lex said theyre trying to plan grant said the radio crackled grant are younry wu speaking are you there im here grant said listen wu said can you see to the rear of the visitor building from where you are grant looked through the rear glass doors to the palm trees and the fog yes grant said wu said theres a path straight through the palm trees to the maintenance building thats where the power equipment and generators are i believe you saw the maintenance building yesterday yes grant said though he was momentarily puzzled was it yesterday that he had looked into the building it seemed like years ago now listen wu said we think we can get all the raptors down here by the lodge but we arent sure so be careful give us five minutes okay grant said you can leave the kids in the cafeteria and they should be all right take the radio with you when you go okay turn it off before you leave so it doesnt make any noise outside and call me when you get to the maintenance building okay grant turned the radio off lex crawled back are we going to the cafeteria she said yes grant said they got up and started walking through the blowing mist in the lobby i want a hamburger lex said i dont think theres any electricity to cook with then ice cream tim youll have to stay with her and help her i will ive got to leave for a while grant said i know they moved to the cafeteria entrance on opening the door grant saw square diningroom tables and chairs swinging stainlesssteel doors beyond nearby a cash register and a rack with gum and candy okay kids i want you to stay here no matter what got it leave us the radio lex said i cant i need it just stay here ill only be gone about five minutes okay okay grant closed the door the cafeteria became completely dark lex clutched his hand turn on the lights she said i cant tim said theres no electricity but he pulled down his nightvistion goggles thats fine for you what about me just hold my hand well get some food he led her forward in phosphorescent green he saw the tables and chairs to the right the glowing green cash register and the rack with gum and candy he grabbed a handful of candy bars i told you lex said i want ice cream not candy take these anyway ice cream tim okay okay tim stuffed the candy bars in his pocket and led lex deeper into the dining room she tugged on his band i cant see spit she said just walk with me hold my hand then slow down beyond the tables and chairs was a pair of swinging doors with little round windows in them they probably led to the kitchen he pushed one door open and it held wide ellie sattler stepped outside the front door to the lodge and felt the chilly mist on her face and legs her heart was thumping even though she knew she was completely safe behind the fence directly ahead she saw the heavy bars in the fog but she couldnt see much beyond the fence another twenty yards before the landscape turned milky white and she didnt see any raptors at all in fact the gardens and trees were almost eerily silent hey she shouted into the fog tentatively muldoon leaned against the door frame i doubt thatll do it he said youve got to make a noise he hobbled out carrying a steel rod from the construction inside he banged the rod against the bars like a dinner gong come and get it dinner is served very amusing ellie said she glanced nervously toward the roof she saw no raptors they dont understand english muldoon grinned but i imagine they get the general idea she was still nervous and found his humor annoying she looked toward the visitor building cloaked in the fog muldoon resumed banging on the bars at the limit of her vision almost lost in the fog she saw a ghostly pale animal a raptor first customer muldoon said the raptor disappeared a white shadow and then came back but it did not approach any closer and it seemed strangely incurious about the noise coming from the lodge she was starting to worry unless she could attract the raptors to the lodge grant would be in danger youre making too much noise ellie said bloody hell muldoon said well you are i know these animals youre drunk she said let me handle it and how will you do that she didnt answer him she went to the gate they say the raptors are intelligent they are at least as intelligent as chimps they have good hearing yes excellent maybe theyll know this sound she said and opened the gate the metal hinges rusted from the constant mist creaked loudly she closed it again opened it with another creak she left it open i wouldnt do that muldoon said youre going to do that let me get the launcher get the launcher he sighed remembering gennaro has the shells well then she said keep an eye out and she went through the gate stepping outside the bars her heart was pounding so hard she could barely feel her feet on the dirt she moved away from the fence and it disappeared frighteningly fast in the fog soon it was lost behind her just as she expected muldoon began shouting to her in drunken agitation god damn it girl dont you do that he bellowed dont call me girl she shouted back ill call you any damn thing i want muldoon shouted she wasnt listening she was turning slowly her body tense watching from all sides she was at least twenty yards from the fence now and she could see the mist drifting like a light rain past the foliage she stayed away from the foliage she moved through a world of shades of gray the muscles in her legs and shoulders ached from the tension her eyes strained to see do you hear me damn it muldoon bellowed how good are these animals she wondered good enough to cut off my retreat there wasnt much distance back to the fence not really they attacked there was no sound the first animal charged from the foliage at the base of a tree to the left it sprang forward and she turned to run the second attacked from the other side clearly intending to catch her as she ran and it leapt into the air claws raised to attack and she darted like a broken field runner and the animal crashed down in the dirt now she was running flat out not daring to look back her breaths coming in deep gasps seeing the bars of the fence emerge from the haze seeing muldoon throw the gate wide seeing him reaching for her shouting to her grabbing her arm and pulling her through so hard she was yanked off her feet and fell to the ground and she turned in time to see first one then twothen tbreeanimals hit the fence and snarl good work muldoon shouted he was taunting the animals now snarling back and it drove them wild they flung themselves at the fence leaping forward and one of them nearly made it over the top christ that was close these bastards can jump she got to her feet looking at the scrapes and bruises the blood running down her leg all she could think was three animals here and two on the roof that meant one was still missing somewhere come on help me muldoon said lets keep em interested grant left the visitor center and moved quickly forward into the mist he found the path among the palm trees and followed it north up ahead the rectangular maintenance shed emerged from the fog there was no door that he could see at all he walked on around the corner at the back screened by planting grant saw a concrete loading dock for trucks he scrambled up to face a vertical rolling door of corrugated steel it was locked he jumped down again and continued around the building farther ahead to his right grant saw an ordinary door it was propped open with a mans shoe grant stepped inside and squinted in the darkness he listened heard nothing he picked up his radio and turned it on this is grant he said im inside wu looked up at the skylight the two raptors still peered down into malcolms room but they seemed distracted by the noises outside he went to the lodge window outside the three velociraptors continued to charge the fence ellie was running back and forth safely behind the bars but the raptors no longer seemed to be seriously trying to get her now they almost seemed to be playing circling back from the fence rearing up and snarling then dropping down low to circle again and finally charge their behavior had taken on the distinct quality of display rather than serious attack like birds muldoon said putting on a show wu nodded theyre intelligent they see they cant get her theyre not really trying the radio crackled side wu gripped the radio say again dr grant im inside grant said dr grant youre in the maintenance building yes grant said and he added maybe you should call me alan all right alan if youre standing just inside the cast door you see a lot of pipes and tubing wu closed his eyes visualizing it straight ahead is a big recessed well in the center of the building that goes two stories underground to your left is a metal walkway with railings i see it go along the walkway im going faintly the radio carried the clang of his footsteps on metal after you go twenty or thirty feet youll see another walkway going right i see it grant said follow that walkway okay as you continue wu said you will come to a ladder on your left going down into the pit i see it go down the ladder there was a long pause wu ran his fingers through his damp hair muldoon frowned tensely okay im down the ladder grant said good wu said now straight ahead of you should be two large yellow tanks that are marked flammable they say inflammable and then something underneath in spanish those are the ones wu said those are the two fuel tanks for the generator one of them has been run dry and so we have to switch over to the other if you look at the bottom of the tanks youll see a white pipe coming out fourinch pvc yes pvc follow that pipe as it goes back okay im following it ow what happened nothing i hit my head there was a pause are you all right yeah fine just hurt my head stupid keep following the pipe okay okay grant said he sounded irritable okay the pipe goes to a big aluminum box with air vents in the sides says honda it looks like the generator yes wu said thats the generator if you walk around to the side youll see a panel with two buttons i see them yellow and red thats right wu said press the yellow one first and while you hold it down press the red one right there was another pause it lasted almost a minute wu and muldoon looked at each other alan it didnt work grant said did you hold down the yellow first and then press the red wu asked yes i did grant said he sounded annoyed i did exactly what you told me to do there was a hum and then a click click click very fast and then the hum stopped and nothing after that try it again i already did grant said it didnt work okay just a minute wu frowned it sounds like the generator is trying to fire up but it cant for some reason alan im here go around to the back of the generator to where the plastic pipe runs in okay a pause then grant said the pipe goes into a round black cylinder that looks like a fuel pump thats right wu said thats exactly what it is its the fuel pump look for a little valve at the top a valve it should be sticking up at the top with a little metal tab that you can turn i found it but its on the side not the top okay twist it open air is coming out good wait until now liquid is coming out it smells like gas okay close the valve wu turned to muldoon shaking his head pump lost its prime alan yes try the buttons again a moment later wu heard the faint coughing and sputtering as the generator turned over and then the steady chugging sound as it caught its on grant said good work alan good work now what grant said he sounded flat dull the lights havent even come on in here go back to the control room and ill talk you through restoring the systems manually thats what i have to do now yes okay grant said ill call you when i get there there was a final hiss and silence alan the radio was dead tim went through the swinging doors at the back of the dining room and entered the kitchen a big stainlesssteel table in the center of the room a big stove with lots of burners to the left and beyond that big walkin refrigerators tim started opening the refrigerators looking for ice cream smoke came out in the humid air as he opened each one how come the stove is on lex said releasing his hand its not on they all have little blue flames thosere pilot lights whatre pilot lights they had an electric stove at home never mind tim said opening another refrigerator but it means i can cook you something in this next refrigerator he found all kinds of stuff cartons of milk and piles of vegetables and a stack of tbone steaks fishbut no ice cream you still want ice cream i told you didnt i the next refrigerator was huge a stainless steel door with a wide horizontal handle he tugged on the handle pulled it open and saw a walkin freezer it was a whole room and it was freezing cold timmy will you wait a minute he said annoyed im trying to find your ice cream timmy somethings here she was whispering and for a moment the last two words didnt register then tim hurried back out of the freezer seeing the edge of the wreathed in glowing green smoke lex stood by the steel worktable she was looking back to the kitchen door he heard a low hissing sound like a very large snake the sound rose and fell softly it was hardly audible it might even be the wind but he somehow knew it wasnt timmy she whispered im scared he crept forward to the kitchen door and looked out in the darkened dining room he saw the orderly green rectangular pattern of the tabletops and moving smoothly among them silent as a ghost except for the hissing of its breath was a velociraptor in the darkness of the maintenance room grant felt along the pipes moving back toward the ladder it was difficult to make his way in the dark and somehow he found the noise of the generator disorienting he came to the ladder and had started back up when he realized there was something else in the room besides generator noise grant paused listening it was a man shouting it sounded like gennaro where are you grant shouted over here gennaro said in the truck grant couldnt see any truck he squinted in the darkness he looked out of the corner of his eye he saw green glowing shapes moving in the darkness then he saw the truck and he turned toward it tim found the silence chilling the velociraptor was six feet tall and powerfully built although its strong legs and tail were hidden by the tables tim could see only the muscular upper torso the two forearms held tightly alongside the body the claws dangling he could see the iridescent speckled pattern on the back the velociraptor was alert as it came forward it looked from side to side moving its head with abrupt birdlike jerks the head also bobbed up and down as it walked and the long straight tail dipped which heightened the impression of a bird a gigantic silent bird of prey the dining room was dark but apparently the raptor could see well enough to move steadily forward from time to time it would bend over lowering its head below the tables tim heard a rapid sniffing sound then the head would snap up alertly jerking back and fortb like a birds tim watched until he was sure the velociraptor was coming toward the kitchen was it following their scent all the books said dinosaurs had a poor sense of smell but this one seemed to do just fine anyway what did books know here was the real thing coming toward him he ducked back into the kitchen is something out there lex said tim didnt answer he pushed her under a table in the corner behind a large waste bin he leaned close to her and whispered fiercely stay here and then he ran for the refrigerator he grabbed a handful of cold steaks and hurried back to the door he quietly placed the first of the steaks on the floor then moved back a few steps and put down the second through his goggles he saw lex peeping around the bin he waved her back he placed the third steak and the fourth moving deeper into the kitchen the hissing was louder and then the clawed hand gripped the door and the big head peered cautiously around the velociraptor paused at the entrance to the kitchen tim stood in a halfcrouch at the back of the room near the far leg of the steel worktable but he had not had time to conceal himself his head and shoulders still protruded over the tabletop he was in clear view of the velociraptor slowly tim lowered his body sinking beneath the table the velociraptor jerked its head around looking directly at tim tim froze he was still exposed but he thought dont move the velociraptor stood motionless in the doorway sniffing its darker here tim thought he cant see so well its making him cautious but now he could smell the musty odor of the big reptile and through his goggles he saw the dinosaur silently yawn throwing back its long snout exposing rows of razorsharp teeth the velociraptor stared forward again jerking its head from side to side the big eyes swiveled in the bony sockets tim felt his heart pounding somehow it was worse to be confronted by an animal like this in a kitchen instead of the open forest the size the quick movements the pungent odor the hissing breath up close it was a much more frightening animal than the tyrannosaur the tyrannosaur was huge and powerful but it wasnt especially smart the velociraptor was mansize and it was clearly quick and intelligent tim feared the searching eyes almost as much as the sharp teeth the velociraptor sniffed it stepped forwardmoving directly toward lex it must smell her somehow tims heart thumped the velociraptor stopped it bent over slowly hes found the steak tim wanted to bend down to look below the table but he didnt dare move he stood frozen in a halfcrouch listening to the crunching sound the dinosaur was eating it bones and all the raptor raised its slender head and looked around it sniffed it saw the second steak it moved quickly forward it bent down silence the raptor didnt eat it the head came back up tims legs burned from the crouch but he didnt move why hadnt the animal eaten the second steak a dozen ideas flashed through his mindit didnt like the taste of beef it didnt like the coldness it didnt like the fact that the meat wasnt alive it smelled a trap it smelled lex it smelled tim it saw tim the velociraptor moved very quickly now it found the third steak dipped its head looked up again and moved on tim held his breath the dinosaur was now just a few feet from him tim could see the small twitches in the muscles of the flanks he could see the crusted blood on the claws of the hand he could see the fine pattern of striations within the spotted pattern and the folds of skin in the neck below the jaw the velociraptor sniffed it jerked its head and looked right at tim tim nearly gasped with fright tims body was rigid tense he watched as the reptile eye moved scanning the room another sniff hes got me tim thought then the head jerked back to look forward and the animal went on toward the fifth steak tim thought lex please dont move please dont move whatever you do please dont the velociraptor sniffed the steak and moved on it was now at the open door to the freezer tim could see the smoke billowing out curling along the floor toward the animals feet one big clawed foot lifted then came down again silently the dinosaur hesitated too cold tim thought he wont go in there its too cold he wont go in he wont go in he wont go in the dinosaur went in the head disappeared then the body then the stiff tail tim sprinted flinging his weight against the stainlesssteel door of the locker slamming it shut it slammed on the tip of the tail the door wouldnt shut the velociraptor roared a terrifying loud sound inadvertently tim took a step backthe tail was gone he slammed the door shut and heard it click closed lex lex he was screaming he heard the raptor pounding against the door felt it thumping the steel he knew there was a flat steel knob inside and if the raptor hit that it would knock the door open they had to get the door locked lex lex was by his side what do you want tim leaned against the horizontal door handle holding it shut theres a pin a little pin get the pin the velociraptor roared like a lion the sound muffled by the thick steel it crashed its whole body against the door i cant see anything lex shouted the pin was dangling beneath the door handle swinging on a little metal chain its right there i cant see it she screamed and then tim realized she wasnt wearing the goggles feel for it he saw her little hand reaching up touching his groping for the pin and with her so close to him he could feel how frightened she was her breath in little panicky gasps as she felt for the pin and the velociraptor slammed against the door and it openedgod it openedbut the animal hadnt expected that and had already turned back for another try and tim slammed the door shut again lex scrambled back reached up in the darkness i have it lex cried clutching the pin in her hand and she pushed it through the hole it slid out again from the top put it in from the top she held it again lifting it on the chain swinging it over the handle and down into the hole locked the velociraptor roared tim and lex stepped back from the door as the dinosaur slammed into it again with each impact the heavy steel wall hinges creaked but they held tim didnt think the animal could possibly open the door the raptor was locked in he gave a long sigh lets go he said he took her hand and they ran you should have seen them gennaro said as grant led him back out of the maintenance building there must have been two dozen of them compys i had to crawl into the truck to get away from them they were all over the windshield just squatting there waiting like buzzards but they ran away when you came over scavengers grant said they wont attack anything thats moving or looks strong they attack things that are dead or almost dead anyway unmoving they were going up the ladder now back toward the entrance door what happened to the raptor that attacked you grant said i dont know gennaro said did it leave i didnt see i got away i think because it was injured i think muldoon shot it in the leg and it was bleeding while it was in here then i dont know maybe it went back outside maybe it died in here i didnt see and maybe its still in here grant said wu stared out the lodge window at the raptors beyond the fence they still seemed playful making mock attacks at ellie the behavior had continued for a long time now and it occurred to him that it might be too long it almost seemed as if they were trying to keep ellies attention in the same way that she was trying to keep theirs the behavior of the dinosaurs had always been a minor consideration for wu and rightly so behavior was a secondorder effect of dna like protein enfolding you couldnt really predict behavior and you couldnt really control it except in very crude ways like making an animal dependent on a dietary substance by withholding an enzyme but in general behavioral effects were simply beyond the reach of understanding you couldnt look at a dna sequence and predict behavior it was impossible and that had made wus dna work purely empirical it was a matter of tinkering the way a modern workman might repair an antique grandfather clock you were dealing with something out of the past something constructed of ancient materials and following ancient rules you couldnt be certain why it worked as it did and it had been repaired and modified many times already by forces of evolution over eons of time so like the workman who makes an adjustment and then sees if the clock runs any better wu would make an adjustment and then see if the animals behaved any better and he only tried to correct gross behavior uncontrolled butting of the electrical fences or rubbing the skin raw on tree trunks those were the behaviors that sent him back to the drawing board and the limits of his science had left him with a mysterious feeling about the dinosaurs in the park he was never sure never really sure at all whether the behavior of the animals was historically accurate or not were they behaving as they really had in the past it was an open question ultimately unanswerable and though wu would never admit it the discovery that the dinosaurs were breeding represented a tremendous validation of his work a breeding animal was demonstrably effective in a fundamental way it implied that wu had put all the pieces together correctly he had recreated an animal millions of years old with such precision that the creature could even reproduce itself but still looking at the raptors outside he was troubled by the persistence of their behavior raptors were intelligent and intelligent animals got bored quickly intelligent animals also formed plans and harding came out into the hallway from malcolms room wheres ellie still outside better get her in the raptors have left the skylight when wu said moving to the door just a moment ago harding said wu threw open the front door ellie inside now she looked over at him puzzled theres no problem everythings under control now she shook her head i know what im doing she said now ellie damn it muldoon didnt like wu standing there with the door open and he was about to say so when he saw a shadow descend from above and he realized at once what had happened wu was yanked bodily out the door and muldoon heard ellie screaming muldoon got to the door and looked out and saw that wu was lying on his back his body already torn open by the big claw and the raptor was jerking its head tugging at wus intestines even though wu was still alive still feebly reaching up with his hands to push the big head away he was being eaten while he was still alive and then ellie stopped screaming and started to run along the inside of the fence and muldoon slammed the door shut dizzy with horror it had happened so fast harding said he jumped down from the roof muldoon nodded he went to the window and looked out and he saw that the three raptors outside the fence were now running away but they werent following ellie they were going back toward the visitor center grant came to the edge of the maintenance building and peered forward in the fog he could hear the snarls of the raptors and they seemed to be coming closer now he could see their bodies running past him they were going to the visitor center he looked back at gennaro gennaro shook his head no grant leaned close and whispered in his ear no choice weve got to turn on the computer grant set out in the fog after a moment gennaro followed ellie didnt stop to think when the raptors dropped inside the fence to attack wu she just turned and ran as fast as she could toward the far end of the lodge there was a space fifteen feet wide between the fence and the lodge she ran not hearing the animals pursuing her just hearing her own breath she rounded the corner saw a tree growing by the side of the building and leapt grabbing a branch swinging up she didnt feel panic she felt a kind of exhilaration as she kicked and saw her legs rise up in front of her face and she hooked her legs over a branch farther up tightened her gut and pulled up quickly she was already twelve feet off the ground and the raptors still werent following her and she was beginning to feel pretty good when she saw the first animal at the base of the tree its mouth was bloody and bits of stringy flesh hung from its jaws she continued to go up fast hand over hand just reaching and going and she could almost see the top of the building she looked down again the two raptors were climbing the tree now she was at the level of the rooftop she could see the gravel only four feet away and the glass pyramids of the skylights sticking up in the mist there was a door on the roof she could get inside in a single heaving effort she flung herself through the air and landed sprawling on the gravel she scraped her face but somehow the only sensation was exhilaration as if it were a kind of game she was playing a game she intended to win she ran for the door that led to the stairwell behind her she could hear the raptors shaking the branches of the tree they were still in the tree she reached the door and twisted the knob the door was locked it took a moment for the meaning of that to cut through her euphoria the door was locked she was on the roof and she couldnt get down the door was locked she pounded on the door in frustration and then she ran for the far side of the roof hoping to see a way down but there was only the green outline of the swimming pool through the blowing mist all around the pool was concrete decking ten twelve feet of concrete too much for her to jump across no other trees to climb down no stairs no fire escape nothing ellie turned back and saw the raptors jumping easily to the roof she ran to the far end of the building hoping there might be another door there but there wasnt the raptors came slowly toward her stalking her slipping silently among the glass pyramids she looked down the edge of the pool was ten feet away too far the raptors were closer starting to move apart and illogically she thought isnt this always the way some little mistake screws it all up she still felt giddy still felt exhilaration and she somehow couldnt believe these animals were going to get her she couldnt believe that now her life was going to end like this it didnt seem possible she was enveloped in a kind of protective cheerfulness she just didnt believe it would happen the raptors snarled ellie backed away moving to the far end of the roof she took a breath and then began to sprint toward the edge as she raced toward the edge she saw the swimming pool and she knew it was too far away but she thought what the hell and leapt into space and fell and with a stinging shock she felt herself enveloped in coldness she was underwater she had done it she came to the surface and looked up at the roof and saw the raptors looking down at her and she knew that if she could do it the raptors could do it too she splashed in the water and thought can raptors swim but she was sure they could they could probably swim like crocodiles the raptors turned away from the edge of the roof and then she heard harding calling sattler and she realized he had opened the roof door the raptors were going toward him hurriedly she climbed out of the pool and ran toward the lodge harding had gone up the steps to the roof two at a time and he had flung open the door without thinking sattler he shouted and then he stopped mist blew among the pyramids on the roof the raptors were not in sight sattler he was so preoccupied with sattler that it was a moment before he realized his mistake he should be able to see the animals he thought in the next instant the clawed forearm smashed around the side of the door catching him in the chest with a tearing pain and it took all of his effort to pull himself backward and close the door on the arm and from downstairs he heard muldoon sbouting shes here shes already inside from the other side of the door the raptor snarled and harding slammed the door again and the claws pulled back and he closed the door with a metallic clang and sank coughing to the floor where are we going lex said they were on the second floor of the visitor center a glasswalled corridor ran the length of the building to the control room tim said wheres that down here someplace tim looked at the names stenciled on the doors as he went past them these seemed to be offices park warden guest services general manager comptroller they came to a glass partition marked with a sign closed area authorized personnel only beyond this point there was a slot for a security card but tim just pushed the door open how come it opened the power is out tim said whyre we going to the control room she asked to find a radio we need to call somebody beyond the glass door the hallway continued tim remembered this area he had seen it earlier during the tour lex trotted along at his side in the distance they heard the snarling of raptors the animals seemed to be approaching then tim heard them slamming against the glass downstairs theyre out there lex whispered dont worry what are they doing here lex said never mind now park supervisor operations main control here tim said he pushed open the door the main control room was as he had seen it before in the center of the room was a console with four chairs and four computer monitors the room was entirely dark except for the monitors which all showed a series of colored rectangles so wheres a radio lex said but tim had forgotten all about a radio he moved forward staring at the computer screens the screens were on that could only mean the power must be back on ick lex said shifting her body what i was standing on somebodys ear she said tim hadnt seen a body when they came in he looked back and saw there was just an ear lying on the floor that is really disgusting lex said never mind he turned to the monitors wheres the rest of him she said never mind that now he peered closely at the monitor there were rows of colored labels on the screen picture you better not fool around with that timmy she said dont worry i wont he had seen complicated computers before like the ones that were installed in the buildings his father worked on those computers controlled everything from the elevators and security to the heating and cooling systems they looked basically like thisa lot of colored labelsbut they were usually simpler to understand and almost always there was a help label if you needed to learn about the system but he saw no help label here he looked again to be sure but then he saw something else numerals clicking in the upper left corner of the screen they read then tim realized it was the time there were only thirteen minutes left for the boatbut he was more worried about the people in the lodge there was a static crackle he turned and saw lex holding a radio she was twisting the knobs and dials how does it work she said i cant make it work give me that its mine i found it give it to me lex i get to use it first lex suddenly the radio crackled what the hell is going on said muldoons voice surprised lex dropped the radio on the floor grant ducked back crouching among the palm trees through the mist ahead he could see the raptors hopping and snarling and butting their heads against the glass of the visitor center but between snarls they would fall silent and cock their heads as if listening to something distant and then they would make little whimpering sounds whatre they doing gennaro said it looks like theyre trying to get into the cafeteria grant said whats in the cafeteria i left the kids there grant said can they break through that glass i dont think so no grant watched and now he heard the crackle of a distant radio and the raptors began hopping in a more agitated way one after another they began jumping higher and higher until finally he saw the first of them leap lightly onto the secondfloor balcony and from there move inside the second floor of the visitor center in the control room on the second floor tim snatched up the radio which lex had dropped he pressed the button hello hello s that you tim it was muldoons voice its me yes where are you in the control room the power is on thats great tim muldoon said if someone will tell me how to turn the computer on ill do it there was a silence hello tim said did you hear me ah we have a problem about that muldoon said nobody ah who is here knows how to do that how to turn the computer on tim said what are you kidding nobody knows it seemed incredible no a pause i think its something about the main grid turning on the main grid you know anything about computers tim tim stared at the screen lex nudged him tell him no timmy she said yes some i know something tim said might as well try muldoon said nobody here knows what to do and grant doesnt know about computers okay tim said ill try he clicked off the radio and stared at the screen studying it timmy lex said you dont know what to do yes i do if you know then do it lex said just a minute as a way to get started he pulled the chair close to the keyboard and pressed the cursor keys those were the keys that moved the cursor around on the screen but nothing happened then he pushed other keys the screen remained unchanged well she said somethings wrong tim said frowning you just dont know timmy she said he examined the computer again looking at it carefully the keyboard had a row of function keys at the top just like a regular pc keyboard and the monitor was big and in color but the monitor housing was sort of unusual tim looked at the edges of the screen and saw lots of faint pinpoints of red light red light all around the borders of the screen what could that be he moved his finger toward the light and saw the soft red glow on his skin he touched the screen and heard a beep picture a moment later the message box disappeared and the original screen flashed back up what happened lex said what did you do you touched something of course he thought he had touched the screen it was a touch screen the red lights around the edges must be infrared sensors tim had never seen such a screen but hed read about them in magazines he touched resetrevert instantly the screen changed he got a new message the computer is now reset make your selection from the main screen over the radio they heard the sound of raptors snarling i want to see lex said you should try view no lex well i want view she said and before he could grab her hand she had pressed view the screen changed picture uhoh she said lex will you cut it out look she said it worked ha around the room the monitors showed quickly changing views of different parts of the park most of the images were misty gray because of the exterior fog but one showed the outside of the lodge with a raptor on the roof and then another switched to an image in bright sunlight showing the bow of a ship bright sunlight what was that tim said leaning forward what that picture but the image had already changed and now they were seeing the inside of the lodge one room after another and then he saw malcolm lying in a bed stop it lex said i see them tim touched the screen in several places and got submenus then more submenus wait lex said youre confusing it will you shut up you dont know anything about computers now he had a list of monitors on the screen one of them was marked safari lodge lv another was remote shipboard vnd he pressed the screen several times video images came up on monitors around the room one showed the bow of the supply ship and the ocean ahead in the distance tim saw landbuildings along a shore and a harbor he recognized the harbor because he had flown over it in the helicopter the day before it was puntarenas the ship seemed to be just minutes from landing but his attention was drawn by the next screen which showed the roof of the safari lodge in gray mist the raptors were mostly bidden behind the pyramids but their heads bobbed up and down coming into view and then on the third monitor he could see inside a room malcolm was lying in a bed and ellie stood next to him they were both looking upward as they watched muldoon walked into the room and joined them looking up with an expression of concern they see us lex said i dont think so the radio crackled on the screen muldoon lifted the radio to his lips hello tim im here tim said ah we havent got a whole lot of time muldoon said dully better get that power grid on and then tim heard the raptors snarl and saw one of the long heads duck down through the glass briefly entering the picture from the top snapping its jaws hurry timmy lex said get the power on the grid tim suddenly found himself lost in a tangled series of monitor control screens as he tried to get back to the main screen most systems had a single button or a single command to return to the previous screen or to the main menu but this system did notor at least he didnt know it also he was certain that help commands had been built into the system but he couldnt find them either and lex was jumping up and down and shouting in his ear making him nervous finally he got the main screen back he wasnt sure what he had done but it was back he paused looking for a command do something timmy will you shut up im trying to get help he pushed templatemain the screen filled with a complicated diagram with interconnecting boxes and arrows no good no good he pushed common interface the screen shifted picture whats that lex said why arent you turning on the power timmy he ignored her maybe help on this system was called info he pushed info picture timee lex wailed but he had already pushed find he got another useless window he pushed go back on the radio he heard muldoon say hows it coming tim he didnt bother to answer frantic he pushed buttons one after another suddenly without warning the main screen was back picture he studied the screen electrical main and setgrids dnl both looked like they might have something to do with grids he noticed that safetyhealth and critical locks might be important too he heard the growl of the raptors he had to make a choice he pressed setgrids dnl and groaned when he saw it picture he didnt know what to do he pushed standard parameters standard parameters park grids bc outer grids cd zoological grids bb pen grids rr lodge grids fd maint grids el main grids cg sensor grids dg utility grids ahb core grids alcl circuit integrity not tested security grids remain automatic tim shook his head in frustration it took him a moment to realize that he had just gotten valuable information he now knew the grid coordinates for the lodge he pushed grid f power grid f safari lodce command cannot be executed error power incompatible with command error ref manual pages its not working lex said i know he pushed another button the screen flashed again power grid d safari lodce command cannot be executed error power incompatible with command error ref manual pages tim tried to stay calm to think it through for some reason he was getting a consistent error message whenever he tried to turn on a grid it was saying the power was incompatible with the command he was giving but what did that mean why was power incompatible timmy lex said tugging at his arm not now lex yes now she said and she pulled him away from the screen and the console and then he heard the snarling of raptors it was coming from the hallway in the skylight above malcolms bed the raptors had almost bitten through the second metal bar they could now poke their heads entirely through the shattered glass and lunge and snarl at the people below then after a moment they would pull back and resume chewing on the metal malcolm said it wont be long now three four minutes he pressed the button on the radio tim are you there tim there was no answer tim slipped out the door and saw the velociraptor down at the far end of the corridor standing by the balcony he stared in astonishment how had it gotten out of the freezer then as he watched a second raptor suddenly appeared on the balcony and he understood the raptor hadnt come from the freezer at all it had come from outside it had jumped from the ground below the second raptor landed silently perfectly balanced on the railing tim couldnt believe it the big animal had jumped ten feet straight up more than ten feet their legs must be incredibly powerful lex whispered i thought you said they couldnt ssshh tim was trying to think but he watched with a kind of fascinated dread as the third raptor leapt to the balcony the animals milled aimlessly in the corridor for a moment and then they began to move forward in single file coming toward him and lex quietly tim pushed against the door at his back to reenter the control room but the door was stuck he pushed harder were locked out lex whispered look she pointed to the slot for the security card alongside the door a bright red dot glowed somehow the security doors had been activated you idiot you locked us out tim looked down the corridor he saw several more doors but each had a red light glowing alongside that meant all the doors were locked there was nowhere they could go then he saw a slumped shape on the floor at the far end of the corridor it was a dead guard a white security card was clipped to his belt come on he whispered they ran for the guard tim got the card and turned back but of course the raptors had seen them they snarled and blocked the way back to the control room they began to spread apart fanning out in the hallway to surround tim and lex their heads began to duck rhythmically they were going to attack tim did the only thing he could do using the card he opened the nearest door off the hallway and pushed lex through as the door began to close slowly behind them the raptors hissed and charged lodge ian malcolm drew each breath as if it might be his last he watched the raptors with dull eyes harding took his blood pressure frowned took it again ellie sattler was wrapped in a blanket shivering and cold muldoon sat on the floor propped against the wall hammond was staring upward not speaking they all listened to the radio what happened to tim hammond said still no word i dont know malcolm said ugly arent they truly ugly hammond shook his head who could have imagined it would turn out this way ellie said apparently malcolm did i didnt imagine it malcolm said i calculated it hammond sighed no more of this please hes been saying i told you so for hours but nobody ever wanted this to happen it isnt a matter of wanting it or not malcolm said eyes closed he spoke slowly through the drugs its a matter of what you think you can accomplish when the hunter goes out in the rain forest to seek food for his family does he expect to control nature no he imagines that nature is beyond him beyond his understanding beyond his control maybe he prays to nature to the fertility of the forest that provides for him he prays because he knows he doesnt control it hes at the mercy of it but you decide you wont be at the mercy of nature you decide youll control nature and from that moment on youre in deep trouble because you cant do it yet you have made systems that require you to do it and you cant do itand you never haveand you never will dont confuse things you can make a boat but you cant make the ocean you can make an airplane but you cant make the air your powers are much less than your dreams of reason would have you believe hes lost me hammond said with a sigh where did tim go he seemed such a responsible boy im sure hes trying to get control of the situation malcolm said like everybody else and grant too what happened to grant grant reached the rear door to the visitor center the same door he had left twenty minutes before he tugged on the handle it was locked then he saw the little red light the security doors were reactivated damn he ran around to the front of the building and went through the shattered front doors into the main lobby stopping by the guard desk where he had been earlier he could hear the dry hiss of his radio he went to the kitchen looking for the kids but the kitchen door was open the kids gone he went upstairs but came to the glass panel marked closed area and the door was locked he needed a security card to go farther grant couldnt get in from somewhere inside the hallway he heard the raptors snarling the leathery reptile skin touched tims face the claws tore his shirt and tim fell onto his back shrieking in fright timmy lex yelled tim scrambled to his feet again the baby velociraptor perched on his shoulder chirping and squeaking in panic tim and lex were in the white nursery there were toys on the floor a rolling yellow ball a doll a plastic rattle its the baby raptor lex said pointing to the animal gripping tims shoulder the little raptor burrowed its head into tims neck the poor thing was probably starving tim thought lex came closer and the baby hopped onto her shoulder it rubbed against her neck why is it doing that she said is it scared i dont know tim said she passed the raptor back to tim the baby was chirping and squeaking and hopping up and down on his shoulder excitedly it kept looking around head moving quickly no doubt about it the little thing was worked up and tim lex whispered the door to the hallway laadnt closed behind them after they entered the nursery now the big velociraptors were coming through first one then a second one clearly agitated the baby chirped and bounced on tims shoulder tim knew he had to get away maybe the baby would distract them after all it was a baby raptor he plucked the little animal from his shoulder and threw it across the room the baby scurried between the legs of the adults the first raptor lowered its snout sniffed at the baby delicately tim took lexs hand and pulled her deeper into the nursery he had to find a door a way to get out there was a high piercing shriek tim looked back to see the baby in the jaws of the adult a second velociraptor came forward and tore at the limbs of the infant trying to pull it from the mouth of the first the two raptors fought over the baby as it squealed blood splattered in large drops onto the floor they ate him lex said the raptors fought over the remains of the baby rearing back and butting heads tim found a doorit was unlockedand went through pulling lex after him they were in another room and from the deep green glow he realized it was the deserted dnaextraction laboratory the rows of stereo microscopes abandoned the highresolution screens showing frozen giant blackandwhite images of insects the flies and gnats that had bitten dinosaurs millions of years ago sucking the blood that now had been used to recreate dinosaurs in the park they ran through the laboratory and tim could hear the snorts and snarls of the raptors pursuing them coming closer and then he went to the back of the lab and through a door that must have had an alarm because in the narrow corridor an intermittent siren sounded shrilly and the lights overhead flashed on and off running down the corridor tim was plunged into darknessthen light againthen darkness over the sound of the alarm he heard the raptors snort as they pursued him lex was whimpering and moaning tim saw another door ahead with the blue biohazard sign and he slammed into the door and moved beyond it and suddenly he collided with something big and lex shrieked in terror take it easy kids a voice said tim blinked in disbelief standing above him was dr grant and next to him was mr gennaro outside in the hallway it had taken grant nearly two minutes to realize that the dead guard down in the lobby probably had a security card hed gone back and gotten it and entered the upper corridor moving quickly down the hallway he had followed the sound of the raptors and found them fighting in the nursery he was sure the kids would have gone to the next room and had immediately run to the extractions lab and there hed met the kids now the raptors were coming toward them the animals seemed momentarily hesitant surprised by the appearance of more people grant pushed the kids into gennaros arms and said take them back someplace safe but through there grant said pointing over his shoulder to a far door take them to the control room if you can you should all be safe there what are you going to do gennaro said the raptors stood near the door grant noticed that they waited until all the animals were together and then they moved forward as a group pack hunters he shivered i have a plan grant said now go on gennaro led the kids away the raptors continued slowly toward grant moving past the supercomputers past the screens that still blinked endless sequences of computerdeciphered code the raptors came forward without hesitation sniffing the floor repeatedly ducking their heads grant heard the door click behind him and glanced over his shoulder everybody was standing on the other side of the glass door watching him gennaro shook his head grant knew what it meant there was no door to the control room beyond gennaro and the kids were trapped in there it was up to him now grant moved slowly edging around the laboratory leading the raptors away from gennaro and the kids he could see another door nearer the front which was marked to laboratory whatever that meant he had an idea and he hoped he was right the door had a blue biohazard sign the raptors were coming closer grant turned and slammed into the door and moved beyond it into a deep warm silence he turned yes he was where he wanted to be in the hatchery beneath infrared lights long tables with rows of eggs and a low clinging mist the rockers on the tables clicked and whirred in a steady motion the mist poured over the sides of the tables and drifted to the floor where it disappeared evaporated grant ran directly to the rear of the hatchery into a glasswalled laboratory with ultraviolet light his clothing glowed blue he looked around at the glass reagents beakers full of pipettes glass dishes all delicate laboratory equipment the raptors entered the room cautiously at first sniffing the humid air looking at the long rocking tables of eggs the lead animal wiped its bloody jaws with the back of its forearm silently the raptors passed between the long tables the animals moved through the room in a coordinated way ducking from time to time to peer beneath the tables they were looking for him grant crouched and moved to the back of the laboratory looked up and saw the metal hood marked with a skull and crossbones a sign said caution biogenic toxins a precautions required grant remembered that regis had said they were powerful poisons only a few molecules would kill instantaneously the hood lay flush against the surface of the lab table grant could not slip his hand under it he tried to open it but there was no door no handle no way that he could see grant rose slowly and glanced back at the main room the raptors were still moving among the tables he turned to the hood he saw an odd metal fixture sunk into the surface of the table it looked like an outdoor electrical outlet with a round cover he flipped up the cover saw a button pressed it with a soft hiss the hood slid upward to the ceiling he saw glass shelves above him and rows of bottles marked with a skull and crossbones he peered at the labels cck tetpaalpha secretin thymolevin x the fluids glowed pale green in the ultraviolet light nearby he saw a glass dish with syringes in it the syringes were small each containing a tiny amount of green glowing fluid crouched in the blue darkness grant reached for the dish of syringes the needles on the syringes were capped in plastic he removed one cap pulling it off with his teeth he looked at the thin needle he moved forward toward the raptors he had devoted his whole life to studying dinosaurs now he would see how much he really knew velociraptors were small carnivorous dinosaurs like oviraptors and dromaeosaurs animals that were long thought to steal eggs just as certain modern birds ate the eggs of other birds grant had always assumed that velociraptors would eat dinosaur eggs if they could he crept forward to the nearest egg table in the hatchery slowly he reached up into the mist and took a large egg from the rocking table the egg was almost the size of a football creamcolored with faint pink speckling he held the egg carefully while he stuck the needle through the shell and injected the contents of the syringe the egg glowed faint blue grant bent down again beneath the table he saw the legs of the raptors and the mist pouring down from the tabletops he rolled the glowing egg along the floor toward the raptors the raptors looked up hearing the faint rumble as the egg rolled and jerked their heads around then they resumed their slow stalking search the egg stopped several yards from the nearest raptor damn grant did it all again quietly reaching up for an egg bringing it down injecting it and rolling it toward the raptors this time the egg came to rest by the foot of one velociraptor it rocked gently clicking against the big toe claw the raptor looked down in surprise at this new gift it bent over and sniffed the glowing egg it rolled the egg with its snout along the floor for a moment and ignored it the velociraptor stood upright again and slowly moved on continuing to search it wasnt working grant reached for a third egg and injected it with a fresh syringe he held the glowing egg in his hands and rolled it again but he rolled this one fast like a bowling ball the egg rattled across the floor loudly one of the animals heard the soundducked downsaw it coming and instinctively chased the moving object gliding swiftly among the tables to intercept the egg as it rolled the big jaws snapped down and bit into it crushing the shell the raptor stood pale albumen dripping from its jaws it licked its lips noisily and snorted it bit again and lapped the egg from the floor but it didnt seem to be in the least distressed it bent over to eat again from the broken egg grant looked down to see what would happen from across the room the raptor saw him it was looking right at him the velociraptor snarled menacingly it moved toward grant crossing the room in long incredibly swift strides grant was shocked to see it happening and froze in panic when suddenly the animal made a gasping gurgling sound and the big body pitched forward onto the ground the heavy tail thumped the floor in spasms the raptor continued to make choking sounds punctuated by intermittent loud shrieks foam bubbled from its mouth the head flopped back and forth the tail slammed and thumped thats one grant thought but it wasnt dying very fast it seemed to take forever to die grant reached up for another eggand saw that the other raptors in the room were frozen in midaction they listened to the sound of the dying animal one cocked its head then another and another the first animal moved to look at the fallen raptor the dying raptor was now twitching the whole body shaking on the floor it made pitiful moans so much foam bubbled from its mouth that grant could hardly see the head any more it flopped on the floor and moaned again the second raptor bent over the fallen animal examining it it appeared to be puzzled by these death throes cautiously it looked at the foaming head then moved down to the twitching neck the heaving ribs the legs and it took a bite from the hind leg the dying animal snarled and suddenly lifted its head and twisted sinking its teeth into the neck of its attacker thats two grant thought but the standing animal wrenched free blood flowed from its neck it struck out with its hind claws and with a single swift movement ripped open the belly of the fallen animal coils of intestine fell out like fat snakes the screams of the dying raptor filled the room the attacker turned away as if fighting was suddenly too much trouble it crossed the room ducked down and came up with a glowing egg grant watched as the raptor bit into it the glowing material dripping down its chin that makes two the second raptor was stricken almost instantly coughing and pitching forward as it fell it knocked over a table dozens of eggs rolled everywhere across the floor grant looked at them in dismay there was still a third raptor left grant had one more syringe with so many eggs rolling on the floor he would have to do something else he was trying to decide what to do when the last animal snorted irritably grant looked upthe raptor had spotted him the final raptor did not move for a long time it just stared and then it slowly quietly came forward stalking him bobbing up and down looking first beneath the tables then above them it moved deliberately cautiously with none of the swiftness that it had displayed in a pack a solitary animal now it was careful it never took its eyes off grant grant looked around quickly there was nowhere for him to hide nothing for him to do grants gaze was fixed on the raptor moving slowly laterally grant moved too he tried to keep as many tables as he could between himself and the advancing animal slowly slowly he moved to the left the raptor advanced in the dark red gloom of the hatchery its breath came in soft hisses through flared nostrils grant felt eggs breaking beneath his feet the yolk sticking to the soles of his shoes he crouched down felt the bulge of the radio in his pocket the radio he pulled it from his pocket and turned it on hello this is grant alan ellies voice alan listen he said softly just talk alan is that you talk he said again and he pushed the radio across the floor away from him toward the advancing raptor he crouched behind a table leg and waited alan speak to me please then a crackle and silence the radio remained silent the raptor advanced soft hissing breath the radio was still silent what was the matter with her didnt she understand in the darkness the raptor came closer alan the tinny voice from the radio made the big animal pause it sniffed the air as if sensing someone else in the room alan its me i dont know if you can hear me the raptor now turned away from grant and moved toward the radio alan please why hadnt he pushed the radio farther away the raptor was going toward it but it was close the big foot came down very near him grant could see the pebbled skin the soft green glow the streaks of dried blood on the curved claw he could smell the strong reptile odor alan listen to me alan the raptor bent over poked at the radio on the floor tentatively its body was turned away from grant the big tail was right above grants head grant reached up and jabbed the syringe deep into the flesh of the tail and injected the poison the velociraptor snarled and jumped with frightening speed it swung back toward grant jaws wide it snapped its jaws closing on the table leg and jerked its head up the table was knocked away and grant fell back now completely exposed the raptor loomed over him rising up its head banging into the infrared lights above making them swing crazily alan the raptor reared back and lifted its clawed foot to kick grant rolled and the foot slammed down just missing him he felt a searing sharp pain along his shoulder blades the sudden warm flow of blood over his shirt he rolled across the floor crushing eggs smearing his hands his face the raptor kicked again smashing down on the radio spattering sparks it snarled in rage and kicked a third time and grant came to the wall nowhere else to go and the animal raised its foot a final time and toppled backward the animal was wheezing foam came from its mouth gennaro and the kids came into the room grant signaled them to stay back the girl looked at the dying animal and said softly wow gennaro helped grant to his feet they all turned and ran for the control room control tim was astonished to find the screen in the control room was now flashing on and off lex said what happened picture tim saw dr grant staring at the screen and gingerly moving his hand toward the keyboard i dont know about computers grant said shaking his head but tim was already sliding into the seat he touched the screen rapidly on the video monitors he could see the boat moving closer to puntarenas it was now only about two hundred yards from the dock on the other monitor he saw the lodge with the raptors hanging down from the ceiling on the radio he heard their snarls do something timmy lex said he pushed setgrids dnl even though it was flashing the screen answered warning command execution aborted aux power low what does that mean tim said gennaro snapped his fingers that happened before it means auxiliary power is low you have to turn on main power i do he pushed electrical main picture tim groaned what are you doing now grant said the whole screen was starting to flash tim pushed main nothing happened the screen continued to flash tim pushed main grid p he felt sick to his stomach with fear main power grid not activeauxiliary power only the screen was still flashing he pushed main set main power activated all the lights in the room came on all the monitor screens stopped flashing hey all right tim pressed reset grids nothing happened for a moment he glanced at the video monitors then back at the main screen picture grant said something that tim didnt hear he only heard the tension in his voice he was looking at tim worried tim felt his heart thumping in his chest lex was yelling at him he didnt want to look at the video monitor anymore he could hear the sound of the bars bending in the lodge and the raptors snarling he heard malcolm say dear god he pushed lodge specify grid number to reset for a frozen interminable moment he couldnt remember the number but then he remembered f and he pressed that activating lodge grid f now on the video monitor he saw an explosion of sparks sputtering down from the ceiling of the hotel room the monitor flared white lex shouted what did you do but almost immediately the image came back and they could see that the raptors were caught between the bars writhing and screaming in a hot cascade of sparks while muldoon and the others cheered their voices tinny over the radio thats it grant said slapping tim on the back thats it you did it they were all standing and jumping up and down when lex said what about the ship the what the ship she said and pointed to the screen on the monitor the buildings beyond the bow of the ship were much larger and moving to the right as the ship turned left and prepared to dock he saw crewmen heading out to the bow preparing to tie up tim scrambled back to his seat and stared at the startup screen he studied the screen telecom vbb and telecom rsd both looked like they might have something to do with telephones he pressed telecom rsd you have waiting calls andor messages do you wish to receive them now he pushed no maybe the ship was one of the waiting calls lex said maybe that way you could get the phone number he ignored her enter the numer you wish to call or press f for directory he pushed f and suddenly names and numbers spilled over the screen an enormous directory it wasnt alphabetical and it took a while to scan it visually before he found what he was looking for vsl anne b freddy now all he had to do was figure out how to dial he pushed a row of buttons at the bottom of the screen dial now or dial later he pushed dial now were sorry your call cannot be completed as dialed error please try again he tried it again he heard a dial tone then the tone of the numbers being automatically dialed in rapid succession is that it grant said pretty good timmy lex said but theyre almost there on the screen they could see the prow of the ship closing on the puntarenas dock they heard a highpitched squeal and then a voice said ah hello john this is freddy do you read me over tim picked up a phone on the console but heard only a dial tone ah hello john this is freddy over answer it lex said now they were all picking up phones lifting every receiver in sight but they heard only dial tones finally tim saw a phone mounted on the side of the console with a blinking light ah hello control this is freddy do you read me over tim grabbed the receiver hello this is tim murphy and i need you to ah say again didnt get that john dont land the boat do you hear me there was a pause then a puzzled voice said sounds like some damn kid tim said dont land the ship come back to the island the voices sounded distant and scratchy did hename was murphy and another voice said i didnt getname tim looked frantically at the others gennaro reached for the phone let me do this can you get his name there was the sharp crackle of static got to be a joke or elsea frigging ham operatoromething tim was working on the keyboard there was probably some kind of a way to find out who freddy was can you hear me gennaro said into the phone if you can hear me answer me now over son came the drawled reply we dont know who the hell you are but youre not funny and were about to dock and weve got work to do now identify yourself properly or get off this channel tim watched as the screen printed out farrell frederick d capt try this for identification captain farrell gennaro said if you dont turn that boat around and return to this island immediately you will be found in violation of section of the uniform maritime act you will he subject to revocation of license penalties in excess of fifty thousand dollars and five years in jail do you hear that there was a silence do you copy that captain farrell and then distantly they heard a voice say i copy and another voice said all ahead stern the boat began to turn away from the dock lex began to cheer tim collapsed back in the chair wiping the sweat from his forehead grant said whats the uniform maritime act who the hell knows gennaro said they all watched the screen in satisfaction the boat was definitely heading away from the shore i guess the hard parts finished gennaro said grant shook his head the hard part he said is just beginning seventh iteration increasingly the mathematics will demand the courage to face its implications ian malcolm destroying the world they moved malcolm to another room in the lodge to a clean bed hammond seemed to revive and began bustling around straightening up well he said at least disaster is averted what disaster is that malcolm said sighing well hammond said they didnt get free and overrun the world malcolm sat up on one elbow you were worried about that surely thats what was at stake hammond said these animals lacking predators might get out and destroy the planet you egomaniacal idiot malcolm said in fury do you have any idea what you are talking about you think you can destroy the planet my what intoxicating power you must have malcolm sank back on the bed you cant destroy this planet you cant even come close most people believe hammond said stiffly that the planet is in jeopardy well its not malcolm said all the experts agree that our planet is in trouble malcolm sighed let me tell you about our planet he said our planet is four and a half billion years old there has been life on this planet for nearly that long three point eight billion years the first bacteria and later the first multicellular animals then the first complex creatures in the sea on the land then the great sweeping ages of animalsthe amphibians the dinosaurs the mammals each lasting millions upon millions of years great dynasties of creatures arising flourishing dying away all this happening against a background of continuous and violent upheaval mountain ranges thrust up and eroded away cometary impacts volcanic eruptions oceans rising and falling whole continents moving endless constant and violent change even today the greatest geographical feature on the planet comes from two great continents colliding buckling to make the himalayan mountain range over millions of years the planet has survived everything in its time it will certainly survive us hammond frowned just because it lasted a long time he said doesnt mean it is permanent if there was a radiation accident suppose there was malcolm said lets say we had a bad one and all the plants and animals died and the earth was clicking hot for a hunred thousand years life would survive somewhereunder the soil or perhaps frozen in arctic ice and after all those years when the planet was no longer inhospitable life would again spread over the planet the evolutionary process would begin again it might take a few billion years for life to regain its present variety and of course it would be very different from what it is now but the earth would survive our folly life would survive our folly only we malcolm said think it wouldnt hammond said well if the ozone layer gets thinner there will be more ultraviolet radiation reaching the surface so what well itll cause skin cancer malcolm shook his head ultraviolet radiation is good for life its powerful energy it promotes mutation change many forms of life will thrive with more uv radiation and many others will die out hammond said malcolm sighed you think this is the first time such a thing has happened dont you know about oxygen i know its necessary for life it is now malcolm said but oxygen is actually a metabolic poison its a corrosive gas like fluorine which is used to etch glass and when oxygen was first produced as a waste product by certain plant cellssay around three billion years agoit created a crisis for all other life on our planet those plant cells were polluting the environment with a deadly poison they were exhaling a lethal gas and building up its concentration a planet like venus has less than one percent oxygen on earth the concentration of oxygen was going up rapidlyfive ten eventually twentyone percent earth had an atmosphere of pure poison incompatible with life hammond looked irritated so what is your point that modern pollutants will be incorporated too no malcolm said my point is that life on earth can take care of itself in the thinking of a human being a hundred years is a long time a hundred years ago we didnt have cars and airplanes and computers and vaccines it was a whole different world but to the earth a hundred years is nothing a million years is nothing this planet lives and breathes on a much vaster scale we cant imagine its slow and powerful rhythms and we havent got the humility to try we have been residents here for the blink of an eye if we are gone tomorrow the earth will not miss us and we very well might be gone hammond said huffing yes malcolm said we might so what are you saying we shouldnt care about the environment no of course not then what malcolm coughed and stared into the distance lets be clear the planet is not in jeopardy we are in jeopardy we havent got the power to destroy the planetor to save it but we might have the power to save ourselves under control four hours had passed it was afternoon the sun was falling the air conditioning was back on in the control room and the computer was functioning properly as near as they could determine out of twentyfour people on the island eight were dead and six more were missing the visitor center and the safari lodge were both secure and the northern perimeter seemed to be clear of dinosaurs they had called authorities in san jose for help the costa rican national guard was on its way as well as an air ambulance to carry malcolm to a hospital but over the telephone the costa rican guard had been distinctly cautious undoubtedly calls would go back and forth between san jose and washington before help was finally sent to the island and now it was growing late in the day if the helicopters did not arrive soon they would have to wait until morning in the meantime there was nothing to do but wait the ship was returning the crew had discovered three young raptors scampering about in one of the aft holds and had killed the animals on isla nublar the immediate danger appeared to have passed everyone was in either the visitor center or the lodge tim had gotten quite good with the computer and he flashed up a new screen total animals species expected found ver tyrannosaurs maiasaurs stegosaurs triceratops procompsognathids othnielia velociraptors apatosaurs hadrosaurs dilophosaurs pterosaurs hypsilophodontids euoplocepbalids styracosaurs callovosaurs total what the hell is it doing now gennaro said now it says there are fewer animals grant nodded probably ellie said jurassic park is finally coming under control meaning what equilibrium grant pointed to the monitors on one of them the hypsilophodonts leapt into the air as a pack of velociraptors entered the field from the west the fences have been down for hours grant said the animals are mingling with each other populations reaching equilibriums true jurassic equilibrium i dont think it was supposed to happen gennaro said the animals were never supposed to mix well they are on another monitor grant saw a pack of raptors racing at full speed across an open field toward a fourton hadrosaur the hadrosaur turned to flee and one of the raptors lumped onto its back biting into the long neck while others raced forward circled around it nipped at its legs leapt up to slash at the belly with their powerful claws within minutes six raptors had brought down the larger animal grant stared silently ellie said is it the way you imagined i dont know what i imagined he said he watched the monitor no not exactly muldoon said quietly you know it appears all the adult raptors are out right now grant didnt pay much attention at first he just watched the monitors the interaction of the great animals in the south the stegosaur was swinging its spiked tail warily circling the baby tyrannosaur which watched it bemused and occasionally lunged forward to nip ineffectually at the spikes in the western quadrant the adult triceratopsians were fighting among themselves charging and locking horns one animal already lay wounded and dying muldoon said weve got about an hour of good daylight left dr grant if you want to try and find that nest right grant said i do i was thinking muldoon said that when the costa ricans come they will probably imagine this island to be a military problem something to destroy as soon as possible damn right gennaro said theyll bomb it from the air muldoon said perhaps napalm perhaps nerve gas as well but from the air i hope they do gennaro said this island is too dangerous every animal on this island must be destroyed and the sooner the better grant said thats not satisfactory he got to his feet lets get started i dont think you understand alan gennaro said its my opinion that this island is too dangerous it must be destroyed every animal on this island must be destroyed and thats what the costa rican guard will do i think we should leave it in their capable hands do you understand what im saying perfectly grant said again then whats your problem gennaro said its a military operation let them do it grants back ached where the raptor had clawed him no he said we have to take care of it leave it to the experts gennaro said grant remembered how he bhd found gennaro just six hours earlier huddled and terrified in the cab of a truck in the maintenance building and suddenly he lost his temper and slammed the lawyer up against the concrete wall listen you little bastard you have a responsibility to this situation and youre going to start living up to it i am gennaro said coughing no youre not youve shirked your responsibility all along from the very beginning the hell you sold investors on an undertaking you didnt fully understand you were part owner of a business you failed to supervise you did not check the activities of a man whom you knew from experience to be a liar and you permitted that man to screw around with the most dangerous technology in human history id say you shirked your responsibility gennaro coughed again well now im taking responsibility no grant said youre still shirking it and you cant do that any more he released gennaro who bent over gasping for breath grant turned to muldoon what have we got for weapons muldoon said weve got some control nets and shock prods how good are these shock prods grant said theyre like bang sticks for sharks they have an explosive capacitor tip delivers a shock on contact high voltage low amps not fatal but its definitely incapacitating thats not going to do it grant said not in the nest what nest gennaro said coughing the raptor nest ellie said the raptor nest grant was saying have you got any radio collars im sure we do muldoon said get one and is there anything else that can be used for defense muldoon shock his head well get whatever you can muldoon went away grant turned to gennaro your island is a mess mr gennaro your experiment is a mess it has to be cleaned up but you cant do that until you know the extent of the mess and that means finding the nests on the island especially the raptor nests theyll be hidden we have to find them and inspect them and count the eggs we have to account for every animal born on this island then we can burn it down but first we have a little work to do ellie was looking at the wall map which now showed the animal ranges tim was working the keyboard she pointed to the map the raptors are localized in the southern area down where the volcanic steam fields are maybe they like the warmth is there any place to hide down there turns out there is she said theres massive concrete waterworks to control flooding in the southern flatlands big underground area water and shade grant nodded then thats where theyll be ellie said i think theres an entrance from the beach too she turned to the consoles and said tim show us the cutaways on the waterworks tim wasnt listening tim he was hunched over the keyboard just a minute he said i found something what is it its an unmarked storage room i dont know whats there then it might have weapons grant said they were all behind the maintenance building unlocking a steel storm door lifting it up into the sunlight to reveal concrete steps going down into the earth damned arnold muldoon said as he hobbled down the steps he must have known this was here all along maybe not grant said he didnt try to go here well then hammond knew somebody knew where is hammond now still in the lodge they reached the bottom of the stairs and came upon rows of gas masks hanging on the wall in plastic containers they shone their flashlights deeper into the room and saw several heavy glass cubes two feet high with steel caps grant could see small dark spheres inside the cubes it was like being in a room full of giant pepper mills he thought muldoon opened the cap of one reached in and withdrew a sphere he turned it in the light frowning ill be damned what is it grant said moro muldoon said its an inhalation nerve gas these are grenades lots and lots of grenades lets get started grant said grimly it likes me lex said smiling they were standing in the garage of the visitor center by the little raptor that grant had captured in the tunnel she was petting the raptor through the cage bars the animal rubbed up against her hand id be careful there muldoon said they can give a nasty bite he likes me lex said his name is clarence clarence yes lex said muldoon was holding the leather collar with the small metal box attached to it grant heard the highpitched beeping in the headset is it a problem putting the collar on the animal lex was still petting the raptor reaching through the cage i het hell let me put it on him she said i wouldnt try muldoon said theyre unpredictable i het hell let me she said so muldoon gave lex the collar and she held it out so the raptor could smell it then she slowly slipped it around the animals neck the raptor turned brighter green when lex buckled it and closed the velcro cover over the buckle then the animal relaxed and turned paler again ill be damned muldoon said its a chameleon lex said the other raptors couldnt do that muldoon said frowning this wild animal must be different by the way he said turning to grant if theyre all born females how do they breed you never explained that bit about the frog dna its not frog dna grant said its amphibian dna but the phenomenon happens to be particularly well documented in frogs especially west african frogs if i remember what phenomenon is that gender transition grant said actually its just plain changing sex grant explained that a number of plants and animals were known to have the ability to change their sex during lifeorchids some fish and shrimp and now frogs frogs that had been observed to lay eggs were able to change over a period of months into complete males they first adopted the fighting stance of males they developed the mating whistle of males they stimulated the hormones and grew the gonads of males and eventually they successfully mated with females youre kidding gennaro said and what makes it happen apparently the change is stimulated by an environment in which all the animals are of the same sex in that situation some of the amphibians will spontaneously begin to change sex from female to male and you think thats what happened to the dinosaurs until we have a better explanation yes grant said i think thats what happened now shall we find this nest they piled into the jeep and lex lifted the raptor from the cage the animal seemed quite calm almost tame in her bands she gave it a final pat on the head and released it the animal wouldnt leave go on shoo lex said go home the raptor turned and ran off into the foliage grant held the receiver and wore the headphones muldoon drove the car bounced along the main road going south gennaro turned to grant and said what is it like this nest nobody knows grant said but i thought youd dug them up ive dug up fossil dinosaur nests grant said but all fossils are distorted by the weight of millennia weve made some hypotheses some suppositions but nobody really knows what the nests were like grant listened to the beeps and signaled muldoon to head farther west it looked more and more as if ellie had been correct the nest was in the southern volcanic fields grant shook his head not much about nesting behavior is clear he said he found himself explaining about the modern reptiles like crocodiles and alligators even their nesting behavior wasnt well understood actually the american alligator was better studied than most and in the case of alligators only the female guarded the nest and only until the time of birth the male alligator had spent days in early spring lying beside the female in a mating pair blowing bubbles on her checks and providing her with other signs of masculine attention designed to bring her to receptivity causing her finally to lift her tail and allow him as he lay beside her to insert his penis by the time the female built her nest two months later the male was long gone and although the female guarded her coneshaped threefoothigh mud nest ferociously her attention seemed to wane with time and she generally abandoned her eggs by the time the hatchlings began to squeak and emerge from their shells thus in the wild a baby alligator began its life entirely on its own and for that reason its belly was stuffed with egg yolk for nourishment in its early days so the adult alligators dont protect the young not as we imagine it grant said the biological parents both abandon the offspring but there is a kind of group protection young alligators have a very distinctive distress cry and it brings any adult who hears itparent or notto their assistance with a fullfledged violent attack not a threat display a fullon attack oh gennaro fell silent but thats in all respects a distinctly reptile pattern grant continued for example the alligators biggest problem is to keep the eggs cool the nests are always located in the shade a temperature of ninetyeigbt point six degrees will kill an alligator egg so the mother mostly guards her eggs to keep them cool and dinos arent reptiles muldoon said laconically exactly the dinosaur nesting pattern could be much more closely related to that of any of a variety of birds so you actually mean you dont know gennaro said getting annoyed you dont know what the nest is like no grant said i dont well gennaro said so much for the damn experts grant ignored him already he could smell the sulfur and up ahead he saw the rising steam of the volcanic fields the ground was hot gennaro thought as he walked forward it was actually hot and here and there mud bubbled and spat up from the ground and the reeking sulfurous steam hissed in great shoulderhigh plumes he felt as if he were walking through hell he looked at grant walking along with the headset on listening to the beeps grant in his cowboy boots and his jeans and his hawaiian shirt apparently very cool gennaro didnt feel cool he was frightened to be in this stinking hellish place with the velociraptors somewhere around he didnt understand how grant could be so calm about it or the woman sattler she was walking along too just looking calmly around doesnt this bother you gennaro said i mean worry you weve got to do it grant said he didnt say anything else they all walked forward among the bubbling steam vents gennaro fingered the gas grenades that he had clipped to his belt he turned to ellie why isnt he worried about it maybe he is she said but hes also thought about this for his whole life gennaro nodded and wondered what that would be like whether there was anything he had waited his whole life for he decided there wasnt anything grant squinted in the sunlight ahead through veils of steam an animal crouched looking at them then it scampered away was that the raptor ellie said i think so or another one juvenile anyway she said leading us on maybe ellie had told him how the raptors had played at the fence to keep her attention while another climbed onto the roof if true such behavior implied a mental capacity that was beyond nearly all forms of life on earth classically the ability to invent and execute plans was believed to be limited to only three species chimpanzees gorillas and human beings now there was the possibility that a dinosaur might be able to do such a thing too the raptor appeared again darting into the light then jumping away with a squeak it really did seem to be leading them on gennaro frowned how smart are they he said if you think of them as birds grant said then you have to wonder some new studies show the gray parrot has as much symbolic intelligence as a chimpanzee and chimpanzees can definitely use language now researchers are finding that parrots have the emotional development of a threeyearold child but their intelligence is unquestioned parrots can definitely reason symbolically but ive never heard of anybody killed by a parrot gennaro grumbled distantly they could bear the sound of the surf on the island shore the volcanic fields were behind them now and they faced a field of boulders the little raptor climbed up onto one rock and then abruptly disappeared whered it go ellie said grant was listening to the earphones the beeping stopped hes gone they hurried forward and found in the midst of the rocks a small bole like a rabbit hole it was perhaps two feet in diameter as they watched the juvenile raptor reappeared blinking in the light then it scampered away no way gennaro said no way im going down there grant said nothing he and ellie began to plug in equipment soon he had a small video camera attached to a handheld monitor he tied the camera to a rope turned it on and lowered it down the hole you cant see anything that way gennaro said let it adjust grant said there was enough light along the upper tunnel for them to see smooth dirt walls and then the tunnel opened outsuddenly abruptly over the microphone they heard a squeaking sound then a lower trumpeting sound more noises coming from many animals sounds like the nest all right ellie said but you cant see anything gennaro said he wiped the sweat off his forehead no grant said but i can hear he listened for a while longer and then hauled the camera out and set it on the ground lets get started he climbed up toward the bole ellie went to get a flashlight and a shock stick grant pulled the gas mask on over his face and crouched down awkwardly extending his legs backward you cant be serious about going down there gennaro said grant nodded it doesnt thrill me ill go first then ellie then you come after now wait a minute gennaro said in sudden alarm why dont we drop these nervegas grenades down the hole then go down afterward doesnt that make more sense ellie you got the flashlight she handed the flashlight to grant what about it gennaro said what do you say id like nothing better grant said he backed down toward the hole you ever seen anything die from poison gas no it generally causes convulsions bad convulsions well im sorry if its unpleasant but look grant said were going into this nest to find out how many animals have hatched if you kill the animals first and some of them fall on the nests in their spasms that will ruin our ability to see what was there so we cant do that but you made these animals mr gennaro i didnt your money did your efforts did you helped create them theyre your creation and you cant just kill them because you feel a little nervous now im not a little nervous gennaro said im scared shi follow me grant said ellie handed him a shock stick he pushed backward through the hole and grunted tight fit grant exhaled and extended his arms forward in front of him and there was a kind of whoosh and he was gone the bole gaped empty and black what happened to him gennaro said alarmed ellie stepped forward and leaned close to the hole listening at the opening she clicked the radio said softly alan there was a long silence then they heard faintly im here is everything all right alan another long silence when grant finally spoke his voice sounded distinctly odd almost awestruck everythings fine he said almost paradigm in the lodge john hammond paced back and forth in malcolms room hammond was impatient and uncomfortable since marshaling the effort for his last outburst malcolm had slipped into a coma and now it appeared to hammond that he might actually die of course a helicopter had been sent for but god knows when it would arrive the thought that malcolm might die in the meantime filled hammond with anxiety and dread and paradoxically hammond found it all much worse because he disliked the mathematician so much it was worse than if the man were his friend hammond felt that malcolms death should it occur would be the final rebuke and that was more than hammond could bear in any case the smell in the room was quite ghastly quite ghastly the rotten decay of human flesh everything parad malcolm said tossing on the pillow is he waking up hammond said harding shook his head what did he say something about paradise i didnt catch it harding said hammond paced some more he pushed the window wider trying to get some fresh air finally when he couldnt stand it he said is there any problem about going outside i dont think so no harding said i think this area is all right well look im going outside for a bit all right harding said he adjusted the flow on the intravenous antibiotics ill be back soon all right hammond left stepping out into the daylight wondering why he had bothered to justify himself to harding after all the man was his employee hammond had no need to explain himself he went through the gates of the fence looking around the park it was late afternoon the time when the blowing mist was thinned and the sun sometimes came out the sun was out now and hammond took it as an omen say what they would he knew that his park had promise and even if that impetuous fool gennaro decided to burn it to the ground it would not make much difference hammond knew that in two separate vaults at ingen headquarters in palo alto were dozens of frozen embryos it would not be a problem to grow them again on another island elsewhere in the world and if there had been problems here then the next time they would solve those problems that was how progress occurred by solving problems as he thought about it he concluded that wu had not really been the man for the job wu had obviously been sloppy too casual with his great undertaking and wu had been too preoccupied with the idea of making improvements instead of making dinosaurs he had wanted to improve on them hammond suspected darkly that was the reason for the downfall of the park wu was the reason also he had to admit that john arnold was ill suited for the job of chief engineer arnold had impressive credentials but at this point in his career he was tired and he was a fretful worrier he hadnt been organized and he had missed things important things in truth neither wu nor arnold had had the most important characteristic hammond decided the characteristic of vision that great sweeping act of imagination which evoked a marvelous park where children pressed against the fences wondering at the extraordinary creatures come alive from their storybooks real vision the ability to see the future the ability to marshal resources to make that future vision a reality no neither wu nor arnold was suited to that task and for that matter ed regis had been a poor choice too harding was at best an indifferent choice muldoon was a drunk hammond shook his head he would do better next time lost in his thoughts he headed toward his bungalow following the little path that ran north from the visitor center he passed one of the workmen who nodded curtly hammond did not return the nod he found the tican workmen to be uniformly insolent to tell the truth the choice of this island off costa rica had also been unwise he would not make such obvious mistakes again when it came the roar of the dinosaur seemed frighteningly close hammond spun so quickly he fell on the path and when he looked back he thought he saw the shadow of the juvenile trex moving in the foliage beside the flagstone path moving toward him what was the trex doing here why was it outside the fences hammond felt a flash of rage and then he saw the tican workman running for his life and hammond took the moment to get to his feet and dash blindly into the forest on the opposite side of the path he was plunged in darkness he stumbled and fell his face mashed into wet leaves and damp earth and he staggered back up to his feet ran onward fell again and then ran once more now he was moving down a steep hillside and he couldnt keep his balance he tumbled helplessly rolling and spinning over the soft ground before finally coming to a stop at the foot of the hill his face splashed into shallow tepid water which gurgled around him and ran up his nose he was lying face down in a little stream he had panicked what a fool he should have gone to his bungalow hammond cursed himself as he got to his feet he felt a sharp pain in his right ankle that brought tears to his eyes he tested it gingerly it might be broken he forced himself to put his full weight on it gritting his teeth yes almost certainly broken in the control room lex said to tim i wish they had taken us with them to the nest its too dangerous for us lex tim said we have to stay here hey listen to this one he pressed another button and a recorded tyrannosaur roar echoed over the loudspeakers in the park thats neat lex said thats better than the other one you can do it too tim said and if you push this you get reverb let me try lex said she pushed the button the tyrannosaur roared again can we make it last longer she said sure tim said we just twist this thing here lying at the bottom of the hill hammond heard the tyrannosaur roar bellowing through the jungle jesus he shivered hearing that sound it was terrifying a scream from some other world he waited to see what would happen what would the tyrannosaur do had it already gotten that workman hammond waited hearing only the buzz of the jungle cicadas until he realized he was holding his breath and let out a long sigh with his injured ankle he couldnt climb the hill he would have to wait at the bottom of the ravine after the tyrannosaur had gone he would call for help meanwhile he was in no danger here then he heard an amplified voice say come on timmy i get to try it too come on let me make the noise the kids the tyrannosaur roared again but this time it had distinct musical overtones and a kind of echo persisting afterward neat one said the little girl do it again those damned kids he should never have brought those kids they had been nothing but trouble from the beginning nobody wanted them aroundhammond had only brought them because he thought it would stop gennaro from destroying the resort but gennaro was going to do it anyway and the kids had obviously gotten into the control room and started fooling aroundnow who had allowed that he felt his heart begin to race and felt an uneasy shortness of breath he forced himself to relax there was nothing wrong although he could not climb the hill he could not be more than a hundred yards from his own bungalow and the visitor center hammond sat down in the damp earth listening to the sounds in the jungle around him and then after a while he began to shout for help malcolms voice was no louder than a whisper everything looks different on the other side he said harding leaned close to him on the other side he thought that malcolm was talking about dying when shifts malcolm said shifts malcolm didnt answer his dry lips moved paradigm he said finally paradigm shifts harding said he knew about paradigm shifts for the last two decades they had been the fashionable way to talk about scientific change paradigm was just another word for a model but as scientists used it the term meant something more a world view a larger way of seeing the world paradigm shifts were said to occur whenever science made a major change in its view of the world such changes were relatively rare occurring about once a century darwinian evolution had forced a paradigm shift quantum mechanics had forced a smaller shift no malcolm said not paradigm beyond beyond paradigm harding said dont care about what anymore harding sighed despite all efforts malcolm was rapidly slipping into a terminal delirium his fever was higher and they were almost out of his antibiotics what dont you care about anything malcolm said because everything looks different on the other side and he smiled descent youre crazy gennaro said to ellie sattler watching as she squeezed backward into the rabbit hole stretching her arms forward youre crazy to do that she smiled probably she said she reached forward with her outstretched hands and pushed backward against the sides of the hole and suddenly she was gone the hole gaped black gennaro began to sweat he turned to muldoon who was standing by the jeep im not doing this he said yes you are i cant do this i cant theyre waiting for you muldoon said you have to christ only knows whats down there gennaro said im telling you i cant do it you have to gennaro turned away looked at the hole looked back i cant you cant make me i suppose not muldoon said he held up the stainlesssteel prod ever felt a shock stick doesnt do much muldoon said almost never fatal generally knocks you flat perhaps loosens your bowels but it doesnt usually have any permanent effect at least not on dinos but then people are much smaller gennaro looked at the stick you wouldnt i think youd better go down and count those animals muldoon said and you better hurry gennaro looked back at the hole at the black opening a mouth in the earth then he looked at muldoon standing there large and impassive gennaro was sweating and lighthearted he started walking toward the hole from a distance it appeared small but as be came closer it seemed to grow larger thats it muldoon said gennaro climbed backward into the hole but he began to feel too frightened to continue that waythe idea of backing into the unknown filled him with dreadso at the last minute he turned around and climbed head first into the hole extending his arms forward and kicking his feet because at least he would see where he was going he pulled the gas mask over his face and suddenly he was rushing forward sliding into blackness seeing the dirt walls disappear into darkness before him and then the walls became narrowermuch narrowerterrifyingly narrowand he was lost in the pain of a squeezing compression that became steadily worse and worse that crushed the air out of his lungs and he was only dimly aware that the tunnel tilted slightly upward along the path shifting his body leaving him gasping and seeing spots before his eyes and the pain was extreme and then suddenly the tunnel tilted downward again and it became wider and gennaro felt rough surfaces concrete and cold air his body was suddenly free and bouncing turning on concrete and then he fell voices in the darkness fingers touching him reaching forward from the whispered voices the air was cold like a cave okay he looks okay yes hes breathing fine a female hand caressing his face it was ellie can you hear she whispered why is everybody whispering he said because she pointed gennaro turned rolled got slowly to his feet he stared as his vision grew accustomed to the darkness but the first thing that he saw gleaming in the darkness was eyes glowing green eyes dozens of eyes all around him he was on a concrete ledge a kind of embankment about seven feet above the floor large steel junction boxes provided a makeshift hiding place protecting them from the view of the two fullsize velociraptors that stood directly before them not five feet away the animals were dark green with brownish tiger stripes they stood upright balancing on their stiff extended tails they were totally silent looking around watchfully with large dark eyes at the feet of the adults baby velociraptors skittered and chirped farther back in the darkness juveniles tumbled and played giving short snarls and growls gennaro did not dare to breathe two raptors crouched on the ledge he was only a foot or two above the animals head height the raptors were edgy their heads jerking nervously up and down from time to time they snorted impatiently then they moved off turning back toward the main group as his eyes adjusted gennaro could now see that they were in some kind of an enormous underground structure but it was manmadethere were seams of poured concrete and the nubs of protruding steel rods and within this vast echoing space were many animals gennaro guessed at least thirty raptors perhaps more its a colony grant said whispering four or six adults the rest juveniles and infants at least two hatchings one last year and one this year these babies look about four months old probably hatched in april one of the babies curious scampered up on the ledge and came toward them squeaking it was now only ten feet away oh jesus gennaro said but immediately one of the adults came forward raised its head and gently nudged the baby to turn back the baby chittered a protest then hopped up to stand on the snout of the adult the adult moved slowly allowing the baby to climb over its head down its neck onto its back from that protected spot the infant turned and chirped noisily at the three intruders the adults still did not seem to notice them at all i dont get it gennaro whispered why arent they attacking grant shook his head they must not see us and there arent any eggs at the moment makes them more relaxed relaxed gennaro said how long do we have to stay here long enough to do the count grant said as grant saw it there were three nests attended by three sets of parents the division of territory was centered roughly around the nests although the offspring seemed to overlap and run into different territories the adults were benign with the young ones and tougher with the juveniles occasionally snapping at the older animals when their play got too rough at that moment a juvenile raptor came up to ellie and rubbed his head against her leg she looked down and saw the leather collar with the black box it was damp in one place and it had chafed the skin of the young animals neck the juvenile whimpered in the big room below one of the adults turned curiously toward the sound you think i can take it off she asked just do it quickly ookay she said squatting beside the small animal it whimpered again the adults snorted bobbed their heads ellie petted the little juvenile trying to soothe it to silence its whimpering she moved her hands toward the leather collar lifted back the velcro tab with a tearing sound the adults jerked their heads then one began to walk toward her oh shit gennaro said under his breath dont move grant said stay calm the adult walked past them its long curved toes clicking on the concrete the animal paused in front of ellie who stayed crouched by the juvenile behind a steel box the juvenile was exposed and ellies hand was still on the collar the adult raised its head and sniffed the air the adults big head was very close to her hand but it could not see her because of the function box a tongue flicked out tentatively grant reached for a gas grenade plucked it from his belt held his thumb on the pin gennaro put out a restraining hand shock his head nodded to ellie she wasnt wearing her mask grant set the grenade down reached for the shock prod the adult was still very close to ellie ellie eased the leather strap off the metal of the buckle clinked on concrete the adults head jerked fractionally and then cocked to one side curious it was moving forward again to investigate when the little juvenile squeaked happily and scampered away the adult remained by ellie then finally it turned and walked back to the center of the nest gennaro gave a long exhalation jesus can we leave no grant said but i think we can get some work done now in the phosphorescent green glow of the nightvision goggles grant peered down into the room from the ledge looking at the first nest it was made of mud and straw formed into a broad shallow basket shape he counted the remains of fourteen eggs of course he couldnt count the actual shells from this distance and in any case they were long since broken and scattered over the floor but he was able to count the indentations in the mud apparently the raptors made their nests shortly before the eggs were laid and the eggs left a permanent impression in the mud he also saw evidence that at least one had broken he credited thirteen animals the second nest had broken in half but grant estimated it had contained nine eggshells the third nest had fifteen eggs but it appeared that three eggs had been broken early whats that total gennaro said thirtyfour born grant said and how many do you see grant shook his head the animals were running all over the cavernous interior space darting in and out of the light ive been watching ellie said shining her light down at her notepad youd have to take photos to be sure but the snout markings of the infants are all different my count is thirtythree and juveniles twentyitwo but alando you notice anything funny about them like what grant whispered how they arrange themselves spatially theyre falling into some kind of a pattern or arrangement in the room grant frowned he saidits pretty dark no look look for yourself watch the little ones when they are playing they tumble and run every which way but in between when the babies are standing around notice how they orient their bodies they face either that wall or the opposite wall its like they line up i dont know ellie you think theres a colony metastructure like bees no not exactly she said its more subtle than that its just a tendency and the babies do it no they all do it the adults do it too watch them im telling you they line up grant frowned it seemed as if she was right the animals engaged in all sorts of behavior but during pauses moments when they were watching or relaxing they seemed to orient themselves in particular ways almost as if there were invisible lines on the floor beats me grant said maybe theres a breeze i dont feel one alan what are they doing some kind of social organization expressed as spatial structure that doesnt make sense she said because they all do it gennaro flipped up his watch i knew this thing would come in handy one day beneath the watch face was a compass grant said you have much use for that in court no gennaro shook his head my wife gave it to me he explained for my birthday he peered at the compass well he said theyre not lined up according to anything i guess theyre sort of northeastsouthwest something like that ellie said maybe theyre hearing something turning their heads so they can hear grant frowned or maybe its just ritual behavior she said speciesspecific behavior that serves to identify them to one another but maybe it doesnt have any broader meaning ellie sighed or maybe theyre weird maybe dinosaurs are weird or maybe its a kind of communication grant was thinking the same thing bees could communicate spatially by doing a kind of dance perhaps dinosaurs could do the same thing gennaro watched them and said why dont they go outside theyre nocturnal yes but it almost seems like theyre hiding grant shrugged in the next moment the infants began to squeak and hop excitedly the adults watched curiously for a moment and then with hoots and cries that echoed in the dark cavernous space all the dinosaurs wheeled and ran heading down the concrete tunnel into the darkness beyond hammond john hammond sat down heavily in the damp earth of the hillside and tried to catch his breath dear god it was hot he thought hot and humid he felt as if he were breathing through a sponge he looked down at the streambed now forty feet below it seemed like hours since he had left the trickling water and begun to climb the hill his ankle was now swollen and dark purple he couldnt put any weight on it at all he was forced to hop up the hill on his other leg which now burned with pain from the exertion and he was thirsty before leaving the stream behind he had drunk from it even though he knew this was unwise now he felt dizzy and the world sometimes swirled around him he was having trouble with his balance but he knew he had to climb the hill and get back to the path above hammond thought he had heard footsteps on the path several times during the previous hour and each time he had shouted for help but somehow his voice hadnt carried far enough he hadnt been rescued and so as the afternoon wore on he began to realize that he would have to climb the hillside injured leg or not and that was what he was doing now those damned kids hammond shook his head trying to clear it he had been climbing for more than an hour and he had gone only a third of the distance up the hill and he was tired panting like an old dog his leg throbbed he was dizzy of course he knew perfectly well that he was in no dangerhe was almost within sight of his bungalow for gods sakebut he had to admit he was tired sitting on the hillside he found he didnt really want to move any more and why shouldnt he be tired he thought he was seventysix years old that was no age to be climbing around hillsides even though hammond was in peak condition for a man his age personally he expected to live to be a hundred it was just a matter of taking care of yourself of taking care of things as they came up certainly he had plenty of reasons to live other parks to build other wonders to create he heard a squeaking then a chattering sound some kind of small birds hopping in the undergrowth hed been hearing small animals all afternoon there were all kinds of things out here rats possums snakes the squeaking got louder and small bits of earth rolled down the hillside past him something was coming then he saw a dark green animal hopping down the hill toward himand anotherand another compys he thought with a chill scavengers the compys didnt look dangerous they were about as big as chickens and they moved up and down with little nervous jerks like chickens but he knew they were poisonous their bites had a slowacting poison that they used to kill crippled animals crippled animals he thought frowning the first of the compys perched on the hillside staring at him it stayed about five feet away beyond his reach and just watched him others came down soon after and they stood in a row watching they hopped up and down and chittered and waved their little clawed hands sboo get out he said and threw a rock the compys backed away but only a foot or two they werent afraid they seemed to know he couldnt hurt them angrily hammond tore a branch from a tree and swiped at them with it the compys dodged nipped at the leaves squeaked happily they seemed to think he was playing a game he thought again about the poison he remembered that one of the animal handlers had been bitten by a compy in a cage the handler had said the poison was like a narcoticpeaceful dreamy no pain you just wanted to go to sleep the hell with that he thought hammond picked up a rock aimed carefully and threw it striking one compy flat in the chest the little animal shrieked in alarm as it was knocked backward and rolled over its tail the other animals immediately backed away better hammond turned away and started to climb the hill once more holding branches in both hands he hopped on his left leg feeling the ache in his thigh he had not gone more than ten feet when one of the compys jumped onto his back he flung his arms wildly knocking the animal away but lost his balance and slid back down the hillside as he came to a stop a second compy sprang forward and took a tiny nip from his hand he looked with horror seeing the blood flow over his fingers he turned and began to scramble up the hillside again another compy lumped onto his shoulder and he felt a brief pain as it bit the back of his neck he shrieked and smacked the animal away he turned to face the animals breathing hard and they stood all around him hopping up and down and cocking their heads watching him from the bite on his neck he felt warmth flow through his shoulders down his spine lying on his back on the hillside he began to feel strangely relaxed detached from himself but he realized that nothing was wrong no error had been made malcolm was quite incorrect in his analysis hammond lay very still as still as a child in its crib and he felt wonderfully peaceful when the next compy came up and bit his ankle he made only a halfhearted effort to kick it away the little animals edged closer soon they were chattering all around him like excited birds he raised his head as another compy jumped onto his chest the animal surprisingly light and delicate hammond felt only a slight pain very slight as the compy bent to chew his neck the beach chasing the dinosaurs following the curves and slopes of concrete grant suddenly burst out through a cavernous opening and found himself standing on the beach looking at the pacific ocean all around him the young velociraptors were scampering and kicking in the sand but one by one the animals moved back into the shade of the palm trees at the edge of the mangrove swamp and there they stood lined up in their peculiar fashion watching the ocean they stared fixedly to the south i dont get it gennaro said i dont either grant said except that they clearly dont like the sun it wasnt very sunny on the beach a light mist blew and the ocean was hazy but why had they suddenly left the nest what had brought the entire colony to the beach gennaro flipped up the dial on his watch and looked at the way the animals were standing northeastsoutbwest same as before behind the beach deeper in the woods they heard the hum of the electric fence at least we know how they get outside the fence ellie said then they heard the throb of marine diesels and through the mist they saw a ship appearing in the south a large freighter it slowly moved north so thats why they came out gennaro said grant nodded they must have heard it coming as the freighter passed all the animals watched it standing silent except for the occasional chirp or squeak grant was struck by the coordination of their behavior the way they moved and acted as a group but perhaps it was not really so mysterious in his mind he reviewed the sequence of events that had begun in the cave first the infants had been agitated then the adults had noticed and finally all the animals had stampeded to the beach that sequence seemed to imply that the younger animals with keener bearing had detected the boat first then the adults had led the troop out onto the beach and as grant looked he saw that the adults were in charge now there was a clear spatial organization along the beach and as the animals settled down it was not loose and shifting the way it had been inside rather it was quite regular almost regimented the adults were spaced every ten yards or so each adult surrounded by a cluster of infants the juveniles were positioned between and slightly ahead of the adults but grant also saw that all the adults were not equal there was a female with a distinctive stripe along her head and she was in the very center of the group as it ranged along the beach that same female had stayed in the center of the nesting area too he guessed that like certain monkey troops the raptors were organized around a matriarchal pecking order and that this striped animal was the alpha female of the colony the males he saw were arranged defensively at the perimeter of the group but unlike monkeys which were loosely and flexibly organized the dinosaurs settled into a rigid arrangementalmost a military formation it seemed then too there was the oddity of the northeastsouthwest spatial orientation that was beyond grant but in another sense he was not surprised paleontologists had been digging up bones for so long that they had forgotten how little information could be gleaned from a skeleton bones might tell you something about the gross appearance of an animal its height and weight they might tell you something about how the muscles attached and therefore something about the crude behavior of the animal during life they might give you clues to the few diseases that affected bone but a skeleton was a poor thing really from which to try and deduce the total behavior of an organism since bones were all the paleontologists had bones were what they used like other paleontologists grant had become very expert at working with bones and somewhere along the way he had started to forget the unprovable possibilitiesthat the dinosaurs might be truly different animals that they might possess behavior and social life organized along lines that were utterly mysterious to their later mammalian descendants that since the dinosaurs were fundamentally birds oh my god grant said he stared at the raptors ranged along the beach in a rigid formation silently watching the boat and he suddenly understood what he was looking at those animals gennaro said shaking his head they sure are desperate to escape from here no grant said they dont want to escape at all they dont no grant said they want to migrate approaching dark migrating ellie said thats fantastic yes grant said he was grinning ellie said where do you suppose they want to go i dont know grant said and then the big helicopters burst through the fog thundering and wheeling over the landscape their underbellies heavy with armament the raptors scattered in alarm as one of the helicopters circled back following the line of the surf and then moved in to land on the beach a door was flung open and soldiers in olive uniforms came running toward them grant heard the rapid babble of voices in spanish and saw that muldoon was already aboard with the kids one of the soldiers said in english please you will come with us please there is no time here grant looked back at the beach where the raptors had been but they were gone all the animals had vanished it was as if they had never existed the soldiers were tugging at him and he allowed himself to be led beneath the thumping blades and climbed up through the big door muldoon leaned over and shouted in grants ear they want us out of here now theyre going to do it now the soldiers pushed grant and ellie and gennaro into seats and helped them clip on the harnesses tim and lex waved to him and he suddenly saw how young they were and how exhausted lex was yawning leaning against her brothers shoulder an officer came toward grant and shouted senor are you in charge no grant said im not in charge who is in charge please i dont know the officer went on to gennaro and asked the same question are you in charge no gennaro said the officer looked at ellie but said nothing to her the door was left open as the helicopter lifted away from the beach and grant leaned out to see if he could catch a last look at the raptors but then the helicopter was above the palm trees moving north over the island grant leaned to muldoon and shouted what about the others muldoon shouted theyve already taken off harding and some workmen hammond had an accident found him on the hill near his bungalow must have fallen is he all right grant said no compys got him what about malcolm grant said muldoon shook his head grant was too tired to feel much of anything he turned away and looked back out the door it was getting dark now and in the fading light he could barely see the little rex with bloody jaws crouched over a hadrosaur by the edge of the lagoon and looking up at the helicopter and roaring as it passed by somewhere behind them they heard explosions and then ahead they saw another helicopter wheeling through the mist over the visitor center and a moment later the building burst in a bright orange fireball and lex began to cry and ellie put her arm around her and tried to get her not to look grant was staring down at the ground and he had a last glimpse of the hypsilophodonts leaping gracefully as gazelles moments before another explosion flared bright beneath them their helicopter gained altitude and then moved cast out over the ocean grant sat back in his seat he thought of the dinosaurs standing on the beach and he wondered where they would migrate if they could and he realized he would never know and he felt sad and relieved in the same moment the officer came forward again bending close to his face are you in charge no grant said please senor who is in charge nobody grant said the helicopter gained speed as it headed toward the mainland it was cold now and the soldiers muscled the door closed as they did grant looked back just once and saw the island against a deep purple sky and sea cloaked in a deep mist that blurred the whitehot explosions that burst rapidly one after another until it seemed the entire island was glowing a diminishing bright spot in the darkening night epilogue san jose days went by the government was polite and put them up in a nice hotel in san jose they were free to come and go and to call whomever they wished but they were not permitted to leave the country each day a young man from the american embassy came to visit them to ask if they needed anything and to explain that washington was doing everything it could to hasten their departure but the plain fact was that many people had died in a territorial possession of costa rica the plain fact was that an ecological disaster had been narrowly averted the government of costa rica felt it had been misled and deceived by john hammond and his plans for the island under the circumstances the government was not disposed to release survivors in a hurry they did not even permit the burial of hammond or ian malcolm they simply waited each day it seemed to grant he was taken to another government office where he was questioned by another courteous intelligent government officer they made him go over his story again and again how grant had met john hammond what grant knew of the project how grant had received the fax from new york why grant had gone to the island what had happened at the island the same details again and again day after day the same story for a long time grant thought they must believe he was lying to them and that there was something they wanted him to tell although he could not imagine what it was yet in some odd way they seemed to be waiting finally he was sitting around the swimming pool of the hotel one afternoon watching tim and lex splash when an american in khakis walked up weve never met the american said my name is marty guitierrez im a researcher here at the carara station grant said you were the one who found the original specimen of the procompsognathus thats right yes guitierrez sat next to him you must be eager to go home yes grant said i have only a few days left to dig before the winter sets in in montana you know the first snow usually comes in august guitierrez said is that why the hammond foundation supported northern digs because intact genetic material from dinosaurs was more likely to be recovered from cold climates thats what i presume yes guitierrez nodded he was a clever man mr hammond grant said nothing guitierrez sat back in the pool chair the authorities wont tell you guitierrez said finally because they are afraid and perhaps also resentful of you for what you have done but something very peculiar is happening in the rural regions biting the babies no thankfully that has stopped but something else this spring in the ismaloya section which is to the north some unknown animals ate the crops in a very peculiar manner they moved each day in a straight linealmost as straight as an arrowfrom the coast into the mountains into the jungle grant sat upright like a migration guitierrez said wouldnt you say what crops grant said well it was odd they would only eat agama beans and soy and sometimes chickens grant said foods rich in lysine what happened to these animals presumably guitierrez said they entered the jungles in any case they have not been found of course it would be difficult to search for them in the jungle a search party could spend years in the ismaloya mountains with nothing to show for it and we are being kept here because guitierrez shrugged the government is worried perhaps there are more animals more trouble they are feeling cautious do you think there are more animals grant said i cant say can you no grant said i cant say but you suspect grant nodded possibly there are yes i agree guitierrez pushed up from his chair he waved to tim and lex playing in the pool probably they will send the children home he said there is no reason not to do that he put on his sunglasses enjoy your stay with us dr grant it is a lovely country here grant said youre telling me were not going anywhere none of us is going anywhere dr grant guitierrez said smiling and then he turned and walked back toward the entrance of the hotel acknowledgments in preparing this novel i have drawn on the work of many eminent paleontologists particularly robert bakker john horner john ostrom and gregory paul i have also made use of the efforts of the new generation of illustrators including kenneth carpenter margaret colbert stephen and sylvia czerkas john gurche mark hallett douglas henderson and william stout whose reconstructions incorporate the new perception of how dinosaurs behaved certain ideas presented here about paleodna the genetic material of extinct animals were first articulated by george o poinar jr and roberta hess who formed the extinct dna study group at berkeley some discussions of chaos theory derive in part from the commentaries of ivar ekeland and james gleick the computer programs of bob gross inspired some of the graphics the work of the late heinz pagels provoked ian malcolm however this book is entirely fiction and the views expressed here are my own as are whatever factual errors exist in the text
