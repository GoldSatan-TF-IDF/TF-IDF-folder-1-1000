stephen r lawhead grail prologue men are such pathetic lumpen things so predictable in their appetites such slaves to their tedious desires and pleasures creatures of dull habit and savage compulsion they waver between one and the other never perceiving anything of the world beyond their animal passions why the cattle of the field know more of life ah but it is all too easy i have long since tired of their trivial ambitions and endeavours ignorant brutes they deserve every misfortune their beast of a god can rain down upon them where is real strength where is true courage where is genuine discipline harnessed to uncompromising volition and both allied in total harmony each subject to the other where are such treasures to be found on the battlefield in the heat of the fight ha that is what men think and as in all else they are vastly mistaken war is children with dirty faces squabbling over the dungheap in war life that single most precious substance in the universe is bartered cheap thrown away wasted traded for a prize which will not last beyond the changing of the seasons fools all of them blind ignorant fools it is pure joy tormenting them only that which endures beyond time is worth having well i know it i who have given all for the mastery of time and the elements know the value of life truly truly i have spent my life on the things that endure not for nothing am i called the queen of air and darkness one i gwalchavad lord of orcady write this and no gentle labour it is nor less rough the reading i fear unlike myrddin or the browncloaked clerics i am no master of the scribblers craft gods truth the sword hilt better fits my hand than this closepared reed even so i am assured my crabbed script will live long after the hand that framed it is dust this brother aneirin assures me and he is wise in such things so be it i was born in sight of ynys prydain with my brother and twin gwalcmai both sons of noble lot himself a king of the orcades my birth in itself is of small consequence but for arthur i would have lived all my days in that wild place and never travelled beyond the boundary stones of my fathers island realm but for arthur my life might have passed in hunting fishing and settling the squabbles of petty chieftains i would never have heard of the kingdom of summer much less the grail and truly i would not be writing this at all still i will persist in my endeavour so you may know the way of it anyone with ears has heard of arthur and his trials and triumphs tales and more tales flood the land from lloegres to celyddon many bards tell them now and a few of the monkish kind have written them too a sorry scribe i may be though perhaps not least among these gallstained inkspillers they speak of wars and battles and that is right they tell of brave men defending the island of the mighty with their lives these tales are good and some are even true i take nothing away from them but my task is ordered differently see now it is the grail i tell that strange stirrer of marvels that most uncanny vessel of desire dangerous yes and more beautiful than words alone can tell it is the holiest treasure in all this worldsrealm but for arthur that precious cup would surely have been forgotten and its healing virtues lost through ignorance and neglect yet truth be told but for arthur none of the terrors and tribulations i describe would have befallen us but for arthur the grail was almost lost and a flame of heavens pure fire extinguished on the earth that is a tale few have heard and it is worth more than all the others ah but i race before myself know you the battlehost of the ancient enemy is large and falters before nothing save the true word and the sound of the clash when those two combatants met will echo through the ages i do believe it blessed among men i was favoured to ride at my kings right hand in the foreranks of the fight tremble and turn pale sain yourself with runes and strong prayers call upon the company of angels and barken well to my warning where great good endures great evil gathers close about this i know hear me speak of the grail and you speak a mystery with a secret at its heart and i gwalchavad prince of orcady know the secret as none other if the telling gives you pleasure well and good but i should not like cold eyes to read it in this book therefore look to your heart look long and hard if you are friend to all that is true and right then welcome and read on but if you would savour the sauce of slander and shadow tricks feast on lies betrayals and seductions you will find little to your liking here blessed jesu i mean to tell the truth of what i know thus i begin for seven long years we warred against the ravaging saecsens seven years of hardship and privation misery torment and death under arthurs command and with the aid of the swift sure hand we prevailed in the end this is well known indeed even small children know how the warhost of britain raised the wall on baedun hill and destroyed the bold invader so i will not say more except to point out that we had scarcely drawn breath from our hardfought victory at baedun when we were beset by the wandering vandal horde fighting first in lerna then in britain we chased amilcar that greedy boar of battle over most of lloegres before he was subdued a strange war that it lasted little more than a season yet brought more waste and destruction to our land than all the saecsen battles put together why is it that trouble always seems to come in threes for with the havoc of the vandali came plague and drought as well those who grumble and complain would do well to remember that the pendragon had three enemies to fight not just one if there is another king who could have done better against such odds then show me that man i say or shut your mouth there is no pleasing some people though many raise their voices in accusation and make loud lament over lost lands and such i still think arthur chose the better course the thing is over now in any event so it does no good to piss and moan if they knew the bear of britain at all they would realize their miserable whining only hardens his conviction the more better a trustworthy foe than a treacherous friend and we have seen enough of scheming friends the island of the mighty is better off without the likes of ceredig morcant brastias gerontius urien and their rebellious ilk always making trouble the devil take them all i say they will not be missed where were they those who make such loud complaint when arthur stood against the vandal lord urien and brastias thought to usurp the high kings portion but did i hear them offer to take the high kings place on the bloodsoaked battleground gerontius was ever quick to goad the others in their petty rebellion but did i see bold gerontius in the forefront of the fight no i did not we had amassed the greatest warhost seen in britain since great constantine twenty thousand men and fifteen thousand horses yet on that fearful day arthur faced his foe alone and the treasonous lords were nowhere to be seen well they made their choice so be it but instead of insulting heaven with their lament they would do better to offer heartfelt praise that they possess both breath and tongue to complain arthur paid dearly for the peace we now enjoy when they carried him from the field of battle so too were our hearts borne away and the sun and stars as well for we walked in darkness without arthur they have taken him to ynys avallach rhys said his face grey with fatigue and worry if you know any prayers say them now for if arthur would be healed it must be in that holy place and none other the wise emrys knew best what to do rhys then delivered arthurs last command you are to conduct the vandali to the north where they will take possession of lands surrendered by the rebel lords any britons living in these realms will be cast out and their settlements made forfeit by their lords treason thus they departed leaving us to establish the peace arthur had won we divided the warhost bedwyr cai and i conducted the new vandal chieftain mercia and his tribes to the lands arthur had granted them in the north cador and the rest of the cymbrogi the name is arthurs choice it means companions of the heart turned their attention to overseeing the departure from these shores of the traitors and their followers whose lands had fallen forfeit burdened by weight of numbers and fatigued with all the fighting we had endured we made our way north very slowly leading the vandal host searching out water along the way far easier said than done i fear with each passing day the drought deepened causing hardship from one end of the land to the other it broke my heart to see holding after holding deserted many had fled to armorica but worse still were the burnedout strongholds those which plague had ravaged and destroyed if the sight of so much suffering made us heartheavy the thought of displacing honest british folk from their homelands brought us to despair oh it is a hard hard thing to tell a man his home must be surrendered and all his lifes labour has come to naught because his rogue of a lord has broken faith with the high king stab that man in the heart it is kinder in the end i swear it i loathed the task set before me and prayed for a way to evade what must be done day after day as we moved the vandal host northward i prayed to god for a miracle behold my prayer was answered not with a miracle but with a resolution almost as good one night the sixth or seventh since leaving our encampment near the battlefield at caer gloiu mercia and his priest approached bedwyrs tent bedwyr had brought arthurs camp chair and tent as the sole scant consolation of a miserable journey we were enjoying a moments rest after another arduous day what do they want now growled bedwyr like bedwyr i desired nothing more than to end this day of heat and dust in good company i will deal with them i said thinking to send them away i stood to call out stay brother bedwyr sighed changing his mind as we have not had more than a dusty glimpse of them for a day or two we had better allow him his say swarthy mercia dark hair and eyes darker still in the fading twilight hailed us with his customary salute striking his heart with his fist the oncecaptive priest hergest spoke when mercia spoke saying greetings friends greetings bedwyr replied bleakly after days of herding vandali he was finding it hard to muster any enthusiasm for their concerns sit down if you will i said making a gesture towards courtesy we would offer you a cup to wet your throats on such a sultry day but we have nothing to put in it i said this last to discourage the appeal i knew was coming every day since the beginning of this journey one or another of the barbarian chieftains had come before us to demand a greater water ration sometimes two or three on the same day what little water we had was shared out to all in equal measure as i told them each and every day it is hot yes said mercia his speech though broken was rapidly improving no doubt hergest was a good teacher yes bedwyr answered leaning back in his chair we need rain the land needs rain my people thirst mercia said bluntly bedwyr reacted irritably am i a fountain i just said we need rain it is a drought you know everyone is thirsty mercia gazed mildly back undisturbed by this outburst he glanced at hergest who uttered a few harshsounding words in his own tongue the vandal merely nodded and loosed a lengthy torrent of barbarian jabber when he finished he nodded again this time to the priest who said lord mercia wants you both to know that he would be less than noble if he did not ask for water when his people are thirsty he intended no disrespect very well bedwyr muttered somewhat chastened by his reply mercia also says that he is unhappy continued hergest before bedwyr or i could frame a reply the priest said the source of his unhappiness is this rooting britons from their homes sits ill with him to be the cause of such hardship does make him seem small in his own eyes i understand bedwyr told him but there is nothing to be done the hardship to the britons has come about by the willful action of their lords who broke faith with arthur the punishment is shared by all that is the high kings command when the stalwart priest had conveyed my meaning mercia answered i quarrel not with arthurs judgment but i would offer a ah an understanding he said speaking through hergest yes asked bedwyr warily what is this understanding allow us to settle unclaimed lands suggested mercia through his priest let stay who will but tell them we will not possess inhabited british holdings this was unforeseen and let britons and vandali live together in the same realm i asked if any care to stay hergest answered the vandal would share the land with any willing to share the land with them is he earnest bedwyr inquired pulling on his chin indeed hergest assured us adamantly he has spoken to the other chieftains and they all agree they would rather settle the wilderness than displace the innocent he paused may i explain if you can it is this way said hergest arthurs generosity is more than they expected and it has shamed them the people of vandalia are a proud race and resourceful because need is great they will accept the land arthur has decreed for them but their pride recoils from causing hardship to the kinsmen of those who have befriended them i shook my head in amazement hardship blessed jesu only a few days ago these bloodlusting barbarians were plundering and burning these same british settlements that mercia spat was amilcars doing obviously there was little love between the defeated vandal king and his minions and is mercia so very different bedwyr asked harshly pressing the matter i think to see what sort of man the new king might be without hesitation the priest replied mercia regrets the plundering and burning that amilcar inflicted on this land it was war such things happen but now that mercia is lord of the vandali hussae and rogatti he has pledged friendship with arthur this friendship he values greatly and would increase its worth by extending it to the britons holding the lands wherein the vandal tribes must settle i was amazed the suggestion showed both benevolence and shrewdness the cunning i might have expected but the compassion in the barbarians suggestion took me by surprise i looked at bedwyr who looked at me rubbing the back of his neck hergest saw our hesitation mercia does not ask that you trust him only that you try him it is not a matter of trust bedwyr said slowly the summer is far advanced there is no time to raise crops before winter comes you will require dwellings and cattle pens and everything else where will you get them if not from the britons when the priest had explained bedwyrs words to him the young chieftain smiled we are not without skill in such matters he replied through hergest besides the wise ones among us say that this winter shall be like those of our homeland in the southern sea it will do us no harm winter in the north is harsh and long bedwyr told him as i know only too well your concern does you honour lord bedwyr hergest answered but would not homeless britons suffer the winter as readily as homeless vandali he lifted a hand to mercia my lord says that if we are to live under arthurs rule let it be among arthurs people the young chieftains eyes shifted from bedwyr to me and back again willing us to believe i regarded him carefully uncertain what to do truly they offered us a way out of the hateful task of forcing people from their homes countrymen whose only sin was having unfaithful noblemen for lords what would arthur do i was on the point of sending them away to allow us to think the thing through when mercia said lord bedvyr lord galahad that was as much as he could make of our names please i beg you let us prove the trust that has been granted us very well bedwyr said making up his mind at once let it be as you say we will conduct you to unclaimed lands and there you shall make your home i leave it to you how to divide the realms between your tribes make your settlements as you will but there is to be no trouble between your people and the britons who choose to remain he said this sternly every word an implied threat mercia rushed forward knelt before him seized his hand and kissed it no doubt this was a common thing among the vandal kind but we are not so accustomed bedwyr snatched his hand away saying rise mercia you have the thing you seek go and tell your people mercia rose and stood a little apart smiling his good pleasure a wise decision prince bedwyr hergest assured us he touched a hand to his throat and i noticed he no longer wore the iron slave ring make certain i do not live to regret it the vandali are barbarians it is true they give their word rarely but when they do the vow endures to the fifth generation the priest affirmed i trust mercia may god be good to you bedwyr told him i am content i am heartily glad you are content i told bedwyr when they had gone i only wonder what arthur will say when he hears what we have done i care nothing for that replied bedwyr he turned away quickly adding i pray instead he lives to hear it two bedwyr retreated to the tent but i remained outside thinking and listening to the sounds of the camp settling in for the night twilight deepened around me i watched the dusky slope of the distant hillside begin to glow as campfires wakened in the darkness soon the aroma of roasting meat stirred me what has become of rhys i wondered thinking that he should have returned long ago he and a small company of warriors had gone in search of water as soon as we halted our days march we were camped in a shallow valley and there were streams in the surrounding hills finding water had become the chief task of each and every day we did not neglect any possible means of filling the waterskins and jars as we moved farther up the vale the streams narrowed and thinned and the search became more difficult we had not located any drinking water this day so rhys had undertaken to continue looking the rest of the cymbrogi were nearby having established camp at a second place on the hillside we did this by way of guarding the vandal host yet allowing ourselves a ready retreat for though they were no longer armed their spears alone filled three wagons there were so many of them that we could easily be overrun thus we always made two camps a short distance apart and kept watch through the night he will soon return bedwyr assured me when i pointed out that it was well past dark and still no sign of rhys and his company why uneasy brother how much water remains the cymbrogi also stood guard over the water wagons lest anyone try to steal another share one day at full rations he replied he had already reckoned the amount we could go on half rations but i would rather wait until rhys returns to make that decision i left him to his rest and returned to the campfire feeling uneasy and troubled though i could not think why perhaps i was merely tired it seemed like years since i had slept more than two nights in the same place years since i had slept without a weapon in my hand once mercia and his folk were settled i thought we will begin to enjoy the peace we have all fought so long to achieve a pale phantom moon rose and soared like a silent spectre over the narrow valley i supped on something tough and tasteless stewed saddle perhaps and finished the last of my days ration of water i retreated to the tent and lay down but found the closeness inside stifling so i took up the oxhide and stretched out on the ground a short distance away whereupon i found i could not sleep for the barking of the camp dogs i lay on my back with my arms folded over my chest gazing up at the heavens marking the slow progression of the moon and wondering if the mutts were always so loud i lay a long time before realizing that i was listening for rhys return i identified all the night sounds of the camp horses whickering and jittery at their pickets the tight voices of the sentries as they moved along the boundary the faroff call of a night bird in a distant tree all familiar yet made peculiar by my listening or perhaps it was something else something in the air making them seem that way i must have dozed without knowing it for when i looked again the moon was well down i heard the short sharp challenge of a sentry and the expected reply i rose at once and made my way to the picket line to see rhys and his band dismounting some of the men swayed on their feet exhausted by their long search good hunting i called hurrying to join them rhys turned when he heard me the look on his face halted me in my steps rhys he tossed a quick command over his shoulder and then stepped near we found a spring he said his voice husky and strange perhaps it was merely fatigue but i have seen terror often enough to recognize its many guises and i thought rhys wore it now a spring yes i said searching the stewards face for a sign good well done is it far he took my arm wheeled me around and started walking me away when we were out of hearing of the men he said no not far the spring is not large but it supplies a pool we can get water there he paused hesitating uncertain how to proceed rhys there is something queer about the spring yes you said it was not far indeed it is just beyond the hill he lifted a hand but the gesture died and he lapsed again into a hesitant silence well i demanded growing impatient with his reticence speak man his reply was swift and harsh i do not like it something queer is out there he glowered at me calm yourself i said soothingly come to the tent sit down you have not eaten anything all day you must be starving come rhys i led him to the tent and sat him in arthurs chair then roused one of the younger men who served the dragon flight wake you baram i said rhys has returned fetch food and water rhys sat slumped in the camp chair his head bent forward resting in his hands i had never seen him so food is coming i said dragging up a stool thinking to distract him from his thoughts i began telling him about our talk with mercia and hergest in a little while baram appeared with the food i dismissed him to his rest once more and served rhys myself when he finished eating he seemed in better spirits so i said now then tell me about this strange pool you have found rhys nodded took a long draught of water swallowed slowly and then began we came upon it before sundown it is no great distance from here and we discovered it soon after we began there is a rocky outcrop on the hillside and a beech grove below the leaves on the trees looked fresh not wilted like all the rest so we rode to the place for a closer look the grove hides a cleft in the rocks pass through it and you come to the pool rhys voice trailed off as if he were revisiting a painful memory of long ago his dark eyes were downcast and he clutched the empty water jar tightly a cool place to escape the sun i observed encouraging him to continue it must have been a welcome find he glanced at me and then away again quickly we entered the grove and rode to the pool he said after a moment i dismounted and heard a sound singing it sounded like someone singing but though the grove and pool are small i could not see anyone he fell silent again hiding in the rocks perhaps i remarked he paid me no heed but sat hunched forward his jaw bulging as he clenched his teeth rhys i said softly fear for nothing man it is gwalchavad beside you now after a time he said i knelt to drink i remember stretching forth my hand to touch the water yes and then he raised his eyes and the fear leapt out in his glance i do not know he stood abruptly i reached towards the water and i when i looked again it was night and the moon was shining in the pool night comes quickly to these glens i offered halfheartedly it must have been later than you knew am i a babe in arms to know nothing of day or night he shouted calm yourself brother i only meant i remember nothing of what happened in the grove one moment it was bright day and the next i knew it was night and that far gone i gazed at his anguished expression and tried to soothe him perhaps you fell asleep it was hot and you had ridden long you were tired and it was cool in the shade overcome by your fatigue you fell asleep and why not a little nap is no bad thing the men with you did any of them remember falling asleep no they remember no more than i he said his voice tense with the effort of holding it steady all i know is that the sun shone as i knelt and when i stood again the sky was bright with stars and night was far advanced we returned at once it is disturbing perhaps i granted but nothing to worry over no doubt you make more of it than there is rhys glared defiantly it is sorcery he growled mark me something evil lurks there i slept ill rising at dawn to ride with rhys to the enchanted pool as he had said it was no great distance away lying in a narrow valley just a hill or two away from camp a grove of beech trees stood at one end of the glen dark in the shadow of the hillside there were six men with us leading the wagons for i was determined to have that water enchantment or no we dismounted at the edge of the grove and stood for a moment gazing into its darkshadowed heart as into a cave or tomb it was quiet but not unnaturally so do you hear rhys whispered it seems peaceful enough aye too peaceful he arched an eyebrow knowingly there are no birds well it may be they have gone i began and this the only water nearby he challenged the dell should be alive with birds stop whispering i told him sharply if there is anyone here they will have seen us long ago come i started into the grove let us examine the pond nights chill hung in the shaded depths of the grove as if the suns warming rays had no power to penetrate beyond the outer branches of the trees we passed between the leaning boles and ducked under lowhanging limbs and after a few steps came to the water my eyes gradually adjusted to the dim light and i saw that though the pool was not large it was set in a deep rockrimmed bowl i made my way to the waters edge and looked in but could not see the bottom a grey rock rose from the far end of the basin like a great squatting toad i heard the slow rhythmic drip drip drip of water splashing from the rock into the dark water you see whispered rhys it is just as i told you it is an unlovely place to be sure i replied but i find nothing amiss here no he answered after a moments silence nor do i whatever was here is gone now he turned pleading eyes to me there was something i believe you brother he turned away stricken afresh i remember now it was it was his jaw worked as he struggled for words i was suffocating as if a hand clenched my throat i could not breathe my lungs felt as if they would burst i remember thinking i must breathe or i will die and then nothing until i saw the moons reflection there he pointed to the centre of the rock bowl and looked up through the branches of the trees as if he thought he might see the moon once more i also raised my eyes and scanned the leafy bower above us the branches of the closegrown trees wove a dense roof over the pool not a scrap of blue sky showed through anywhere rhys shifted uneasily beside me on my life gwalchavad he said softly i thought it was the moon he paused i saw something glowing in the water i swear it did you say that you had tasted the water i asked and kneeling cupped my hand and dipped out some water i raised it to my nose and sniffed but could smell nothing unusual i put my hand to my lips and wet my tongue the water was warm and tasted slightly muddy but not at all bad for that what say you rhys watched me closely i have tasted worse i replied rhys squatted beside me and reached out to cup some water as he did so i observed a strange mark on the fleshy part of his upper arm what is this i wondered a wound the skin was broken and discoloured pierced by what appeared to be small pricks at regular intervals it looks like a bite i remarked an animal of some kind a dog perhaps rhys looked stricken i remember no bite well i said it is not so bad no doubt you have forgotten gwalchavad rhys said his voice thick i would know if i were bitten by a dog he craned his neck and held his arm to look at the wound i would remember once when i was but a lad my brother gwalcmai and i had found a cave and entered to find a sleeping bear i still remember the awful sick dread that overwhelmed me as i heard the slow snuffling breath saw the black shapeless mass of fur and realized that we had stumbled into a death trap unawares i felt the same feeling now as if we had intruded on something better left undisturbed glancing around quickly i stood let us fill the water casks and leave this place as soon as the wagons were loaded we left the grove and hurried back to find that the cymbrogi had struck camp and were ready to leave on another days march seeing no good reason to tarry bedwyr called the order and rhys raised the hunting horn and blew a lengthy rising blast to signal our departure the long disorderly ranks of vandali began moving once more i watched for a moment then steeling myself for another endless scorching day in the saddle i lifted the reins and rode on three the only person i ever loved did not love me i was young then and foolish i know i wielded not a fraction of the power i now possess or things might have gone differently the arrow was meant for my sister does that surprise you my sweet how so charis never spared a thought for me she was already grown when i was born and though we shared the same father avallach the invalid never spoke two words to me in all the time i lived under his roof the beloved briseis was dead and cold in her grave long long before my mother shared the great kings bed he needed lile and it is true he would have died but for her healing skill avallach used her depended on her but he never loved her even in death queen briseis commanded avallachs affections and lile the nursemaid was merely tolerated poor lile she wanted so to be his wife and though he married her in the end she was never more than his mistress even i a barefoot grubby child with dirty hands and snotty nose could see that my mother was insignificant and in my infant heart i vowed never to allow myself to descend to insignificance oh but i would look at charis so beautiful and strong the sun in its glory was not more radiant and bright i wanted nothing more in all the world than to be like her to be her when i saw the way my father looked at her the way his eyes filled with love and admiration for his goldenhaired daughter i wanted it all the more i would have given the world and everything in it just to have avallach smile at me the way he smiled at her he never did at first we harboured some small hope that the drought would slacken its hold the farther north we rode that was not to be however for the hills beyond the hafren vale were just as dusty as those we had left behind and the streambeds were just as dry nor did a single cloud ever darken the sky from dawn to dusk the heavens remained empty the sun rising and setting in a firmament of fiery white like a ball of flame simmering in a lake of molten iron i have heard of desert lands where rain falls but once a year though i had never known britain to suffer so for lack of rain searching for water to keep ourselves and the vandal horde supplied became our sole occupation fortunately there are springs in the central hills where we could refill our casks if not for these founts deep in the earth we might have died of thirst thus with gods help we were able to keep moving until reaching afon treont though the bracken on the hills was brown and tinderdry and the treont was showing a wide band of cracked mud and lumpy stone along either bank there was at least good water to be had in the long lake just to the north there we paused to rest for a few days the animals could drink their fill from the shallows but the better drinking water was farther out beyond the green stagnant pools we had to use boats to get it a labour which exhausted most of the day and the warriors were far from pleased about the tedious occupation ferrying water casks in coracles is like herding geese on the back of a pig declared cai he and bedwyr stood on the bare rock shore watching the small round boats struggling with their loads i see it keeps your tongue wet observed bedwyr sourly only just replied cai he watched the tipsy boats for a moment then said i suppose we must be moving on again soon nay bedwyr replied i am thinking we will stay here but arthur said i know what arthur said declared bedwyr edgily but he could not know how hard it is to keep these people fed and watered rheged is still some way to the north cai pointed out rubbing his whiskered chin and i am thinking this is far enough bedwyr growled god love you cai but you do know how to fret a man the flamehaired cai shouldered the affront with placid acceptance i merely suggest with this damnable drought there will be no harvest in rheged or anywhere else bedwyr explained sharply why go all the way to rheged when they can just as easily starve here indicating the darkwooded hills beyond the lake he said at least here they can get water and whatever can be had from the forest i see your point replied cai you do asked bedwyr suspiciously it is a good plan as good as any other also the settlements hereabouts are not so many that the folk will be hard pressed by the vandali said bedwyr continuing his argument enough i said it was a good plan the sooner we settle these these people the sooner we can head south i am anxious for word of arthur and i am not demanded bedwyr you are the only one eager for word of arthur i suppose if it is a fight you are wanting cai answered gruffly go argue with rhys no doubt he will oblige two of a kind the both of you bedwyr flared but held his tongue he gave cai a dark smouldering look and stormed away grumbling to himself cai watched him stumping along the lakeshore and take your temper with you he called at bedwyrs retreating back i saw what had happened do not be angry with him i said moving to cais side am i angry he shouted am i the one biting the head off anyone who happens by anyway he started it him and his foul mood the heat i suggested is making everyone surly och agreed cai clucking his tongue by the holy three i wish it would rain he turned a clear blue eye towards a sky just as clear and blue just look at that would you not a cloud anywhere not a single cloud all summer it is uncanny i tell you he drew a damp sleeve across his face it is too hot to stand out here any longer i am going back he stalked off leaving me to watch the labourers on the lake the round stones all along the shore were black where the moss had been blasted by the sun like skulls whose flesh had been burned to a dry crust the drought was i reflected exposing and killing much that was green and tender only the tough and deeprooted would survive as with plants so with people upon returning to camp i discovered several more riders preparing to leave bedwyr was sending word to the surrounding settlements never fear i have saved uriens settlement for last brother he informed me that one will require a man of wisdom and judgment that is why i am sending you gwalchavad you are too kind as we are staying here bedwyr said we will let the chieftains and headmen come to us why not it saves us chasing all over britain bringing the bad news it saves some of us perhaps well said bedwyr with a wry smile a borrowed horse never tires what am i to tell them ah that is where your wisdom and judgment will be invaluable first light the next morning i called two of the younger warriors to accompany me on my errand they were raw freshfeatured youths one named tallaght the other named peredur they were glad for a chance to quit the coracles for a day or two and we left as soon as the horses were saddled striking north and west searching for the trail bedwyr maintained we would find and which would lead us to uriens fortress in the south rheged hills as bedwyr knew the land i did not doubt him in the least but it seemed to me that we rode a long way before finding anything that resembled the track he had described is this the trail do you think wondered tallaght doubtfully we have seen no others i replied looking at the narrow overgrown track little more than a beaten path through thick bracken it will serve until we find another who knows it may become more serviceable farther on with that we rode on eventually coming to a stand of birch trees the outriders as it were of the thickly forested hills farther on as there was a bit of grass showing green in the shade of these trees i decided to stop and let the horses graze a little before continuing on our way the wood was cool and it felt good to get out of the sun for a while we dismounted refreshed ourselves from the waterskins and then lay back in the long grass to doze an indulgence denied those enduring the swelter and confusion of the lakeside it seemed as if i had just closed my eyes when peredur nudged me i came awake with a start shh he warned his face close to mine listen there came a light buoyant sound such as the breeze might make of a summers evening or a rill as it slips and splashes through the glen but the sound was made by a human voice and i found it enchanting tallaght and peredur were sitting all hunchshouldered their faces tight and swords half drawn have you never heard singing i said climbing to my feet never like that peredur murmured regarding me strangely tallaght too appeared unnerved by the sound put up your blades i said and let us find the creature making this delightful sound the two obeyed reluctantly and i wondered at their odd behaviour likely they had fallen asleep and the singing had wakened them out of a dream however it was i put the matter behind me and proceeded into the wood the singing seemed to drift to us in fits and starts which made locating the source more difficult than it might have been just when we thought we had found the singer the sound would stop only to begin again slightly farther away she is leading us into the forest i whispered to tallaght after we had chased a while you and peredur go around i made a circling motion with my finger i will drive her towards you and we will catch her between us she wondered peredur a maid most certainly i asserted i have never heard a man who could sing like that now then let us see if we can catch this elusive songbird ready the two nodded and i started ahead once more they waited until i had taken a few paces and then darted off the trail on the run i proceeded at a slow but steady pace taking care to make more noise than necessary in order to maintain the illusion that there were still three hunters in the chase walking along listening to the lilting song drifting back to me and watching the flickering patterns of sunlight on the path i fell into a reverie it seemed as if i walked not in dappled forest light in the heat of another dry day but in the cool dawn of a fine misty morning i fancied that i could even smell the sweet fragrance of spring flowers as i passed though these were long since gone and then all at once so swiftly that it startled me i stepped into a glade there on the grass before me sat a beautiful young woman flaxenhaired with tawny skin she seemed to have fallen on the path for she lay on one elbow and the mushrooms she had been gathering were scattered about her her mantle had risen revealing a shapely leg she was bare of foot and head her golden hair was uncombed but long and tightly curled giving her the look of a wild thing my sudden appearance seemed to have surprised her for she glanced up catching her breath as her eyes met mine jesu save me those eyes deep green and ever so slightly slanted giving her a most beguiling aspect she was dressed poorly her mantle was smirched the hem ragged there were holes where it had been torn clearly she had been digging with her hands for the fingers of both were filthy she sat in surprise for a moment her lips half parted as if uncertain whether to scream seeing her agitation i raised my hands to show i held no weapons and said peace sister i mean you no harm she looked at me curiously but made no move to stand or speak i moved a step closer and we looked at one another for a long moment i had never seen eyes so clear and so green are you hurt i asked bending low on one knee do you need help still she made no answer i was about to repeat the question when peredur and tallaght burst into the clearing they were sweating and breathing hard from their run they looked first to the young woman and then to me tallaghts bewilderment melted at once to relief but peredur stared his expression growing strange we have found our singer i said and motioned the two of them closer to the young woman i said you need have no fear these men appear more fierce than they are glancing at the warriors the girl hastily pulled her tattered clothing over her legs and began struggling to her feet allow me to help you i said leaning forward and offering my hand she looked at my hand but did not take it i said to the warriors i think your rough looks have stolen her voice peredurs odd expression altered his eyes showed white all around he appeared distressed and confused as if in terror for his life calm yourself brother i said there is no harm see we have upset the lady to disturb one so beautiful is surely a sin addressing the young woman i offered my hand once more with a quick glance to the others she took it and allowed me to raise her to her feet i am gwalchavad i told her and asked what are you called she declined to reply so i said we are making for urien rhegeds stronghold perhaps you would kindly show us the way she regarded me closely watching my mouth then pointed through the trees to the west and is it far i asked again without a word she knelt and began gathering the mushrooms she had spilled onto the path here men help her perhaps she will lead us to the fortress tallaght stooped and commenced retrieving the mushrooms peredur still staring made no move well will you stand there gaping all day lend a hand i commanded we must be getting on our way he bent to the task with it seemed to me extreme reluctance i could make no sense of the lads strange behaviour had he never met a beautiful girl before what manner of man allowed himself to be so unnerved by a pretty face and a comely foot we made short work of gathering the scattered mushrooms which she received without a word and secured in a fold of her mantle now then i told her if you would not mind leading us to the fortress we have business with your chieftain she turned and started walking in the direction she had pointed i started after her advancing only a few paces however when peredur called out wait we should not leave the horses behind i suppose that in the distraction of the chase i had forgotten about them entirely you and tallaght fetch the horses and join us on the trail i do not think the settlement can be far away with that i turned and continued on the young woman walked ahead of me quickly but pausing every now and then to glance over her shoulder to see if i was still behind she moved so swiftly i found it a chore to keep pace with her gradually the wood began to thin and the land to rise and then we stepped from the trees into the full bright sun cleared land lay before us planted in fields the crops were withered however leaves and stalks dry and rattling listlessly in the sun beyond the fields squatting atop the broad crest of the hill stood the timber wall of the stronghold a wellused track emerged from the wood not fifty paces from where i walked and made its way to the fortress gate i wondered how we had missed such a welltravelled road in our search the young woman halted just ahead of me gazing at the stronghold i moved to stand beside her and she pointed to the place i thank you for leading me i told her we started across the field together and had just reached the trail when i heard a shout behind us and turned the young woman continued on without looking back peredur and tallaght emerged from the wood leading my horse they rode to where i stood waiting the trail led from the glade explained tallaght i cannot understand how we missed it before nor can i added peredur well i replied at least we will not have to search for it on our return taking the reins from tallaght i said you can go ahead if you like i will walk with our guide at this both warriors exchanged uneasy glances but i ignored their odd behaviour and quickly joined the young woman on the trail we walked towards the gate a steady climb as the hill rose steeply at its summit and the young woman kept her eyes on the stronghold and said nothing approaching the gate we were hailed by a man brandishing a spear greetings he called hastening forward to meet us i give you good day i gave the gateman my greeting whereupon he looked at the girl beside me and stopped in his tracks losing control of his spear which fell to the ground he bent to retrieve it and stood staring at us his mouth agape like a beached fish we come looking for the caer of urien rheged i told the man have we found it that you have lord he replied slowly he seemed to have difficulty taking his eyes from the girl for her part she regarded the man without expression indeed she seemed to look through him to the settlement beyond but if it is himself you are wanting i must tell you he is not here the man said his attention shifted to the two warriors coming up behind me is it far you have ridden today we have come from the pendragon i answered our camp is no farther than a short days ride the pendragon here cried the man but our lord is gone to join him in the south his eyes fearful now shifted quickly to me has urien been killed i must tell hwyl i must tell him at once he made to dash away then and there but i held him stay friend calm yourself all will be explained in good time i smiled to assure him we meant no harm ah but it is too hot to be standing here in the sun perhaps there is a shady spot within i gestured towards the fortress my men and i could use a drink and the horses as well forgive me lord spluttered the man i am a hound for yapping on so come with me and i will lead you to hwyl he holds the throne while lord urien is gone the man turned on his heel and rushed off i took a step or two and noticed that the young woman was not following indeed she paid not the least heed to the conversation that had just taken place but was still gazing at the fortress as if entranced by the sight stepping once more beside her i touched her arm and said we are going up now perhaps you could lead us she gave a shudder as with cold and came to herself once more she looked at me nodded and proceeded to follow the gateman i fell into step behind her and the two warriors came after we passed through the gates and into the foreyard of the caer it was a large fortification well provided with numerous storehouses and dwellings people occupied with their daily chores paused in their work to observe us a few called greetings most if not all regarded the young woman beside me with looks of unguarded curiosity the gateman ran before us into the hall reappearing a moment later with another man tall and slender and despite the grey in his thinning hair alert and readyhanded greetings in the name of the pendragon i said i told him who it was that addressed him and presented the two warriors with me we have come to speak to the chieftain here and secure his aid i am hwyl the man stepped before me uriens chieftain i am and i give you good greeting lord gwalchavad he held out his arms to me by way of welcome it is an old celtic custom that when two friends or kinsmen meet they grip one another by the arms and look into each others eyes to exchange their greeting we do this in the north and in the islands too although i did not expect to receive such a welcome here but then i thought they did not yet know of uriens banishment our reception might sour when they heard what i had to tell them turning his eyes to the young woman he gave her an appraising look and said i would greet your friend but you have not told me her name i had hoped you could tell me i replied as we found her within shout of the stronghold i assumed she was one of your people my people wondered the chieftain much surprised but you are mistaken i am certain we have never seen her before four hwyl appeared unsettled by the simple suggestion that the young woman might belong to his tribe know you i would remember her he stated firmly if i had ever seen her before and i have not he shook his head emphatically she is not of our folk well i said perhaps some of your people know her no doubt she comes from a holding nearby perhaps allowed hwyl reluctantly addressing the girl he asked do you have kinsfolk hereabouts although she turned her eyes towards him as he spoke she gave no other sign that she had heard the question he asked again and received again the same uncomprehending stare see now said hwyl beginning to lose patience this reluctance is unseemly we have asked kindly and expect an answer we mean you no harm please i said to hwyl i believe she is mute she has not said a single word since we found her seeking merely to reassure her i reached out and touched her gently on the arm may god have mercy on her soul it is a pity however light my touch produced an astonishing result the young woman pulled her arm away as if my fingertips had burned her flesh she held the arm stiff and close to her staring wildeyed as she backed away from me rubbing the place my hand had touched she took three steps and began trembling and shaking all over her eyes then rolled up into her head showing nothing but white meanwhile her mouth framed a scream but no sound emerged she then collapsed falling to the ground where she began thrashing and rolling as if in unbearable agony i was beside her in two steps bring water i shouted kneeling over her hurry hwyl sent the gateman scrambling away for water i called to peredur and tallaght it is the heat we must get her out of the sun bring her into the hall suggested hwyl going before me by the time the two warriors had dismounted i was already striding for the entrance it took all my strength to hold her for the tremors threatened to throw us down at every step i could feel the muscles of her back and arms stiff and tight as iron bands somehow i reached the doorway and stumbled in owing to the high roof and lack of windholes the hall was dimly dark and much cooler along one side of the great room was a series of wicker partitions separating a number of sleeping places i carried the stricken young woman to the first of these and lay her down on the straw pallet and then stood helplessly watching the convulsions coursing through her body two women from the settlement entered and rushed to the young womans side one of the women carried a water jar and the other some rags kneeling down in the straw the first cradled the young womans head in her lap while the other wet the cloth and began applying it gently to her forehead this produced a soothing effect and in a moment it appeared the more violent of her spasms had passed the girl closed her eyes and lay back still trembling and shaking somewhat but quieter go about your affairs said the woman with the water jar we will look after her and bring word of any change i thanked her kindly and leaving the young woman to the elder womens care summoned tallaght and charged him to tend the horses but hwyl interposed saying please have no care for the beasts get will see your mounts watered and rested join me at table we will share a cup instead thus we settled with hwyl at the far end of the hall where a table stood beside a long hearth next to a large chair made of oak and covered with the hides of three or four red stags a young boy appeared as soon as we sat down he carried a bowl of ale which he placed on the table he looked to the chieftain for approval and receiving it in the nod of his elder turned and ran away that is ffinn my young nephew i am teaching him to serve in the hall explained hwyl all those of an age have gone with urien to fight the war in the south but as you are here no doubt they will be returning soon lifting the bowl he took a drink and passed it to me saying welcome my friends the comfort of this hearth is yours for as long as you care to stay i drank the brew was cool dark and sweet and with great reluctance passed the bowl to tallaght your welcome cheers me i told the chieftain it is too long since i have tasted ale so good already i am regretting that we cannot stay longer he offered the cup around once more and said be it short or long your stay is more than agreeable we have had no word from the south at all a quick sharp thrust is best i thought drawing a deep breath word is not good i told him the war is over but the price has been high i feared as much remarked hwyl grimly is urien dead no i answered grateful for the opportunity to set the matter in a different light no he is not dead though perhaps he might prefer it suspicion clouded hwyls features death is more than enough for most men i find hwyl i said your lord has been banished from britain i let that sink in a moment before explaining urien broke faith with the high king and joined a faction that rebelled against arthur the rebellion was crushed and the leaders exiled to armorica along with any who would go with them urien will not be returning to rheged hwyl staring at the empty board before him was shaking his head and muttering to himself i might have let him find out later at the council but i know if i were in his place i would wish to learn the worst as soon as possible so that i could warn the settlement and begin making plans i am sorry to bear such bad tidings i continued and then drove the blade home the lands of all who joined in the rebellion are forfeit to the high king and he has given them to another the chieftain raised his eyes at this his face was ashen with shock and dismay but his reply surprised me bad tidings you say he mused shaking his head ruefully and that is only the half of it he looked at me as if staring hopelessness in the face then turning once more to the contemplation of his barren table he said gods truth i always feared the worst did you now alas urien is no steady man as a boy he was a flighty lad so unlike his father i always hoped he would come to a better nature but no he has grown reckless headstrong and inconstant unhealthy in any man such character is perilous in a ruler even so i hoped he looked at me with sad haunted eyes his mouth quivering his voice thick that we took him for our lord i do most deeply regret i am sorry it has come to this i told him hwyl struggling to hold himself simply nodded he was too overcome to speak peredur extended the bowl to me indicating that i should give it to the chieftain which i did hwyl accepted the ale and braced himself with a last long drink it is bad for you i will not deny it i said when he had finished yet it need not be the ruin you fear no his interest pricked if there is some way to avert the judgment lord i beg you to tell me there is i assured him if you will abide it i then extended the small hope i had brought with me the man who has been given these lands is not willing that any should be cast out he has said that any who wish to stay in their settlements may do so and has vowed that the protection he affords his own people will be extended to all who remain in his realm thinking he saw the answer to his troubles hwyl seized the proposition at once then we will stay by god we will stay wait until you have heard all i cautioned you may have different thoughts when i tell the rest hwyl unwilling to throw aside the promise so quickly embraced said tell me then it can be no worse than i have heard already it is this the man of whom i speak is not a briton no a frown of concern creased his brow he imagined the worst and confronted it headon is he irish then he is not irish either i said peredur and tallaght knew what was coming and tensed as if to meet a blow there was no way to say otherwise so i told him the blunt truth this man is the lord and leader of the enemy we have been fighting in the south blessed god in heaven breathed hwyl aghast at such harsh justice i allowed him to grapple with this wishing we had another cup or two to help digest this meal of stones his name is mercia and he is lord of the vandali who have been conquered the enemy king who made war on britain has been vanquished and in exchange for peace his lords have sworn fealty to arthur pendragon it is mercias desire to occupy unsettled lands he purposes that his people should raise their own settlements and strongholds what is more this mercia has vowed that he will take nothing that is not given freely and will strive for peace between his people and the britons who remain under his care hwyl was silent for a time coming to terms with what i had said we can stay that is certain he asked finally mercia has made this promise cannot honestly vouch for its certainty but you need not answer me now hold council with your people i advised summon the other chieftains and talk to them if we left our lands where would we go there is no provision for you elsewhere so that is the way of it concluded hwyl bitterly it is either remain and be ruled by an enemy or become like the picti and wander the hills knowing neither hearth nor home i did not allow his budding anger a chance to flower yes that is the way of it in the pendragons name you and your chieftains are summoned to a council of all whose lands are forfeit i informed him you are to deliver your decision then i signalled to peredur and tallaght that it was time to go the two rose at once and i instructed them to ready the horses will you not stay the night asked hwyl but the warmth of hospitality had grown cool his shoulders were slumped now as if under the weight of his grief and the hard judgment he must endure we have disturbed the peace of this place more than enough i answered i think we should leave you to your deliberations hwyl did not disagree but merely nodded and said that might be best i told him when and where the council would be held and then took my leave of him he walked with me out of the hall passing by the place where the young woman lay the two looking after her rose as we approached she is sleeping soundly now the elder woman reported was it the sun i asked aye it was the woman replied nor i surmise has she had a bite to eat for a good few days she was gathering mushrooms when we found her the woman regarded me suspiciously those even one of those would kill a horse she explained as if i should have known better hwyl asked what would you have us do with her might she stay here she does not belong here said hwyl firmly that much i know her people may be searching for her the woman offered but she is in no wise fit to travel perhaps i suggested you could take care of her for a few days and bring her with you when you come to the council there will be people from other settlements in the region someone may know her that we will do hwyl replied now i bid you farewell i wish our meeting had been otherwise i told him i am sorry the chieftain shook his head urien has brought this calamity upon us not you i must speak to the people and decide what is to be done we will come to the council and give our answer we left the settlement then all thoughts of ale vats far behind us and rode as far as we could before daylight left us we made rough camp along the way and slept under the stars i was long awake however thinking about the young woman we had found and the strangeness of that finding but stranger things were to come five rejoining the cymbrogi next day we found the entire lakeside camp in an uproar we rode into the midst of a throng shouting and clamouring outside the tent everyone was so excited that it took some moments before i could make myself heard finally leaning down from the saddle i seized the shoulder of the nearest warrior why this turmoil i demanded what trouble trouble he cried twisting around to see me there is no trouble lord gwalchavad he replied grinning unless you think the happy return of our pendragon a quarrelsome thing arthur returned i wondered so soon handing the warrior the reins of my horse i left him to care for the animal as a reward for his impudence and pushed my way nearer the tent i caught sight of cai attempting to subdue the enthusiasm of the crowd with an inadequate supply of gestures and grimaces pressing my way to him i said where is he ah gwalchavad thank god you are here i could use another hand they say arthur has returned aye he confirmed he lies within cai indicated the tent behind and might welcome a mote of peace and quiet turning once more to the crowd he frowned listen to them now he made to renew his efforts at silencing the clamorous cymbrogi but i restrained him putting my hand flat on cais chest i demanded but is he well brother just tell me that see for yourself he replied brushing off my hand for if you will not help at least get out of the way cais reply gave me little direction for my expectation i stepped quickly to the tent and reached to withdraw the flap not knowing whether i should find a king more dead than alive the mood of the warriors was high but as downcast as they had been since the high king was taken away they might have easily mistaken arthurs return holding it a thing more hopeful than was otherwise warranted crowds i know have a way of believing only what they want to believe oh but i had seen the wound men who sustain such injury even if they survive rarely recover their full vigour as many a battlescarred veteran will attest though i am no healer i know whereof i speak for ever since i was old enough to throw a spear without falling off my horse i have followed my king into the fight and have seen the crippled and dying afterwards may god have mercy i have myself sent to the judgment seat more men than i can remember yes i had seen arthurs wound deep it was and brutal the blood ran dark in hot pulsing rushets when they carried him from the field his skin was pale as that of a corpse his hair lank and his eyes sunk back in his skull as i say i was no stranger to that appearance still i never thought to see arthur wear it plucking up my courage i grasped the tent flap pulled it aside and stepped quickly in scarcely less crowded inside than out i shouldered my way farther into the tents interior straining for a glimpse of arthur and saw the back of bedwyrs head and beside him rhys cador and llenlleawg pressed near also i shoved closer almost trembling with uncertainty i pushed in between bedwyr and cador bedwyr glancing back saw that it was me and shifted a half step aside and there was arthur sitting in his camp chair impatient with myrddin who was bending over him gwenhwyvar stood behind resting her hands on his broad shoulders a satisfied smile curving her lips arthur looked up at my appearing and cried gwalchavad welcome brother i hoped you would soon join us he made to rise in greeting but the emrys tugged him back down into the chair let me finish myrddin muttered i cannot sit here all day arthur complained the men are waiting i must speak to them we will be at this all day if you do not sit still long enough for me to put this on you snapped myrddin ah look at you now said arthur glancing around and grinning at what he saw it is earth and sky to see you brothers he reached out to seize bedwyr by the arm stop squirming myrddin insisted a moment more arthur raised his eyes heavenward as the emrys bent over his work there said myrddin finally stepping back we are finished arthur glanced down holding up his arm bent at the elbow i saw the dull gleam of redgold encircling the high kings upper arm it was an armband but unlike any i had seen before a dragon its serpentlike body encoiled glaring fearlessly upon the world with redflecked ruby eyes a handsome ornament to be sure god alone knows where myrddin got it it came to me that the trinkets form was not unlike the image on the standard which uther had made and carried into battle having revived uthers old title to such magnificent acclaim myrddin thought to adorn the occasion with a worthy reminder of arthurs lineage tradition they say is a powerful and influential friend to those who honour it at last said arthur as he jumped up making for the tent flap there was not the least hesitation or difficulty in his movements if i had not seen him sprawled at deaths gate life ebbing with every beat of his heart i would have thought myself deceived could this be the selfsame man how was it possible a wound of such dire consequence could be healed so quickly he pushed through the crush of onlookers patting their backs and calling their names but moving on eager to get outside we will drink together friends he called lifting the oxhide flap and stepping through that was arthur truly forgetting that we had only tepid lake water and were fortunate to get that much less any ale with which to hail his safe return snagging hold of llenlleawg as he followed arthur out i asked how is it possible the lanky irishman merely looked at me and grinned but passed along with no reply turning to myrddin i said will no one tell me anything greetings gwalchavad the emrys spoke soothingly you had a successful journey i hope never mind about me i answered how is it that arthur is healed what is the meaning of the armband and why is it that peace said myrddin raising his hands against my onslaught i can answer but one question at a time we have been to ynys avallach he said as you know to obtain for arthur the healing we could not effect ourselves you have succeeded marvellously well i remarked the others had quickly cleared the tent leaving myrddin and me alone for a moment outside the cheering grew loud and then died away as arthur began to address the cymbrogi i had little to do with it myrddin assured me his voice grew solemn arthur lived but only that much and no more he held up a finger pressed against his thumb to show how narrow was arthurs claim on mortal life i do not know how he clung to a cord so slender but he did yes and then heaven was with us and he was healed myrddin answered regarding me mildly he is as you see yes yes i said impatience getting the better of me i can clearly see but how it was a miracle he explained but a miracle of such provenance that it allowed no witnesses i cannot tell you how nor will arthur speak of it perhaps one day he will tell us but not yet despite myrddins words i sensed there was still much that he would not say but cai said cai refuses to believe his eyes myrddin declared flatly as for the golden armband he continued it belonged to uther ygerna had it made for him after they were married it gave him the idea for the dragon standard when uther died ygerna kept it for her son always believing he would one day become high king like his father why did you wait until now to give it to him whenever did i have a better chance myrddin demanded we have scarcely had space enough to draw breath from one battle to the next no doubt that will change i mused now that we have rid ourselves of invaders and rebellious britons we can enjoy a season of peace that is what i have been saying all my life myrddin replied tartly six i remember lost atlantis though i was but a babe in arms when the calamity came upon us i can still see the isle of apples as it was then before the destruction the great palace was much reduced from its former glory owing to avallachs long wasting illness everything was falling into neglect even so to my childish recollection all was leafgreen and golden sunlight endless gardens and mysterious rooms no one entered anymore my mother turned the gardens to her use lile was wise in the ways of root and stem she knew the lore of herbs and her medicines were most potent we would spend entire days in those gardens my mother and i she working among her herbs and i playing at her feet she believed me too young to understand yet she told me everything she knew about the plants this is three hearts she would say it is useful for stanching the flow of blood and for purging the bowel in this way lile awakened in me the thirst to master the plants of healing and death but there was much much more than she knew the magi of atlantis had amassed the lore of every age and realm and though it took what would have been a lifetime for a mortal this lore i also acquired in broceliandes deep wood i found what i sought a remnant of our race had taken root there kians people avallachs son and charis brother there among the tall trees and deep shadows they had built a city i found it and found too the knowledge i craved there was a book from briseis library it came the queen loved her books i do not think she ever read it but it was saved i think annubi the royal familys faithful sage and counsellor may have had something to do with that if lile kindled the flame of love for secret lore annubi fanned that flame into an allconsuming fire at first it gave him pleasure to tell me things he was lonely after all later however he had no choice i made certain of that he served me and lived at my command annubi was the first man i bent to my will and i learned much about the power of the female sex when i had wrung him dry i let him go indeed i hastened him on his way he was the first but not the last far from it there have been so many each has had his purpose wealth power position blood i choose them well and take what they have to give whatever is required i become queen wife lover whore it is all the same to me myrddin was right of course there had been little time for anything other than fighting sometimes it seemed to me that we spent all our days ordering our weapons if we were not sharpening them we were repairing them and if not repairing them we were sharpening them again whenever we had a spare moment we looked to our horses and tended our wounds always anticipating the next battle the next war though the vandali had been defeated we remained wary unwilling perhaps to think that peace had finally come to the island of the mighty we had been cruelly disappointed before but as the wise emrys had suggested over the next few days arthur began to tell how he had come by his miraculous healing an intriguing tale made more so by the simple fact that apart from avallach arthur was its only observer and as he had been lying at deaths gate at the time he was not best placed to say what had happened and though he spoke with great enthusiasm and greater reverence the details remained hazy i gleaned there was something about a cup and a heavenly visitation and a prayer in a strange language by lord avallach of the holy men at the abbey there was never a mention thus i supposed they had little to do with the matter indeed the chief agent of the miracle seemed to be the cup or bowl which arthur had seen or thought he had seen in avallachs possession you drank something from the cup wondered bedwyr we were sitting at table arthur and the queen together with myrddin and a dozen of the dragon flight the elite of the pendragons warhost in the tent which served as a hall for us when we were on the battle trail it was late but we were exulting in our kings return and reluctant to leave the tent a potion or elixir one of paulus concoctions arthur pursed his lips that may be so he allowed i cannot remember avallach held it like this he cupped his hands as if cradling a bowl no wait he said shaking his head it was the other one avallach never touched it the other one cai demanded with growing frustration you mean to say there were two bowls now no not two bowls arthur retorted two people avallach and some other the angel suggested gwenhwyvar helpfully and everyone around the board turned his head to stare at her we all saw her she insisted appealing to myrddin she said tell them myrddin you must have seen it but myrddin scowling now refused to speak there was an angel she maintained defiantly we saw her cai instantly resumed his inquiry did the angel speak to you bear what did she look like if you say it was an angel so be it replied arthur equably i thought her one of avallachs servants this drew a snort from myrddin who folded his arms and turned his face away but what did they do demanded bedwyr did they touch you did you touch the bowl no said arthur he did not think he was touched or touched the bowl other than to drink if indeed he had drunk from the cup there was speaking a prayer he thought from the way avallach prostrated himself but in a language unknown to arthur there was light yes a blaze of candlelight that whelmed the room in shimmering radiance most wonderful to see and there seemed to be music arthur definitely thought he heard music but neither singing nor harps nor pipes nor anything else he had ever heard before but since neither avallach nor the heavenly servant had produced this music he could not be certain precisely how it might have come about he was more certain about the delicious fragrance that accompanied the appearance of the bowl it was he said as if all the flowers of summer were tumbled together each lending sweetness to the other and blending into an odour at once divine and indescribable these assertions brought more questions from cai bedwyr cador and the others who despite arthurs hazy recollections seemed determined to solve the mystery those who were there however appeared reluctant to speak gwenhwyvar made but simple comments of correction while llenlleawg and myrddin spoke not at all they were i suspect unwilling to scrutinize the miracle too closely and were content to allow the mystery to remain in the end however the continued assault on the mystery grew too much for myrddin drawing himself up he strode to the table and struck the board with the flat of his hand enough he shouted his voice a command even the deaf would obey glaring down along the board at those huddled on the benches he said listen to your mindless nattering you stand in the presence of a holy miracle and you yammer away like foolish children without a thought in your heads we only want to understand complained bedwyr sourly silence roared myrddin the terrible scowl on his face challenged anyone to speak and no one deigned to brave the challenge since you desire to know he continued stiffly i will tell what can be told the bowl as you have it is called the grail know you that it is none other than the welcome cup used by our lord christ himself at his last meal when he sat and supped with his friends on that same night he was betrayed and the next day was scourged and crucified one of the christs many followers was a wealthy merchant known to us as joseph of arimathea the same who provided the meal that night and the tomb as well joseph kept the cup which the lord had blessed and when the first believers were driven from jerusalem he brought the holy vessel to britain joseph and his friends established the first church in the west and it was here on ynys prydain that they raised the first altar to the risen christ alas that first church passed from this worldsrealm for the people were not yet ready to hear and receive the true word joseph and those with him died in their time and were buried beside the lake beneath the tor where avallach and charis now reside and where the monks have raised their abbey but the grail abides through means unknown to any save avallach who alone guards it the cup of christ is preserved in truth it is the holiest object that abides on earth its marvels are beyond telling and i know whereof i speak for once when i was stricken and dying this selfsame grail preserved and healed me and behold now it has healed arthur raising an admonitory hand he said but i warn you do not think to discover the how or why of it no man can tell you how it effects its healing nor why some are healed even while others perish truly it is enough to know that it endures as a special sign of gods good pleasure accept it revere it and let it be instead of worrying heaven and the angels with your ignorant chatter you should rather throw yourselves to the ground and repent of your folly so saying myrddin turned abruptly and departed the company sat for some moments in silence pondering myrddins curious warning then slowly talk resumed somewhat more respectful this time but no less excited after a time arthur visibly moved by what the emrys had said spoke his mind myrddin is right this is a thing too holy for idle speculation we would do well to guard our tongues better still suggested cai we should pay homage to the cup for healing our king to cais manifest amazement everyone agreed wholeheartedly arthur commended the plan and lauded cais suggestion embellishing it with the small addition of a special contingent of monks to offer prayers and psalms on behalf of the holy object and the realm thus would the pendragon establish his reign and the kingdom of summer commence dazzled by glory we all retired to our sleep that night in a mood of high expectation surely now after the saecsen wars and the battles fought to subdue the invading vandali we could lay aside our weapons and embrace the practice of peace so long abandoned in our homeland we dreamed that night of returning to peaceful pursuits growing contented and prosperous and enjoying the fruits won by our swords harsh labours having dreamed the glorious dream we rose the next morning to greet the sun rising on a new and splendid epoch the beginning of the summer kingdom taliesins ofttold vision when peace love and honour would govern britains island brood arthur regretted that he could not ride south at once be at ease bear steady bedwyr reassured him the council is soon finished a day or two more and we are done here as we might have expected myrddin thought little of the notion has it not occurred to any of you he inquired tartly that there is good reason why the grail has remained hidden all these years i have every confidence avallach knows best what to do hear me arthur do not think to meddle leave it alone but arthur would not listen thanking the emrys for his advice he proceeded to do the opposite and the plan quickly grew to include not merely a simple service of homage but a perpetual choir too and a church in which to house them all a seemly structure arthur said where any who are weary and oppressed can come and see the cup blessed of the saviour king himself he was convinced that just beholding the sacred vessel would work wonders for those who made pilgrimage to view it this he said would be the first of many marvellous undertakings with which he would commence his reign more and greater ventures would follow as bright dawn follows stormtorn night nevertheless bedwyr had summoned the lords and petty kings of the region in the kings name and much as arthur desired to hasten south to ynys avallach he must abide until the council finished and the vandal problem was laid to rest for once and all the necessity rubbed him raw but he endured filling the time with schemes and dreams which he elaborated at great length to any who happened near oh it was a wonderful sight to see and one which i thought had passed forever arthur in the blazing vigour of untempered youth inflamed by his vision of a holy britain even now entering the harmony and prosperity of the summer kingdom myrddin held himself apart viewing this turn of circumstance with a sour expression although he appeared illdisposed towards arthurs schemes he yet seemed loath to quench the fire that kindled them like everyone else i suppose he was only too happy to have arthur hale and whole once more and could not bring himself to steal even the smallest mote of the kings joy or dampen the pendragons ardour not that anything could when i asked him what he thought of arthurs plans the wise emrys merely shrugged it matters not a whit what i think he intoned somberly the high king will have his way in this come what may i thought this strange or at least unusual myrddins behaviour was often inexplicable but rarely proud and never meanspirited no one else seemed to notice myrddins gloomy indifference and this concerned me too i began to meditate on what myrddin had said about the grail and weighed his words against arthurs zeal but arrived at no firm conclusion still as i looked around me i saw that at least one other held some portion of myrddins reserve gwenhwyvar who had at first matched arthurs fervour with her own now appeared to be waning in her enthusiasm as the others were all too caught up in the golden glow of important doings i decided to discover gwenhwyvars heart in the matter it is not lack of faith that has brought me to this pass but lack of strength she confided that man wears me out he has ten new plans before sunrise and those ten have each spawned ten more before dusk he hardly sleeps and all the scheming makes him amorous i get no rest gwalchavad truly it is like sleeping with a whirlwind when gwenhwyvar realized what she had said the colour rose to her slender throat do not tell him i said that never my lady i assured her but do you think he is right i want to believe him she insisted adding and certainly he speaks like no other man if the summer realm can be brought into existence by dint of zeal alone arthur will succeed handsomely and if we are able to accomplish even so much as a tenth part of all he has planned i have no doubt our deeds will live forever her words were noble to be sure but i could not help noticing an edge to her voice whether of doubt or of uncertainty i could not say perhaps it was merely the fatigue she had mentioned still i marked it and remembered thinking to myself that the two people closest to arthur myrddin and gwenhwyvar were not wholly with him the next day the first of the regions lords began arriving for the council as i think of it now that was when the trouble started seven hwyl of rheged was among the first of the noblemen to appear he arrived at the lake camp with chieftains from the three holdings he protected he also brought the young woman we had found in the forest and left in his care truth to tell what with arthurs unexpected return i had not spared a single thought for the stranger until the moment i set eyes on her once again if she remembered me she gave no sign for as she passed her face remained impassive and her gaze moved over me without the slightest recognition as she regarded the pendragons camp she appeared slightly the better for her sojourn among hwyl and his people her long hair was neatly braided and her clothes were clean and since she appeared well treated and content i turned away and thought no more about her others arrived from surrounding lands arawn gryffyd and euan who held settlements east of the treont rhun hasner ensyth and gwrgan ffrych from the hill country to the west each came in the company of such chieftains and headmen as were deemed appropriate to attend the council in the absence of their respective kings we welcomed them and bade them assemble before the pendragons tent where the high king waited arthurs camp chair which he used as a throne when on the move had been set up outside the tent on a red oxhide on the ground four spears two upright and two crossed were established behind the chair and the pendragons shield hung from the crossed spears the high king received the homage of his noblemen with good grace and an easy manner speaking warmly to each one as he came before arthur in all i believe there were upwards of fifty noblemen who answered the summons along with many warriors and women of those two of them cyllin ap caradoc and cynfarch had ridden with arthur during the saecsen war and were happy to see him once more had they known barbarians were soon to be thrust into their midst they might not have embraced their pendragon so warmly so far as i knew only hwyl the chieftain i had personally alerted came prepared to deal with the matter at hand i dreaded thinking what would happen when the others learned of arthurs judgment strife was the last thing on arthurs mind however and though he had not forgotten his decree and its inevitable upheaval i believe he misjudged the intensity of the feelings so provoked in his present humour he could not conceive of the difficulty others would have swallowing the bitter cup he offered so full of peace and goodwill himself i think he really imagined all men readily and eagerly sharing his joy certainly his radiant and extravagant manner smoothed the way even so it was a rough ride over rugged ground as anyone save arthur might have expected the sudden announcement that their lands had fallen forfeit to barbarians did not sit well with the noblemen of the region stunned by the high kings declaration they sat glaring in icy silence while arthur explained the nature of the rebellion against him and its unfortunate consequences then much as i had done with hwyl he held out their only hope this is what i have decreed and this is how it will be he said solemnly treachery has reaped its reward however it has pleased god to temper justice with mercy so that the innocent do not suffer unduly for their ignoble lords disloyalty before me this day mercia lord of the vandali has vowed to uphold and protect those who remain on their lands within the realm he has been granted you may keep your settlements and holding your fields flocks and cattle he has undertaken the oath of christ and forsworn all other gods added to this he has given me his solemn pledge that he will take nothing from you that is not freely given intended to soothe these words kindled instead indeed it was as if arthur had thrown oil onto a sputtering flame the anger of the noblemens responses singed the very air swear faith to a barbarian roared lord ensyth i never will i am a briton and abide none but a trueborn briton over me neither will i see my lands given over to foreigners nor i shouted arawn his neighbour to the north as if this were the signal they had all been waiting for the whole assembly leapt up as one shouting thrusting fists of defiance in the air each striving to be heard above the others the council quickly lost all semblance of order the cymbrogi instinctively closed ranks around the pendragon put their hands to their sword hilts and looked to return force with force llenlleawg cai bedwyr rhys and i took up our places and stood to face the uproar arthur having caused the commotion yet appeared surprised at the vehemence with which the noblemen expressed their views he sat gazing in mild amazement as the council collapsed around him myrddin frowning hovered at arthurs right shoulder bent and spoke a word into the kings ear arthur merely raised his hand and dismissed the suggestion allowing the tumult to continue i suppose he thought such an overheated blaze would quickly burn itself out and he could more easily persuade the dissenters once their tempers had cooled this i fear was too generous a reading of the situation for the more they clamoured the hotter and more angry they grew truly i believe it would have ended in blows and bloodshed if not for the abrupt appearance of the mute young woman because of the confusion i do not know how she came to be there it seemed to me that she simply emerged in the midst of the chaos to stand among the angry lords for my own part i had been looking at arthur should any command be forthcoming and when i glanced back there she was standing as placidly as a maid in a meadow hands folded in front of her cool and chaste dressed in a simple white mantle tied at her slender waist with a bit of blue her fair hair glowing in the sun a vision as i thought could not appear more lovely in my eyes her unexpected presence unsettled the council the shouting continued for a moment and then ceased as one by one the irate lords fell silent and an uneasy hush passed over the assembly the girl herself seemed not to know or mind the effect of her arrival indeed she seemed oblivious to all save the cymbrogi ranged before her these she regarded with the innocent interest of a child beholding a new and fascinating game she took a hesitant step forward and then another pausing demurely her green eyes wide and glowing with delight the rapt look on her face was enchantment itself as i say a moment or two passed before the council recovered its voice and when it did the fury that had formerly threatened arthur now demanded to know who was this woman and what she meant by invading the proceedings and interrupting their deliberations well arthur was at a loss he looked around him for anyone who might offer an explanation i hastened to his side saying i know this woman lord rather she is known to me who is she he asked glancing at her once more bedwyr leaned close to hear what i had to say i cannot say but why is she here again i cannot say i replied turning to me arthur grinned if this passes for acquaintance with you gwalchavad i wonder that you ever meet a stranger arthur please i begged i only meant that i have seen her but once before when i rode to uriens stronghold to summon hwyl to the council she is hwyls kinswoman then wondered arthur stealing another glance at her no lord i answered and quickly explained how i had come upon her in the forest she seemed in distress from the sun and hunger i said so i left her in hwyls care at my suggestion he has brought her to the council to see if anyone knows who she might be why asked bedwyr can she not speak for herself that is the problem i told them she is mute she cannot speak a word arthur nodded and then stood raising his hands to quiet the complaint that was threatening to overtake us once more friends he called calm yourselves there is no cause for concern here i have it that this young woman is a mute who has lost her way i ask you now if anyone among you knows who she may be or where her people might be found there followed a short interval wherein the noblemen and chieftains discussed the matter among themselves and when they had done so it emerged that no one knew her nor did anyone know whether any clan might be missing one of its members not satisfied with this reply arthur appealed to them once more asking them to search their memories the council resented the suggestion and reacted swiftly and angrily it was quickly established that no one save hwyl and his folk had so much as set eyes on her before this day on this at least they all agreed almost as vehement in their agreement as they had been in their contention with arthur curious i thought that the mere presence of the young woman should arouse such passionate denial the assembled noblemen were fervent in their protests of ignorance shouts of shes not of our kin and never seen the like of her formed the general opinion and i was put in mind of hwyls brusque rejection when he had first set eyes to her looking on the maid fair as she was and not at all displeasing in any aspect i wondered what could provoke such ardent animosity this and she had not so much as breathed a word what was it that men saw in her that frightened them so turning to myrddin arthur shrugged i think she is not known in these lands what should be done with her upon hearing the question i glanced at the wise emrys expecting his answer and was startled by what i saw myrddins countenance formerly flintlike in the heat of the opposition against arthur was now transformed eyes wide he stared openly with an expression of such melancholy tenderness that i was embarrassed to see it what is more he seemed not to have heard arthur speak but continued gazing in this foolish lovestruck fashion until the pendragon nudged him and asked again for his advice only then did the emrys come to himself do with her he asked regarding arthur with mild distaste as if the king had blurted a stupidity let her remain with us until we find her kinsfolk of course arthur ordered rhys to take the girl and deliver her into the care of some of the women rhys unaccountably grew discomfited by this simple command he blushed crimson to the tops of his ears and stuttered a hasty reply under his breath begging to be spared this duty though he fumbled for words his eyes pleaded most eloquently and he even began to sweat as he stammered out his excuse so distracted was he that gwenhwyvar stepped in for him and said that perhaps it would be best for all if she made provision for the young woman instead the pendragon anxious to get on with the council readily agreed with his queen and gwenhwyvar stepped forth to take the girl aside but the young woman had other ideas for even as the queen moved from the throne the girl started forward she took three steps towards us gwenhwyvar hesitated allowing her to approach the fair stranger came nearer but it became apparent that she was not looking at arthur nor the queen nor any one of us her bright green eyes were firmly fastened on another i looked around me to see who it might be myrddin bedwyr no neither of these rhys cai cador no the young woman moved nearer and i saw that she stopped before llenlleawg who stood at rigid attention spear at his shoulder gazing into the distance above her head as if trying mightily to ignore her but she would not be ignored for she put out her hand and took him boldly by the arm as if claiming him for her own only then did he lower his gaze to regard her with an expression devoid of any warmth or welcome it appears she has chosen her champion arthur observed dryly and i cannot fault the choice he then called to the irishman to lead the young woman away gwenhwyvar went with them and as soon as they had gone the council began to grind ahead once more but more slowly this time and with less roaring and breastbeating as if all their anger had been expended and their passions leeched away by the curious interruption in the end the noblemen were persuaded to the virtue of accepting arthurs terms any lingering resistance melted away at mercias arrival the vandal prince strode at once to where arthur sat on his camp chair and prostrated himself at the high kings feet stretching himself full length upon the ground his face in the dust the barbarian then took hold of the pendragons foot and placed it on his neck and lay as dead before his sovereign lord arthur then raised the barbarian to his feet and allowed him to embrace the high king like a brother this unabashed display of submission and acceptance went some distance towards convincing the yet reluctant nobles that the vandali were earnest in their regard for arthur unwilling to be bested by barbarians in displaying loyalty to the high king the britons made a point of renewing their vows of allegiance placing themselves likewise beneath the pendragons sovereignty arthur acclaimed them one and all rejoice mighty chieftains he told them bestowing the favour of his winning smile for a great good has been born in britain today you have put battle and bloodshed behind you and welcomed the stranger in your midst in order that peace should obtain throughout the land for this i commend you and i make bold to prophesy that from this day as the realm of mercia prospers so britain will prosper he then declared a feast in honour of the new accord and even made a joke at his own expense saying that any king who feasted his lords on bread and water instead of meat and ale was a king who risked his life in a lions den a small jest but the noblemen laughed heartily for by this they understood that the drought was just as hard if not harder on the high king as it was for them and that he had allowed himself no greater luxury and largesse than the least of them possessed truly i believe this endeared arthur to them and bound them to him far more tightly than anything else he could have said or done they loved him for it and the mistrust and hurt feelings of the day dwindled to insignificance thus the council ended and the noblemen departed hailing one another loudly and talking together as they made their way to the place of feasting that was well done bear bedwyr said watching them go you have carried the battle let us pray the peace endures arthur replied rhys then called him away to attend another matter and the others departed also leaving me and myrddin alone beside the empty throne a strange day i said watching the others leave yes myrddin agreed absently very strange indeed i feared the council would end in bitter bloodshed instead it ends in a feast of friends oh that yes muttered myrddin only half listening to me who would have thought it then without taking his leave he simply turned and walked away i stared after him and as he moved slowly off i thought i heard him speaking to himself she chose llenlleawg he said his voice hushed and oddly strained a curious choice or is it great light what does it mean eight we did not linger in the north a moment longer than necessary the great warband was assembled for the last time so that the pendragon could pay tribute to their stalwart devotion and reward their sacrifice with high words and good gold which he shared out from the wealth of his war chest he then dismissed them and having seen mercia placed on a solid footing with his neighbours struck camp and headed south the warriors departed in knots and clumps so that the journey became one long leavetaking as we said farewell to our swordbrothers sending them back to hearth and kin i do believe arthur embraced each one and sped him homeward with a word of gratitude and praise accordingly we reached the southlands far fewer in number than when we rode out only the dragon flight and a scant handful of the younger cymbrogi remained to serve the high king as we came within sight of our destination ynys avallach the isle of avallach a place of peace and a haven of rest the great tor rises from the surrounding marshland like a mountain rising above the clouds atop this mountain sits the fisher kings palace a huge wallbounded manychambered edifice made of honeycoloured stone it boasts a highvaulted great hall large stables and two high towers either side of its wide timber gate a causeway connects the tor with the nearby hill on which the abbey is built the fields of the monks lie to the east and to the north is the first of a multitude of low shapely hills in the evening light the palace glows like sunstruck gold and its image is reflected in the fine lake at the foot of the tor owing to his fondness for plying the waters of that lake in his small boat avallach is known as the fisher king a king he is to be sure but unlike any i have ever known he is the last monarch of the fair folk the last of that graceful elegant race he is also myrddins grandfather and his daughter charis is myrddins mother to see them is to know where the wise emrys received his stature and regal bearing not so many days had passed since we last saw the soft southern hills and yet the region seemed vastly changed for what the dry hot wind did not steal the plague destroyed indeed as we drew nearer our destination we more often passed abandoned holdings several of which had been occupied when we first rode north each day of the drought drove more people off the land some fled into the forests where they might hunt and forage others abandoned britain for foreign shores even arthur despite his hopeful vision looked upon the forsaken settlements with a mournful eye he spoke little but the gloomy expression on his face declared his mind well enough the king held it a calamity bedwyr his closest friend tried to comfort him they will come back bear he said when the drought ends and the plague has run its course they will all come back but arthur only nodded glumly and said i pray you are right even the sight of ynys avallach with the splendid tor soaring above the placid lake failed to lift the pendragons spirits where always before it had been a pleasant if not joyful sight this time it appeared to us a lonely place steeped in dolorous airs and failing light though myrddin said he was behaving like a child to take on so arthur paused leaned in the saddle and looked long upon the solitary tor and its crowning palace finally myrddin grew disgusted and rode alone to alert the monks and fair folk of our arrival the welcome when we received it more than made up for the sorrowful end to a journey begun in high spirits mind i have seen the fair folk before and more than most but i am always astounded by them it is as if the mind cannot long hold to such splendour and gradually lets the memory slip away i know no other way to account for it even so to say that each time i renew my friendship with avallach and his folk i fall afresh under a spell of charm and grace is to speak but half a truth because of avallach and charis a spirit of peace abides in that place the like of which is rare in our warrent world god well knows then again perhaps it is myself who possessing a cold and wayward heart cannot easily conceive that places such as ynys avallach exist alas i fear i have seen too much of blood and strife and it has corroded my soul and yet bright hope in coming to the tor i am welcomed as a brother and reminded of the beauty i have forgotten and i am recalled to the pursuit of higher things there is avallach most worthy lord he of dark and imposing mien a man whose nobility is proclaimed not in word and deed alone but in every limb and sinew he is a king whose realm as they say is not of this world arthur is a big and handsome man but next to avallach even our beloved pendragon seems but a lanky stripling of a youth green and ungainly the fisher king is tall and his voice is like soft thunder falling on the ear from a friendlier clime when he smiles it is as if the sun itself has come from behind a cloud to light the drear shadowcrowded way with dazzling warmth myrddin has said that lord avallach is the last of his kind and i believe him but while he endures our waveencompassed isle is a better place by far and then charis to speak of her is to demean with words what is best expressed in song a wordless melody of the kind oft stroked on the harp in myrddins hand is the best description i do believe for when the harp strings sing and the heart sheds its weariness and rises to the eternal dance that is what it is like to behold the lady of the lake the name was taliesins bestowal and it speaks to the shimmering mystery of her she is womanly grace and all things female made rounded flesh and blessed of the fairest form elegance finds its meaning in her movements and to hear her speak is to know how heavens bright citizens address their immortal kind a man of crude weapons and rough ways i know my praise shames the object it would exalt so i will say no more save this imagine the thing which holds for you a blessing of gentleness and comfort that incites to virtue without reproof even while it soothes with beauty and you begin to glimpse the wonder that is charis i am not alone in this appraisal mind i have it on solid authority that the first of our race to behold charis went down on their knees in worshipful reverence to the vision they believed heavensent i am not convinced they were entirely wrong there are other fair folk too and i will speak of them as opportunity allows but i would establish here how i felt upon seeing their beguiling race once again as i say mere moments in their welcoming presence and melancholy fell away sorrow vanished and the nagging anxiety that dogged our steps fled back to its dank abode our meal in the fisher kings hall that night though simple fare was a feast we went to our rest with hearts healed and whole once more the next days were bliss to one and all the trials and travails of the vandal invasion were swept away and our spirits restored in that peaceful gentle place see now i have said nothing in all this of llenlleawg and the strange young woman the omission was apurpose to set the piece in its proper place so to speak rest assured the mute young woman was with us every step of the way though quiet as might be expected curiously her unnatural silence contrived to draw even the slightest of attentions i observed her effect on others whenever she was near the eye forever stole in her direction untethered thoughts drifted her way though making no demand of any kind she yet exerted an uncanny influence and her presence loomed in our midst like a great standing stone on a silent moor for her part she seemed happy to journey with us eating sleeping riding acquiescing to her lot with grace and forbearance as it seemed nor did anyone suspect llenlleawg might be anything but happy with this arrangement the tall irishman was never given to complaining true he once fought an entire battle with a broken spearpoint in his thigh and no one knew of it until two days later when he fainted while trying to remove the shard himself he is like that a true son of eriu through and through and no one who knows him at all can ever claim to know what he will do or say next in battle a whirlwind is more temperate and a stormgale more serene than is our llenlleawg moody and restive as the evershifting waves that surround his soggy homeland he may be but i will thump the man who speaks an ill word of llenlleawg i tell this so you may know how it came about that no one spared a thought for the irishman or his flaxenhaired companion all that long way south llenlleawg made no complaint and the strange maid remained complacent the while nothing in the way either of them behaved aroused the slightest suspicion not even myrddin who is ever alert to the subtlest of signs and indications found reason to express the slightest concern consequently it was not until coming in sight of the tor that any of us had occasion to suspect that all was not well llenlleawg who might have spoken sooner let it slip that he thought the woman bewitched he was answering gwenhwyvars mild inquiry i think and said so long as she remains in sight of me and i of her she is meekness itself yet if i leave her side but a moment she grows so distraught that it seems a wicked cruelty i am sorry replied the queen thoughtfully turning her eyes to regard the stranger where she primly sat her horse a few paces away in truth it had escaped my notice as if sensing gwenhwyvars mild attention the strange girl shifted in the saddle and turned her face towards us the queen shivered and dropped her gaze how do you sleep wondered bedwyr overhearing their talk no matter where i lay my head llenlleawg replied she will not rest until she has put herself beside me you mean you sleep with her bedwyr said his voice rising in surprise no more than you sleep with your saddle the irish champion answered glaring at bedwyr for raising the question has she spoken to you the queen asked llenlleawg shook his head neither word nor sound has she uttered i wish you had told me sooner gwenhwyvar chided gently but seeing we are so close to ynys avallach i ask you abide but a little longer until we can seek the advice of charts and the blessed bishop elfodd i would trust them to know what is best to do llenlleawg said no more and no doubt the thing would have proceeded in the way gwenhwyvar had suggested if not for the girls odd behaviour for as we drew nearer the glass isle and the abbey the young woman fell further and further back in our ranks when we at last reached the causeway leading to the tor and avallachs palace she was nowhere to be seen though the queen asked after her and many of the cymbrogi remembered seeing her no one knew where she had gone a quick search of the ranks turned up neither clue nor hint of her passing apparently the strange young woman had disappeared in full sight of all and yet no one had seen her go it was as if she had simply faded away leaving not the slightest trace behind despite his lack of enthusiasm for the duty llenlleawg was abashed that he had failed in the simple task of looking after his charge i suspect he was so relieved when she finally left his side he simply turned a blind eye to her disappearance we were in sight of our destination mind who could imagine anyone straying away with the end of the journey so near llenlleawg rode directly to find the missing woman and even then no one doubted that we would soon see them both before the sun had so much as quartered the sky thus we dismissed the matter from our minds and were soon caught up in the gladness of our welcome we had come to ynys avallach after all where all unhappy thoughts are banished like gloomy shadows from the trail when daylight strikes through the clouds at the end of day i confess i never gave the matter a second thought until myrddin remarked on llenlleawgs absence the next day i was admiring avallachs horses in the stables the fair folks love of horses almost matches that of the irish and they breed a steed even our eireann cousins could envy i speak as a man who has spent more days on horseback than on my own two feet so take it for a truth from one who knows whereof he speaks see now i stood stroking the long sleek neck of a handsome grey mare when i heard the soft tread of a step behind me i turned and myrddin was beside me they are a joy to behold he proclaimed speaking to my thoughts i am certain avallach would be happy to let you ride one if you wished he paused looking sideways at me in the way he has as if looking through a body into the soul beyond then he said perhaps you might like to take this one and go in search of llenlleawg he should have returned by now and i cannot think he has lost his way no i granted never that but has it ever occurred to you that he may have decided to spend a night with a young woman beyond the gaze of prying eyes so to speak myrddin flatly rejected my insinuation do you really believe he would defy his lord and queen to frolic in the forest with a maiden he has been charged to protect well i something has happened to him he declared or he would have returned by now i will take leave of arthur at once i told him and started off he caught me by the arm and stayed me take someone with you those who rode with you when you found the girl who were they teredur and tallaght i answered they are with us still i will fetch them allow me myrddin suggested i will send for them you can see to the horses he turned on his heel and strode from the stable pausing at the door long enough to add swiftly my friend the trail is already cold with the help of avallachs stablemen i soon had three handsome horses saddled and ready to ride peredur and tallaght joined me as i was tightening the cinch on the grey i had chosen for myself i hailed the two young warriors and said it seems we are to be companions once more did the emrys tell you what we are about no lord answered peredur we were told to hasten to the stables to find you and bring these he said indicating the bag of provisions they each carried well and good i replied this is the way of it the maiden we found in the forest went missing before we reached ynys avallach and llenlleawg was sent to bring her back he should have returned by now myrddin has asked us to find them or llenlleawg at least are we to try the fair folk mounts wondered tallaght eyeing the animals appreciatively aye lad i told him if you can bear to sit such a beast we are your men lord gwalchavad peredur said happily lead us where you will with that we were away clattering through the yard and down the winding path to the marshland below it was morning yet and we passed a few monks toiling in the fields beyond the abbey they sent us on our way with god speed you and blessings of the day having seen llenlleawg leave our company i knew where to begin searching though the lake was low from the drought the earth was still soft enough to take a fair impression and indeed we had no difficulty recognizing the distinctive crescent and bar of a warhorses hoof arthur had long ago adopted the old roman custom of affixing an extra crosspiece of iron to the horseshoe which though costly greatly improved the usefulness of our mounts especially on the battlefield there was no mistaking one of the pendragons horses taking our lead from the tracks we rode east our horses wonderful creatures carried us over the nearer hills as lightly as thistledown borne aloft on the winds breath and we were soon far from sight of the tor i was so enjoying my ride that i soon forgot all about llenlleawg and his lady peredurs sharp whistle brought me up short i halted and turned to see him pointing away south forgive me lord he said but i think he has left the trail just here looking to the place he indicated i saw the tracks of two shod horses leading south i commended his sharp eye and confessed that i had been too much given to the ride to notice the turning you have saved us the chore of retracing our steps i allowed and granted him the privilege of leading the search now on with you tallaght and i will follow thus i took my place behind the other two and we resumed our journey the trail as peredur had rightly espied departed its eastward course and struck off towards the south once beyond the saltmarsh lowlands we encountered droughtdry hills and dusty valleys passing abandoned holdings where but recently we might have expected a drink days end found us far to the south and searching for a stream or brook where we might make camp for the night the first stars were already alight when we finally came upon a shrunken rill where a little water yet trickled though i would have preferred a more private place among the trees i did not like to wander far from the trail for it seemed likely that if llenlleawg had passed this way he might have camped hereabouts too we gathered the few bits of dry brush to make our fire and pulled provisions from the bags behind our saddles to make a quiet meal after which we rolled ourselves in our cloaks to contemplate the brightspangled heavens and wait for sleep to overtake us i had just closed my eyes or so it seemed when a strange wailing sound roused me i awoke and stood stonestill and holding my breath to listen for a moment the sound similar in some ways to that of a wolf crying down the moon reached me from some distance farther south i walked a little apart from the red embers of our exhausted fire and looked to the low southern hills where i saw the faintly flickering glow of a beacon flame i watched for a while and scanned the land round about for an answering fire but saw none neither did i hear the wailing sound again the beacon if beacon it was died away as quickly as a spark and the darkness closed around the place i waited but the flame was not renewed and so i returned to my rest the next morning after leaving a pile of rocks to mark the trail we turned aside to find the place where the beacon had been lit for i hoped to discover some sign of who had made it and why as it happened the ride led us farther south than i anticipated but we found the site an immense bed of stillwarm ashes surrounded by a ring of earth erected to keep the dry hillside from taking light here and there we saw a few footprints though very few and those were scuffed and featureless they have taken care to leave nothing behind peredur observed who could have made it wondered tallaght llenlleawg and the girl better to ask who was meant to see it i replied and then considered that the wailing began only after the beacon had all but spent itself maybe they feared we would miss the signal so they roused us another way i suggested lightly to my companions but neither of them deemed it likely probably it was only a wolf suggested tallaght no doubt the smell of smoke disturbed the beast now i have heard wolves howling in the night more times than either of my young friends have swung rump to saddle and i know it was never any wolf i heard still i held my tongue and let the thing go as there was nothing more to see i went to my horse gathered up the reins and regained my mount ready to resume the trail the day flies before us i called urging them away a moment lord cried peredur i looked around and saw him inside the firering squatting on his haunches prodding the ashes with a length of branch unburned at one end so saying he lifted something from the smouldering ash pile and brought it to me what think you of this he asked extending the stick towards me i saw that he had found a scrap of cloth fine stuff tightly woven which had been all but consumed in the flames taking the scrap between my fingers i looked again more closely and to my dismay recognized it at once god help him i moaned my voice a low croak it is a piece of llenlleawgs cloak nine i must have an infant a child my sweet i need a child loth as i recall merely shrugged no difficulty there he replied lightly i will send one of the men to the settlement there are always brats enough and no one squeals overmuch if one goes missing no i said not that way taking up the camphorwood box from the table i removed the lid and dipped my fingers into the fine grey powder it is nothing last time we this is differenti insisted quietly it is not like last time young loth hesitated in the flickering candelight a beautiful young man he was the very image of his father i dropped a pinch of the grey powder into the flame between us smoke puffed up and a subtle fragrance filled the air i need a child i said pressing my hands to my stomach it must be bone of my bone blood of my blood it must be my child i dropped another pinch of the powder a potion of compliance into the flame replaced the camphorwood box and stepped nearer lowering my voice slightly and you must give me this child my darling me but i i will tell you about this child shall i putting my hands on his chest i stepped forward drawing him to me this child will grow to be a sorceress of rare and wondrous powers and she shall be called the bane of britain she will destroy that simpleton myrddin and his tiresome pet arthur she will lay waste to the kingdom of summer and prepare the way for us to reign you and me together we will establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years i drew him closer as i spoke come my darling loth my hands found his arm and began leading him away i have prepared the bedchamber for our pleasure mother ihe began then hesitated still uncertain morgian it is shhi hushed gently i ask nothing you have not done with other women there is food within and wine we will eat and drink and in the timebetweentimes you will give me your seed for the making of a child he looked through the door and into the candlelit interior beyond come my darling i said my voice like warm mead sweetly intoxicating and seductive the night awaits i would not hear you speak so even in jest tallaght intoned ruefully as i breathe son it is no jest either this is all that remains of our swordbrothers cloak or i know him not at all turning his gaze once more to the ash pile he said then we best make certain there is no more of him here than that and so we did stir the embers how we might the ashes revealed nothing more keeneyed peredur meanwhile busied himself with searching the surrounding hillside and his labour bore fruit see here he cried drawing our attention they passed this way hastening to where he stood we saw the tracks of two people and possibly a third leading away from the firering i bent low to examine the faint markings little more than bent grass and scuff marks in the dirt and marvelled once more at peredurs ability son i said for he was that young wherever did you learn to track my father kept the game runs for king cadwallo he answered i have ridden with him since i was old enough to sit a horse well lad he taught you well tucking the burned scrap of cloak under my belt i said i think it best we follow the trail we are given lead on thus we continued on our way pursuing our new course south and east slowly passing beyond the lands of the summer realm i took care to mark our progress for we were moving into territory strange to me trusting peredur to keep the trail i occupied myself with watching the rocks and hills round about keeping an eye for any sign that we might be watched save the occasional lonely crow i saw no living thing even so the further we journeyed into that queer land the more certain i grew that we were being watched i have ridden into battle often enough to know when an enemy is lurking near hiding and awaiting the chance to attack an unwary warrior that was the feeling that overtook me in this place once as we descended a steep defile between two overhanging bluffs the skin prickled on my back as if danger stalked us from behind spear in hand i wheeled my horse to see the empty path and nothing more this occurred three times before the sun reached midday and each time it took me by surprise though it does me no credit to confess it the last instance so unnerved me that i called peredur to halt at the next opportunity thinking to water the horses and collect myself somewhat this he did soon after for directly we came upon a tidal estuary and climbed down from the horses the bank such as it was consisted of loose slaty shingle and wrack cast up by the tide as ill luck would have it the tide was out leaving an expanse of mud wide as a battleground with only a thin rivulet of rank green water oozing down through the centre loath to let the horses drink this foul brack we looked up and down either side to see if we might yet come to some better place but were frustrated in the attempt the estuary stretched far inland and maintained its breadth beyond sight this is an unhappy place god knows remarked tallaght scanning the mud before us it will not grow more agreeable for standing here i replied seeing nothing for it but to strike on and make for the other side i swung up into the saddle once more the sooner we put the place behind us the better i will feel peredur who had ridden a few hundred paces upriver to the first of a series of low bluffs rising from the bank returned to say the trail ends just here there is no better fording that i can see they must have gone across at high tide or we would see the prints then we have no choice so saying i lifted the reins and struck off across the muddy broad it was vile stuff thick black sticky muck with a stink that turned the stomach the rancid slime sucked at the steeds hooves and released a stench which assaulted the nose and watered the eyes i pressed on regardless anxious to get across as quickly as possible that was my mistake for having almost reached the slowtrickling flow in the middle of the mudflat i realized that my proud mount was sinking deeper into the mire with every step halting i turned in the saddle to warn the two behind me come no further i called we must go around another way with that i lifted the reins and made to turn the grey peredurs shout stopped me stay lord he cried tersely do not move glancing swiftly behind me and all around i saw nothing to alarm me and was about to say as much when tallaght joined in the warning lord gwalchavad he called his voice tense look around you he thrust out his hand and pointed to the mud look i did but saw only the scum of the fetid mire glimmering under a baleful sun and then even as i watched the whole dully glistening surface began to shiver and then to tremble i stared in disbelief as the muddy flats quaked with sudden sluggish life and the horror of my predicament came clear the inrushing tide was flowing once more and the whole unstable mass was quivering and heaving in the slowrippling waves of quicksand go back i shouted save yourselves both warriors turned their mounts and began struggling back towards the bank i made to follow them but the grey had sunk still lower and could not lift her legs pulling hard on the reins i succeeded in making the horse rear onto its hind legs whereupon i swung the frightened animals head and completed the turn the grey succeeded but two further steps before sinking to the hocks once more desperate to save my panicky mount i threw myself from the saddle and instantly sank to my knees in the vile bog the mud shuddered and heaved around me as the unseen waves lent it eerie life but i gritted my teeth and tightened the reins around my hand and then with an effort raised my foot from the mire and lumbered ahead one step half turning i coaxed my mount forward speaking in a soft soothing tone eyes wide and rolling with terror as the killing mud sucked at her hooves the grey struggled gamely forward rearing up and plunging but succeeding only in sinking us both more deeply i made to wade forward and felt my insubstantial footing give way i now stood hipdeep in the muck and could feel cold water seeping through the ooze and up around my legs tallaght and peredur having reached the bank secured their mounts threw off their cloaks and hastened back to help me i saw them floundering over the mud and tried to warn them away but they came on regardless throw me the reins shouted tallaght having come as near as he dared he lay himself upon the mud and stretched out his hand let me take her he called as i could do nothing more for the beast i threw the reins to the young warrior and concerned myself with my own fate instead for his part peredur holding his spear above his head waded out to me stretching himself flat upon the mud he extended the butt of the spear i leaned towards him cold water gushed up around my thighs and i promptly sank to my waist peredur wormed closer take hold he cried seeing the spear within reach i raised my right leg and brought it down smartly so as to jump up i did not so much leap as lurch flinging my body forward in a sorry imitation of cuchullains salmon leap though laughably awkward the manoeuvre gained me a hairsbreadth of distance i felt my fingers close on the butt of peredurs spear and i grabbed hold with a grip that death himself could not shake loose the young warrior by the strength of his arms alone pulled me nearer i slithered from the wallow and came free with a squelchy sucking sound but there i stopped and peredur could not draw me further without hauling himself in as well i tried snaking my way to him but even the slightest movement sent the bog quivering i lay still and began sinking once more we need a rope peredur called alas we had no rope and well i knew it a moment lord peredur wormed his way to dry land where he ran to his horse and stripped off the tack drawing his knife he cut the reins from the bit and tied them together then came to the edge of the mudflat and threw the end of the leather strap to me it fell just out of reach so he quickly pulled it in took two steps nearer leaned out and threw it again the second throw went wide as did the third but i snagged the line on the fourth try and wound it around my wrist haul away i called and peredur holding tight with both hands edged slowly back and back at first i feared the strap would break but it was good leather and though it stretched taut as a harp string it did not break one step and another and then he reached the bank gained his feet and pulled hard until i was sliding smoothly over the morass upon reaching the bank i scrambled to my feet with a whoop of delight peredur threw down the leather line and ran to me grinning at his accomplishment well done lad i said clapping him heartily on the back that was quick thinking tallaghts shout brought us back to the task at hand help i am losing her i turned to see that the grey was sunk to her belly in the black ooze and the young warrior was in over his knees but still clinging tightly to the reins peredur and i ran to his aid in my haste i struck a piece of slate and my foot slid out from under me i fell back but rose on the instant with an idea here now i called to peredur help me with these so saying i stooped to gather an armful of the larger slates choosing the broadest ones i could find peredur saw what i was about and leapt to digging beneath the surface layer he found several pieces of fair size and carried them to the edge of the quicksand bog placing the first slate atop the morass he stepped out on it and found that it would support him it will serve he shouted and i began passing him more slates which he put down a step at a time forming a steppingstone path out to where poor tallaght was now almost sunk to his waist let go of the horse i told him my heart falling at the thought of abandoning my handsome mount if she goes tallaght answered between clenched teeth we go together son there is no need i replied let her go save yourself the unseen waves of the incoming tide set the mud heaving and shuddering around him water showed in a queasy ring around the young warriors waist peredur placed the last slate but a few paces from tallaght brother he said stretching forth his arm the tide is flowing it is take my hand or sink and drown realizing the danger at last tallaght relented with a groan he released the reins and threw out his hand peredur caught him and pulled him free though the steppingstones were themselves beginning to sink they yet bore up the two young men who skittered across and clambered thankfully onto solid ground we three stood for a moment panting with the exertion of our efforts and staring unhappily at the grey tossing her head and whinnying with fright the two young men suggested throwing down more slates and somehow getting the animal to walk on them even if the horse was willing i replied we could never lift her onto them observing the eerily rippling bog i added the tide is beating us besides i am not fool enough to risk all three of us in a hopeless cause i fear we must let the sea have its way tallaght stared and opened his mouth to protest but peredur took his arm and silenced him with a conclusive lord gwalchavad is right now i am as steadfast as any man i know but i could not find it in me to stand and watch that beautiful animal die come away i said to my companions we can do nothing more tallaght resisted will you not even end it with a spear glancing back i shook my head and turned to leave lord he called insistent still let me do it if you will not i stopped and though i had no wish to berate him i addressed him with my thoughts lad a warrior should have a friendly feeling for his mount and your affection does you credit but this is a hostile land and we may well be glad of our spears before another day is run even had we weapons to spare killing a horse with a single thrust from this distance would take a fortunate cast indeed i own no such skill and will not see the poor beast suffer any more than need be in light of these unhappy facts i think we must leave the thing where it is turning away once more i said i am heartily sick of this place and wish i had never seen it peredur snatched up the reins of his mount and fell into step behind me and after we had walked a few paces tallaght also took up his reins and came along we moved inland climbing up the low bluffs above the estuary where i paused briefly to look back at my doomed mount now plunged to her flanks in the killing bog and screaming terribly the sound of that wretched creature cut me to the quick i made a sorrowful farewell and moved on miserable wet and stinking from toe to head oh my heart was low and regretful but there was nothing for it but to drag ourselves away my two companions fell into a fretful silence from which i tried to raise them but gave up trying after a while i felt as bad as they did and with the days passing the foreboding grew more not less i found myself wondering what disaster would befall us next for although calamity can overtake anyone at any time especially travellers in the wilds in my present mind i deemed our misfortune nothing less than an assault by a malevolent power dogging our every step since we had entered this accursed realm it seemed to me that the rocks and bare hills conspired against us and even the low brooding sky wished us ill i remained firm in this woeful assessment for a considerable time as i warmed myself by the campfire later i consoled myself with the thought that it could have been worse we might have lost far more than a good horse and to be sure if i had been riding alone i would have died with my horse accordingly i thanked the good god for my quickthinking young friends and took our narrow escape as a warning vowing to be on better guard from now on ten the search for a suitable fording place took us far out of our way by the time we accomplished our crossing twilight had come to that forsaken land no wholesome twilight mind but a murky dusk of rising mist that made the air dank and heavy our clothes were still damp and repugnant to us but we found no clean water in which to wash and so were forced to wear them whether we would or no and though we gathered enough twigs and brush to make a fire the fickle flame did little to dry us the stench of the mud took away our appetites so we did not bother trying to cook or eat anything contenting ourselves with a few mouthfuls from the waterskin tallaght carried behind his saddle downhearted dejected and tired from our ordeal no one felt like talking so we rolled ourselves in our cloaks and tried to sleep even sleep did not come easily no sooner had we closed our eyes than the moon rose bulging full and yellow like a great baleful eye in the heavens the light it cast seemed filthy mean and pestilential a plague moon peredur called it and we agreed thus we passed a wretched night and rose illrested to begin a day which nevertheless held the promise of coming good after our wasted night we welcomed the clear blue sky and fine bright sun both sky and sun swiftly faded however to a dull bleachedbone white which hurt the eyes and brought an ache to the head we worked our way back down along the tidal estuary in search of the trail we had followed the previous day still feeling fairly certain that llenlleawg and possibly two others had passed this way as i had no horse we took it in turn to ride and walk and sometimes peredur and tallaght shared a mount the bank was rough and rocky and made for slow going whether on horse or afoot we could move no faster and then when we finally reached the place where we had tried crossing the day before we could not raise the trail again for all peredurs exemplary skill and keen eye we found neither track nor trace of whoever it was we had been following the bog took them i suppose suggested peredur gloomily the same as it took the grey indicating the empty stretch of slowly undulating muck he said the horse is gone and the tide is hungry still he need not have mentioned the calamity carcass or no i was only too aware of the poor beasts demise losing a good horse is as bad as losing an arm or a leg and that is the end of it after a time we gave up searching among the rubble rock shingle and decided to continue in the direction the tracks had been leading when they encountered the quagmire i freely confess the plan made little sense there was no good reason to suppose that whoever made the trail had crossed the bog when we could not unless they knew how and where to ford and if so that fording was not to be found by us indeed we discussed this very thing and the two young warriors were of the opinion that it would be best to range farther downstream since our quarry might easily have gone the other way but something in me urged for pressing on as it happens i am not a man given to whims or obscure proddings and in any event i seldom receive them yet i was seized by such a powerfully insistent urging that i threw aside all reason and followed it perhaps because i am unaccustomed to receiving these ethereal promptings my own inexperience made me gullible then again perhaps something beyond human ken was hard at work but i was too blind to read the signs the three of us proceeded to a nearby hilltop for a better view of our position we paused to scan our surroundings and found that we had come up out of a valley and onto a wide hillcrowded barrens in happier times those same stark hills might have appeared greenclothed and agreeable a welcoming sight for man and beast alike after a season or two of drought however the sight of numberless bald crests rising one after another into the distance like so many withered windgrizzled heads failed to lift a heart already labouring under the unrelenting bleakness of that desolate place what few trees existed were stunted twisted things tortured into strange shapes by the coastal wind for yes i now determined that we were journeying into llyonesse a long evernarrowing spine of land thrown up by contentious seas to separate and quell their warring natures the irish sea on the right hand and muir nicht on the left long deemed an inhospitable land it is a queer place a realm more fitting for outcast souls and wild beasts than upright men ah and i remember it is also the unholy battleground where myrddin fought the wicked morgian for his life see now the disappearance of pelleas the emrys friend and servant was but one of the misfortunes issuing from that desperate battle another was the leaving of my twin and brother gwalcmai deeply do i miss him for until that dreadful day my brother and i had rarely been out of sight of one another so much as a single day but that we were together again by nightfall while arthur and the cymbrogi crossed swords with the saecsen in the north myrddin warned by signs and portents had gone alone to confront the queen of air and darkness when myrddin did not return gwalcmai rode with bedwyr to discover what had become of him the two of them found the wise emrys bloodied and blind in llyonesse alas pelleas who had taken up the search before them has never been seen again and gwalcmai overcome with remorse and shame undertook exile or as myrddin says true man that he is gwalcmai could no longer abide his tainted lineage and went in search of redemption tainted lineage truly morgian is no kin of mine to speak plainly the affair sits no more comfortably with me now than it did when i first heard of it allowing gwalcmai to go away like that however noble the purpose has always seemed illadvised to me had i been there you can well believe i would have had a word or two to say about it well i was not there and nothing can be done about it now save pray we are reunited one day which i do and so look forward to that happy reunion these things then were in my mind as we made our slow way into the empty hills i scanned the bleak horizon alternating this unproductive activity with picking mudclots off my tunic and trews after riding a fair while we came to a small briarchoked burn snaking along the bottom of a narrow gully though much shrunken from the stream it had been the water was still good and so we stopped to refresh the horses and replenish the waterskins then we washed ourselves and our clothes as best we could and sat down to rest and eat a bite of hard bread when our clothes had mostly dried we then journeyed on until the desultory sunlight faded and night stole in around us once more at the failing of the sun a murky tepid dusk drew over the land discouraged by the long and futile day we halted and made camp in a hollow while tallaght busied himself with the horses peredur fussed at making a fire the wood was rotten and unaccountably damp and produced more smoke than heat as they were about these chores i walked a little to the overlooking hilltop to see what might be learned of the night sky the haze which had obscured the day yet persisted thickening as daylight dwindled so as to keep out the light of any stars a mournful wind from the southwest moaned over the barren hills and set the bare branches of the dwarfed trees chattering like naked teeth storms often attend such nights but there was not the slightest hint of rain in the air and the wind tasted of sea salt nor was i better encouraged when peredur called out to advise me that he had found the source of the damp a small spring of water seeping from the hillside i left off my scrutiny and went down to attend this new discovery hopeful that we might get some fresh water at last i should have guessed my hope like all else in that dismal realm would die forlorn though peredur delved with his hands into the hillside and removed several stones the spring remained little more than a soggy weepage soaking up from the earth i dismissed the spring saying were it ten times the trickle it still would not serve the horses peredur persisted however and collected enough in a bowl to give us all a drink as he had discovered the spring we granted him first draught which also became the last the water tasted of spoiled eggs gab he spat wiping his tongue on his sleeve to get the taste out of his mouth tallaght laughed at the pinched expression on peredurs face which caused the stricken warrior to rail angrily at his kinsman tallaght responded with harsh words whereupon peredur took offense at this abuse if i had not been standing over them i have no doubt the thing would have come to blows enough i told them sternly it is nothing put it behind you they glared at each other and backed away to nurse imagined resentments the rest of the evening i was only too thankful to let the night smooth our ragged tempers but this was not to be the fretful wind waxed stronger with the setting sun gusting out of the east blowing dust from the hilltops and swirling it around the hollow at first i hoped merely to ignore it but the dry thunder mumbling in the distance chased away any thought of sleep i lay wrapped in my cloak listening to the storm and thought i heard the sound of a bell such as monks often employ to call their brothers to prayer it came to me that the sound tolling regular and slow was gradually growing louder i rose and climbed the slope to have a look around and in the darkness at the summit stumbled over peredur who had roused himself with the same notion he whirled on me with a start and struck me with his fist before i succeeded in convincing him that he was not under attack peace lad it is myself gwalchavad forgive me lord he said much relieved i did not know you were awake the bell woke me i replied the young warrior appeared so confused by this simple declaration i added the monkish bell that as it tolled again just there gods truth he said shaking his head it was the singing that woke me i heard nothing of the bell i stared at him trying to define his face in the windy darkness singing strange to say but even as i spoke the word i heard the sound of voices lifted in slow sonorous chant perhaps i had been too taken with the bell to have noticed but i had not heard the sound before that instant nevertheless peredur maintained that the chanting had wakened him and now that he had said it i heard it too as we stood in the windtossed night discussing this the moon broke free of the lowflying clouds and cast a thin watery light over the barren hillscape the bell tolled and the chanting grew louder and i turned in the direction of the sound but saw nothing and so directed my gaze elsewhere there they are breathed peredur putting his head close to mine eight of them i make it where i searched the moonshot darkness for a glimpse of what he saw but found nothing there answered peredur placing his hand on my shoulder he turned me in the direction he was looking the same direction i had searched now i saw the flickering gleam of eight separate lights aglow on the hilltop on my honour i swear the lights had not been there a mere moment before yet there they were bobbing gently along the crest of the hill torches held aloft by unseen hands wafting gently nearer to the sound of chanting and the slow ringing of a bell a poor night i think for travelling hereabouts i remarked who can they be wondered peredur and then suggested we take up our weapons and see no i counselled their course will bring them near enough we will await them here we stood our ground and shortly perceived the phantom glimmer of faces beneath the guttering torches on they came passing out of sight briefly as they descended one of the intervening valleys only to reappear much closer than before now they were near enough for us to see that there were nine of them eight torchbearers led by one who carried the bell monks as i had supposed dressed in priestly robes that billowed in the wind they were chanting in latin and ringing their bell so intently that they did not appear to heed us at all had i been in their place i doubt if i should have expected to encounter fellow wanderers on such a night on they came their voices low their steps shuffling slowly their shapes shifting in the windwhipped torchlight as their robes blew this way and that dust churned up by the gusting wind cast a filthy pall over all so that they seemed to float along on dirty clouds when i judged they had come near enough i stepped forth out of the darkness my hands upraised to show i carried no weapons peace to you good brothers i said speaking boldly to be heard over the whine of the wind it was not my intent to frighten them but an unexpected stranger looming out of the darkness of a stormblown night might be assumed to set the heart racing curiously the column simply halted ceasing its chanting at the same instant so that it seemed the monks had anticipated my sudden appearance i give you good greeting i called stepping nearer they turned towards me and it was then i saw that their faces were swathed in strips of cloth dressings like those that bind the wounded none of them spoke a word the hiss and flutter of the torches and the sighing moan of the wind were the only sounds to be heard in all the world we all stood looking at one another in silence peredur and i on our side the nine shrouded monks on theirs what do you here on such a foul night i asked at last the foremost monk carrying the bell deigned to reply we go to worship our lord he intoned the time of our release approaches we have ridden far this day but we have seen neither church nor chapel hereabouts i told him where is your abbey our temple lies beneath the hollow hills he said in a voice cracking like the dull distant thunder we are christian men too i said and camped nearby you are welcome to share our fire christ spat the monk his anger sharp and quick we know him not mystified by his denial i asked then who do you worship mithras he proclaimed triumphantly and the remaining monks murmured the name in approval if this arrow was loosed to wound me i confess it fell a good way short of the mark for the monks revelation so surprised me i merely gaped at him mithras i cried in amazement that old bullkiller departed britain with the romans i replied which was what men like bishop tudno iltyd and elfodd taught holy men and learned every one mithras lives declared the man with the bell so saying he lifted his hand to his shrouded face and drew aside the wrappings as if they had been a veil i beheld a visage ravaged by disease the wretchs cheeks and nose had been eaten away his chin was raw his lips were cankered black and on his forehead pale bone glinted beneath scabcrusted skin there was not a thumbsbreadth of healthy flesh on him anywhere for that which was not rotted away was as dry and cracked as the droughtblighted earth beneath our feet peredur gasped lepers ignoring the young mans bad manners i swallowed my dread and forced what i meant to be a smile of welcome i have extended the hospitality of our hearth such as it is i told them i do not withdraw it now fool said the leper his voice a croaking whisper you stand on ground sacred to mithras the wind tore aside his cloak and in the flickery light i saw the dull glint of an ancient lorica on his chest a bronzehandled spatha hung from his hip and a brooch at his shoulder was engraved with the image of a shewolf and the words legio xxii augustus hail mithras the leper hissed bow down these words so alarmed me i sained myself with the sign of the cross something the good brothers do in times of trial when seeking comfort of the heavenly presence an instinctive impulse nothing more yet the result was staggering instantly the sky was rent by dry lightning a searing white flash set the heavens ablaze thunder rolled i threw a hand over my eyes when i dared look around once more peredur and i stood on the hilltop the wind whipping at our cloaks curling them about our trembling legs we were alone the nine lepers had vanished leaving nothing behind but the burning stink of brimstone eleven thunder cracked over our heads as if the sky itself would fall in shattered chunks upon the ground i felt peredur crowding close beside me devilry walks among us i said steadying my voice come we will hold vigil until morning returning to our pitiful fire we heaped up the small supply of brush we had put by and renewed the flame then sat huddled close to the fire and waited out the long stormworried night tallaght slept on undisturbed when murky daylight finally broke over the barrens i rose and retraced my steps to the hilltop to look for signs of what had passed in the night but the wind had done its work too well and there were no tracks to be seen i did however see the faint smudge of smoke rising from a fire some distance away to the south upon rousing tallaght we saddled the horses and began making our way to our destination as quickly as possible it took longer than i imagined to reach the place and we arrived to find the camp deserted only the smouldering ash of a fire remained once again peredur proved his skill forbidding us to dismount he stalked around the camp eyes down squatting low now and then searching this way and that for marks that only he could see there were four of them he announced abruptly they are travelling on horseback and which way did they go tallaght asked on leaving here peredur replied they rode south but four you say interrupted tallaght where did they keep the horses i see no tallaght i said sharply let the man speak to peredur i said what else would you say llenlleawg is with them he answered only one of the horses is wearing barred iron tallaght gazing around the deserted camp complained for so many people they left little sign of their passing i am looking but i see no such marks you are not meant to see them peredur replied haughtily they took pains to rub them out oh now you behold the invisible tallaght sneered and say whatever comes into your head offended by tallaghts slur on his abilities peredur snapped perhaps if you were not so blinded by your own high opinion of yourself you might stop it i cried exasperated and a little disturbed by their vexatious behaviour what has come over you tallaght and you peredur this is not like you at all he started it sniffed peredur tallaght retorted hotly liar i only said that enough i roared both glared at me in sullen silence overgrown children rebuked by a disapproving elder listen to you fighting like snottynosed bairns the pair of you i will not have it i gave them each a frown of firm rebuke and then addressing myself to peredur said now lead on we will take it in turn with the horses as before i would rather go afoot peredur muttered under his breath good i replied then you can have the first stretch get on with you now tallaght allowed himself a smirk at peredurs expense so i rounded on him and you my friend can sift the ashes and tell us how long ago they were here the young warrior opened his mouth to object then closed it again when he saw the set of my jaw dismounting he stumped to the firebed and began prodding the ashes with a sigh he stooped and took some into his hands felt them tossed them aside and put his hand flat on the stillwarm ashes i say they left at dawn he concluded rising to wipe his hands on his breecs he added defiantly unless anyone wishes to contradict me no one contradicts you tallaght i said growing weary of the sour attitude i gave a nod to peredur and we started off once more i wondered at the change that had come over the two young warriors previously they had shown themselves to be fast friends quick to praise and slow to anger now however they seemed as quarrelsome as cats edging for dominion of the dung heap i put the change to anxiety and the rigours of the journey and let it go at that anyone as illfed and tired as we were might also be fretful even so until they came to their former good spirits once more i thought it best to keep them separated the path led us south and ever south the sun waxed full but carried itself shrouded in a white heat haze as on the previous day we forced a rapid march all morning stopping only to change riders just after midday peredur led us to a small siltchoked pool a little way off the trail we could not bring ourselves to drink the stuff but the horses were thirsty enough not to mind it was while we were waiting for them to get their fill that we noticed the smoke as it happened i had been smelling it for some little time before peredur brought it to my attention but because my nights vigil over the campfire had left me with a cloak that stank of stale smoke i had paid little heed to more of the same we all reek of the hearth i replied no he said adamantly this is different lifting his head he turned slowly around in a circle then stretching out his hand pointed in the direction we had been travelling it is coming from that way he said we continued on following the scent of the smoke which grew stronger with every step soon we came to a ridge whereupon i ordered my companions to dismount and we crept cautiously to the crest to observe the land below far off to the right i could see the greygreen glint of the sea flat and glimmering like an anvil under the whitehot hammer of the sun to the left the ridge descended in steep rocky ledges to a rough rubblefilled valley and there straight ahead rising in a thick black column a pillar of smoke ascended to the heights to be carried away on the wind the fire itself remained out of sight behind a low hill signalling the others to follow me i went down for a closer look my companions leading the horses upon reaching the valley floor we discovered the bed of a dry stream bearing the hoofprints of four horses one with barred iron the other three unshod in the soft fine dirt it did not need peredurs eye to see that the riders had crossed the dry stream climbed the hill and were now encamped beyond rather than walk into a strange camp unawares i thought it best to see what manner of men we had been following all this time stay with the horses i told tallaght and commanding peredur to attend me turned and made my way swiftly to the top of the hill where lying on my stomach i peered over the crest and down the slope to the valley below what i saw astonished me the entire valley floor had been heaped into a mound surrounded by ditches and atop the mound stood a great fortress of stone the romans sometimes built in stone however the stronghold before me was unlike any the legions ever raised save in one respect only this fortress too was a ruin its huge stones lay in tumbled heaps the remains of high walls filling the ditches the cracked shell of what once must have been a magnificent tower rose over the central gateway a tree growing up through its empty middle the rubble of a hundred dwellings lay overturned and scattered within the walls and although the great hall itself was roofless now several enormous beams arched over empty space and two of its graceful walls stood untouched hard by the mound to the south stood the blighted remains of a great wood rank upon rank trees of untold age stood leafless and dead their black trunks and twisted limbs testifying to their tortured demise while many more were heaped one atop the other like stout warriors fallen in battle at first i thought the smoke must issue from this bleak wood but a closer look revealed that it ascended instead from the huge hearth in the centre of the ruined hall truly declared peredur in an awed voice giants must have built this place perhaps i allowed and did giants also start that fire peredur glanced at me to see if i was jesting with him swallowed and said i see no one then let us go down i replied and instructed him to tell tallaght to leave the horses and for both of them to follow me and guard my back warily alert to any sight or sound i crawled down the hillside working slowly towards the ruined gateway yawning open like a toothless mouth in the centre of the collapsed wall there i paused and waited until i saw that tallaght and peredur were behind me and then picked my way through the opening upon entering the inner yard i scrambled over the rubble and almost slid into a standing well i looked in and saw my own self looking back for though the well wall had fallen there was yet water below it was the first clear water i had seen in many days and my first thought was to drink before caution convinced me that it might be better to wait until we could test it properly there is water here i told my two shadows and then advised but i would not drink it yet moving on i continued towards the hall here and there among the tumbled stones i caught the glint of sunlight shining up at me from the ground as i passed shoving aside the debris i found bits of broken glass in the soil real glass mind the more i looked the more i found it was everywhere underfoot even the romans who used the precious stuff with abandon were not so profligate as that the wrecked hall stood before me thick black smoke rising above its two intact walls i saw no one nor any sign that anyone had set foot much less set fire in the place for hundreds of years cautiously carefully i crept to the hall then worked along the wall until i came to the end standing against the good wall i peered around the corner into what had been the great halls hearth and there i saw a curious sight a huge iron cage round and with a peaked roof like a house of an earlier age all around this iron house brush and branches had been piled up and set alight as there was far more smoke than the flames themselves allowed i supposed oil of some kind had been used to help ignite the brush whoever had set the fire had gone there was no one to be seen anywhere i signalled my two companions to join me and was about to call out to them that once again we had lost our quarry when i heard a groan see now i have often enough stood on the battlefield after a bloodletting to have heard the sounds wounded men make and there was no doubt in my mind that this is what i heard clear and unmistakable the sound of a broken man moaning over his wounds here i cried someone is hurt darting forward i ran to the iron house and looked inside llenlleawg lay on his side curled in a tight ball his head was a bloody mass and his eyes were closed i called to him but could not rouse him it is llenlleawg i shouted to the others hurry desperately wishing for some way to carry water from the well i threw myself upon the nearest of the fallen rooftrees instead tallaght and peredur flew to my side as i lifted the ancient timber in my arms it was good oak strong still and though broken in the middle long enough to serve dragging the wooden beam to the cage i began using it to push the burning brush away peredur was first to reach me and added his strength to mine within a dozen heartbeats we had cleared a path to the cagework house get another beam i shouted to tallaght who returned carrying the other half of the timber i had found peredur saw what i intended and before i could give the order he ran to a nearby stone gathered it up in his arms and carried it to the firebreak we had cleared there he threw down the stone and we drove in with our timbers wedging them between the lowest bars of the cage and using the stone levering the ironwork off the ground alas the metal cage was heavy and the stone was not high enough to raise it much but as tallaght and i together applied our full strength to the timbers peredur leapt to the gap digging with his hands scraping away the dirt until he had succeeded in scooping out a hollow just big enough for a man squirming on his back his face a hairbreadth from the hot metal peredur wormed under the bar and into the cage rolling onto his feet he leapt to llenlleawgs side and tried to revive him failing that he seized the stricken irishman by the arms and began dragging him to the gap hurry growled tallaght through clenched teeth i am losing my grip smoke stung our eyes and burned our nostrils but we clung tight to the timbers as peredur tugged the unconscious llenlleawg to the shallow hole he had dug then diving under the hot iron he positioned himself flat on his stomach and reached back for llenlleawg for gods sake groaned tallaght the cords in his neck bulging hurry i cannot hold it stand firm lad i told him sternly it is almost finished agh tallaght gasped redfaced his eyes shut against the strain his shoulders were shaking steady now i told him just a little longer peredur meanwhile had succeeded in pulling the irish champion halfway through the body was now stuck however and the young warrior could not budge it he is wedged in peredur cried raise the cage higher christ cried tallaght mercy on your feet i told peredur take him under the arms scrambling up the young warrior grabbed llenlleawg under the arms and pulled with all his might the unconscious body moved a fraction and then stopped tallaght groaned quickly i grunted my own strength beginning to fail seeing there was nothing for it peredur raised his foot and placed it against the hot iron straining every sinew taut he threw back his head and gave a mighty heave lifting llenlleawg and pulling him through the gap in the same instant tallaghts strength gave out and he fainted the sudden weight sent the timbers flying and i was hurled onto my side as the iron cagework house slammed to the ground llenlleawg was free peredur lay half atop him panting with his exertion i ran to them both well done i cried here help me get him away from the flames together we hauled the unconscious champion clear of his wouldbe grave we found a place by one of the standing walls and i left the two of them there while i returned for tallaght i dragged him away from the fire and marked that the flames were already burning themselves out the young warrior awoke as i tried to lift him and with my aid was able to stagger to the wall where he collapsed once more and lay groaning gently to himself i knew how he felt both head and heart were pounding my breath came in ragged gasps my hands were raw and my side ached where the beam had caught me as it tore from my grasp rest easy i told them gulping air it is over we are safe now all is well brave words as it turned out twelve power as i possess is not as many believe given in exchange for a soul to hear the ignorant speak one would think it merely a simple bargain an exchange of vows perhaps and the power one seeks simply flows from the fingertips for the asking but no it is not so easy as that the truly great gifts are not gifts at all but treasures obtained after long and difficult searching prizes won only through hardfought victories over relentless nearinvincible adversaries true power of the kind i possess is achieved only through the most rigorous and exhausting means and few mortals have even the slightest notion of the enormous discipline that must be brought to bear at every step of the journey for it is a journey proceeding from strength to strength adding skill to skill eminence to eminence following the long and arduous path to complete mastery the first eminence is the mastery of silence in which the adept must forsake all communication with others no external thought or word must be allowed to intrude or distract no other voice can be heeded or heard the adept must abandon all contact with other minds this leads to the second eminence wherein the adept gains the ability to project thoughts and images into other beings and wherein emotional atmospheres are generated and manipulated with mastery also comes control over animal life and the ability to command animals to ones bidding the third eminence allows the adept to project ones image over distance at will to be in two places three places at once and in different forms in the forth eminence the adept acquires profound knowledge of plant and vegetable essences the deep and intimate awareness of the nature and use of plant life in extracts and elixirs gaining the fifth eminence grants mastery over the movements of air and water and the command of fire weather can be manipulated and controlled in localized regions the sixth eminence leads on to the ability to pass into etheric form to dissolve ones physical presence disappearing in one place and reappearing in another whole and complete in the mastery of the seventh and last eminence the adept achieves the ability to prolong physical life indefinitely the adept acquires the ability to halt the normal human aging process and even reverse it when necessary without this all that came before would be too soon rendered useless the ignorant speak of hidden arts but they are not hidden indeed there is nothing secret about them at all they are freely open and available to any who would pursue them ah but the price the price is nothing less than the devotion of an entire life so perhaps the simpleminded are right after all in thinking of the acquisition of power as a pact in which the soul is bartered there is no other way leaving the others to restore themselves i walked back over the hill to fetch the horses and with some difficulty brought them within the confines of the ruined caer the horses shied from entering the place and it took all my coaxing just to get them to pass through the gate once inside they twitched and shivered as if they were cold and stamped the ground anxiously nevertheless i tethered them nearby and retrieving the two waterskins from behind the saddles hastened back to the ruined wall kneeling beside llenlleawg i wet the edge of my cloak and dabbed it to his lips he did not stir is he dead asked peredur he gathered his legs beneath him and came to stand over me putting my face near llenlleawgs i felt his breath light on my cheek he lives never fear i told the young warrior let us see what they have done to him thus i proceeded to clean his wounds pouring water on a strip of cloth torn from the lower edge of my siarc i washed away the dirt and blood from his face and neck he had been soundly beaten taking many blows to the head and several of these had been hard enough to break the skin his left eye was red and puffy dark blood caked his nostrils and oozed from the nasty gash on his lower lip his cloak was gone and much of his shirt as well as his belt and weapons whoever made bold to separate this irishman from spear or knife most certainly paid a fearful price for their audacity of that i had no doubt save for some bruises on his shoulders and scrapes on his arms and wrists there were no other wounds that i could see apparently his attackers had been satisfied to beat him senseless before throwing him into the iron house they would never have gotten him inside it any other way the horses began neighing just then so tallaght having regained himself somewhat got up to see what was bothering them he walked away shaking the cramps from his arms a cruel death observed peredur looking around almost fearfully it is fortunate we found him when we did who would want to do such a thing when we discover that we will have pierced the mystery to its core i replied and turned once more to llenlleawg i tore another strip from the bottom edge of my siarc wet it and applied it to his battered face this brought a moan from the irishmans throat he wheezed and black phlegm came to his lips i dabbed it away with the edge of the wet cloth there cough it all up i told him get rid of it at the sound of my voice his eyelids flew open and he surged up all at once as if he would flee be easy llenlleawg i said placing my hand on his chest so that he would not do himself further injury lie back all is well your enemies are gone he slumped back with a sighing groan then fell to hacking so hard i thought his ribs would crack he coughed up the vile black stuff spitting again and again only to cough up more drink a little i offered bringing the waterskin to his mouth it will revive you as the water touched his lips a troubled expression appeared on his face and he made to rise once more rest yourself brother i said it is gwalchavad here there is nothing to fear recognition came into his eyes at last he ceased resisting and lay back allowing me to give him a drink he drank greedily swallowing it down in great draughts as if he had not had any water in days i tried to pull the waterskin away but he gone and much of his shirt as well as his belt and weapons whoever made bold to separate this irishman from spear or knife most certainly paid a fearful price for their audacity of that i had no doubt save for some bruises on his shoulders and scrapes on his arms and wrists there were no other wounds that i could see apparently his attackers had been satisfied to beat him senseless before throwing him into the iron house they would never have gotten him inside it any other way the horses began neighing just then so tallaght having regained himself somewhat got up to see what was bothering them he walked away shaking the cramps from his arms a cruel death observed peredur looking around almost fearfully it is fortunate we found him when we did who would want to do such a thing when we discover that we will have pierced the mystery to its core i replied and turned once more to llenlleawg i tore another strip from the bottom edge of my siarc wet it and applied it to his battered face this brought a moan from the irishmans throat he wheezed and black

recognition came into his eyes at last he ceased resisting and lay back allowing me to give him a drink he drank greedily swallowing it down in great draughts as if he had not had any water in days i tried to pull the waterskin away but he grabbed my wrist and held it in place and gulped until he choked spewing blackened water from his nose and mouth here now we did not pull you from the flames to drown you i said drink slowly there is plenty he released my hand and slumped back his mouth worked and he tried to speak but it was some time before he could make himself understood gwalchavad he said his voice raw and wispy you found me we have been following your trail for days i am sorry we did not arrive sooner we might have saved you a beating i am he began then fell to coughing again you found me who did this to you before he could answer i heard a shout it was peredur calling me to come running llenlleawg started at the sound peace brother it is one of the cymbrogi i explained quickly leave it to me how many he gasped with you only two of the younger warriors i said rising if i had known we were going to be riding the length and breadth of llyonesse i would have brought the entire dragon flight rest easy i will return directly i found peredur beside tallaght who was standing with his arms half raised and crossed at the wrists as if to protect himself from a beating peredur his hand on tallaghts shoulder spoke to him while shaking him gently the horses meanwhile had not ceased their neighing if anything their distress had only increased what is it i snapped irritated at his failure to accomplish this simplest of chores i cannot wake him peredur said i gave the young man a sour look to show him what i thought of his ludicrous explanation and turned to tallaght but behold though he stood upright with his eyes open wide in all other respects he appeared fast asleep seeming neither to see nor to hear but remaining unmoved through all of peredurs exertions a rapt expression on his face as if held in thrall to a dream of such pleasant aspect that he would not be roused baffled and alarmed i reached out and took the young warrior by the arm the muscle was tensed hard solid as wood yet tallaght appeared tranquil with no sign of strain in either face or form next i put my face close to his and discerned the faint stirring of his breath on my skin tallaght i cried sharply wake up the young warrior gave not the slightest indication that he had heard taking him by the shoulder i shook him so as to rattle his bones as before this raised no response seeing that his arms were folded i took hold of his right arm and tried to straighten it as if to break the spell i could sooner have broken his arm for try as i might there was no unbending that rigid limb except by violent force which would not have helped in the least after jostling and shouting some more i admitted defeat and desisted i tell you the truth peredur i declared turning once more to the awestricken youth i have never seen the like he has become a living corpse peredur gaped what are we to do with him i cannot say i replied regarding the stiffened form before us but i would not leave him here like this i suppose we must lay him down somewhere casting a quick glance at the sky i added llenlleawg is not well enough to travel yet and we are losing the day we will make camp in the hall and see what tomorrow brings spend the night here peredur wondered with alarm where else i countered angrily here at least we have stout walls at our backs water and a fire it is as good a place as we are likely to find in this accursed land too shocked to object farther peredur closed his mouth and stared at me in dismay now then i said let us carry tallaght to the hall and make him comfortable until he wakes what asked peredur if he does not wake see here i snapped i am not liking this any more than you but there is nothing else to do together we eased the young warrior onto the ground and lifting him between us began carrying him to the hall tallaght gazing dreamily skyward remained placidly unaware of his rough handling we might have been toting a plank for all tallaght sagged or complained we moved him to a place beside one of the standing walls and after clearing away the stones laid the sleeping warrior on his back in this position his resemblance to a corpse grew the stronger tearing yet another strip off my siarc i wet it folded it and placed it over tallaghts eyes as much to hide his dead unblinking stare as to protect his sight it was while i was about this chore that i saw the bite a small neat circle of reddish marks on the side of his neck where sharppointed teeth had broken the skin if i had not seen it before i would have said it was the bite of an animal a small dog or weasel perhaps but i had seen it before on rhys arm rhys knew nothing of how he had gotten it and i was none the wiser for having seen two but i knew tallaght did not have it before he went to see to the horses now what are we to do asked peredur when i finished now we make camp i said i saw no reason to mention the bite to peredur frightening him would serve no purpose water the horses peredur and i stopped myself and corrected my command better still we will both water the horses and when that is finished we will tether them within the hall this we did and our various chores occupied the fastfading day a grey shroud of clouds moved in from the sea to obscure the sun and cast a dusky pall over the ruined stronghold we took wood and live embers from the remains of the fire around the iron house and used them to make our campfire now and then i paused to tend our stricken brothers but there was little to be done for either of them tallaght had not altered a whit since we placed him on the ground and llenlleawg having drunk a little water and received dressing for his wounds slept now coughing from time to time and stirring fitfully but never waking while we worked we talked peredur and i for it helped to keep our courage up i confess i could feel the fear stealing over me as the daylight abandoned us to the long dark night as the shadows bloomed and spread over the ruins i felt as if we were being stalked i imagined cold eyes watching us from all the dark places watching and waiting we gathered more brush and branches enough to keep the fire during the night and with the dull twilight closing around us made a simple meal from our provisions neither of us ate more than a few mouthfuls as we sat hunched before the fire gazing at the rubble heaps and fallen timbers around us while the wan flames flickered over the ruins when we finished eating we banked the fire and gathered our cloaks around us to sleep if sleep were possible with the night a heavy stillness descended over the valley and its ancient keep a cold unnatural silence which stifled all sound and made us feel as if each belaboured breath we drew might be our last twice my carewracked drowse was broken by the sound of an owl the creatures soft trilling call drifted down from the crumbling tower above i woke and looked around to see a sickly moon rising over the broken wall in elder times the call of wisdoms bird was deemed an unchancy thing portending ill fortune for the wretch who heard it some i ween believe it still now i am of no such mind to take fright at bird sounds in the night but this night the call made me think of winter and graves and death stealing light and life from the eyes after the third call peredur awakened i saw him start and then leap up the owl startled by the sudden movement below swooped off flapping its broad wings slowly peredur crouched his hands tensed staring furiously around him as if he meant to take flight too peace lad i murmured softly it was only an owl but he seemed not to hear taking two or three steps away he stopped then said no wait very well i will go with you so saying he threw aside his cloak and started away as if he meant to follow someone who even now led him swiftly from the camp i thought to call after him but held my tongue rose and went after him peredur walked through the caer and out the gate making straight for the blighted wood looking neither right nor left he ran leaping like a stag over the crosswise boles quickly outdistancing myself who scrambled clumsily in the dark with only the half of a pale moon to light my way avowed to the task i pressed on however following the sound of his reckless flight as the cracking of dry undergrowth gave me direction i struggled on as best i could trying to avoid impaling myself on the ragged ends of broken branches as i slid over a fallen trunk i felt something soft beneath my feet and reached down to retrieve a siarc peredurs siarc to be sure i crashed on a few more paces and found his breecs dangling from an upthrust limb has he gone mad i wondered gathering the clothes into a bundle under my arm and running on a dozen paces more and the sound of his flight abruptly ceased it took me a moment to realize i no longer heard him anywhere ahead of me i listened turning my head this way and that to catch any stray sound which might betray the spot where he had gone to ground again i made to call out to him but something checked my impulse my senses already alert quickened as in the heat of the hunt and i picked my way forward in stealth stopping every few paces to listen before moving on in this way i proceeded quietly warily my skin tingling with an eerie anticipation i came to a place in the blighted wood where three huge trees had fallen one across another to form a rough enclosure i crept nearer and looked over this rude wall and there in the centre of the clearing lay peredur sprawled naked on the ground and on his bare chest a small hunched black creature was lowering its flat head thirteen my heart seized in my chest i stared at the creature not daring to draw breath the thing was squat and repulsive with two long arms and a largeskulled flat head its short legs were drawn up as it sat on its rump its back curved sharply as its dark head descended towards peredurs face at first i feared the thing must have killed him for the young warrior lay with arms and legs splayed out as he had fallen but as that ghastly head drew near peredur moaned by that i knew he lived instantly my hand went to the sword belt at my side as my fingers closed and began to draw the weapon forth the creature halted and quick as a cat turned its gaze on me a more grotesque face i never want to see lowbrowed and thinjawed with a nose like a shrivelled leaf nostrils atwitch as it sniffed the air a goatlike mouth with long yellow teeth gaped open in a hiss of warning two wide pale eyes menaced me from beneath the heavy brow as the head sank lower onto the shoulders and the long hands clutched at its prize great king save your servant i thought and the thought was answered by a low guttural growl bubbling up from the hideous creatures throat i fell back with a scream the creature leapt from peredurs chest charging straight at me with terrible swiftness i stumbled back another step tripped over broken wood and fell down the thing was upon me in an instant the beasts awful breath smelled of rotted meat and foul decay i felt its sudden weight upon my chest driving the breath from my lungs i made to throw the creature off but could no longer raise my arms it was as if all the strength had gone from my limbs and i could but lie and watch in horror as the odious thing lowered its face towards mine alas for me i could not move i could not breathe the repugnant head dropped slowly nearer and the toothy mouth opened striving with all my might i could not so much as lift my smallest finger i felt myself gripped tight by a strength greater than my own closer drooling now the evil mouth drew nearer and nearer yet i saw the small neat sharp teeth as the mouth opened and the creature prepared to bite my lungs burned frozen fast i could but watch the dread face slowly descend its baleful eyes blotting out all else filling my sight staring into my soul even as i watched i could do no else the face utterly changed and i found myself beholding the face of a woman a beauty more lovely than any other i had ever known lithelimbed and supple she reached to gather me in her gentle arms her long dark hair falling down around her white shoulders her breasts were full and round and wonderful to look upon her shapely hips were smooth and her long legs folded beneath her she smiled and her teeth were fine and white and straight a goddess could not be more beautiful i think and despite my fear desire stirred within me she lowered herself to cover me with her fair body and i felt myself drawn into her embrace my lungs swelled to bursting yet i could not draw breath the blood beat in my temples and dark mist gathered before my eyes god help me i rose to meet her then even as i felt the sweet gentleness of her soft lips on mine and felt my breath drawn from my mouth there came a shriek so loud so piercing i feared my head would split in the same instant the woman vanished and the beast appeared once more its mouth open in a scream of rage i sensed a swift movement above me and a dark shape descending the loathsome thing made to leap away but the falling shape caught the creature full on its flattened skull with a tremendous crack the monster threw back its head and howled crack the dark shape sent it sprawling suddenly i could breathe again good air came rushing into my mouth and lungs and i gulped it down like a drowning man who has risen from the killing depths peredur was standing over me the broken end of a massive branch in his hands his jaw was set and his eyes were narrowed still gasping i turned my gaze to where he was looking and saw the black beast writhing on the ground biting itself in agony blessed jesu i gasped save us at these simple words the vile thing loosed a shriek yet more terrible than any i had ever heard there came a sizzling sound and it vanished into a sudden vapour leaving behind only the echo of its tortured scream and a stench of bile and vomit peredur turned to me he tried to speak but lacked words to equal the event and so closed his mouth and gazed in wonder at the place where the beast had disappeared then he raised the club in his hand and looked at it as if he did not know how it had come to be there he threw the weapon aside with an expression of disgust i feared it might have killed you he said almost apologetically you did the right thing i assured him peredur shivered and glanced down only then did he realize that he was naked he glanced guiltily at me but i turned away so he would have no need to make the explanation he was struggling to find i knew well what had been in his mind when he shed both siarc and breecs your clothes are here i told him gathering up the bundle where i had dropped it he accepted the clothing with shamefaced gratitude i did not see what happened to your boots i mean it was he stammered save your breath lad i advised gently you owe me neither explanation nor confession we were attacked and fought it off there is nothing else to say peredur closed his mouth and began drawing on his breecs we then picked our way back to the ruined hall our camp i was relieved to find remained undisturbed both llenlleawg and tallaght slept soundly lord let us leave at once said peredur let us get far away from here before we are attacked again though it was the dead of night and darker than the inside of a burial mound i agreed we may not get far in this darkness i told him but at least we will get away from here we quickly saddled the horses and prepared to depart then turned to wake the sleepers despite our vigorous attempts to raise them however the two slept on nothing we did made the slightest difference let us put them on the horses anyway suggested peredur in desperation we would have to tie them to the saddle i replied to keep them from sliding off at every step no peredur as much as i wish to be gone from here we could easily come to greater harm stumbling around like blind men in the dark if we are going to be hauling men like mealbags on horseback i think we must wait until daylight indicating his feet i said you cannot walk back to ynys avallach barefoot with great misgiving and greater dread peredur set about building up the fire and together we stood watch for the rest of the night weapons in hand our backs to the flames as we searched the darkness talking to one another to keep fear at bay dawn seemed a long time coming when the sun finally rose it cast but a wan grey light over us as on those days in the north when the mist comes down and lingers on the heathered hills but there was no cooling mist and the hills hereabouts held only dry scrub and thorns as soon as it grew light enough to see the path we broke camp peredur retraced his steps to the blighted wood returning quickly with his boots anxious to get away from the ruined caer as soon as possible we turned to the sleepers and tried again to wake them tallaght had finally lost the unnatural rigidity of his limbs and now lay peacefully asleep i bent to remove the strip of cloth from his eyes and the young man came awake at my first touch up he charged as if from a bed of live coals he flew into me fists flying kicking biting shouting incoherently here here now i cried fending off the blows as well as i could peredur leapt to my aid and pulled him off me peace he bellowed peace brother wrapping his arms around tallaghts torso he threw him to the ground and fell on top of him to hold him down all the time shouting peace we are your friends kneeling beside him i struck the struggling warrior sharply on the cheek tallaght wake at the sound of his name the fight went out of him he looked from one to the other of us with frightened eyes as recognition slowly came to him oh he said squeezing his eyes shut let him up peredur i said and we raised him between us where he stood wobbling on his feet like a man with a headful of ale it is over tallaght you are back among the living i told him he lurched towards me and seized my arm with both hands lord gwalchavad forgive me i thought i thought you were he released my arm and clutched his head as if it hurt him oh jesu save me i had the strangest dream it is over lad i said are you well i feel as if i have slept a thousand years he answered dreamily and yet as if i had closed my eyes but a moment ago he then began babbling about his curious dream but i brought him to a halt before he could gallop any further plenty of time to talk once we are on the trail i told him sharply the horses are ready we are leaving at once i left him to peredur and turned to llenlleawg who though stiff and aching from his beating at least had his natural wits about him he roused himself slowly when i woke him and made to sit up wincing with pain at the effort i put my arm beneath his shoulders and raised him how do you feel brother never better he rasped his voice raw as a wound he then hacked up a gob of blackened gall and spat it on the ground have i been long asleep not long i allowed only all night and half the day besides i see he licked his dry lips how did you find me we saw the smoke can you sit a horse i will sit a goat if it bears me from this place he answered bring it on brother and the sooner we quit this accursed ruin the better i will be have you seen the girl we have seen no one here but you i told him was she with you when he made no reply to this i said llenlleawg was she with you did she have a hand in this llenlleawg attempted to sit up again his face contorted against the pain wait a moment i told him let me help you so saying i retrieved a spear and put it in llenlleawgs right hand then squatting behind him i took him under the left arm the irish champion gripped the spear shaft and pulled himself up as i lifted and with much groaning and clenching of teeth we got him standing shakily and swaying like a windtossed sapling but standing all the same then he was racked with coughing i steadied him as he cleared his lungs of yet more black muck it is not as bad as i thought llenlleawg gasped squinting and pressing his left hand to his side as he leaned on the spear at least he wheezed there is no blood the young woman llenlleawg was she here i asked again i cannot remember but you were following her i insisted you must have followed her into llyonesse she must have led you here llenlleawg regarded me dully then turned his face away as i said i do not remember what do you remember nothing much he said shaking his head slowly i remember following the trail and crossing into llyonesse there was a beacon and i went to see what it meant and he paused abruptly and i cannot remember anything after that obviously there was more he would not say but i did not know how to make him tell me well i conceded you are safe now and we are returning to ynys avallach no doubt you will remember more later he nodded grimly and i shouted for peredur to bring one of the horses come i said taking llenlleawg by the arm lean on me i will bear you up together peredur and i lifted the tall irishman between us boosted him to the saddle and put the reins into his hands let us be gone from here i said leading the horse forward we quit the ruined fortress passing once more beneath the crumbling tower and out through the gate we crossed the ditches and headed north hastening back along the trail that had brought us travelling quickly and quietly at least as quietly as four men might and as quickly as possible when two of the four must go afoot peredur and i walked beside our two ailing companions to help steady them in the saddle and keep them from falling we allowed ourselves but little rest so despite the footling pace we made good distance on the day indeed by the time the gloomy twilight gathered round us we were well on our way home we camped in the dry streambed of a little cramped glen and ate from our dwindling store of provisions took turns at the watch through the night and pushed on at first light next morning no further disasters befell us nor did anything out of the ordinary give cause for alarm however when we came in sight of the estuary where i had lost my horse to the quicksand some days before a sense of dire foreboding came upon me there was of course no visible reminder of that terrible event but the place seemed steeped in dolour and gloom i could almost feel its spirit restless with anguish sad and hungry and forlorn i felt cold and unhappy and thoughts of death and desolation swarmed in my head there was nothing for it but to continue on and to put as much distance as we could between us and the sinister place before turning aside to make camp for the night the rest of the journey to ynys avallach proved uneventful and tallaght so improved that though we travelled no more swiftly at least we were able to share the horse between us thus on the evening of the sixth day we came in sight of the fisher kings stronghold glinting like white gold in the dusky light its fine walls and towers reflected in the reedfringed pool below weary and more than a little footsore i suppose i have spent too much time in the saddle these past years we paused to gaze upon that tranquil sight and let it fill our souls with the pleasure of its serenity then our hearts lifted and the vision of our destination lending speed to weary feet we hastened on arriving just as the abbey bell tolled for evening prayers i know the good monks have a word for this as they have a word for everything else in their peculiar world but i know not what it is or if i have been told i remain ignorant of it no matter what its name this prayer at the closing of the day has always seemed to me one of the finer things of their occupation perhaps one day when sword and spear no longer rule my days i may give myself to such pleasant contemplation as those good brothers now enjoy as the slowtolling bell rang out over the summer realm we passed the silent shrine and put our feet to the upwardwinding path leading to the tor pausing at the top to look out upon the land below softly fading into the pale blue shadows then as we turned to enter the yard i heard a cry of welcome rhys came running bursting with questions i had no wish to answer more than once peace brother i said gripping his shoulder all will be told and there is much to tell only let us get a drink down our throats first leave the horses rhys said i will send someone to attend them turning to the others he called come inside the pendragon has been waiting for you he has given it was then that he caught sight of llenlleawg head down slumped in the saddle almost fainting with exhaustion and peredur holding the reins and walking beside him what is this rhys exclaimed dashing to his side is he wounded help us get him down i said and explained that we had found him beaten and left for dead he will recover never fear however a few days food and rest would not be wasted on him i think we hauled the unresisting irishman down from the saddle whereupon he seemed to come to himself once more insisting that he could walk and would not be lugged into the hall like a sack of grain he grew so adamant that we let him have his way truly i think he had been nursing his strength for this moment he was that proud he did not wish to be seen in his weakness by his swordbrothers nor could he bear causing his beloved queen even a moments worry as it happened he need not have concerned himself the hall was empty no cymbrogi to be seen and few of avallachs folk either rhys to all appearances was king of the rock and held dominion over the few who came and went he called a command to one of the young fair folk lads i saw hurrying away on some errand the fellow spun on his heel and raced to obey had i given the matter more than a fleeting thought i would have expected our arrival to occasion greater interest than we had so far received where is everyone i asked as we stepped into the empty hall the plague has worsened in the southlands rhys replied charis and most of the monks have gone to londinium to join paulus in the fight lord avallach is at his prayers as for the others they will return when it gets dark well and good i told him but where are they now rhys called for the welcome cup and then turned to look at me i thought you knew how should i know i countered sourly and unless someone tells me i fear i shall die in ignorance they are at the shrine rhys replied as if we should have known we saw no one at the shrine i told him bluntly or i would not have asked not that shrine rhys said the new one arthurs shrine the king is building a shrine to the cup llenlleawg flanked by the two young warriors drew up beside us what cup would that be the holy cup rhys paused and regarded us dubiously do none of you know any of this i reminded him that we had journeyed all the way from llyonesse on foot most of the way and were not of a mood to appreciate riddles it is to be the grail shrine rhys announced tersely the pendragon has decreed a shrine to be built to house the holy cup which he has taken as the sign and emblem of his reign arthur believes a great blessing will flow from this grail to the benefit of britain and of all the world is this the same cup that healed arthur asked peredur one and the same confirmed rhys i know the cup you mean i said as the memory came winging back to me as from a great distance you mean to say that you have seen it no one has seen it rhys replied save avallach myrddin and now arthur avallach knows where it is he keeps it hidden somewhere i think now you know as much as anyone else about it the boy appeared bearing the requested welcome bowl rhys took it raised it spoke a word of greeting and delivered the bowl into my hands i passed it at once to llenlleawg and waited for the others to finish before taking it up once more the ale was cool dark and frothy soothing my parched tongue and throat like milk mixed with honey i drank a long draught and with great reluctance passed it along once more the bowl made the round again and rhys said he would have food brought so that we might refresh ourselves while we waited for the others now i must send for myrddin he told us preparing to dash away once more he has spent the last three days telling everyone to bring word the moment you returned fourteen no doubt this new shrine has everyone occupied tallaght mumbled staring into the empty cup as into a fresh grave alone with a dry bowl in a deserted hall we sat glumly considering our sorry homecoming haggard and harried grey with dust bone weary we wore every step of our peculiar journey on our clothes and on our faces well remarked peredur it is not as if anyone knew we would be returning just now even so llenlleawg above remarking on his disappointment said nothing but closed his eyes and bowed his head fatigued and dispirited the one welcome he sought above all others that of his king and for which he had rallied his dwindling strength was denied him and exhaustion was rapidly overtaking him there will be time enough for glad greetings i told them trying to put a more favourable face on the thing as for me i can think of nothing better than a bite to eat and a quiet drink before meeting the others the food arrived a few moments later and upon sending the serving boy back to refill the bowl we fell to eating content with a little peaceful quiet to soothe our wearied souls we ate in silence and i was just reaching for a second barley loaf when i heard quick purposeful footsteps enter the hall i knew before raising my eyes to his greeting that myrddin had found me at last he said gliding to the table in a single swift motion like a hawk falling upon its unsuspecting prey you have returned at last is the woman with you and it is earth and sky to see you too wise emrys i replied i do hope you have fared well while we were away he regarded me sharply and dismissed my lacklustre attempt at scorn with an impatient flick of his hand tell me what happened i will and gladly i replied but it may be best if we permit my companions to leave now know they are anxious to wash and rest myrddins quick golden eyes turned to llenlleawg and he perceived in an instant what i meant forgive me he said stepping smoothly to the irishmans side i have been too distracted to notice your distress how can i help you llenlleawg the champion raised his head and forced a waxy smile i am well emrys only let me rest a little and i will greet my king and queen in a better humour he made to rise but lacked the strength and fell back in his chair here said peredur jumping up if you will excuse us lord emrys tallaght and i will see to llenlleawg the two of them raised llenlleawg between them too tired to pretend otherwise any longer the proud irishman allowed himself to be helped to his feet once steadied however he pushed away their offered hands and moved from the hall with a slow sore gait the young warriors respectfully took their leave and hurried off to the warriors quarters to find a bath and change of clothes when they had gone i returned to the table myrddin seated himself on the bench opposite me folded his arms on the board and leaned close now then there is no one to overhear he said levelling his keen hawklike gaze upon me your confessor waits before you tell me everything there is trouble i told him bluntly i cannot say what it is but myrddin i deeply fear it i then began to relate all that had happened during our sojourn in llyonesse and it did me good for i felt the burden lift from my soul as i told him about the strange trials we had endured in that godforsaken realm from losing my horse in the false sands to our encounter with the beast in the night myrddin listened all the while nodding to himself from time to time as if the incidents i relayed confirmed something he already knew or suspected at last i concluded saying that we escaped with only the loss of one horse is a wonder indeed we were beset from the moment we entered llyonesse god save me myrddin it is a desolate region with but one settlement that i could see and that a ruin llyonesse he muttered the word as if it hurt his mouth to say it a wasteland by another name the dead rest uneasy there in truth i replied and confessed to seeing the mithrian lepers i have not heard of them for a long time myrddin mused you know them i wondered when i was a boy my grandfather elphin used to tell me stories about the lost legion i never thought to hear about them again he paused for a moment reflecting unhappily then glancing at me again he said this fortress how did you find it from the smoke i replied then described coming upon the ruin and finding llenlleawg trapped in the ironwork house inside the caer do you know the place i asked from what you tell me i believe the stronghold you found was belyns i had never heard the name before and said so belyn was avallachs brother myrddin explained when the fair folk came to ynys prydain they settled first in llyonesse but the land was not good to them so avallach and his people came here belyn his brother king would not leave the southlands so he and his people stayed and now they are no more the place was more cairn than caer i pointed out could this have happened so long ago yes the emrys answered nodding at the memory long and long ago turning once more to the subject at hand he said the woman you never saw her i never did emrys and i do not know whether llenlleawg can tell you more he said she led him into llyonesse but seems to remember little else leave it to me myrddin said rising i will speak to him when he is better rested now then i have kept you from your bath long enough go we will talk again later i want arthur to hear what you have to say but that can wait until tomorrow until then gwalchavad i would have you say nothing to anyone else of these matters i believe treachery stalks the summer realm and i would not care to alert the enemy that we are on his trail treachery his use of the word brought me up short emrys are you saying one of the cymbrogi is a traitor just so he replied solemnly moving away he has yet to show his hand but i sense dire purpose in this no doubt that was why you were allowed to find llenlleawg allowed to find him i challenged jumping to my feet to follow him in truth myrddin they meant to kill him and would have succeeded too if we had not seen the smoke and arrived in time to save him if the enemy had wanted him dead a quick thrust of a blade through the ribs would have sufficed myrddin replied calmly deflecting my objection the smoke on the other hand was meant to lead you to our irish friend so that you could rescue him that i am persuaded is one of the few certainties in all of this twisted tale you rescued him because you were meant to rescue him nothing more it is absurd i concluded stopping in my tracks you make it seem as if we were on a fools errand the emrys turned back and regarded me with a slow solemn shake of his head never say it he intoned gravely never say it my friend something brutal cruel and sinister is at work among us feel it but why i demanded to what end myrddin troubled now and hesitant answered in truth i wish i knew still we would all do well to remember this where great good abides there great evil gathers it is ever so and we have been warned we must all tread very carefully from now on with that he turned and walked away i glanced uneasily around the hall feeling unseen eyes on me watching me then fled the great empty room and proceeded at once to the warriors quarters though i expected to join the others they had finished by the time i arrived and so i had the entire bath to myself the room was warm and damp the air heavy with steam two torches burned in tall stands either side of the square pool their flames shimmering and dancing on the water i stripped off my filthy clothes and slipped gratefully into the bath the hot water heated from the ovens in the old roman way did much to restore me i confess i stayed overlong and perhaps the heat and steam went to my head for as i lay back in the soothing water i saw a black mist gather before my eyes i pressed my eyes shut for a long moment and drew a deep breath and when i opened my eyes once more the mist was gone but i felt lightheaded and queasy concluding that i had had more than was good for me i rose and was about to climb from the pool when i heard my name i have been looking for you gwalchavad i felt an icy breath on my naked skin and turned a woman stood opposite me across the room dressed in long loose robes of blue and deepest green her fair hair shimmering in the feeble torchlight she was tall and slender and possessed of the beauty men see only in their dreams she was watching me intently an expression of approval on her face woman who are you i said you were but a boy when i last saw you she said drawing a step closer her feet made no sound on the flat stones but look at you now what a fine handsome man you are the very figure of your father lot would be pleased strange to say until she uttered my fathers name i did not recognize her but the instant she invoked lot my heart clutched and my strength flowed out of me like water poured out upon the sand it was all i could do to hold myself upright morgian i gasped trembling inwardly as with cold or with frozen rage my son she said nicely extending her arms to me have you no welcome kiss for your mother you are not my mother i replied revulsed my mother is dead poor gwalchavad she pouted folding her hands prettily before her and to think i always treated you like a son of my own blood get away from me witch i said i made to turn away but could no longer make my limbs obey i would speak to you dear gwalchavad she replied her voice growing as smooth and sinuous as a serpent coiling around its prey there is something i wish you to do never i spat i would sooner cut off my hand than lift a finger for you oh i think i may find a way to change your mind she said her smile beguiling with concealed treason men are such simple creatures after all i tried to speak and felt my tongue clench in my mouth my jaws seized up tight you see i am not to be denied she continued stepping nearer she raised a hand and absently described a figure in the air i felt my throat constrict and i could not breathe it is a small thing a trifle of no particular consequence i think you may find it far easier to obey than to refuse i will die first i forced the words out through clenched teeth my jaws aching as if to break she raised her head and laughed her voice warm and lovely charming she said pressing her hands together beneath her chin that is exactly what your brother said she informed me cheerfully alas poor gwalcmai he forced me to take him at his word still i do not expect you to make the same mistake no i shrieked pressing my fists to my eyes jesu save me there came a fluttering sound like that of wings in flight and when i opened my eyes i was once again lying in the water still alone one of the torches was out i rose and looked at the stone floor where morgian had stood but despite the steam and damp there was no trace of any footprint nor any sign of her at all i shouted and received only the dull echo of my own voice in return frightened now i left the bath and fled to the warriors quarters there was no one around and as i dried and dressed i gradually calmed and convinced myself that it was only a bad dream brought on by fatigue and the uncanny experiences of my recent journey when i emerged at last i had put the thing firmly from my mind and was ready to greet my king and swordbrothers in better spirits i returned to the hall feeling certain i could devour my weight in roast meat and drain a lake of ale the babble of voices echoing along the passageway gave me to know that the shrinebuilders had returned and a celebration had commenced indeed the hall was bright with torchlight and full of friends laughter and highspirited talk flowed like a wave out into the night cups were being passed and the hearth fire had been laid pausing at the threshold i stood for a moment and counted myself most fortunate among men to behold such a noble gathering when men and women such as these pass from this worldsrealm i thought the world will be a colder place rejecting the thought as unworthy of the occasion i drew myself up and entered the glad gathering on the instant i was hailed and a cup thrust into my hands i felt a hard clap on my back as i raised the cup and cais voice loud in my ear here he cried the wanderer returns how went the hunt brother before i could answer cador appeared and said if my two young kinsmen are to be believed disaster dogged your trail from dawn to dusk ah well i allowed following myrddins request it was never more than a nip at the heel cai laughed but my careful reply caught cadors attention he stepped nearer there was trouble aye i replied reluctantly there was then raising the cup i said but there is ale in the bowl and fire on the hearth let us talk of happier things i drank and passed the cup wiping foam from my mouth i said tell me now what is this i am hearing about arthurs new shrine och cried cai only a few days but so much has happened while you were gone you will be kicking yourself you were not here he then plunged into an enthusiastic recounting of the heady events of the past days the account grew somewhat in the telling but was well seasoned with remarks from various others who came to greet and welcome me once more into their company the short of it was that arthur having returned to the place of his miraculous healing had been wakened in the night by a vision of a shrine wherein the cup of christ shone forth with a light like the morning sun the pendragon took this vision as a sign from the high king of heaven that he should build a dwelling for the grail the abbot and monks were consulted and for two days arthur and bishop elfodd sat headtohead over bits of slate on which the pendragon scratched drawings to represent the shrine he had seen in his vision elfodd and arthur i wondered at this pairing but kept my thoughts to myself and allowed cai to finish which he did eventually saying we have sent to londinium for men who know how to work with stone stone i asked the shrine is to be of stone stone aye replied cai arthur wants it to last a thousand years ten thousand offered a nearby listener forever put in another the work has begun already it has that confirmed cador the site has been chosen and the ground has been cleared we have been cutting trees all day and pulling up stumps i tell you the truth gwalchavad you have had the easier time of it i was never born to drive oxen when talk turned again to how i had fared on my journey i made the excuse that i was starving and suggested we join those at the board where the food was now arriving i looked for arthur and gwenhwyvar but did not see them anywhere among the throng made up of cymbrogi for the most part with a few monks and a smattering of fair folk as well neither did i see myrddin and held the absence of these three together as yet one more misfortune to be borne along with all the rest i might have wallowed in my melancholy but then overcome by the aroma of roast meat and warm bread and by the sight of bubbling cauldrons being carried from the kitchens on wooden poles i devoted myself to eating instead when the rough edges had been smoothed from my hunger i gazed along the benches down the length of the board to see who my supper companions might be i saw farther along tallaght and peredur and many others i knew heads down over their platters as if nothing in all the world could trouble them i saw this and i wished i could discard my unpleasant memories so easily and then it came again into my mind the unwanted intrusion of my waking dfeam as if morgian herself had burst boldly into the room to taunt me with fresh terrors suddenly too upset to eat any more i pushed my bowl from me stood made some excuse to my companions and started towards the entrance of the hall i had walked but halfway across the great room when the doors swung open and arthur and gwenhwyvar entered myrddin swept in behind them saw me and beckoned me to him at my approach the king smiled and held out his arms for me to embrace him gwalchavad he cried here you are god be good to you my king i said gripping his arm myrddin told us you had returned safely that i have lord welcome gwalchavad said gwenhwyvar her voice soft and low i was hoping you would be here is llenlleawg with you she looked quickly past me into the hall for sign of her kinsman no my lady but i have no doubt he will join us as soon as he is rested come now gwalchavad said arthur happily sit with me at table much has happened while you were away and i have much to tell you nothing would give me greater pleasure lord i replied nor was i disappointed truly his zeal was irresistible as he described the great work he had undertaken a few moments in arthurs company and i had all but forgotten the harrows of my journey and the queer menace of the dream see now this is the mark of the pendragon of britain a man whose ardour for life is so compelling that others find their lives in him a man whose natural nobility extends to everyone he sees so that all others are ennobled in his sight truly he is one of the great kings sons and wears his sovereignty with such easy grace that all who will bend the knee to his authority are raised up and exalted by it know you i have lived alongside arthur for many years and have served him and followed him into battle more times than bear remembering so believe me when i say that i have rarely seen arthur in such joyous good spirits it was as if all the hurt and pain of the past troubled years had been wiped away and his spirit restored to its true and natural state fine and unblemished by the harsh tolls of kingcraft and war that night he was more himself than even the day of his marriage to gwenhwyvar and that is saying something we talked and laughed together and i felt my own heart rise to bask in the warmth of his friendship when at last we parted for the night i found the vision of the kingdom of summer burning in my heart although the name never passed his lips ah but that was not necessary arthur was aflame with it like a beltain fire he scattered sparks in all directions and set the night alight anyone who spoke to him would have been likewise dazzled and i count myself blessed to have sat at his right hand and listened to him describe his plans for the grail shrine it was no rude hut he meant to build but a perpetual beacon of goodness to all who walked in darkness a wellspring of blessing to all who thirsted for righteousness an endless feast to all who hungered for truth and justice the completion of the grail shrine would commence a season of peace and plenty which would last a thousand generations how all this would come about was still somewhat vague indeed the means by which arthur would come into possession of the holy cup was not as i recall ever mentioned but one thing was very clear in the pendragons mind the deeds we performed now would become a song which would endure so long as men had tongues to speak and ears to hear oh and when we rose from the table at last the night was far spent and the dawn gleaming like redgold on the eastern horizon seemed not the beginning of a day only no it was nothing less than the inauguration of a magnificent golden age fifteen the first of the stoneworkers tribe appeared three days later eight or so men with huge oxdrawn wagons full of tools and provisions they did not come to the tor but went straightaway to the site and occupied themselves with establishing their camp in the valley at the foot of the hill where the new shrine would be built arthur eager to see the work begun rode out to greet them and some of the cymbrogi went with him we watched as they went about their chores and by days end five large leather tents of the kind the romans used to make occupied the little plain five more were raised the next day these they said were to house their fellows and families who arrived in four days time the numbers at the site swelled to perhaps forty in all though that included the children who seemed always to be everywhere at once over those first few days i had ample opportunity to observe the masons as they went about the chores of ordering their camp they were odd men small of stature with broad backs and tough sinewy arms and short thick muscular legs they were a hardhanded readytempered crew and loud with it when they were not shouting at one another they were singing to make the valley ring much like seamen in their ways i would be surprised if a single one of them had ever sat a horse or gripped a sword much less thrown a spear the next days were given with considerable pointed discussion to the preparation of the site the stonemen grumbled endlessly at how poorly the land had been cleared and they complained about the chosen placement and the disgraceful paucity of suitable stone in the region nothing was good enough for them and they spared no breath letting the whole realm know it gods truth arthur muttered cai quickly tiring of their surly opinions if complaints were stones the shrine would be raised by now and a cathedral besides added bedwyr tartly pack the lot of them back to londinium and be done with it i say put in rhys we were doing well enough before they came but arthur took the carping and complaining in his stride they are hounds without a handler he said when their chieftain arrives he will bring them to heel the chieftain he meant was a bandylegged bald man with a beard like a bearskin his skin blasted by years of toil in sun and rain and wind was as thick as the leather of his tent and just as brown his name was gall and he walked with a limp and chewed hazel twigs which he kept in ready supply in a leather pouch at his side tough as an old stump he had but to speak a single word and his men leapt to obey arthur liked him instantly once gall and his small brown wife arrived the complaining subsided to a tolerable level and the work began in earnest despite the appalling stone and lamentable situation again we were favoured with occasions aplenty to observe them for the cymbrogi were put to work cutting trees to supply the timber they needed i never imagined masons required so much wood for their curious craft that which you would build in stone gall informed us you must build first in wood nor could i help noticing that myrddin seized every opportunity to go alongside the master mason questioning his every move and thought in order to learn all he could of the stoneworkers craft when we were not fetching logs to the site we were occupied supplying water for their camp though the drought continued as the long dry summer wound slowly to its close the spring below the tor remained as sweet and cool and plentiful as ever unaffected by the lack of rain we filled empty ale vats and trundled them back and forth to the stonemasons camp using their oxen and wagons were we ever thanked for this singular service ha in the midst of this turmoil a strange and unsettling event occurred which should have served as a warning to us all it was a sabbath day when the monks perform their holy offices and many of the christian folk in the realm come to the chapel to observe these services and worship with the clerics the masons as it happens do no work whatsoever this one day in every seven and so they were free to join in the worship which they did singing out the hymns and psalms with unrestrained vigour arthur so enjoyed this display of religious fervour that he went along to observe the vespers in the evening and then invited everyone monks and masons together to the tor to sup with him in avallachs hall thus we were all there together and enjoying the mood of festive cheer when i felt a queer sensation course through the hall beginning at one end of the great room and sweeping through to the other i could see it ripple through the crowd as it passed and felt a fluttery queasiness in the pit of my stomach this was instantly followed by a peculiar numbing tingle like that of a winter chill on cheeks and nose and fingertips the hall fell silent with the kind of queasy anticipation that follows a sudden change in the wind just before the storm breaks illumined by the subtly shifting radiance of torchlight and hearthglow the entire company stood motionless and staring some with mouths open as if to speak some with bowls halfway to lips as if to drink i saw arthur and gwenhwyvar half turned towards the doorway with laughter still on their faces but frozen now in everyones expression and demeanour were the fastfading remnants of a last interrupted happiness i looked again and saw the cause of this interruption a few paces inside the doorway stood a young woman tall and slender her long hair a mass of fiery curls flowing over her shapely shoulders like glistening water her willowy form clothed in a deep green robe over a hooded mantle of shining gold she stood imperious and erect a monarch receiving the homage of her people for a long frozen moment silence reigned in the hall suspended between one breath and the next no one moved or spoke and then i heard footsteps outside the hall the approach must have surprised her for she turned her head towards the sound and in that instant the hall sprang to life once more as if on command and myrddin appeared in the doorway behind her she faced myrddin and he halted stricken in midstep i saw the smile of welcome freeze even as the words of greeting died on his lips the greenrobed lady moved swiftly to his side and laid her hand gently on his arm then she turned and together beaming their good pleasure they crossed the threshold into the hall for all the world a regal couple entering their marriage feast my amazement at myrddins curious behaviour was immediately swallowed by an even greater astonishment for as she drew nearer i realized that this lady was the woman i myself had discovered wandering barefoot in the forest it was she whose pursuit had almost killed llenlleawg and three more besides gone were the rags gone the fearful expression gone too the bare feet dirty hands and unkempt hair she appeared in every way the very likeness of a queen from the hem of her robe to her curled and hennad hair i stood rooted in surprise but the crowd surged forward exclaiming all at once myrddin with a single word silenced the tumult peace he said his voice filling the hall from hearthstone to rooftree he stood with upraised hand and halted the commotion as quickly as it had begun then turning to the young woman he said so you favour us with your presence once more i would know who it is that we would welcome lady i command you tell me your name his tone was firm but gentle and there are few indeed able to defy his commands still i knew full well the young woman lacked the power of speech and therefore was my astonishment compounded when she answered forgive me lord emrys i am called morgaws excitement rippled through the gathering she speaks some exclaimed what does it mean asked others arthur pushed through the throng to join them gwenhwyvar at his heel it is a wonder he proclaimed beaming his pleasure at this unexpected turn how has this transformation come about myrddin still watching the young woman narrowly made no move as morgaws stepped before the king thank you lord arthur she said inclining her head prettily i am beholden to your kindness she spoke in a voice both hoarse and low as if rusty from disuse a year ago a curse was laid on me by a woman of our holding and i lost the power of reason and speech since then i have wandered where i would a captive within myself neither knowing who i was nor where i belonged yet you appear to have recovered yourself most remarkably well gwenhwyvar observed pushing in beside her husband i would hear how that came about the two women eyed each other with cool appraisal morgaws put her hands together neatly and said i have indeed noble queen yet i am at a loss to explain it all i know is that upon coming in sight of the tor i felt a great confusion overwhelm me i knew nothing but that i must get away you left us all too suddenly gwenhwyvar pointed out crisply we worried for your safety and sent good men in search of you they faced dangers and endured severe hardships for your sake one is suffering still it would have saved us great pain and no little trouble if you had but given us some small sign we might have helped you morgaws lowered her eyes demurely alas i can but beg your forgiveness my queen my imprudence was poor reply to the great benevolence you had shown me i was not in my right mind i confess i fled into the wood nearby and rode until i could ride no more then i slept and when i awoke the confusion had left me and i was myself again after so long a time i could not rest until i returned home and restored my fortunes she smiled prettily i have come to thank those who cared for me in my affliction a doubtful frown played on gwenhwyvars lips and where is your home not far from here morgaws answered my home is near caer uintan and she paused as if reflecting unhappily but then resumed upon restoring myself i could not rest until i had returned here to thank you for the kindness you have shown me although she answered the queen i noticed her eyes never left arthur and when she finished she smiled at him you returned to us alone said myrddin after all that has happened to you i would have expected your people to take better care of you than that certainly it is unwise for a young woman to travel unaccompanied the question appeared to unnerve morgaws somewhat her glance shifted away from arthur and she bent her head hesitating as if searching for a suitable answer the king saved her from her predicament however arthur expansive and generous said i too am interested to hear your tale but there is plenty of time for explanations later you are healed now and that is cause enough to be thankful come let us sit down together and celebrate your safe return with that the king then led his elegant guest to the table where he seated her near him gwenhwyvar catlike in her wariness stayed close and nothing passed that she did not see or hear as ever the wise emrys kept his own thoughts to himself but i could not help noticing he did not join them at table that night for the next few days talk of morgaws unexpected return was exceeded only by discussions about the grail shrine though i listened to all that was said further enlightenment was not forthcoming regarding the lady some said one thing and some another various speculations about her plight and marvellous restoration became hopelessly tangled and genuine facts seemed difficult to come by she was a noblewoman some said whose settlement was destroyed and her people slaughtered by the vandali others had it that she was the daughter of a belgae tribe whose people had fled to armorica because of the plague leaving her behind still others held other ideas but no one seemed at all certain which of the various stories were true all the while work on the shrine continued apace and the days settled into a peaceable rhythm safely back at ynys avallach among friends and swordbrothers once more i considered the fearful events in llyonesse increasingly trivial with each passing day the memory faded growing more and more distant and insignificant i even convinced myself that my dream of morgian was the result of lightheadedness brought on by fatigue worry and too much time in a too hot bath it is i suppose only human to put aside fear and pain to move away from all unpleasantness as quickly as possible i was no different from anyone else in this respect even morgaws return failed to kindle any lasting suspicion after all gwenhwyvar and arthur accepted her the queens wariness having given way to genuine welcome and affection they all but doted on her who was i to question their sentiments i told myself the lady has obviously suffered greatly and her release from her affliction is cause for celebration i told myself we have no proof she has done anything wrong i told myself she has every right to enjoy the attentions of arthurs court these things i told myself repeatedly and half believed them still from time to time doubt crept up on me little more than vague twinges of misgiving so despite my repeated selfassurances and the excitement and gaiety bubbling around me i could not make myself feel glad for her nor was i the only one to take a sour view of the matter peredur too held himself distinctly apart from the merrymaking one night some while after morgaws return i saw him sitting at the board cup at his elbow watching the king and queen with their enchanting guest sliding onto the bench beside him i said why the scowl friend i thought you would rejoice at the wanderers return like everyone else i might he muttered darkly if everyone else was not smitten blind with adoration i find little enough to admire in that woman morgaws he regarded me with suspicion and slowly turned his scowl back to the crowded hall morgaws he said his voice so low i could hardly hear him you do not like her much i see peredur shrugged i do not think of her one way or another reaching for his cup he drained it in a draught why should i he demanded she is nothing to me i wish i had never laid eyes on the slut i wondered at this uncommon vehemence but instead replied i know what you mean brother i too feel uneasy about our mysterious guest you were the one who found her his tone suggested that every misfortune in the world flowed directly from my hand you did not seem uneasy about her then it was true i suppose when we first came upon her in the forest i had felt nothing but sympathy for her plight peredur as i recall had been dismayed by her from the first moment he saw her well i allowed it may be as you say no doubt my view has been altered by our sojourn in llyonesse and i will tell you something else we are not the only ones to harbour misgivings peredur merely grunted at this myrddin too withholds his blessing then perhaps myrddin emrys is as wise as men say with that the young warrior threw aside his empty cup it struck the board with a thump whereupon he stood abruptly you must forgive me lord gwalchavad i find myself out of temper tonight i assure you i meant no offense please take no notice he left me then and stalked away i saw him disappear into the throng gathered at the hearth and so i determined to see who else might be less than complete in enthusiasm for the honoured lady after a time i located the elusive llenlleawg who i expected would feel something akin to the distaste peredur expressed if anyone had reason to distrust morgaws llenlleawg certainly did much to my amazement however i could not have been more wrong she is a wonder is she not he said as i came to stand beside him there was no question about whom he meant he stood staring at her from a distance across the hall where she all smiles and demure replies conversed nicely with arthur gwenhwyvar and elfodd who had joined us from the nearby abbey she is that i suppose i answered regarding him closely ignoring my ambivalence llenlleawg continued truly she is one of the tuatha dedannan happy with his comparison he said indeed she is a very sidhe how her face shines beneath her flaming locks and her eyes his voice drifted off in tones of such rapture i turned and looked my friend full in the face had i ever known him to speak so no never can this be the same man i said who suffered so much in her pursuit she had nothing to do with any of that he declared nothing at all does that mean you have remembered something of your ordeal no he said flatly i remember nothing about what happened but she was not the cause of it that much i know if you cannot remember how can you be certain the tall irishman gave me a darkly disapproving look and stalked away unable to make sense of his reaction i took my search elsewhere at the entrance to the hall i found myrddin standing alone watching the regal diners at the board seeing where his attention lay i put my head close to his and said somewhat carelessly well it seems morgaws has won a place among us oh she is adept at insinuating herself into mens affections myrddin replied his mouth twisting wryly mark me gwalchavad there is no end to the question of morgaws i look at her and see only questions begging answers why did she leave us only to return like this her fine clothes where did she get them she speaks with the easy loftiness of a noblewoman but who is her family why does everyone forget themselves whenever she is near llenlleawg has certainly forgotten himself i replied intending to tell myrddin of my conversation did you know that he i began but the wise emrys was no longer listening he had turned and was gazing at morgaws the frown had vanished in a look of rapture ah but she is beautiful there is no denying it he murmured this simple remark filled me with greater anxiety than anything else he could have said i stared at him but heedless of my presence he moved away i slept ill that night and the next morning rode early to the site of the new shrine hoping to take my mind from the problem of morgaws once at the site i was amazed to see how much had been accomplished since galls arrival as it happened the hill chosen for the shrine was a low humpbacked mound within sight of both avallachs tor and the abbey and roughly equal distance from each early as i was as i came in sight of the place i could see the workers swarming over the hillside wagons trundled to and fro some with stone for the shrine some with stone for the path leading to the shrine still others having delivered their loads were rumbling away for more i dismounted tied my horse on the picket line and walked to the base of the hill stopping now and then to talk to some of the cymbrogi who were helping construct the path of stone cobbles they all worked with cheerful vigour beside the masons their banter highflown and easy the cymbrogi fetched the stones which the masons selected with deft efficiency tapping them into place with wooden mallets i greeted those i knew commended their zeal and walked on slowly mounting to the top of the hill which had been levelled to provide a precise and striking site for the shrine pits had been dug at the four corners and filled with rubble stone then an extensive bed of small stones had been laid down on which the foundation would be placed the first few stones had been placed the previous day now the labourers were busily erecting a rough timber support along the proposed line of the wall i found the affable gall blissfully employed shouting commands to a group of cymbrogi endeavouring to drag a wagonload of stone up the hill stop the wheels he was crying use the timber to stop the wheels turning to me he said they fill them too full you see i tell them half loads are easier on the oxen the shrine will not be raised in a day i tell them but they refuse to listen then regarding me more closely do i know you lord i am gwalchavad and i am at your service i replied warming to the man at once openfaced his features glowing with health and goodnatured exasperation he looked out upon the world through a pair of mild brown eyes the sun glinting off his rosy bald pate for a moment he stood blinking at me sturdy arms folded mouth puckered in thought and then good lord gwalchavad of course yes one of the famed dragon flight in the name of christ i give you good greeting he smiled his agitation at the heedless volunteers already forgotten my name is gall if it were not for the fact that the high king of britain presses me daily to know when the work will be completed i would invite you to break fast with me but there is no rest for the wicked though his speech was couched in the form of a complaint he seemed not to mind his hardship in the least you have no end of helpers i observed he peered at me doubtfully have you come to help me too fear not i replied lightly for unless you discover some task requiring my particular attention i will happily stand aside and watch from afar good man the overloaded wagon crested the hill just then and the master mason bustled off to order the deposition of the stone i walked around the site looking out at the surrounding fields blasted by heat and drought how much longer could the land survive without good groundsoaking rain i could not help thinking that despite the late warmth harvest time was soon upon us and what a poor harvest it would be at least the dry weather hastened the masons work but would the people hereabouts view the kings shrine in any kindly light when both grainstore and belly were empty before i could wonder further my meditations were arrested by a call from below i turned and looked down the slope of the hill to see cai trudging up to meet me upon exchanging greetings he said i have been looking for you brother this is the last place i expected to find you yet find me you did he nodded glanced quickly around the hilltop at the work in progress then said arthur has summoned the dragon flight to attend him in council this is sudden do you know why i asked already starting down the hill to where the horses were waiting as it happens said cai falling into step beside me i believe he is going to tell us about his plans for guarding the shrine at my questioning glance cai continued in tones suggesting he felt it beneath him to explain the obvious once the holy cup is established in the shrine it must be guarded you know who better than the dragon flight the finest warriors in all britain who better indeed i replied but where is the cup now avallach has it i expect but soon it will belong to everyone maybe myrddin is right i countered and we should leave it alone it seems to me avallach has kept it safe enough all these years worrier cai scoffed what can possibly happen to the cup with us guarding it sixteen it is one of mortal humans more cunous traits that the appearance of a thing is more greatly esteemed than its true character this is invariable i find perhaps it is that a phasing image evokes the beholders best sympathies and the desire to be united to the thing admired then again fools that they are perhaps they simply believe that nothing which attracts them could ever bring them harm they are woefully wrong in this of course as in so much else be that as it may it is precisely this oddity which has served me so well that morgaws is beautiful there is no doubt i made her flesh and blood for just this purpose fairest of creatures she is nevertheless my creature i taught her everything she would need to know to accomplish my will and desire i taught her everything and taught her well she is that empty vessel which can be made to contain whatever its owner requires born of the union between my dutiful son lot and me morgaws is truly bone of my bone and blood of my blood from the moment she came into the world i have moulded her to my will like all infants and children she was born with a desire to please those in authority over her those who controlled her food and shelter warmth and security with consummate skill i manipulated her childish desires to serve my purpose and she responded magnificently morgaws is my finest creation revenge made flesh together with the rest of the cymbrogi we hastened back to the tor to prepare ourselves for the council to take place at midday in the warriors quarters men rushed to and from the baths while others shaved and dressed in their finest clothes still others were busily burnishing their swords spearheads and shield bosses thus inspired i washed and shaved too and put on my better clothes and by the time i had finished scouring my sword the cymbrogi were already gathering in the great hall i found rhys and cador and walked with them to join the rest the tables and benches had been removed from the hall and everyone was pressed tight at one end of the huge room we three pushed our way to the front of the assembly as was our due only to find that the pendragon was already in attendance he was sitting in avallachs thronelike chair facing the dragon flight who formed a loose circle around him beginning with bedwyr at his right hand and continuing around to llenlleawg at his left gwenhwyvar stood behind the throne her hand resting on arthurs right shoulder and myrddin beside her tall and as silent as the oaken staff in his hand cador rhys and i quickly took our places at the bottom of the circle opposite the king who acknowledged our arrival with a slow nod of approval seeing that all were assembled he raised a hand to myrddin who then stepped forward to stand before the king taking his staff he raised it high and brought it down sharply with a loud crack and then twice more planting the staff firmly he made a circuit around it passing once twice three times gazing steadily into the face of each man as he passed this done he lifted the staff and held it lengthwise across his chest and in a voice both solemn and profound began to speak fortunate among men are you i say again fortunate are you and all men alive to hear what passes in this hall i tell you the truth many generations of men before you have lived and died longing for this day myrddin paused his golden eyes scanning the company before him heed the head of wisdom this day the sun has risen upon the kingdom of summer henceforth and until the stars fall from the sky and the sea swallows our island the kingdom now begun shall prevail you who stand before your king bear witness the lord of summer has taken his place upon the throne and his reign is commenced at these words the assembled warriors gave out a tremendous cry a joyous roar to alert all ynys prydain that a new kingdom had come into existence at the high kings command it was some time before the emrys could make himself heard finally when the acclaim had abated somewhat he continued the praise of true men is a boon of great blessing and the inauguration of the summer realm is right worthy of praise he said yet the kingdom of summer will not be honoured in word only but in deed for this reason and for this purpose the fellowship of the grail is begun if the first proclamation brought forth cheers this last brought a hush of anticipation as deafening in its way as the shouts of praise i held my breath with all the others as the pendragon rose from his chair and came to stand beside his wise emrys arthur wearing his golden tore and serpent armband caledvwlch gleaming naked at his side raised his hands in lordly laud of his decree the fellowship of the grail arthur said his voice echoing the strangely stirring words is the first expression of the summer realm but what is it is it a brotherhood dedicated to the service of the most holy grail yes it is that and it is more it is an alliance of true and kindred spirits kinsmen united not by blood but by devotion to a common duty that duty is to guard and protect the grail and all those who will come as wayfarers and pilgrims to the shrine of the blessed cup hear me cymbrogi it is a high and holy duty to which i have called you for many years the grail has been guarded in secret hidden for its protection and watched over by its keeper lord avallach soon however the holy cup will be unveiled for the blessing of britain and her people a secret no longer it will be delivered into our keeping and we will become its guardians and protectors the skills we have learned in war and honed in constant battle those selfsame skills will be turned to the nurture of peace our swords will become the weapons of our lord christ on earth no longer will our adversaries be mere flesh and blood but the powers and rulers of darkness the fellowship of the grail is begun in you my loyal friends you will be the first and those who come after will follow the path you mark out with your steps therefore i charge you my cymbrogi walk worthy of your calling so saying he lowered his hands turned and seated himself once more the dragon flight inspired by highsounding words and the prospect of glorious deeds greeted the pendragons declaration with loud acclaim they cheered and cried pledges of loyalty to the new fellowship when after a time the cheering began to die away cai shouted to be heard lord and pendragon he said his brash bawl of a voice loud above the clamour i know full well that i am one with my swordbrothers in welcoming the inauguration of the summer realm and like them i pledge sword and self to the cause you have just proclaimed your words are fine and high as befitting the occasion and i suppose you are loath to demean the noble fellowship with tiresome explanation yet though i chance the scorn of those blessed with keener wits than mine cai turned this way and that as if to acknowledge those he held above him even so i deem it worth the risk to ask how are we to accomplish the duty which you have laid upon us and which we right readily accept this brought goodnatured laughter from all those looking on cai ever practical could not hear a cause proclaimed without knowing how it would be accomplished of course once cai had cracked the wall the rest came pushing through the breach all of them demanding of the king in one way or another what they were meant to do and how they were meant to do it i could not help noticing that myrddin made no move to aid the king but stood leaning on his staff and observing the clamour with cool indifference as if to say who would stir the hive must brave the buzzing arthur merely smiled and stood taking his place in the centre of the circle once more lord cai fearless friend i bend the knee to your humble entreaty turning to the assembly arthur declared your approval of the fellowship is as gratifying as your zeal is heartening if i have not revealed my thoughts fully it is for this reason the fellowship of the grail is to be a true union of hearts and minds and this i am persuaded can only be brought about by the willing dedication of those so called and not by kingly decree therefore i would that you my noble friends select from among your own number those who will determine the ordering of the fellowship on your behalf holding that in mind i urge you to pray seeking wisdom and choose your leaders well for the rule they proclaim will be the law from this day forth and forevermore in this i thought i saw the hand of bishop elfodd or at least the example of a monastic order as a guide for establishing the grail fellowship be that as it may arthur gave no instruction about how we were to go about our determinations and seemed unwilling to say more indeed having delivered himself of his address he took his leave of us bidding us to proceed with our deliberations and bring him word when we had chosen our leaders soon we stood in our circle regarding one another with glances of shrewd and thoughtful appraisal here was an activity to which we men of war were least suited the best that could be said was that while it might have been an unequal battle at least we did not down weapons and surrender the field shouldering our responsibility as best we could we embarked on what amounted to a long and fruitless wrangle in the end the dragon flight unused to cultivating decisions of this kind turned expectantly to their battlechiefs first to speak was bedwyr perhaps as the one who enjoyed the high kings closest confidence he had gleaned greater knowledge of arthurs intentions than we had heard for he said brothers if you will permit me to break into your meditations i would offer a suggestion speak cried cai impatient to get on with the proceedings by all means we will be forever beholden to you unless someone takes the tiller we will be circling these waters forever everyone laughed at this and our burden was eased considerably the stiff awkwardness of our high calling as arthur had deemed it disappeared and we became merely comrades with a duty to discharge my suggestion bedwyr continued is simply this that each man among us should declare three choices and those whose names come most often to the lips of their comrades will scout out the path by which we are to proceed a fine plan i thought but one of the younger cymbrogi made bold to amend bedwyrs proposal if you please noble lord he said seizing his chance in the outcry of approval that followed bedwyrs address it is in my mind that the issue before us is both sacred and profound and no less portentous than battle where life and limb are placed at hazard beneath the rule of those who lead us leaning near to cai i whispered he speaks well this one who is he he is one of cadors kinsmen cai replied he goes by the name of gereint i think ah yes i vaguely remembered the fellow although in truth so harried were we in our battles against the vandali i had yet to fully acquaint myself with the more recent additions to our number gereint continued thus i would gladly submit in peace to those i willingly trust in the heat of the fight perhaps i may be so brazen as to propose that we bestow the honour of ordering this fellowship upon those to whom we have already sworn our loyal submission namely the pendragons battlechiefs well the proposal was carried forth on a rolling wave of noisy enthusiasm bedwyrs eminently sensible if less valiant suggestion was forgotten in the eager rush to advance the proposition the cymbrogi gave voice to the plan and all departed in high spirits assured at having discharged their duty properly and well all that is save the five battlechiefs who were now saddled with the task bedwyr cai cador llenlleawg and me what happened next shames me to confess so i will simply say that we fell to long and fevered discussion about how the thing should be accomplished oh it was thirsty work too for as the day drew on and the weighty task conspired to steal our strength we sought refreshment in avallachs good ale a dubious remedy perhaps but if it did little to ease the burden of decision at least it helped us think better of our chore for a short while anyway after a long wandering discussion we arrived once more precisely where we had started taking arthur at his word we framed this modest proposition that the most holy grail rarest of treasures must be guarded that means cai maintained over the rim of his bowl a perpetual guard well and good replied bedwyr but the grail fellowship is to be more than guard duty arthur said it is to be a sacred calling we are to protect pilgrims and wayfarers too llenlleawg pointed out that means we must have warbands to ride the land he did not say anything about riding the land said cador he said very little at all retorted bedwyr growing impatient what is so difficult demanded cai we are given a free hand to order the fellowship how we will and all you can do is find fault with arthur for allowing us the honour the onus you mean muttered cador onus cai flapped an impatient hand at cador who took a deep draught of the cup man where do you get such words it is latin cador informed him loftily are we to be monks now llenlleawg inquired sourly spouting latin and psalms at one another a sad day has dawned when a man cannot say what he thinks sniffed cador into his cup and i say give me a sword and i will guard this grail llenlleawg declared see see cried cai almost upsetting the ale jar in his eagerness to clap llenlleawg on the back llenlleawg agrees the holy cup must be guarded we are to be guardians of the grail easy brother bedwyr said saving the jar he poured another draught and took a long pull from the bowl and put it down with a thump i say we have talked enough for one day he pressed his fingertips to his temples my head hurts drink and frustration had worn us down and tempers were beginning to fray at the edges i did not like to see my swordbrothers quarrelling so determined to end the discussion before we were at one anothers throats i agree with bedwyr we have talked enough for one day i suggested let us part while we are still friends and come at this again tomorrow aye and what do you suggest we tell the king asked cai arthur is awaiting word from us tell him i replied that our deliberations are well begun but that a duty of such significance takes time a day or two more at most i should think the others liked the sound of that and agreed that another day or two should give us ample time to complete our task it was decided that we should come together again the following morning with a mind to setting matters to rights cai hastened away to tell arthur and cador retreated to his bed for a nap llenlleawg quickly departed on errands of his own leaving bedwyr and myself to contemplate the ruin of the day we must finish tomorrow bedwyr confided i could not bear two more days like this is everyone always so contentious always i assured him he shrugged i never noticed before looking towards the empty doorway through which llenlleawg had just disappeared bedwyr said our irish friend has something on his mind you mean there is somewhere else he would rather be bedwyr favoured me with a knowing look the mysterious lady morgaws oh aye i agreed i have seldom seen anyone so afflicted those who fly highest fall hardest bedwyr observed shaking his head slowly not that i know anything about it he paused growing pensive i can almost envy him seventeen that evening at table i watched for llenlleawg and morgaws but neither of them appeared i thought this highly suggestive but if anyone else noticed their absence i heard nothing about it then again neither did arthur or gwenhwyvar join us for supper and no one thought ill of that why would they the king and queen often took their supper in each others company and that is only right still i determined that a word with myrddin would probably not go amiss also i wanted to ask him what he thought about arthurs shrinebuilding venture and now there was the grail fellowship to discuss making quick work of my meal i took myself off to find the emrys a chore far easier said than done for it is a commonplace that myrddin is seldom to be located where one first thinks to search his errands are many and as varied as they are obscure one moment he is at the pendragons side the next he is away to caer edyn in the north or sailing back from lerna visiting this lord or that one consulting bishops and abbots testing the wind for portents delving into druid lore and who knows what else besides consequently it was not until very much later that i was able to find the everelusive myrddin a little sudden this fellowship is it not i said coming upon him as he poled the small boat to the shore he had been fishing on the lake below the tor a pastime much favoured from his childhood i believe is it myrddin wondered walk with me gwalchavad taking me by the arm he steered me onto the narrow lakeside path night was seeping into the still quiet evening the sky was fading gold and the first of the stars were already alight i think it sudden i replied whenever was there ever a better time he asked stooping to pluck a reed from the bank must goodness stand forever in the shadows waiting for her opportunity to shine heaven forbid i answered yet it seems to me that no sooner have we made peace with the saecsen than we are forced to fight the vandali and if that were not enough we must also face a season of drought and plague which drives our people to abandon their homes and quit these shores for foreign lands i had thought we had enough to occupy ourselves without the words eluded me without all this i waved my hand vaguely in the area of the tor to signify what had taken place there myrddin regarded me with his keen golden eyes for a long moment when he spoke at last he said you speak my thoughts exactly truly does that surprise you i confessed that it did and said but you are his wise counsellor our king has a mind of his own or have you never noticed yes but he is impatient myrddin retorted before i could finish he is impetuous and stubborn i tried to tell him wait just a little arthur i said we have come so far the quest is nearly at an end it would be wrong to force our way now will he listen no he will not the summer realm is aborning myrddin says arthur we cannot hold it back the world has waited long enough it would be a sin to withhold that which can do so much good and so it is as you have seen myrddin concluded he rushes from one thing to another full of holy zeal and heavenly ambition and no one can tell him anything for he will not hear much less heed what of elfodd i asked the king seems to have more than enough time for the good bishop perhaps elfodd might prevail save your breath myrddin interrupted elfodd is just as bad as arthur after arthurs healing the bishop is convinced that the kingdom of heaven is at hand and that the high king is gods instrument for establishing it here and now it is hopeless the two of them goad each other and gwenhwyvar might the queen find a way to persuade her husband to reason myrddin sighed wearily ah she might if it were not that she had seen her husband lying at deaths gate in this very place not so very long ago gwenhwyvar is only too pleased to have arthur hale and whole once more so in her eyes at least this overzealous arthur is preferable to the other no she cannot bring herself to reproach him well it was no worse than i suspected arthur miraculously healed and delivered of his enemies for once and all was suddenly ablaze with virtue and good works where was the harm who was to say he was wrong might not arthur the one to whom the miracle had happened possess a keener insight might not the one who had seen the vision be best able to describe it i thought the summer realm was earth and stars to you myrddin i said as we resumed our walk i thought you wanted it above all else swift as a hawk swooping from the sky the emrys fell upon my remark i do i do he exclaimed no one knows how much i crave it nor what its advent has cost me truly gwalchavad i desire it more than my life myrddin said growing solemn but not like this i waited for him to continue and he did after biting the tender end off the reed and sucking the juice the kingdom of summer is near gwalchavad nearer now than ever of that you can be certain but it will not be compelled if we try to force it i fear we can only do great violence to it and to ourselves we have a chance now a chance that may never come again and my best instinct tells me we must proceed with all caution it does seem the soundest course i concurred ah but what if i am wrong myrddin murmured and i heard the anguish in his voice what if i am wrong and arthur is right what if gods hand is on him to accomplish this great and glorious feat to oppose it even by so much as the merest hesitation would be to hinder god himself i ask myself does god now perform his works in this worldsrealm only with myrddins permission i let the question hang myrddin continued slashing the air with the reed in his hand can it be that i who have laboured so long to advance the summer kingdom cannot recognize it now that it is upon me is it possible that it is gods good pleasure to reward his faithful servants even before they have completed their labour i did not know what he meant by this last statement but before i could ask him he declared there is one certainty or none at all if this thing flows from god nothing can stand against it and if it is not of god then it cannot stand he concluded simply flinging the reed into the lake wise is myrddin and keen of insight he had not only discerned the heart of my own feelings and perceived my objections but offered lucid consolation as well moving to the matter uppermost in my mind i said have you discovered anything more about morgaws only that she is a noblewoman of caer uintan he replied his face hard in the dusky light or so it is said i could almost hear the gates slamming shut to keep me out why ignoring his reluctance i pressed on regardless llenlleawg seems to have reversed his opinion of her i observed before she disappeared he could not abide her now that she has returned he cannot bear to have morgaws out of his sight yes it is all very strange agreed myrddin is that all you have to say you seemed more than concerned before was i that was all he said but i suddenly felt foolish for having involved myself in matters that did not concern me after all if there was anything amiss the wise emrys would know ever alert to the subtle shiftings of power and the hidden meanings of events myrddin would know well i conceded no doubt i was overhasty in my judgment she has done no harm nodding myrddin resumed walking turning back the way we had come the palace atop the tor was black against the pale purple sky watch and pray gwalchavad myrddin said absently watch and pray he returned to the tor then leaving me to my thoughts it came into my mind to visit the shrine the old shrine where the tin merchant joseph erected the first church in the island of the mighty and where the grail was first seen in this worldsrealm no more than a hut made of sticks and mud it stands on the place of that first small church on the hill above the lake the good brothers of the abbey often say prayers in the shrine and i wondered if i should meet any of them but as i approached i saw that i had the place to myself which is how i much preferred it see now i am faithful in my own way it is not that i dislike the good brothers god knows but i have not their learning and i always feel a pagan whenever i encounter monks at prayer the brothers are not to blame for this i own the fault right readily perhaps the purity of their example shames me such virtue and devotion as they demonstrate is to be lauded but i am not cut of that cloth my days are spent on the back of a horse with a shield on my shoulder and a spear in my hand so be it the shrine was black against the fading sky and i stood for a moment just looking at its looming shape and feeling the immense age of the place slowly and with mindful reverence i mounted the slope of the hill and went inside the shrine it is a simple bare room large enough perhaps for three or four but no more a single narrow window opens above the altar made of three shaped slabs of stone there was a candle on the altar but it was not lit and the interior of the shrine was dark as a cave dark it might have been but i was aware only of an immense and restful peace which seemed to fill the tiny chapel with a serenity as deep and wide as the sea entering i knelt and closed my eyes plunging myself into this ocean of calm the irresistible tide pulled me down and down and down into its fathomless depths i did not pray that is i said no words aloud but allowed my mind to drift along on the deepflowing current of peace if i had any thought at all it was merely to bathe myself for a while in the calm of all calms and perhaps touch for a moment the source of all serenity perhaps this is prayer by a different name i do not know neither can i say how long i remained like this time was swallowed in eternity i think for it seemed to me that i had inhabited the shrine for a lifetime of lifetimes in all that time knowing nothing of earthly strife and clamour knowing nothing of desire or striving knowing nothing but blissful contentment and the desire that i might abide like this forever to stay just as i am i thought would be joy surpassing all pleasures i held that thought in my mind clung to it and clinging cried out in my heart of hearts great king cast me not aside the cry arose unbidden but i knew it as my own for i had uttered my deepest fear nor was the reply long in coming for all at once my hands and face began to tingle with an exquisite sensation and i imagined beams of light or flames dancing over my flesh i was immersed not in water but in living light the notion grew so strong in me that i opened my eyes and saw the shrine awash in a pale golden luminescence shifting and shimmering over the interior walls like the reflection of light on water another time i might have been amazed at this wonder but not now in my present mind it seemed wholly natural and expected that this should be the only curiosity was that the dancing light had no point of origin it simply shone of itself and was everywhere manifest gilding the rudebuilt shrine with glimmering gold ah but to see it gleam and shine was pure delight and i was seized by an inexpressible rapture my heart soared and i felt as if i were a child once more enfolded by a bliss which surpassed all understanding and then and then a miracle the light intensified its radiance growing bold and sharp taking substance as it were and i felt a warmth steal over me like that which arises when the sun breaks through the concealing cloud and all the earth warms of an instant beneath the allpervading strength of its rays at the same time i heard the sound of silver bells hung from the branch of a tree for the wind to strike one against another the sound was the light and the light was the sound i understood that they were both but emanations of a thing i had not yet perceived the sound like the light grew and hardened too and when i thought all the world must hear the ringing of the unseen bells a word formed i heard it as a word breathed not spoken a resonant word which seemed as much a part of me as my very bones behold i searched within myself what this command might signify but i saw nothing save the bare stone altar and then even as my eye lit upon the stone it began to gleam with a golden sheen the rough stone gilded by the light the bellsong quickened and i heard again the breathless command behold even as i looked it seemed as if something like scales fell from my eyes and i saw radiant upon the altar the grail eighteen the grail my breath caught in my throat i stared at the sacred object ablaze with the fiery light of glory the intensity of its radiance burned my face it felt as if my eyes were coals of fire i held my breath for fear of singeing my lungs should i dare inhale the searing air blood pounded in my ears with a roar like that of the ocean beyond the throbbing pulse in my ears was a sound like that of a harp pouring out a heavenly sound the incomparable melody falling like holy rain from heaven transfixed by the beauty of the blessed cup i made to raise my hand to shield my eyes but could not lift so much as a finger neither could i look away the grail filled my vision was all my vision i began to see as i have never seen before i saw the path of my life stretching out before me and it went on forever i thought within myself to follow the path to discover where it might lead next and suddenly i felt a presence with me in the shrine a mighty force towering in the strength of its vitality majestic in its power like a storm at sea where gales blow and great waves clash oh the weight of it the weight it was as if a mountain had shifted and settled upon my pitiable frame and i was being crushed out of existence i could not endure i knew my last living moment had come my poor heart laboured in my chest faltered and then stopped i closed my eyes mercy i cried inwardly mercy lord these words had but fled my mind when the weight vanished my heart began beating and i could breathe once more cool air like a soothing balm rushed into my lungs and i drew it deep almost choking on it no longer gripped by the power that had held me i fell on my face before the altar my chest ached my limbs quivered i lay gasping like a fish flung from the water but oh the air revived me wonderfully well for it tasted as sweet on my tongue as the richest mead the delicious scent filled my head and mouth and i gulped it down in great greedy draughts feeling as if i had never drawn breath before when i at last raised my head i was dizzy with the fragrant intoxication of the air the grail had gone as i knew but the shrine still held a glimmer of the heavenly radiance of the sacred vessel though that even as i watched faded quickly away leaving the room in darkness once more i lay for a time placid unmoving my spirit at ease with the stillness of the night and when at last i heard as a summons from another realm the abbey bell toll the midnight prayer i rose unsteadily to my feet at the doorway i paused and looked back hoping i think for a last fleeting glimpse of the holy object but the altar was bare stone hard and cold the grail had moved on i did not return to the tor that night but remained on the hillside near the shrine wakeful and curiously agitated i could not hold a thought in my head for a single moment before it slipped my grasp and flew away try as i might my thoughts scattered far and wide like birds afrighted from the field now and then one of them would return to roost i must tell someone i would think and then flit it would vanish and another would take its place i have seen it i have seen the grail in this way the night passed at last as the sun rose above the line of treetopped hills to the east i rose too and made my way back to the fisher kings hall the inner yard was already stirring as the cymbrogi made ready to go out to their days labour at the shrine i entered the yard to the open stares of those who were preparing to leave most of those gaping at me smiled some laughed outright and i wondered what they thought amusing was it that i had as they imagined lost my way in the dark and was forced to spend the night outside or did they believe me to have slept in a serving maids bed ignoring their derisive smirks i proceeded to the hall and was met while crossing the yard by bedwyr and cai as they came to see the work party away good day to you brother said bedwyr then looking at me more carefully added though it appears you have had the best of the day already cai was more direct man next time get yourself beneath a bush to nap he advised and they both walked off shaking their heads and laughing i stared after them the inexplicable behaviour of everyone around me was rapidly sapping my lingering tranquillity i could feel my pleasant peaceful mood melting away like dew before the midday sun i vowed to myself that the next person to make jest of me would answer for it as it happened the next person was arthur the king came bolting out the doorway as i stood watching cai and bedwyr he slapped me on the back and said greetings brother i have missed you these past days i am going to the shrine ride with me nothing would please me more i said took two steps with him and remembered that i must attend the council instead forgive me arthur i am forgetting myself i said and explained that owing to my duty to the council i could not accompany him ah well tomorrow then he said then stopped abruptly and looked me in the face the fellowship is important gwalchavad it will soon take on an eminence of the highest order wherever men hear of the grail fellowship their hearts will burn within them it will become a beacon fire and all britain will be illumined by the blaze he smiled suddenly speaking of fires it seems you have stood too near the flame my friend farewell bewildered and annoyed by my baffling reception i proceeded into the hall in search of bread and a little ale the cymbrogi had broken fast but there was plenty of their leavings to make a meal so i gathered a bit of this and that onto a platter and settled on one of the benches to eat in peace and to see if i might recover my former good cheer i took up one of the small loaves tore it and began to eat only then remembering that i had missed my supper last night and was famished i was washing down the bread when i saw myrddin sweep past the entrance to the hall hurrying as he was i had time but to shout his name as i leapt to my feet and started for the door thinking to catch him before he vanished again but before i had taken half a dozen paces he reappeared at the doorway i have been searching for you he said hastening to meet me they told me you did not return from our walk last night and i thought he broke off staring at me as he stepped nearer then his golden eyes widened and his face assumed an expression of knowing wonder what i asked suddenly reminded of my curious treatment at the hands of my comrades will no one tell me what is the matter you have seen it observed myrddin sagely you have seen the grail i seized him by the arm and drew him further into the hall as if to keep the secret from being overheard what makes you think that your face he replied raising a hand to my chin and turning my head to the side you have the look of someone who fell asleep in the sun your skin is red red sunburnt he said only you and i both know there was no secret rising of the sun last night sunburnt i said but i touched my fingertips lightly to my face the skin was as dry with tiny raised bumps like sun blisters but there was no pain or discomfort and the flesh felt cool to the touch nevertheless i believed him as you did not return to the tor i surmise that you spent the night at the old shrine the wise emrys explained that is where i first saw the grail reluctant still to demean the radiant vision with poor words i replied i cannot rightly say what i saw he smiled knowingly there is no need gwalchavad i have seen it too remember but why me myrddin i asked i am not the most devout of men far from it there are better christians than me and a good many hereabouts why me and not one of them god knows he answered at my disapproving frown he said that is to say the spirit moves where it will and no man may make bold to let or hinder but i thought the grail was real a real cup that is what i saw was i faltered what had i seen oh it is very much a real cup myrddin assured me quickly but the hallows of this world the holy and sacred objects given to us for our blessing and edification are never limited to mere physical manifestation at my confused and baffled expression the wise emrys went on to explain the grail is no ordinary material object a cup of bronze or silver as you suppose although it is that it is also a spiritual entity with a spiritual existence a hallow is that what you called it indeed what you saw last night in the shrine was the hallow that is the spiritual manifestation of the grail a vision of the real cup if you like myrddin allowed but one is no less real as you say than the other i saw the hallow then but what does it mean he shrugged i have no idea but it must be a sign i insisted it must betoken something something important god alone knows the why and wherefore that is no answer i growled then ask god for another myrddin made to move off but i followed him with my questions what am i to do myrddin watch and pray he advised repeating his homily of the day before is that all i demanded losing patience with his irksome reticence i suppose i should have known better than to demand of a bard the meaning of a vision they delight in posing riddles but answers interest them not in the least what more would you have me say perhaps you could tell me this at least i said why were you looking for me when i learned you had not returned to the tor i feared for you you thought that what happened to llenlleawg might have befallen me it was in my mind myrddin allowed but said no more a moment later bedwyr and cai returned to the hall saw us talking and joined us the emrys greeted them and said you must be about your business come to me when you have finished if you like he left then and we took our places at one of the tables to wait for the others and i finished my meal to my relief neither cador nor llenlleawg mentioned my reddened skin and we began our deliberations where we had abandoned them the day before we talked throughout the day and with better resolve no one i think wanted to spend a third day grappling with the others over fine points of custom and ceremony accordingly we all agreed with cais observation of the previous day that yes the grail was a rare treasure requiring protection therefore the first rule of the grail fellowship would be to protect the shrine wherein the holy vessel was contained the five of us arthurs battlechiefs that is would choose the guards from among the members of the fellowship further in order to ensure proper reverence and vigilance each member of the fellowship would be required to swear sacred oaths of loyalty and allegiance not only to arthur lord of the summer realm but also to the lord christ whose cup it was our sworn duty to protect that much was easy to agree upon which we promptly did and then our swift forward march quickly bogged down in the mire of minutia questions arose which we had not anticipated and for which once raised answers must be found what for example if a member of the fellowship should disobey his duty or fall into disgrace how should the remedy be determined should there be orders of rank among the members of the fellowship if so how should these be comprised all these and more beset us and for each one we answered two more sprang up to take its place thus the day passed and i began to fear we would be at our task forever when bedwyr who observed what was happening suggested a compromise that we begin with what we had agreed upon but retain the right to amend or add rules to the ordering of the fellowship whenever the need arose by this time tempers were frayed and it felt as if we had been treading on eggs all day long we were fairly panting for a cool drink and cador went off to fetch it no sooner had he gone than llenlleawg having grown increasingly peevish as the day wore on pushed himself to his feet and declared that he was not so thirsty that he could not wait until supper if we have finished he said curtly i will beg to be excused further discussions a matter awaits my attention elsewhere yes go by all means bedwyr told him we have finished god willing unless you have any objection i will inform arthur that our deliberations have borne fruit and that we have reached an end for the time being the tall irishman inclined his head in assent and took his leave at once he could not wait to get free of us bedwyr observed it is not like him to be so hasty especially with ale in the offing cai added meaningfully no doubt the cut and thrust of a blade is more suited to his nature i allowed this wordful striving is tedious it makes my head ache aye agreed cai it does that he thought for a moment then added i say we should ride out to the new shrine and take word to arthur after sitting in this hall the whole day i could use a breath of fresh air after the ale amended bedwyr oh aye after the ale replied cai surprised that there should be any question about that i am for it i said consequently when cador returned bearing the jug and cups himself we all hailed him a hero drank up and raced out to join the work party at the shrine nothing much had changed since the last time i visited the site a few more stones had been placed along the line of the circular wall and additional timbers erected the heap of stone was somewhat larger but that was all despite the many eager hands available for all the cymbrogi were employed the work is going well arthur said happily dragging his forearm across his sweating brow we found him standing atop the hill bare to the waist and covered in rock dust the sweat made little muddy rivulets where it had trickled down his back and sides indeed far better than i hoped i think we will be able to hold the rites of consecration at the christ mass look at you bear bedwyr commented grey as a ghost and filthy with dust have you been rolling in the stuff that the pendragon of britain should be toiling in the dirt did not surprise me in the least arthur was so eager for the grail to be enshrined so that the summer realm might commence in full i think he would have moved whole mountains with his bare hands if that would have helped we all agreed that if the work continued at pace the shrine would certainly be finished in time to mark the turning year now then have you anything to show for your labours the king asked we have indeed lord bedwyr replied and began relating all we had discussed and the decisions we had reached we each took it in turn to supplement bedwyrs admirably succinct if somewhat flatfooted report with comments of our own arthur listened nodding from time to time and when bedwyr had finished declared himself well pleased with the result it is just as i hoped he said his smile quick and warm with approval you have done your king good service as he turned his gaze towards the heap of stone and timber i saw the light come up in his eyes and he said guardians of the grail i am pleased facing us once more he added to you is granted the highest honour of a warrior in this worldsrealm so be it over the next days a few embellishments were added to the ordering of the fellowship but the basic structure we had erected remained intact the cymbrogi expressed enthusiastic support of the fellowship and as the work on the shrine slowly proceeded so their zeal increased it seemed their ardour like the kings knew no bounds with the passing days something akin to religious fervour took hold of all who laboured on the new shrine it seemed as if faith raised the circle of stone indeed curious happenings became commonplace a heavy stone slipped and fell onto a mans hand as he tried to lift it onto the wall but instead of his fingers being crushed he received not so much as a pinch or scratch two workers using nothing but their bare hands stopped a wagon laden with rubble from rolling downhill when the wagon hitch broke it had taken two oxen to pull the wagon in the first place another man who had worked himself into such a frenzy that his hands became blistered had his blisters healed overnight while he slept so that he was able to renew his exertions the next morning there were several minor accidents as well mind a fully laden horse stepped on the foot of one poor fellow and crushed two toes which then had to be cut off another unfortunate slipped in the mud and hit his head against one of the lower steps he bled like a stuck pig from an ugly gash and had to have his hair shaved off in order to dress the wound neither of these nor one or two others were blessed with any miraculous cures however and instead had to be carried to the abbey for the monks to tend once out of sight the afflicted were swiftly forgotten in the general excitement thus the small miracles loomed larger than perhaps they ought which served to heighten the euphoria bishop elfodd said that the miracles were signs heralding the dawn of a peace to last a thousand years once the grail shrine was consecrated he said the age of peace would begin and all britain would be blessed with signs and wonders strange to say then that as the elation of those around me waxed the greater my own fervour waned perverse creature that i am the intense almost ecstatic jubilation of my comrades combined with my own sinful pride to produce the opposite reaction in me i quickly came to view both the shrine and the fellowship with distaste what i once held in kindly favour became offensive to me i could not bear to look at the shrine without shrinking from it the very mention of the grail fellowship put my teeth on edge well the fault is mine i own it and confess it freely so that you will know what manner of man i am see now i do not shrink from the truth even when it tells against me indeed though it brings me no pleasure i write this so all may believe me when i relate the horror of what is to follow nineteen in llyonesse i learned my an annubi possessed a great store of wisdom all of which i devoured and in that way devoured him but in the dark islands i practised it orcady provided the solitude i required and also the resources of a wealthy and powerful husband to protect and indulge me while i perfected my craft poor lot knew little of my labours because i allowed him to see very little only enough so that he would respect my long seclusions his headstrong son despised me but his grandsons gwakmai and gwalchavad might have proved valuable to me ardent men have their uses after all and i could easily have bent them to my purposes but they had forsaken their birthright to follow that oxbrained arthur so i persuaded the old king to give me a son of my own a child i could train to my will who would rule the realm after his father i might have reigned in orcady myself but i have greater ambitions and was already laying my designs for merlin once i offered him the choice of joining me united we would have created a force more powerful than any since atlantis was destroyed but the selfrighteous idiot had the temerity to spurn me he styles himself a bard like his father and holds to the ancient bardic ideals that and the pathetic notion of his which he dignifies with the name the kingdom of summer since merlin would not join me he must be destroyed i had through various means watched his progress and knew that he had acquired a rough an of his own which if allowed to thrive might cause me trouble i had paid dearly for that which i possessed great power comes at great cost and i could not easily afford to let anyone interfere in my plans so i lured him to llyonesse where i could more easily control the confrontation killing him would have been childs play of course and looking back on it now i know that is what i should have done what i wanted however was not only to strip him of his power but to do it so completely and absolutely that he would abandon every hope and ambition he had ever had for his ridiculous summer realm i misjudged him however he was more canny than i expected the encounter went against me and i was forced to break off the attack merlin imagines that he bested me moreover he believes my power was broken in that however he is desperately mistaken when i saw i could not win the encounter outright i abandoned the attempt in order to preserve the power i had laboured so long to gain in truth i permitted the little weasel to escape or he would have been crushed and annihilated just like the smarmy lickspit pelleas i destroyed him just for spite and to show merlin just how fortunate he was to escape yes i allowed merlin to slip away that time but he will not elude me again he has made it his lifes labour to raise the oafish arthur to prominence it will be a singular pleasure to wipe out that work to obliterate the both of them in fact it is better this way the sight of them squirming in their death throes is a sight i will relish forever oh they will die in disgrace with curses between their teeth that is inevitable inescapable they will die in shame and despair but not before they have seen everything they valued laid waste this i have promised myself it will be morgaws is now in place she has beguiled the entire court in one way or another and she has chosen the one who will become the agent of betrayal rhys i thought would have served us admirably in this indeed we tried to seduce him but met with unaccountable resistance nevertheless his influence has been abrogated he will not trouble us gwakhavad too might have provided a pleasantly ironic choice but i knew he would be difficult we will keep trying of course but whether we win him or not makes no real difference others have been corrupted to the cause and only await the command to strike that command will not be long in coming only one or two details remain and then the destruction will commence the day of morgians revenge is at hand behold all you people your doom swiftly approaches weep with black despair for there is no escape the seasons passed harvest came and went a dismal business best forgotten the long dry summer had done its worst there was nothing for it but to trust winter rains to bring a better spring though we looked to every grey cloud that drifted overhead the rain did not come the lack of rain meant however that the work on the new shrine could continue without interruption and people began to look upon its completion as the salvation of the land when the grail shrine is finished became the litany which began every conversation as people turned hopefully to a brighter future each day the pendragon and cymbrogi rode out to their labours and each night returned delirious with exhaustion and companionship accordingly the day of completion hastened by favourable weather and the unquenchable ardour of the cymbrogi labourers arrived far sooner than expected though i did no work myself i often rode out to watch as the builders seized with the fervour of creation vied to outdo one another in the quality of their work and despite my inexplicable aversion i will say that it grew into a fine and handsome place sixsided with neat straight walls rising from a tiered base and topped by a steeppeaked roof of wood covered with red roman tile god knows where they got that and a series of curved steps it was not large but arthur allowed that it was after all only a beginning in time the shrine could be expanded or attached to a much larger structure which he had in mind but this will do for now he declared well pleased with the result as the turning of the year approached arthur began making plans for the grail shrines consecration he called for messengers to summon those he wished to attend the august event i volunteered at once since the errand provided me a welcome escape from what i had begun to think of as the delirium which had overtaken almost everyone i say almost because there were others like myself who regarded the absurd euphoria with increasing suspicion myrddin as ever pleased to garner whatever he could of the builders craft would speak no word against the shrine or the grail but his praise was ever guarded and he held himself aloof from any talk of miracles or thousandyear reigns of peace and such likewise bedwyr who always seemed to find one important concern or another to occupy him know he often fished with avallach llenlleawg i believe never so much as rode out to the site it was whispered that lady morgaws demanded his constant attention cai helped often however and cador only now and then as it pleased him thus bedwyr cador and i along with a score of cymbrogi rode out one cool bright morning to our various destinations far and wide throughout the realm and beyond i was sent to londinium to bring back charis who yet laboured there in one of the plague camps before leaving i asked llenlleawg if he would ride with me for all he appeared so haggard and ill at ease that i reckoned a little sojourn away from the overheated mood of the tor would be no bad thing but he declined no he said my place is here with arthur of course i replied lightly no one doubts it but arthur himself has commanded me to go and escort charis home then go it is nothing to do with me i watched him as he stumped away and could not help thinking that he was no longer the man i knew i resolved to bring the matter to myrddins attention at the first opportunity when i returned be that as it may it was with a sense of relief that i left the tor relief that i might be quit of the tedium and hypocrisy of maintaining a pretence of support when my heart was not in it taking an extra horse i departed pausing at the abbey to inquire where i could find paulus some of the brothers had just returned from a long stint away in the south just outside caer lundein where paulus had established a camp off the old roman road charis was there along with a good many monks from neighbouring monasteries helping to combat the yellow death it has ravaged londinium terribly one of the brothers told me i believe it is far worse there than it ever was here paulinus is easy to find and you will not have to enter the city perhaps you would not object suggested elfodd to taking a few supplies to them the need is great and it is the least we can do would you mind not at all i assured him and then watched as the good the seasons passed harvest came and went a dismal business best

need is great and it is the least we can do would you mind not at all i assured him and then watched as the good monks piled bundle after bundle upon the horses supplies for making medicine cloaks and winter clothing for the brethren dried meat and casks of ale and mead to help their fellows celebrate the christ mass which was drawing near when they finished at last i took my leave and made for the londinium road i thought it a long time since i had been on that highway the last time was for arthurs crowntaking and wedding so much had happened since then it seemed a lifetime ago perhaps it is as myrddin says time is not the passage of an endless succession of moments but the distance between events that was nonsense to me when i first heard it now looking back i think i begin to know what he meant the swiftest way to the londinium road lies through a stretch of forest an old old trackway used from ages beyond remembering the forest is older still of course and there are yet many of the great patriarchal trees to be seen elms on which moss has grown so thick that they appear greygreen with age and oaks with trunks large as houses the forest fringe where light still penetrates to the ground evokes no fear but when men must go into the dark heart of the ancient wood they go in haste passing through as quickly as possible this i did hunkering down in the saddle with one of the wise emrys saining runes on my lips as i rode i said be the cloak of michael militant about me be the cloak of the archangel over me christs cloak blessed saviour safeguarding me gods cloak of grace and strength shielding me to guard me at my back to preserve me from the front and from the crown of my head to the heel of my foot the cloak of heavens high king between me and all things that wish me ill and all things that wish me harm and all things coming darkly towards me in this way i passed through the darkest part of the forest after a while the path lightened ahead of me and i knew that i was reaching the end i emerged from the wood at a gallop and gained the hills above the road where i paused to look back at the tors bluemisted shape in the distance i rode until nightfall whereupon i made camp and spent the first of several mild nights under the winter stars the journey remained uneventful and four days later through the murky brown haze of evening smoke as if the plague were a visible cloud under which the city suffered i glimpsed londinium cowering behind its high walls those walls erected long before constantine was emperor were collapsed in several places and falling down it was amidst the rubble of one such breach outside the northern gate that brother paulus camp had been established rather than trust to the hospitality of that plagueridden city i happily made camp beside the road and waited until the next morning to proceed any farther and anyway the gates were already closed for the night at dawn the gates opened and people emerged bringing the plague victims with them some they carried some they dragged i resumed the saddle and as i drew near the odour of the place reached me a foul stench of sickness rot and death that made the gorge rise in my throat i swallowed hard crossed myself and rode on a pall of smoke rose from a great refuse heap to hang like a filthy rag over the camp and i saw what appeared to be bundles of castoff clothes scattered in their hundreds all around closer i discovered that these were not bundles but bodies i tethered the horses on a patch of withered grass a short distance away and approached on foot picking my way carefully among the yellow ravagers victims there were so many everywhere i looked i saw more and still more i believe the numbers shocked me more than the sight and smell which were both appalling i gazed in dismay at the scattered bodies of men women and children in their hundreds mind and more being brought out through the gates many if not most to be dumped beside the road like so much refuse discarded and forgotten those who had given up the fight lay still and silent but those in whom life yet warred cried in their torment moaning and mewing as they twitched and writhed the groans of these unfortunates filled the air with a low queasy keen their faces were spotted and distorted their eyes red their sores pusfilled and running they vomited and defecated and bled over themselves and lay rotting in their own filth i had not witnessed the devastation of the yellow ravager before yet judging by what i saw around me i knew it was well named the poor wretches mewing and crying in their throes were uniformly cast in a lurid shade of yellow as if their flesh had been tinted by noxious dye and wrung out while wet their skin was bloated and vile mucus ran from nose and eyes to choke them they sweated and panted as if being consumed from within by fire many reached out their hands to me crying for help for release but i could do nothing for them i knew the plague had worsened in the south i had heard the bleak tidings like everyone else but had no idea it was this bad if it did not end soon i reckoned there would be no one left in londinium to even bury the victims let alone care for them oppression hung over the camp like the nasty smoke from the smutty little fires that had been lit here and there to burn the plague sufferers clothing this served to heighten the feeling of gloom and foreboding and misery into a sensation so palpable that i could almost see death hovering over the camp black wings outspread gliding slow i also saw scores of monks at work among the plague victims for the church had shouldered the burden of caring for the diseased and dying these stalwart clerics carried water to the fevered and warm cloaks to the shivering they prayed with the distressed and comforted the dying and though they strove valiantly against an insidiously powerful adversary their struggle was in vain there were far too few of them to sway the course of battle the cause so far as i could see was lost yet they fought on the good brothers had used the rubble stone of the fallen wall behind them to erect hundreds of small enclosures over which cloth and skins were placed to form hovels in which the more curable of the sick might lie need had far outstripped the monks kindly provision however and they had begun laying the plaguestruck toetotoe rank upon rank in endless rows beneath the crumbling wall meanwhile the busy brothers hastened among the sprawled bodies on urgent errands i caught one brownrobed cleric and asked of him where i might find brother paulus the monk pointed to a tent beside the wall not far from the gate and i made directly for the place once when stepping over a body of one i thought a corpse i felt a hand reach out and snatch hold of my foot a pitiful voice cried please revulsion swept over me i jerked my foot free please the wretch moaned again i thirst i thirst ashamed of my harsh reaction i glanced around to see where i might find some water to give the poor fellow and saw a monk carrying two flasks i ran to the brother told him i had need of the jar and returned to the man on the ground then knelt beside him put my hand beneath his head and raised him up a little to drink his hair was wet and his skin damp and cold his rheumy eyes fluttered in his head when i put the jar to his lips i watched in horror as a black tongue darted out to lap at the water bless you he whispered his breath sighing out between his teeth drink i urged take a little more it was only after entreating him a second time that i realized i was clutching a corpse i put aside the jar lowered his head to the ground and stood wiping my hands on the ground hardening my heart i walked on ignoring the pleas of those i passed god help me i walked on lest through their defiling touch i should become like them what if arthur is right i thought and the most holy grail can end this suffering what if it could bring about the miracle arthur believes then he must try anyone with half a heart would try indeed the king would have to be either a coldhearted fiend or insane not to attempt anything that held out even the slightest hope for healing his people certainly a king of arthurs stamp must do everything in his power to bring this healing about these things i thought and began at last to understand arthurs obsession with the shrine i regretted my doubt and mistrust and repented of my disbelief who was i an ignorant warrior to question the things of god thus as i walked along i found myself praying great light let arthur be right hasten the completion of the shrine and let the grail do its work let the grail do its saving work merciful lord and let the healing begin i reached the tent and ducked gratefully inside where i found paulus hunched over a low table pouring his healing potion from a large jar into smaller vessels for distribution to the afflicted brother paulus i said and he looked up recognized me and smiled it was the tired forlorn smile of an exhausted man his hair was lank and his eyes were sunken his flesh had the wan pallid look of a person too long confined god be praised it is gwalchavad he said genuinely pleased to see me greetings he took two steps towards me then caught himself you should not be here he warned tell me quickly what you have to say and then leave taking him at his word i said greetings paulus i bring supplies and provisions from your fellow monks i also bring word that lady chads is required at the tor the pendragon has sent me to fetch her if you will tell me where she may be found trust that we will depart as soon as the horses are unburdened that would be best the haggard monk agreed replacing the jar and drawing his sleeve across his damp forehead come i will show you please i would not disturb you just tell me where she is and i will find her myself the dutiful monk waved aside my offer it will be quicker to show you he insisted he led me out along the wall passing the burning refuse heap on the way where i saw to my horror that it was in fact an immense pit which had been dug in the earth filled with logs and set alight to burn the dead by twos and threes the corpses were thrown onto the sputtering heap the smoke stank and the corpses sizzled down in the lower depths of the pit black grinning skulls nestled among the red embers i turned my face held my breath and hurried by i am sorry paulus said calling over his shoulder we have no other choice the plague is far worse in the city where people live close together that makes it more virulent i think everything is worse in the city i concurred then inhaled some of the stinking smoke and was overcome by a fit of coughing paulus led me past the pit and along the wall to another section of the camp and still more hovels and still more bodies lying on the ground but here at least robed monks passed among the plaguestruck bearing jars of healing elixir not all die paulus told me many of these may yet recover those who have that chance are brought here where we can care for them just then a figure emerged from a nearby hovel moved to one of the victims on the ground i saw that it was chads lady of the lake her fair hair bound in a length of cloth and wound around her head her tall elegant form clothed in a simple coarse robe such as the monks around her wore kneeling beside the sufferer a young woman with waxy yellow skin she placed her hand gently on the young womans forehead the stricken woman came awake at the touch and seeing the one who attended her smiled despite the agony of her distress she smiled at chads and i saw the killing plague retreat if only for a moment charis offered her charge a few words of comfort at which the young woman closed her eyes and rested again but more comfortably i think for her features appeared serene as charis rose and continued on her way paulus made to call charis but i stopped him saying please no i will go to her i watched for a while as charis moved among the stricken and suffering here stooping to touch there stopping to offer a word like the monks she carried a jar of the elixir which she gave out pouring a few precious drops of paulus healing draught into the victims bowls and cups then helping the sufferer to drink wherever she went i imagined peace and solace followed a healing presence like a light clearer and finer than sunlight which soothed and calmed easing the pains of disease and death upon reaching the last of her charges charis stood smoothed her robe turned and looked back along the ranks of victims she closed her eyes and stood there for a moment head bowed lips moving slightly then she opened her eyes and glancing up saw me and smiled in greeting in that smile she became the fair folk queen i remembered oh they are a handsome race there is no doubt i saw the light come up in her eyes and the breath caught in my throat i watched as she approached feeling both humble and proud to be accounted worthy to converse with such nobility you have come from arthur i think she said upon joining us i give you good greeting lady chads i replied inclining my head in respect the pendragon has indeed sent me to find you have you come to help us she inquired with a smile or brought supplies perhaps bishop elfodd has sent a fair store of provisions but i have come to escort you back to ynys avallach i see the smile faded instantly and i watched as grey fatigue repossessed her features forgive me i said and explained about the grail shrine and arthurs concern to have it consecrated at the christ mass observance i must have told it poorly for a frown appeared grew and darkened like a shadow of apprehension as she listened so she said with crisp indignation when i had finished arthur deems the building of this shrine more important than the saving of lives what of my son does merlin encourage this enterprise lady i said it is the kings hope that the consecration of the grail shrine will drive both disease and war from our land forever arthur believes it will be the saving of us myrddin as ever aids his king charis regarded me with a keen eye you avoid my question i wonder why forgive me lady charis but the wise emrys does not often vouchsafe his confidences to me but you have eyes do you not you have a mind to question what you see do you think this grail shrine will end plague and war she demanded do you believe it will be the saving of britain my mind whirled searching for a suitable reply i believe i answered slowly that the swift sure hand is upon our king to accomplish many things who am i to say whether the good god should bless arthurs efforts charis relented you are right of course my question was unkind i am sorry gwalchavad she smiled again and again i saw fatigue in her clear eyes like paulus she was on the knifeedge of exhaustion she glanced along the long row of hovels and shook her head you see how it is here i cannot leave she spoke softly as if to herself then turning to me she said at the risk of incurring the kings displeasure i fear you must tell arthur that i cannot attend the ceremony i am needed here paulus stepped forward and laid his hand on her arm you have been summoned by the high king you must go his tone became quietly insistent go now and return to us when you have rested i have brought a horse for you i told her glad to have the monks approval i had seen enough of pestilence and death and was anxious to get away if you are willing we could leave at once charis hesitated go paulus urged gwalchavad is right arthurs new shrine may be just as important in this battle as your presence here he would not have summoned you otherwise very well charis decided to me she said tend to the horses it is best for you not to linger i will join you as soon as i am ready i thanked paulus and asked him where he would like the supplies to be stored just leave them he advised that would be best we can collect them when you have gone i hastened to the horses removing myself from the hateful camp as swiftly as possible i carefully stacked all the bundles and casks in a neat pile and sat down to wait in a little while charis joined me and without a backward glance we were riding for ynys avallach earlier i had marked a stream one of the few i encountered that had not yet dried up completely and stopped there for the night i was heartily glad to have left the plague behind though it was not until i had washed myself head to sole that i felt hale again while i kept watch my companion slept soundly and well grateful i reckon for a respite from her unendurable duties and the next morning we journeyed on the return took a little more time than the outward journey for i chose another trail which kept us well away from the forest having braved the unseen watcher once i saw no need to do so again besides i thought it a reproach to tax the heavenly host with my protection when i could so easily avoid trouble in the first place thus we skirted the forest and arrived at the tor by another way passing within sight of the grail shrine though i had been away only a handful of days i found the site altered beyond recognition gone were the wagons and the heaps of rockbroken stone gone too the ropes and lumber and ranks of workers swarming over a halffinished building in place of all the clutter and activity stood a silent graceful structure of whitewashed stone glistening in the dawn light elegant in its simplicity the master gall had done his work well the shrine appeared to shimmer with an inner radiance the drought heat had long since blasted the surrounding grass to thin withered wisps of palest yellow so that the whole place with hill and shrine included glowed in the early morning with the lustre and radiance of gold we stopped to marvel at the glorious sight in all it was a fitting house for the christs holy cup what is more for the first time since i had heard arthurs plan i thought he was right it is magnificent i thought truly it betokens a new and glorious reign of peace and wellbeing upon our arrival at the tor we were greeted by arthur and gwenhwyvar who appeared in the yard as we dismounted gwenhwyvar and charis embraced one another warmly and arthur stood by beaming his good pleasure out of the corner of my eye i glimpsed the elusive avallach standing beside a pillar arms crossed over his chest since coming to the tor i had rarely seen him most often in the long evening when he was fishing with bedwyr or myrddin and then only from a distance i knew that the fisher king suffered from an incurable malady which often kept him confined to his quarters i assumed that was why we had not seen much of him since our arrival thus i was surprised to see him standing in the shadows nearby he stood for a moment gazing at the tight group before him then stepped out to join it chads he said throwing his arms wide for his daughter his voice boomed like friendly thunder and he hugged his daughter and told her how much he had missed her you are the sun of my happiness he said and now it is summer again have you seen the shrine asked arthur unable to rein in his curiosity any longer i have indeed replied lady charis and pronounced the shrine the work of a master who both knew and respected the object to be protected within it is that affirmed the fisher king somewhat reluctantly i thought arthur charis said are you certain this is the way she gripped arthur by the arm as if to hold him to account as certain as the sun and stars the pendragon replied his gaze as steady as his unwavering grip the summer kingdom is here we stand at the threshold of an age the like of which has never been seen since the beginning of our race the nations will look up in wonder when they hear what we have done the blessing begins here and it will flow throughout all britain and to the ends of the earth people of lands far distant from these will come to witness the miracle britain will be foremost among the nations and our people will be exalted avallach nodded resignation heavy in his eyes arthur reached out and squeezed the fisher kings arm we are so close my friend so very close have faith and watch what god will do arthur spoke with such passion and assurance that it would have been a dead heart indeed not to beat more quickly at his words his zeal was a flame burning away the straw of opposition who could stand against the pendragon when heart and will and mind were united in the pursuit of so lofty a purpose who indeed as we were yet talking others of arthurs court came to greet avallach and welcome the lady of the lake cai and bedwyr first then cador and rhys i looked for llenlleawg but did not see him and it was not until we were all gathered in the hall for our supper that the irishman emerged from hiding the hall was prepared for the lady of the lakes return and avallach had already called for his guests to be seated and we were making way to our places some of us more slowly as we hailed this one or another myrddin and charis arrived and were talking quietly just inside the doorway while others entered the hall it was then i saw llenlleawg appear in the doorway morgaws at his side the two stepped into the hall and moved towards their places at one of the nearer boards as i was slowly making my way to the board myself i had opportunity to mark their entrance and observe what followed see now the emrys his head low and a little forward is speaking earnestly to his mother who listens intently she senses a movement beside her however and glances to the side to see llenlleawg pass by she recognizes him of course for i see it in her eyes as her lips begin a smile a smile that instantly freezes when she also takes in the sight of morgaws it is only the merest glance but the queerest thing happens as if acutely mindful of charis attention the young woman turns her head their eyes meet morgaws falters her foot catching in midstep she lurches sideways as if struck by a spear hurled from across the hall she stumbles her features twisted in pain or rage and i fear she will fall but llenlleawgs hand is at her elbow he steadies her arm and bears her up incredibly morgaws recovers both balance and aplomb in her stride the moment passes in a twinkling and i the only one to have seen it am left to wonder at what i have witnessed the two latecomers turn away and lose themselves in the convivial mingling at the board i look once more to where myrddin and charis stand the emrys is still speaking but his mother is no longer listening instead she stares at the place where morgaws and llenlleawg appeared her expression one of horror the colour drained from her face strange to say but i am put in mind of the first time peredur laid eyes on the woman when we found her in the wood his expression combined the same shock and terror at her appearance sensing that his words are no longer attended myrddin looks up his mothers stark features halt the flow of his words and he touches her arm the lady of the lake quickens at his touch she comes to herself once more as if suddenly starting from a dream sees her son and smiles her hand rising to her face myrddin ever alert turns to see what has so shattered his mothers composure but there is now nothing to see morgaws and her escort have disappeared in the crowd myrddin takes his mother by the arm and walks with her to their places at table with arthur and gwenhwyvar i settled in next to bedwyr and noticed his dark brow furrowed in serious rumination thinking to lighten his sombre mood i said it seems friend llenlleawg has become champion to the mysterious morgaws i wonder if arthur kens this shift of loyalty never have i seen a man wear a more haunted look he is sick with it our llenlleawg i fear what may become of him well no doubt he will recover love seldom proves fatal so i am told bedwyr gave a mirthless scornful chuckle what has something happened while i was away ah he replied his smile as bitter as his tone arthurs shrine races to its completion and we are all deliriously happy of course one of the serving boys appeared just then and placed cups before us bedwyr raised his cup to me and took a deep draught and yet i prodded nudging him with an elbow yet bedwyr continued the pendragon communes with god and the angels and the concerns of earthly mortals are not to be mentioned bedwyrs rueful smile turned sour in short our king stands with his head in the clouds and his feet on the dung heap the odour he imagines is meadowsweet but it smells like manure to me you surprise me brother if anyone can bring the summer kingdom to fruition it is arthur it could happen just as he says bedwyr drank again put aside his cup and said do not mind me gwalchavad i am only mourning the past or maybe i am jealous she is a beautiful young woman is she not he laughed forcing himself to rise above his melancholy yet there was a bitter edge to his voice when he said two days my friend two days and all doubts and suspicions shall be swept away in two days the shrine is consecrated and the grail is established and the kingdom of summer begins i am certain all will be well despite his dubious assurance bedwyrs conviction appeared as shaky as my own but after my harrowing visit to the plague camp i had tried to believe the miracle could take place what if as myrddin had said the swift sure hand was on arthur to bring about the restoring of this worldsrealm who could oppose god twenty dreams of spitting cats and hissing snakes kept me thrashing on my pallet all night i heard strange laughter and awoke to the sound of someone calling my name the warriors quarters were quiet however and as the sun was rising on a new day i thought to banish the nights malignant cast with a cold plunge in the lake i crept from the palace and made my way quickly down the twisting path the mist rising off the lake as the dawnlight struck the surface of the water made it seem as if i descended from the pure heavenly heights to the cloudbound earth below at the lakeside i stripped off my clothes and waded out from the shore some little distance for owing to the drought the level of the water was much lower now gathering courage i dove in and swam quickly to the centre of the lake before i lost my nerve the water was clear and stinging cold but not as cold as it should have been for the season here the christ mass was upon us and winter winds should be howling from the frozen north yet save for a few chill evenings the days though short remained warm as midsummer and dry the warmth nobody complained of but the lack of rain scoured the land to dust ever since i was old enough to walk from my fathers caer down to the waters edge i have loved swimming lot insisted that anyone bred and born on a rock in the sea should be able to swim to save his life so my brother and i learned early and learned well this thought was in my mind as i swam to the centre of the lake took a deep breath and sank down into the cold springfed depths down and down i went the icy water tingling on my skin pricking like ten thousand needles when at last i could stay under no longer i rose to dive again and again trying to go deeper each time the last time i simply bobbed to the surface to float on my back gazing up at the sunstreaked morning sky letting my thoughts drift as idly as the clouds above while i lay floating the sound of someone singing reached me a lightly lilting wordless melody silently without so much as a ripple i sank down into the water and turned my eyes to the bank where i saw a hunched figure hurrying along the lakeside pathway leading to the tor a woman dressed all in black i did not recognize her for a cloud had passed before the sun and her features were hidden by shadow curiously this shadow moved with her covering her so that i could not see who it might be it was then i remembered having heard that same strange song before it had led me a chase the day i found morgaws in the wood the thought had no more flitted through my mind when she stopped halting in midstep much as someone might when hailed from behind by the shout of a friend in the same instant the shadow vanished and i saw that it was indeed morgaws and what i had taken for black was in fact her customary green which i could see so clearly i wondered how i had mistaken it before that aside i thought it odd she should be astir so early in the morning and naturally wondered where she had been she stood stockstill for a long moment and then turned slowly towards the lake something in me urged secrecy so i allowed myself to submerge once more strange to say but as my head sank beneath the water i felt a peculiar warmth where her gaze swept the water it passed in an instant like a wave washing over my head and then all was as it had been before when i surfaced again morgaws was gone i watched for a time and thought i saw her on the tor path just before she entered the palace gate but owing to the brightness of the sunlight i could easily have been mistaken i swam to the bank dried myself and dressed then made haste to find myrddin i had it in mind to tell him what i had seen but by the time i reached the tor i had convinced myself that my concern was mere foolishness what had i seen after all only someone taking an earlymorning walk she sang yes as any young woman might delighting in her own company and the simple splendours of the new day in any event myrddin was occupied with the ordering of the ceremony and would not care to be bothered along with the rest of the dragon flight i spent the day in preparation for the consecration ceremony beginning with a fast we assembled in the hall to learn our duties for the ceremony and to hear how our ranks should be ordered we then attended to our clothing and weapons siarcs and breecs were washed and cloaks brushed swords and spears were burnished and shields were washed white with lime and painted with the cross of the christ that night in place of a meal we gathered in the hall and held vigil led by one of the abbey priests we prayed through the night for the good lords blessing on the new realm then as dawn broke upon the eastern horizon we dressed in our finest clothes and arrayed ourselves as for battle the participants assembled in the yard each one taking his place as we had been instructed arthur and gwenhwyvar first myrddin and charis following with various priests and monks and nobles from the region coming after and behind them the dragon flight and the rest of the cymbrogi walking slowly crosier held high the procession was led out through the gate by bishop elfodd beside him walked lord avallach carrying a fine wooden casket in his hands thus we walked slowly down from the fisher kings palace to the lakeside path two by two upon reaching the lake the monks commenced chanting a psalm softly quietly at first but louder and with more spirit as we went when we passed the monastery its lone bell tolled the plaintive voice ringing out over the countryside calling the world to witness the changing of the age much of that world seemed prepared to take notice for there were many hundreds of people already gathered in the valley awaiting the ceremony the stoneworkers and their families were there of course also i suppose the monks had spread the word throughout the region and many despite the plague or indeed perhaps because of it had come to see the lord of summer begin his reign the grail shrine gleamed like white gold in the morning light the cool stone shimmering and radiant against the fair blue of the sky the procession reached the foot of the hill and stopped whereupon bishop elfodd turned and spoke a prayer we then continued up the hill followed by the crowds which pressed in all around us to see and hear what was taking place and paused at the hilltop for another prayer a third prayer was spoken as the grail was carried around the perimeter and a fourth at the entrance to the shrine at each place avallach accompanied by the bishop presented the casket to the four quarters while the good bishop offered up a prayer together they sained the earth with the presence of the holy object in a loud voice bishop elfodd called for all present to bear witness from this day the ground whereon you stand is holy ground let it here be known and proclaimed throughout all britain that the lord christ has favoured this place and has claimed it for his own henceforth and for all time this place shall be a refuge and sanctuary for any and all who come here and no one shall be turned away nor shall anyone be compelled to leave nor carried away by force thus no one shall prevent another from entering gods peace then myrddin his dignity and noble bearing never greater ascended the steps of the shrine turned to the mass of onlookers and stretched forth his hands if anyone had forgotten that myrddin was once a king the memory was reawakened now i have lived my life in the presence of kings and noblemen and i saw a king now lordly in manner and mien tall and erect his head high his expression grave and proud his golden eyes ablaze with the light of righteousness myrddin gazed out over the upturned faces of the throng and silence descended over the hill as all upon it strained forward to hear what he would say my people he cried in a loud voice this is a day like no other in the long history of our race he paused and i felt the air quicken around me with anticipation the crowd as a solitary creature keen with yearning held its breath rejoice the emrys shouted suddenly and i swear i heard his shout echoing across the surrounding hills like thunder rejoice he cried again lifting his hands high for this day begins the kingdom of summer may it endure forever listen hear the words of the chief bard of britain taliesin ap elphin ap gwyddno garanhir there is a land shining with goodness where each man protects his brothers dignity as readily as his own where war and want have ceased and all races live under the same law of love and honour it is a land bright with truth where a mans word is his pledge and falsehood is banished where children sleep safely in their mothers arms and never know fear or pain it is a land where kings extend their hands in justice rather than reach for the sword where mercy kindness and compassion flow like deep water and men revere virtue revere truth revere beauty above comfort pleasure or selfish gain a land where peace reigns in the hearts of men where faith blazes like a beacon from every hill and love like a fire from every hearth where the true god is worshipped and his ways acclaimed by all thus taliesin spoke bequeathing his bright vision to a world ruled by the powers of darkness today it pleases the high king of heaven to honour the words his servant uttered so long ago people of britain hear me rejoice and be glad the longawaited day has dawned the high king took his place beside myrddin then as i gazed upon arthur tall and strong his handsome face lit by golden morning light the white stone of the shrine fairly glowing behind him i knew that the wise emrys as ever had spoken the truth the high king drew his sword caledvwlch and raised the naked blade like a cross and held it before him today in your hearing taliesins prophecy is fulfilled he said my friends the kingdom of summer is begun taliesins fair vision has become reality here we begin and may the living god crown our efforts with every virtue arthur lofted the bladecross and the host of people gave voice with a great cry of acclaim pendragon pendragon their shout became a flood rolling down the hillside to spread throughout the land pendragon in that moment the high king bold and bright before them became the longawaited summer lord after a time the cry died down allowing arthur to continue lowering the great sword he placed the point of the blade against the stone at his feet and folded his hands one over the other atop the pommel then gazing out over the people and the valley beyond as if into the fardistant future he said what is begun this day will burn in the hearts of all who hear of it what is begun this day will be a boon of rich blessing to the people of every race and tribe what is begun this day arthur pendragon said his face shining in the morning light will last to the end of the world when god shall roll up the heavens like a parchment and return to earth to reign in righteousness for all eternity so be it delivering his sword to myrddin the king turned stepped to where avallach stood waiting and with a bow of acknowledgment to the grails first guardian placed his hand on the casket and opened the lid the world was lit with a sudden flash of radiance as if lightning had been shut up inside the box to be released at this moment the onlookers gasped as arthur reached in and withdrew the grail and raised it high i do not know what others saw but i beheld a footed cup which glittered and shone in the bright sunlight as if it too were alive to the light that danced over and around it a row of rubies and emeralds glittered around its foot and the rim was set with pearls a broad band of impossibly ornate scrollwork bent around the bowl catching the light and throwing it off like sparks from a golden flame my heart soared as i filled my gaze with that rapturous sight i felt myself grow stronger and yes more noble as if the light revealed the man i was meant to be but so rarely was and i was not the only one to feel this way from the murmurs of amazement around me i guessed that all who beheld the lord christs bowl were in that selfsame moment granted a vision of the good gods redeeming grace it happened in the blink of an eye the narrow space between one word and the next for yet was arthur speaking behold i give you the cup of christ which shall be the emblem of the summer realm and a perpetual reminder of the source and sustainer of our good fortune so saying he stepped to the entrance of the shrine and placed the grail on the altar stone which had been prepared for it this done he reverenced the cup with a bow and stepped away from the altar outside again he retrieved his sword from myrddin raised it and declared from this day i have done with war and killing strife and violent contention have no place in the kingdom of summer henceforth shall britain be called a land of peace stepping into the shrine once more he laid caledvwlch before the grail point on the floor and hilt resting against the altar stone so that the blade looked like bishop elfodds cross the high king then knelt before the altar and offered up a prayer father in heaven never let me forget that sight arthur on his knees before the altar his head back face tilted upwards his strong arms outspread palms upwards to receive the blessing he sought and above him shining with the brightness of the sun itself filling the shrine with a high and holy light the grail how long he remained in the shrine i cannot say for the moment was eternal and all creation held its breath when he emerged it was to a world subtly but surely changed arthur himself seemed fairer stronger more noble as if all those lordly qualities which he already possessed in rare abundance had been expanded increased multiplied within him and he now assumed a greater stature than before if anyone doubted his own perception he had only to look at gwenhwyvar the expression of admiration and love commingled in her eyes would have convinced the hardest sceptic that here before us stood a lord transfigured the high king his face shining with the reflected glory of the holy cup slowly raised his hands in a gesture of benevolence and said may the grail which we have established in this shrine serve as a beacon of hope to all mankind let it hereafter be said that once upon this island of the mighty men and women loved virtue more than their lives and sacrificed themselves to the rule of truth and justice friends he said we have kindled a flame that will burn to the end of the world we are men still but gods own cymbrogi stand in awe of the things we shall do even now angels are gathering to assist us on the journey we have begun signs and wonders will become commonplace miracles will multiply in abundance and peace will wash over the island of the mighty like a great sea wave lifted on the wings of the storm i ask you who can stop the waves who can tame the oceans fury or harness the seas colossal strength who can bid the sun to halt in the sky or stay the steady march of the seasons i tell you the truth we shall do all these things and more who pledge fealty to the kingdom of summer and its eternal lord for if we remain loyal through all things britain will be the wonder of the world a torch that is never quenched a holy fire that cannot be extinguished and all the nations that dwell in darkness will lift up their eyes and will behold the light of their salvation burning as a beacon in the night they will look up and they will rejoice and so great will be their rejoicing that the sound of celebration will overwhelm the sound of war that hateful craft will pass away never to be remembered if the acclaim before had been thunderous the roar of approval which met this pronouncement was deafening it seemed to go on and on and on during this exuberant and joyous outpouring bishop elfodd stepped forward and lifting holy hands to the lord of hosts began saining the shrine with prayers of consecration but the ceremony was effectively finished even as he prayed people came crowding forward for a better view of the sacred cup arthur signalled the grail guardians to take their places which we did standing in a wide double rank to form a narrow pathway through which the people might pass into the shrine men and women young and old hastened forward jostling one another in their eagerness to kneel before the grail and offer up their own heartfelt prayers once begun the flood became a tideflow which washed up the side of the hill and into the shrine we guardians stood and watched them come some anxious and halting some so atremble with awe that they could hardly move some with touching reverence others bold as if they would lay hold of the kingdom and claim its mighty promise for themselves no matter how they went in all emerged changed some more some less but no one who entered the shrine remained the same after having seen the grail i saw one old woman with a withered hand emerge with her hand restored and a man on a wooden crutch walked out on two strong legs to throw the stick as far away as he could hurl it another man so ill he lacked the strength to walk was brought to the altar by his friends only to emerge leaping and jumping for joy these were but the first of many healed that day i saw men and women bent double by grief and care enter the shrine and leave with heads high and the fire of hope shining in their faces many emerged with tears glistening in their eyes and on their cheeks more than a few had to be removed from the shrine dazzled by the glory of the blessed cup and overcome by the holiness of the moment they were transported into a rapture of bliss and were borne out by kinsmen and friends the evening stars were shining in the eastern sky when the last of the worshippers departed bishop elfodd lit the torches either side of the doorway and replaced the grail in its wooden casket only then were we able to sit down and rest our aching feet despite watching all day bedwyr cai and cador volunteered to take the first nights watch llenlleawg and i were allowed to return to the tor with cais admonition to remember the watchers their supper the first night passed peacefully in the summer realm and the next day remained so tranquil and serene it was easy to believe that the world had indeed changed the few folk who visited the shrine went away manifestly blessed one crippled woman a girl given to fits and two boys with skin diseases were healed the prevailing mood of peace and elation made our guard duty pure pleasure we ended the second blissful day full of brotherly love and kindly thoughts for all mankind ah but word of the miracles accomplished in the presence of the grail was spreading through the land already the news had gone out beyond the borders of the realm and like a spear hurled from the hand there was no calling it back twentyone all night long visitors streamed into the valley to everyones surprise there were more than a few saecsens among them how word had flown so far so fast was more than i could credit obviously they had been travelling day and night to reach the grail shrine and once arrived they waited patiently sitting in groups on the ground or sleeping on the hillside the monks brought food and water and cared for the sick through the night until they could be admitted to the shrine the next morning arthur upon receiving information that saecsens were coming to the shrine was visibly delighted and declared that the grail was already fulfilling its highest purpose one day he said every citizen of britain will have made his way to this place to see the most holy grail and the world will be made new there was much in what the pendragon said for on the third day more people came to the shrine and the arrivals did not stop at dusk when the grail shrine was closed the people kept coming and were contented to wait through the night to be admitted the next morning on the fourth day the numbers swelled a steady flow of visitors trickled into the valley all through the day and into the night by the fifth day it was clear that the numbers were steadily rising thus the chore of guarding the shrine was growing increasingly wearing for the five guardians admittedly if even one of us had thought beyond that first days duty we might have seen how inept our scheme really was if we had not been distracted by the blissful exhilaration of our position and if we had properly understood the nature of the object we were guarding we might have anticipated the eagerness of the people driven by desperation and need to obtain healing thus it did not take a bards wisdom to see that our simpleminded notion of five grail guardians standing perpetual watch was after only a few days breaking down under the sheer weight of numbers clearly a new plan was needed brothers said bedwyr as we looked out upon the gathered pilgrims in the fading light so many had arrived through the day that they would not now get in to see the grail until the morning you are mighty men all and far above me in every way no doubt you could stand before the shrine day and night for a thousand years and never feel the strain but i cannot in short i am tired as if to demonstrate his point he yawned and said we must have help and i see no reason why the cymbrogi should fritter away the days in idle pursuits while we labour on it is neither fitting nor right are you suggesting that we compel our swordbrothers to help shoulder this duty i asked i am suggesting that very thing confirmed bedwyr with another yawn man why did you not speak up the sooner blurted cai it is all i can do to put one foot in front of the other and here am i thinking you enjoy standing like a pillar all day long as much as i enjoy it cador remarked i yet might be persuaded to let a few of the cymbrogi take my place if my brother guardians were so disposed that is the cador i know bedwyr replied adopting an admiring tone generous to the last as for myself i deem it no less an honour for sharing it among my swordbrothers let them have it i say then it is settled i said we all agree that the duty should be shared out among the cymbrogi llenlleawg has not said what he thinks cai pointed out indicating the tall irishman standing silent as a pillar well inquired bedwyr swinging towards the irishman what say you llenlleawg arthurs champion shrugged if everyone else agrees he muttered glancing away and down i am for it bedwyr stared at him for a moment as if trying to decide what ailed the man so he said turning away abruptly we have made our first addition to the rules of order as the last of the days visitors made their way into the shrine we then fell to discussing how to divide the watch and it was quickly decided that one grail guardian should stand as overseer to eight of the cymbrogi to further ease the hardship of the duty the day guard would be relieved at sunset by those who were chosen to watch the night thus we would only be required to stand one watch in every five an obviously superior arrangement for we would enjoy a day of rest between we then drew straws to see who would begin the new order of rotation as luck would have it i drew the next days watch but llenlleawg drew the short straw and was forced to stand watch that very night after having stood guard all day though luck went against him he made no complaint while there were still many people waiting in the gathering twilight we had no choice but to declare the shrine closed bedwyr told the people the grail shrine would open again at dawn and the attending monks bade those in need to come to the monastery for food and shelter one old man became agitated at this announcement and began shouting i have waited all day he said i cannot wait any longer just until tomorrow friend said the monk firmly but not unkindly tomorrow will be too late the man insisted his voice and shoulders shaking with the effort he carried a long stick which he leaned on for support please i must see the cup of christ tonight come to the abbey and we will take care of you the monk told him you can come back in the morning i am old and sick i may die tonight the man said stubbornly and turned to appeal to bedwyr you there you are the kings man you can let me see the cup before i die please the monk took hold of the old mans arm and made to lead him away bedwyr intervened however wait let him in but no more today he will be the last the monk relented and led the old man forward they entered the shrine and bedwyr undertook to inform all the other visitors that food would be provided at the abbey for any who required it and that they were welcome to return to the shrine at dawn when they would be cheerfully admitted the people muttered over this but accepted their lot and began making their way down the hill to the valley below where most of them would spend the night the rest of us meanwhile fell to discussing who should make up the watch for the night we quickly chose the guard and informed bedwyr when he rejoined us a moment later the old man emerged from the shrine he walked directly to bedwyr seized his hand and kissed it saying bless you son bless you bless you ducking his head with each benison i can die a happy man he said and then walked away carrying his stick in his hand a friend for life cai observed now let us be gone llenlleawg wished us a restful sleep in our good soft beds and bade us remember him his supper he then urged us to haste lest he starve before the food should reach him we promised to send his supper along with those who were to take the watch with him that night whereupon bedwyr cai and i rode back to ynys avallach we passed through the gate to find the yard alight with torches and filled with people and horses someone important has come one of the cymbrogi told me as i dismounted who i asked but he did not know thinking it might be gwalcmai i threw the fellow the reins and commanded him to take care of my mount while bedwyr called for volunteers to stand guard duty i ran to the hall to welcome not my brother alas but someone almost as dear and good to me bors see now i have known bors for a long time he and his brother king ban of benowyc were among the first of the pendragons advocates having supported aurelius and uther arthurs father and uncle the first high kings of britain they had aided the young dux britanniarum in his struggles to unite the lords of britain and conquer the saecsens for bors that meant more than merely providing men he had joined the cymbrogi and lent his sword to the cause for seven years he like all the rest of us fought alongside arthur following the defeat of the saecsens at baedun and arthurs kingmaking and wedding bors returned home to help his brother out of some difficulty or other summoned from armorica to help fight the vandali he had at last arrived just in time to help celebrate the enshrinement of the grail and now stood drinking ale and laughing with arthur and gwenhwyvar if you could not resist finishing off the black boar the prince of benowyc was saying you might at least have saved one of his piglets for me here i have come to feast on pork only to be given cakes and ale instead did you think to fight the vandali alone i remarked striding up beside him where is your warband asked bedwyr welcome brother said cai we feared your pilot had lost his way on that ocean of yours gwalchavad bedwyr cai he shouted with husky heartiness embracing us with his free hand bless me but it is good to see you again i tell you the truth we met arthurs messenger halfway so i sent the warriors home and came on alone he did not say it but with britain sore beset by plague and drought no doubt it was safer for his men to remain in armorica turning to arthur he said i am heartily sorry i could not come to you sooner bear but the frencs grow ever more contentious and will not be appeased so easily as in the past we had our hands full through the summer i tell you still ban would have me beg your pardon for the delay there is no need said arthur waving aside the apology tell me how fares your brother ban sends his greetings to one and all and asks to be remembered by his former swordbrothers as ever he is desirous of coming to britain one day soon when kingly duties weigh less heavily upon the crowned head as he says if that is the case i ventured then he will likely remain in benowyc forever i have never known a man so able at producing work out of thin air too true agreed bors i tell him the same thing myself but he can always find a thousand things begging to be done and it is who will do them if i leave and thus he keeps himself busy year to year turning to arthur he said now then what am i hearing about this grail of yours it saved arthurs life gwenhwyvar replied if not for the grail britain would be in mourning now the holy cup healed his wounds and restored his life then it is true bors wondered turning wide eyes towards arthur from the moment we made landfall i have heard nothing but talk of this holy grail i thought it must be one of those peculiar rumours that surface from time to time like that enormous serpent living in the lake up north afanc i told him i know a man who saw it snatch one of his cows from the shore of the lake where it was grazing i myself have seen it the serpent asked bors in astonishment no the lake they all laughed at this and bors thrust the cup into my hands drink brother ah but it is good to be back among true friends rhys arrived while bors was speaking and whispered something to the king i fear lord bors said arthur gwenhwyvar and i have been called away we must speak to myrddin before he disappears again but you will sit with me at table tonight arthur promised and i will tell you all about the battles you have missed the pendragon and his lady moved away then and bedwyr made excuses too saying he must see to the night watch and supper for llenlleawg he hurried off to order the cymbrogi leaving cai and me to help bors with the welcome cup where is our irishman wondered bors at the shrine i answered and went on to explain about the fellowship of the grail we each take it in turn to guard the shrine i concluded it was llenlleawgs bad luck to draw the short straw he has the watch tonight alone asked bors passing the cup to me nay replied cai there are eight cymbrogi with him or soon will be so he will not lack for company when did you arrive i asked taking a drink and passing the cup to cai at midday just bors replied his features grew keen but tell me have you seen this grail man cai hooted for three whole days i have done little else save stand beside it from dawn to dusk where is this shrine bors asked excitement growing take me now said cai we have just this moment returned from there now bors insisted i want to see this marvel for myself if it is as you say even a moment is too long to wait but the shrine is closed now i explained even if it were not people in their hundreds have waited through the day to see it and now must wait through the night as well they stand ahead of you brother but never fear i have the watch tomorrow and i will take you and make certain you get to see it bors yielded with good grace very well he said if i must wait then at least i tarry in good company bless me but i am sorry i missed the fighting was it bad bad enough i replied the saecsens were worse of course but the vandali were nearly as bad fiercest when backed into a corner fortunately arthur saw to it that did not happen very often mostly we chased them up and down the valleys they had their women and children with them god in heaven he shook his head in disbelief truly i declared it seems they had been forced to flee their homeland in the southern seas somewhere and they were looking for new lands for settlement they chose the wrong place when they chose britain bors said they tried lerna first i said and when we chased them away from those green hills they came here it took the whole summer but we vanquished them at last even so they have not done too badly no he regarded us dubiously for a truth cai declared nodding in return for peace and sworn allegiance to the high king arthur gave them lands in the north he never did did and done i told him and related the story of how arthur had undertaken single combat with the black boar and received the deadly wound which ended in the miraculous healing i believe it is for the best i concluded the grail is established britain is at peace and the kingdom of summer is begun never has there been a better time to be alive bors regarded me curiously trying to determine if i was sincere or not unable to decide he reached for the cup instead took a long draught of the ale whereupon one of the serving men appeared to say that avallach called for his guests to take their places at the board we hurried into the hall where we were joined at table by bedwyr and cador and some others eager to renew their acquaintance with bors the talk was fine and amiable the ale flowed freely and we spent the evening pledging and repledging our undying friendship to one another i wish llenlleawg were here bedwyr said at one point this is just the tonic that would do him good to llenlleawg proclaimed cai grandly the finest warrior who ever drew sword or sat horse i will drink to that declared cador cheerfully raising his cup high to the finest warrior that ever drew sword echoed bedwyr and we all acclaimed the sentiment with a noisy rattling of our cups we were then overtaken by a sudden and irresistible urge to drink the health and virtue of every single member of the dragon flight fine men each and every one night was far gone when i finally found my bed the warriors lodgings were full so i took off my boots and curled up in the corner it seemed that i had merely closed my eyes when i was roughly roused by someone shaking me by the shoulder wake up said a voice loud in my ear lord gwalchavad please wake up i opened one eye and recognized the face hovering above me in the dark tallaght what are you doing i am trying to wake you lord he said you have achieved your ambition i replied and made to roll over now go away and let me sleep he started shaking me again forgive me lord you must come with me there is trouble i sat up what trouble i demanded pulling on my boots i cannot say he answered rhys says the pendragon has roused the dragon flight we are summoned to the yard at once as we were no great distance from the hall i could hear men moving quickly and quietly in the corridor beyond by the time we joined them the yard was in turmoil men rushing everywhere at once to saddle horses and procure weapons by torchlight i caught sight of rhys leading arthurs mount from the stables rhys i shouted running to meet him are we attacked the shrine he shouted breathlessly as he passed without slowing something has happened at the shrine well what is it man how do i know he hurried on so i concerned myself with saddling my horse and arming myself i had just strapped a sword to my hip and got hold of a spear when rhys hunting horn called us to be mounted i swung into the saddle and saw arthur across the yard his face set in that expression i have come to know well the serene unhurried calm of a skilled craftsman assembling the tools of his trade unlike other men when riding into battle the pendragon becomes more himself rather than less eventempered by nature in a fight arthur is never uneasy or alarmed never worried or distressed never fearfraught nor less yet unnerved myrddin has said that he believes arthur truly lives only in the fight many warriors live to fight myrddin told me once but arthur comes alive in battle the way an eagle only conies alive when it takes flight he is courageous i agreed what is courage but the mastery of fear said the wise emrys but there is no fear in arthur tell me does the eagle fear the wind that frees him to fly well the eagle of britain was ready to soar and those who recognized the sight knew well what it meant we rode through the gate and pounded onto the winding tor path in the dark there must have been fifty or more men clattering down the hillside at arthurs back gaining the lakeside path we flew past the monastery scrambled over the lowland and made directly for shrine hill where we found the place in chaos people were stumbling around in the darkness for the moon had set and dawn had not yet come and they were shouting at one another the women were wailing and children were crying but i could not see what had happened to cause such distress there was a crush of confusion at the foot of shrine hill rhys gave forth blast after blast on the horn and we forced our way through the clinging throng and rode for the hilltop the shrine itself was peacefully quiet and we swiftly discovered why the warriors charged with guarding the shrine were dead they lay on the steps leading to the entrance to the shrine where they had fallen all had been attacked with a sword and suffered horrific wounds several had lost limbs and one had been decapitated arthur took one look at the carnage and said who had the watch tonight his voice was tight as if he were speaking with immense difficulty llenlleawg i answered without another word the king turned and mounted the steps to the shrine he stepped inside only to emerge a moment later his face frozen in a rictus of shock and dismay arthur said bedwyr as the king strode past is he inside but the king made no reply and without so much as a backward glance walked back down the hill seizing a torch from the hand of a nearby warrior bedwyr dashed to the entrance of the shrine well cador shouted at him when bedwyr did not answer cador cleared the steps in a bound and dashed inside i could see the torchlight playing over the interior of the shrine and then cador appeared in the doorway looking shaken and unsteady thinking to see llenlleawg dead in a pool of blood i leapt up the steps to the door of the shrine and looked inside but there was neither blood nor body indeed the shrine was completely empty owing to my relief at not finding llenlleawgs corpse it took a moment for the awful significance to break over me but when it did it burst with all the fury of a tempest the shrine was empty the grail was gone caledvwlch was gone and llenlleawg was nowhere to be found twentytwo rhys cai cried the pendragon upon reaching the throng at the bottom of the hill find someone who saw what happened the two were already moving to his command as arthur having mastered his shock swiftly turned to the waiting cymbrogi the grail is gone and caledvwlch with it the guards are dead get more torches search the hill i want to know how many were here and which way they went in the moment of stunned hesitation that followed he roared now and men scattered in twenty directions seizing a torch from one of the sconces at the entrance to the shrine i began searching the outside of the building and was quickly joined by cador bearing another torch we walked slowly crouching low examining the soft dusty earth for fresh footprints or for any other sign that the attackers might have crept up from behind the shrine to take the watchmen unawares there were all sorts of marks in the dust the tracks of masons and the imprints where stone and tools had lain but all these were old and scuffed about nothing fresh here cador concluded still just to make certain we had not missed anything or overlooked any possible trace however small we made a second circuit of the shrine this time the only new tracks we saw were those cador and i had made during the first circuit i could identify them readily enough on the dry dusty ground which gave me to know that had there been any new tracks the first time we would have recognized them there were none go tell arthur cador said i will look over there he pointed to the broad slope of the hills rearward side hurrying to the front of the shrine i found the hillside ablaze with the light of torches as the cymbrogi scoured the path and surrounding area arthur and bedwyr were standing halfway down the hill talking to myrddin who was still on horseback after a few brief words the emrys turned his mount and raced away again hearing my footsteps behind him the king whirled on me well he demanded we found nothing pendragon i told him look again he commanded we have already searched twice and again the order was curt and brooked no reply bedwyr grim in the softly fluttering light nodded we must be certain he said as it was easier to comply than to argue i walked the shrine perimeter for the third time more slowly and painstakingly to be sure again i saw nothing i had not seen before nor did cadors scrutiny turn up any traces that the shrine had been approached from the rear cador met me at the hilltop shaking his head nothing he said whoever did this did not strike from behind we hurried back reaching the king just as rhys and cai came hastening up the pathway dragging two others between them there are at least three more dead down there rhys informed us bleakly skulls split ear to ear another four wounded these two saw what happened cai added they are father and son arrived after nightfall from east of arthur raised a hand and cut him off addressing the two men he said what did you see the older of the two swallowed then glanced sideways at cai who urged him on with a sharp nod the man licked his lips and said it was dark lord pendragon i fear my eyes is not what they was specially in the dead of night just say what you saw urged arthur impatiently the man blinked his face squirming in the torchlight he licked his lips again and worked his jaw the second man a youth with a club foot blurted it were terrible lord pendragon terrible the first thing i knowed somethings amiss was when up there comes a shout like a death cry it were we had just got ourselves a piece of the ground and rolled up in our cloaks to sleep and this brought us up again something quick i can tell you the elder man nodded his agreement at this aye the very truth yes yes growled bedwyr testily but what did you see tell them and be quick about it coaxed cai in a low tone with another nod of encouragement up there the youth said pointing to the shrine men was all asudden fighting for their very lives all of them at it eh da the man nodded every last one he murmured they was fighting something fierce the youth continued and must have been six or more against one but the one he were a fighter he flew this way and that slashing and slashing and what with the shouting and slashing i never seen such a sight he killed them all he did every last one repeated the father who demanded bedwyr the young man looked at cai for help his name said arthur tersely holding him to the task i never heard his name the youth replied but he were tall taller than the rest at least he hesitated glancing around quickly then added and the queen were with him the words hit me like a spear in the gut llenlleawg and gwenhwyvar can it be true i looked to arthur to judge his reaction but save for a tightening of his jaw saw no appreciable change bedwyr however had gone red in the face and was almost shaking with frustrated rage how could you see all this from down there he shouted pointing angrily down the hill at the place where they had stood for the torches on the side of the shrine the young man explained we saw it all he killed them and then he comes running down here running like his legs is afire we see him waving that great sword in one hand and carrying something under his other arm what was he carrying demanded bedwyr roughly the youth shrugged a wooden box is that what you saw too bedwyr turned his withering gaze on the elder of the two tell the truth man arthur cautioned his voice tight the man licked his lips and said some of the people down here they started shouting the grail the grail he has got the grail i do not know about that all i saw was the box and him running away with it you said you saw the queen where was she cai asked well now the tall one runs to where the horses is picketed over there he pointed to where the guards had tethered the animals the queen was waiting there never seen her at first for all the battle going on up the shrine but i reckon she was waiting there all along what happened then said arthur softly almost trembling with rage well they go to ride away some of those nearest by make bold to lay hold of the killer everyone is shouting he stole the grail he stole the grail and they try to stop him and it is dead they are for their troubles asserted the older man that sword is up and he strikes them all down who lays hand to him and then they both ride off that way the youth pointed to the east is that all said arthur that is the last i seen the youth answered we never seen anything after that until you all came the older man nodded and spat adding we feared you was coming to kill us too there is nothing else you are certain of that bedwyr glared hard at both of them daring them to add to or take away anything from what we had already heard the two shook their heads and remained silent whereupon arthur dismissed them charging them to say nothing of this to anyone else until more could be learned as soon as they had gone we all turned to one another it cannot be llenlleawg has done this cai insisted vehemently it was never llenlleawg and gwenhwyvar who then snarled bedwyr llenlleawg is the only one of us missing now why is that do you think it was someone else cai maintained someone who looked like him those two are confused i suggested quickly it is dark they were asleep when it started they could not possibly have seen everything that happened truly agreed cai maybe they caught sight of llenlleawg riding off in pursuit of the attackers and assumed he had done it aye he rode off asserted bedwyr his voice an ugly sneer taking the grail with him what of gwenhwyvar cador wondered gwenhwyvar was with me arthur said bluntly llenlleawg could not have done it cai insisted anyway llenlleawg was sworn to protect the grail with his life if he rode in pursuit of the killer he could never leave it behind bedwyr dispatched this lame suggestion without mercy then why not ride to the tor he could bring the grail for protection and raise the alarm if word of the massacre had not been brought to us by those confused people down there we still would not know of it since the queen was with arthur cador suggested it must have been morgaws with him arthur glared hard in the dim light yes he agreed sourly turning to cador the king said ride to the tor and tell the queen what has happened then find morgaws if she is there bring her to me cador leapt to the saddle at once and raced away into the darkness swinging towards bedwyr arthur commanded you and rhys take eight men and see if you can raise the trail bedwyr made to protest but the look on arthurs face warned him off and he departed calling for men and torches gwalchavad the king ordered you and cai see what is to be done for those who have been wounded then take word to elfodd and remove the dead to the abbey i do not like this arthur cai muttered under his breath arthur ignored him saying i will talk to the people here someone may have seen something more the king stalked off towards the distraught crowd cai made to follow but i put a hand on his arm and said come there are injured needing help if you would go to the monastery i will see to matters here you go to the monastery cai said staring at arthur as he walked away i want to talk to some of the others and see if anyone saw anything different thus i found myself hurrying to the abbey to summon bishop elfodd owing to the fact that a few monks had been at the shrine tending folk through the night word had reached the abbey before me i rode into the yard to meet the bishop and five or six monks as they rushed from their lodging hall i pray there has been a wicked mistake elfodd said it is no mistake i told him there are dead and wounded the king wants you yes yes elfodd replied quickly we will do whatever we can are you returning to the shrine at once i will go with you laying a hand on the shoulder of the nearest monk he said brother hywel i leave you in authority he then ordered the monks to fetch balms and bandages and hasten to the shrine ride with me i said putting down a hand for him the way is short and we are soon there two monks hurried to the bishops aid and we were soon hastening back across the nightdark valley upon dismounting we proceeded directly to the shrine where arthur was holding council with myrddin and bors by fluttering torchlight as much as it pains us the ernes was saying it may be the truth the high king stared at his wise counsellor his face grim in the fluttering light of hissing torches at least bors said softening myrddins pronouncement what passes for the truth until we find llenlleawg and learn why he has behaved like this then it is true i asked llenlleawg is gone myrddin replied he is not at the tor it is a tragedy bishop elfodd said breaking in i am shocked beyond reason i thought the shrine well protected i never imagined one of the guardians we are no less dismayed than you bishop myrddin said pointedly what this moment requires however is your sympathy and support not your reproach the bishop accepted his reprimand with good grace he inclined his head in acknowledgment of his error and said i am deeply sorry lord arthur and i want you to know that i am placing myself and my brothers under your command we will do all in our power to assist you in any way we can arthur thanked him and said your skills would best be employed aiding the wounded and praying for llenlleawgs swift return the wounded will be cared for of course the cleric replied and i will immediately establish perpetual prayer for the recovery of the holy cup glancing at bors and myrddin he said please send word if you need anything with that he hurried off to direct the monks who were helping with the injured and dead cador returned from the tor lashing his horse up the hill at full gallop without even pausing to dismount he leaned from the saddle putting his head to arthurs ear even while he spoke the pendragons face changed now i have seen the bear of britain in his rage before but have never seen him like this his face darkened his jaw bulged and the veins stood out on his neck and brow seizing cador by the arm the king almost hauled him bodily from the saddle my wife gone he cried she is nowhere to be found cador replied trying to keep his saddle i stopped at the stables the queens horse is gone along with morgaws and another he hesitated the stablers were asleep but one of them says he thinks he saw the queen take the horses mind he was half asleep at the time added to what myrddin had already said it seemed the two witnesses were right the kings champion had murdered his swordbrothers and stolen the most holy grail what is more it appeared he had been aided in this atrocity by none other than the queen that llenlleawg could perform such a treacherous act was unthinkable that gwenhwyvar should be party to it was impossible yet there it was a double betrayal of such abhorrence the mind shrank from contemplation of it there must be some other explanation i determined morgaws is involved somehow find her and no doubt all would be explained i stepped quickly to join those at arthurs side and await his command cador was saying avallach wanted to come here but i persuaded him to remain at the palace he instructed me to say that he will await the pendragons return in his chamber charis has gone on to the abbey to help the monks duty discharged cador continued it cannot be what it seems bear we will find them but until we do we cannot know what really happened he speaks my thoughts entirely i said speaking up we should not judge by the appearance of the thing alone it cannot be what it seems i pray you are right said bors god knows i have trusted that man in the thick of the fight more times than i remember and i cannot find it in my heart to doubt him now until we find llenlleawg said myrddin we will not discover what happened therefore our best efforts are given to the search rhys and bedwyr have already begun snapped arthur angrily it will be daylight soon bors observed striving to sound brisk and confident they will raise the trail never fear we will learn the truth before the day is out away in the east the sky was greying with the dawn come arthur said myrddin taking the king by the arm i want to see the shrine together they started towards the shrine to examine the empty building and i believe to speak to each other alone what would you have us do now cador called after them bury the dead came arthurs terse reply silent with our own thoughts we stood and watched the thin grey line turn to silver and then blush bright red as the sun rose on the worst day i have known since baedun hill twentythree now the battle begins i have made the first strike it is greatly to morgaws credit that no one saw it coming she chose her servant well and bound him to her with strong enchantments he is ours and a more potent weapon would be difficult to find oh it would have been pure joy to have seen their faces when they discovered the traitor in their midst i wish i had been there to savour it to the full but it is not time to reveal myself just yet i must content myself with the knowledge that my glory will be all the greater for remaining so long undiscovered still the shock of betrayal is an exquisite pleasure and that it followed so quickly upon the birth of the summer kingdom is especially poignant simple treachery when applied with such swift and thorough proficiency can be simply devastating trust is i think the most fragile of the virtues ever brittle it shatters easily and once broken can never be completely repaired in a single stroke i have broken arthurs most deeply held trusts there is no force on earth that can compel a heart to continue trusting when cruel hard facts fly in the face of faith doubt and fear are everfaithful allies i find and when joined with suspicion can become wonderfully debilitating in an enemy they are like twin hounds baying for blood relentless and merciless they will chase and bite and howl wearing down the prey until mind and heart and will are spent and the helpless victim drops from exhaustion i do not expect arthur to surrender easily nor less yet myrddin they will prove stalwart adversaries i expect thus will my eventual triumph taste the sweeter and what is this morgaws tells me she has come into possession of a certain talisman a treasure of some kind by which arthur and merlin set great store an object of power healing power apparently among other things she used it to bait her trap she does not tell me what it was but i suspect the grail that would be a treasure indeed there were rumours in the wind about this grail years ago the miraculous cup of such power it is able to work wonders of its own accord well these tales are always stirring up the poor folk superstition has its uses i find still i never would have thought merlin would have anything to do with it he fancies himself above the common herd and its bovine beliefs dear nephew has surprised me before however therefore i will make it my affair to find out more about this treasure morgaws has discovered in the meantime i have a little talisman of my own to reveal come enemy mine the chase awaits you is this the last one wondered cai shovelling dry earth onto the body in the grave a bright redgold dawn had given way to a pale grey monksmantle of a sky a gloomy day to match the mood of death and doom the dirt was hardbaked and the graves shallow we worked away in silence thinking about the horrific events of the previous night twelve had been buried and three more bodies brought from the hillside to the little yard near the lake below the abbey cai and i along with cador bors and some of the cymbrogi had buried our swordbrothers first before turning to the pilgrims many of the dead had families with them some of whom stood nearby weeping quietly as their kinsmen were laid to rest one more i told him indicating the last of the three together we dragged the last body to the newly dug grave and rolled it into the narrow hole i put my shovel into the mound of dirt and dragged part of the pile onto the body cai likewise bent his back to the task then hesitated god bless him he muttered under his breath i know this one i glanced up and he said is this not the old man who raised the commotion when we closed the shrine i turned and looked into the bloodless face of the corpse in the grave so it is i confirmed the last time i had seen him he had been striding away with an expression of rapture on his battered old face he said he wanted to see the grail before he died cai remembered then at least he died happy i replied and began pulling dirt over him a moment later a rider came from the tor arthur wants you the warrior said bedwyr has returned you are to come at once leaving the mourners to the care of elfodds monks we rode back to the tor to face the kings wrath arthur was standing behind his camp chair the chair uther had used as a throne waiting for us in avallachs chamber at the fisher kings palace bedwyr and rhys were standing before the chair arms folded and unhappy he betrayed us arthur said his voice the growl of a wounded animal he has betrayed the summer kingdom he has betrayed his king and he has betrayed britain we do not know what happened rhys pointed out do we not demanded the high king his voice hard and flat and cold do we not we know the grail is gone and llenlleawg with it we know eight cymbrogi were slain by his hand and fifteen pilgrims as well we know the summer realm lies in ruins we know he has stolen murdered and destroyed if that were not condemnation enough he has taken the queen with him whether by force or by deception i know not the queen he has vowed to protect through all things he shall be hunted down like the treacherous dog that he is and he shall be killed bear pleaded bedwyr be reasonable we will find him and then we will discover the truth let it not be said that arthur pendragon was ever less than reasonable replied the king icily we shall be a very paragon of reason if a servant betrays his master it is reasonable that he should expect to receive punishment it is reasonable that the murderer should forfeit his life for his crime it is reasonable to seek justice and demand retribution justice yes by all means agreed bedwyr but what of mercy ah said arthur you think us too harsh then let us temper our justice with mercy as you suggest know this the same mercy granted those who were slain shall be granted the one who murdered them bedwyr glanced at rhys uneasily clearly they wanted to say more but owing to arthurs poisonous mood felt their intercessions were only making matters worse in the strained silence cai and i took our places beside our swordbrothers and waited for the storm to break twentythree dead the grail gone the pendragon roared suddenly striking the back of the chair with his fist my sword taken and my queen abducted that was the first time i heard that word uttered but no doubt he was right the king glared around him defying anyone to dispute his reading of events is that not the shape of things no one made bold to answer arthur glowered murderously at us i had never seen him so angry you he shouted pointing at bedwyr have you nothing to say in truth intoned bedwyr wearily i thought we could not fail we raised the trail at first light but arthur cut him off save me your excuses you failed yes bedwyr shut his mouth and stared ahead a short while ago arthur continued pacing behind his chair like a caged bear i told avallach that his worst fears had been realized he was against enshrining the grail but i persuaded him that it would be safe i pledged my honour to it the best men of the dragon flight will protect it nothing will happen to it but now he glared at us with true contempt and loathing and i felt the depth of his anger restrained now but dangerously close to flaring now it has been stolen by one of our own and we are no closer to recovering it than we were when the alarm roused us from our beds the blame will fall on me and rightly so but god help me i will not make no vow you cannot keep myrddin declared he had entered the chamber so quietly no one noticed arthur swung angrily towards this illopportuned interruption glaring at his wise counsellor he drew breath to vent his rage anew but myrddin said morgaws too is gone or have you forgotten i confess that i did not at first understand the significance of myrddins insistence preoccupied with what we considered far more weighty matters such as the dire betrayal of the king by his own champion what did the disappearance of a foundling guest matter arthur stared hard at myrddin it can wait he growled at last we have more important affairs before us or have you forgotten impatient and angry though he was he should not have said that last do i weary you with my prattling myrddin demanded tartly drawing himself up full height he took breath and let fly i am a true bard he said his voice a very lash if i speak know that it is worthy of your regard o lofty king question me if you will but doubt me at your peril peace myrddin arthur grumbled i meant no disrespect but the wise emrys would not be appeased so easily while you have been busy with your grand and glorious schemes the secret enemy has quietly invaded the innermost treasureroom of your stronghold find morgaws and you will find the grail arthur gazed grudgingly at his counsellor as if trying to weigh the implications of his next decision ready the dragon flight he said at last bedwyr remained unconvinced do you think rhys and i would have returned so soon if we had found anything with so many people coming and going in the last days it was impossible to see anything might it be possible you were looking in the wrong place inquired myrddin smoothly bedwyr opened his mouth to protest then clamped it promptly shut he knew better than to argue with myrddin when the wise emrys was in a mood to cross swords thus we were very soon riding out from the tor in force at my suggestion the king agreed to allow peredur to lead the search i knew and valued the young warriors abilities as a tracker and he was eager to be of service the day was no longer fresh when we set out but our hopes were kindled when upon reaching the lakeside we found the tracks of one unshod horse leading away west all of arthurs horses are ironshod of course and so are avallachs it might be morgaws mount suggested peredur doubtfully then mercy granted those who were slain shall be granted the one who murdered them bedwyr glanced at rhys uneasily clearly they wanted to say more but owing to arthurs poisonous mood felt their intercessions were only making matters worse in the strained silence cai and i took our places beside our swordbrothers and waited for the storm to

leading away west all of arthurs horses are ironshod of course and so are avallachs it might be morgaws mount suggested peredur doubtfully then again there have been many visitors to the tor of late it could be anyone of them true myrddin allowed but did any of the visitors ride west in the last day or so can anyone say that they saw anyone riding alone that was good enough for arthur let us see where this leads we will quickly discover whether we have made an error well the trail was good to begin with and we flew along the wooded pathways confidence growing through the day only to be cast down abruptly when it ceased i do not mean that we merely lost the trail for we did not the tracks those of a lone horse and rider led us all the way around the lake thereby avoiding the abbey and then bent towards shrine hill according to the tale of the tracks the rider came within sight of the grail shrine but did not approach paused then moved off at speed east in the direction of the wood we followed the trail without the slightest difficulty the tracks were good and the dry ground took a ready impression eventually the trail came to a small clearing in the wood where stood a stone there the rider had stopped it appears she met someone here lord peredur said rising from his examination of the tracks even without dismounting i could see the place where two other horses had stood chafing the dry earth here and there with impatient hooves they rode on that way peredur pointed into the trees on the opposite side of the clearing we resumed our pursuit but not for long at the other side of the clearing no more than two or three hundred paces away the hoofjprints of the three horses simply and suddenly stopped the marks were there in the dust for everyone to see and then they were gone it appears they have vanished between one step and the next bedwyr observed pressing a fingertip into the last print not trusting completely to his eyes less yet to peredurs or anyone elses bedwyr had dismounted for a closer look and now turned from his scrutiny of the prints in the dirt to regard the jagged circle of sky showing through the closewoven branches above the short day was far gone the wan light already fading meanwhile cai had carried the search farther along the trail and some others had quickly scoured the perimeter finding nothing they all returned to await the pendragons pleasure what would you have us do lord asked bors arthur stared at the broken trail and said nothing so we fell to discussing what in view of this unhelpful discovery might be the best course in the end it was decided that rhys and cador would continue the search with peredur and a company of men the rest of us would return to ynys avallach which we did reaching the tor long after dark having ridden in dejected silence all the way back nothing had happened in our absence the dead were still dead the grail was still gone llenlleawg had not returned to explain his behaviour nor had morgaws been seen neither had gwenhwyvar returned to welcome the search party and tell us we had worried for nothing that all was well exhausted and edgy we stared bleareyed at the prospect of another long hopeless night and an endless succession of hopeless days to follow thoroughly dejected we dragged ourselves to the hall to get a bite to eat and a drink and to rest ourselves from our strenuous if futile exertions more disturbing news awaited us there however we entered to find the great room empty save for one of avallachs servants who approached us the instant we crossed the threshold greeted the high king and said if you please lord i have been instructed to tell you that lord avallach and lady charis have left the palace and returned to work with the good brothers at londinium they wish you gods aid in your search arthur stiffened i see he said was there anything else no lord the steward replied that is all i was to say while some might have considered this circumstance a blessing in disguise after all facing a stillangry avallach would not have been the most pleasant end to a day already rich with disaster arthur took it hard i am disgraced he murmured then remembering himself dismissed the servant with a command to bring some food and drink for his men we collapsed onto the nearby benches a sorrylooking group once more the only good that could be said of this day was that it was soon to end well it could not end soon enough for me even so too tired to eat and too disheartened to sleep we prolonged the torment we sat like gloomy lumps on the bench clenching our cups in unfeeling hands the bread tasteless in our mouths each one nursing his disappointment as best he could bors made a halfhearted attempt at lightening the desultory mood with a tale about a hunt in benowyc when the effort failed he dragged himself away to sleep bedwyr followed soon after leaving only cai myrddin and myself to sit with the king after a while myrddin rose drained his cup and said this avails nothing he said tomorrows troubles can wait until tomorrow rest while you can with that he left and cai and i stood to go too but hesitated when arthur made no move cai sat down once more go on he whispered to me i will see him to his bed when he is ready i did not like leaving them like that but i was swaying on my feet and could not keep my eyes open any longer very well i said relenting only see to it that you both get some sleep oh aye agreed cai turning his gaze to the dejected king soon i have no doubt they sat there all night for cai was redeyed and irritable the following day and the pendragons disposition had not improved nor did the morning light serve to brighten our circumstances the day ended in dismal waiting arthurs spirits sinking ever lower with the slow relentless arc of the sun he fretted and fumed chafing at the tedium and then as the long shadows stretched across the yard subsided into a wretched silence cador and rhys had better appear tomorrow muttered bedwyr as we abandoned the vigil for the night leaving the king to his misery but they did not return and bedwyr refusing to endure a third endless day of anxious inaction took six cymbrogi and rode out to see what he might find he returned at dusk having done nothing more useful than tire seven horses finally towards evening of the following day cador appeared alone with ill tidings on his lips we searched in all possible directions cador informed us his clothes begrimed his face grey with fatigue and could not raise the trail again but peredur found this he put his hand to his belt and withdrew a circlet of silver in our eagerness we all gathered close for a better look and i saw on cadors extended palm a silver brooch of the kind used to fasten a cloak the metal had been worked into the shape of a tore with two small rubies at the ends the pin was missing and the brooch was bent as if a horse had stepped on it but still it was a handsome piece no doubt belonging to a man or woman of noble rank i had never seen it before at least not that i could remember but myrddin took one look and almost swooned his knees buckled and cai took him by the shoulders and bore him up emrys are you well here sit you down but myrddin pushed away from him and staggered forth give it to me he shouted snatching the brooch from cadors hand he studied it closely then folded his fingers around it and pressed his fist to his forehead great light he groaned no no no he murmured in his anguish not again we stared at him apprehensive uncertain what to do ignorant still of the trouble what could he see in this simple ornament is it gwenhwyvars asked bors his voice creaking with apprehension no said arthur it was never gwenhwyvars or llenlleawgs either then whose wondered cador as mystified as the rest of us i thought it must be myrddin gave out a groan ah fool he said more to himself i think than to anyone else he looked around his face ashen it belonged to pelleas twentyfour see now the fisher king had two daughters charis the elder and morgian the younger by his second wife there was some trouble between the two daughters never learned what it was but it led morgian to reject her kinfolk she left ynys avallach long ago and took refuge in the wild north as far away from charis and avallach as possible in time she came to the orcades and in that clutch of smoothhilled islands made for herself a fortress amidst the ancient standing stones and barrows god help me this selfsame morgian became my grandfathers wife she was not my mother nor even my fathers mother heaven forbid it hear me i am the son of lot ap loth king of orcady my father rode with arthur against the saecsens and vandali let all men remember that it was my grandfathers misfortune to fall prey to morgians lust for power he was a king and she wanted a kingdom the match was set before anyone knew the danger poor loth in his dotage imagined himself a lord of vast wealth and influence and she was very beautiful some say that even then she was a canny sorceress and laid an enchantment on my grandfather under the sway of morgians corrosive influence he believed lot his loyal son plotted to steal his throne he harried my father and tried to kill him but lot escaped with most of the warband and established himself on one of orcadys many unassailable rocks gwalcmai and i were raised there coming south to serve with duke arthur no more than boys my brother and i and arthur no older we were among the first of the young war leaders cymbrogi i have no doubt that it was morgian who had turned loth against arthur in the end but true lord that he was arthur never counted our kinsmans rebellious ways against us still the infamy is never far from me every time i take the field it is to restore some lustre to our tarnished name the good lord willing we may yet be remembered as something other than the twin grandsons of wayward loth the mad king who made wicked morgian his queen in the years we were fighting for our lives morgian delved deep into the dark arts that now ruled her myrddin says she has been consumed by the power she sought to command evil he says cannot rest and is never satisfied it is a guest that always devours its host a weapon that wounds all who would wield it and myrddin should know he faced her and defeated her she fled the field her precious power shattered her sorcery overthrown that victory did not come without a price however it cost myrddin his eyesight and his closest friend when myrddin rode out to confront morgian he went alone pelleas myrddins faithful friend and servant feared for his master and followed alas pelleas has never been seen again nor his body ever found in all the world there is only one person who knows what happened to pelleas and that person left pelleas brooch behind you ask what this means said myrddin emrys clutching the silver brooch do you not know the darkness of the tomb when you see it do you wake in the night and think it bright day he pressed the back of his hand to his mouth and stared around him with wild eyes calm yourself myrddin said bors attempting to soothe we do not understand death and darkness he said his voice raw in its torment morgian has returned morgian whispered bedwyr at the sound of her name the hairs on my neck prickled and my mouth grew dry myrddin his face ashen his hands shaking swept from the chamber leaving us stunned and bewildered as soon as he had gone everyone began talking at once most knew something of the queen of air and darkness aside from myrddin i think bedwyr and i knew her best but bors knew her not at all he pulled me aside and said this morgian she and morgaws are the same yes no i answered but in my heart i wondered was it possible had morgian taken the shape of morgaws i shuddered at the thought but you know her he persisted who is she that she wields such power she is a sorceress and the sworn enemy of the emrys and all his works i told him her powers are as vast as her ways are subtle she is shrewd and she is cunning and the ancient adversary himself is not more fearful than she myrddin fought her once and nearly lost his life bedwyr informed bors she blinded him and left him for dead i think if it were not for pelleas he would have died i remember pelleas bors said his voice trailing off maybe it is nothing to do with morgian cai suggested weakly god love him if the sea and sky ever changed places he would be first to question it and last to believe it i wished i had some of cais dogged obstinance as hardheaded as he was bighearted he refused to believe the worst about anyone or anything but i believed more the dread for i had some small experience of morgians powers and it chilled me to the marrow to think she was somehow involved in the theft of the grail we fell silent no one believed cai was right but no one had the heart to dispute him either after a time arthur turned quietly to cador what of rhys he inquired softly the change in the pendragon astonished me the fire of his anger had been quenched utterly cowed by myrddins revelations he appeared shaken and defeated i did not like to keep you waiting any longer cador replied i thought best to bring word but also to begin spreading the search rhys and the cymbrogi are riding to the nearby settlements and holdings to ask their aid soon the whole world will know of my failure mused arthur ruefully the king dismissed cador then charging him to rest and return to the court when he was once more refreshed when cador had gone the pendragon turned to the remaining grail guardians and bors who had in all respects taken llenlleawgs place this is what your negligence has wrought he said the ruin of a kingdom he glared around the ring effaces if you have anything to say i beg you say it now friends for i tell you the truth unless the holy cup is restored britain is lost we all stared in silence loath to make matters worse for saying the wrong thing alas it was true the guardians had failed in their sworn duty and now the kingdom was imperiled who could answer that unfortunately the king read our reticence the wrong way taking a step backward he collapsed into the thronelike chair it was as if a blow from the flat of a sword had struck him down even my friends desert me he groaned i could but gaze in wretched misery at his anguish now made painfully visible then as if to fight the despair that even now ensnared him the pendragon heaved himself up once more and stood defiant a man confronting his accusers he spoke and there was fire in his voice every day more and more pilgrims arrive at the shrine only to find it empty the word of miracles has gone out come they say come to the summer realm and there you will see miracles and so the people come expecting a marvel but instead see only arthurs folly his grotesque smile was terrible to see ah perhaps that is the greatest marvel of all one mans arrogance and pride transformed into a hollow shell of lifeless stone he regarded us dully then flicked a hand at us leave me no one said a word and no one moved what the king demanded are you become stumps leave me i said get you from me i cannot bear the sight of you bors standing with his head down arms wrapped around himself made no move lost in thought he seemed no longer to heed anything taking place in this world but bedwyr dour in his silence turned on his heel and led the retreat abandoning his king to his misery oh it was a hard hard thing but what else could we do with arthur in this vile humour there was nothing for it but to quit the chamber to stay would have served no good purpose bedwyr and the others went to the hall but i could not bring myself to join them i went my way alone wandering wherever my feet would take me and soon found myself out on the high parapet above the gate the inner yard on one side the sloping hill with its twisting path on the other and the lake beyond i watched as the dull twilight deepened and with it a dreary fog rose from the marshes and lake to clothe the tor in a thick damp silent cloak the silence of the grave myrddin would say my thoughts flittered here and there restless birds that could find no friendly roost when i looked around night had settled uneasily over ynys avallach ending another foul day at last i noticed without pleasure that though the year had turned the change brought no rain the drought persisted aching with fatigue and thoroughly dispirited i left the battlement but not before casting a last glance towards the woodland to the east where the grail and all our brightest hopes had disappeared a bank of low cloud darker even than the night sky rose over the wood as if the darkness myrddin feared was drawing down upon us i shivered with a wayward chill and hurried inside the next day arthur did not receive us bedwyr went to him for instructions but returned saying that the king had shut himself in his chamber and would not see anyone this is not right cai asserted do you blame him bedwyr snapped his anger flared instantly none of this would have happened if not for us the fault is ours he struck himself on the chest with the flat of his hand the fault is ours i am going to him said cai stalking from the hall he returned a short while later without having seen the king and we spent a dismal day in an agony of bitter despair cymbrogi came and went throughout the day anxious for a good word but there was nothing to tell them dispirited dejected discouraged we slipped further into the besetting gloom at last unable to stomach the bile of guilt any longer i left my woeful companions and went in search of myrddin quitting the hall i moved along the corridor towards the warriors quarters passing by avallachs private chamber the door was open slightly and as i passed i heard the moan of a man in pain pausing i listened and when the sound did not come again i went to the door pushed it gently open and stepped inside arthur yet sat in his chair his head bowed upon his chest the feeble glimmer of a single candle casting its bravely futile light into the closegathered gloom oh and it tore at my heart to see him who was earth and sky to me sitting alone in that darkened chamber i regretted at once that i had intruded and turned to go away again but the king heard the sound of my soft footfall and said leave me his voice was not his own and the strangeness of it filled me with dread i cannot leave him like this i thought so turned and advanced it is gwalchavad i whispered approaching the chair at this he raised his head slightly black shadows clung to him as if to drag him down into the depths the room had grown chill and the king sat with neither cloak nor brazier to warm him a dragon torpid in his winter den even so the eyes that gazed at me from beneath the griefcreased brow were feverbright go away he muttered you can do nothing for me i thought i might sit with you i said wondering how it was possible for a man to decline so swiftly and completely a short while ago he had been aflame with righteous anger and now it had burned to ashes and those ashes were cold there was no other chair in the room so i stood awkwardly certain that i had made a mistake in coming and for arthurs sake regretting the intrusion i was just thinking how best to make my retreat when the king said he has raised me up only to dash my head against the rocks the hopelessness in his tone made me shudder for i knew whom he meant after a moment he continued saying i thought the time had come gwalchavad i thought the world would change and that we would bring peace and healing to the land i saw the kingdom of summer so clearly and i wanted it so arthurs voice became a strangled cry god help me i wanted it so he was silent for another long moment as if considering what he had just uttered i stood quietly and he seemed not to heed my presence any longer perhaps that is my failing wanting it too much he said at last i thought he wanted it too i was so certain i was never so certain of anything the king sank further into his chair only to start again out of it as rage suddenly overswept him three days he shouted his ragged cry ringing in the empty chamber taliesins vision myrddins work of a lifetime the promised realm of peace and light and it lasts all of three paltry days the cry became a moan god why why have you done this to me there was such good to be gained why have you turned against me why do you scorn me as if remembering my presence once more arthur shifted in his chair and looked at me i was betrayed he spat his voice harsh and thick betrayed by one of my own i loved him like a brother and trusted him i trusted him with my life and he repaid my trust with treachery he has taken the grail and he has taken my wife if morgian is at the root of this i ventured quietly then llenlleawg was likely bewitched he could not have done it otherwise the king seemed not to hear me however clenching his hand into a fist he struck it hard against his chest as if to quell the inner pain he did it again and i stepped nearer so as to prevent him from injuring himself should he persist but the fit passed and he slumped back in his chair weak with misery arthurs folly he muttered closing his eyes once more they come they come to see a miracle and find nothing but a heap of stone raised by a fool of a king i could no longer bear to see him berate himself so harshly at risk of rousing his wrath against me i spoke you could not know any of this would happen i said trying to soothe him king of fools arthur mocked hear me gwalchavad never trust an irishman the irish will stab you in the back every time if it is as the emrys believes it was morgian not llenlleawg who did this i said you could never have foreseen that you hold me blameless he sneered then why has destruction befallen me why am i forsaken why has god turned against me fearing i was making matters worse i hesitated arthur seized on my reluctance as confirmation of his failing there he shouted you see it too everyone saw it but me oh but i see it now he slammed his head sharply against the back of the chair with a cracking thump i see it now he said again his voice breaking with anguish and now it is too late arthur it is not too late i countered we will find llenlleawg and recover the grail everything will be made right again the kingdom of summer has not failed it must wait a little longer that is all i saw it gwalchavad he said closing his eyes again i saw it all he was exhausted and i thought at last he might allow sleep to overtake him if i kept his mind from wandering along the more distressing paths what did you see lord i saw the summer realm he replied his voice growing soft and dreamy i was dying i know that myrddin does not say it but i know i must have been very near death when he prevailed upon avallach to summon the grail avallach was against using the blessed cup in that way he paused and i made bold to suggest that he should rest now sleep lord you are tired sleep arthur growled how can i sleep when my wife is in danger he pressed his fingertips to his eyes as if to pluck them out of his head in a moment his hands dropped away and he continued gwenhwyvar came to me she was so brave she did not want to let me see her crying she kissed me for the last time as she thought and left me myrddin left too everyone left the tor and then avallach came into where i lay i realized that i was about to hear how arthur had been healed and restored to life by the grail so said no more about resting just now i did not see either of them at first arthur said his voice falling to a whisper at the memory but i knew avallach had entered the room and that the holy grail was with him for the bedchamber was suddenly filled with the most exquisite scent like a forest of flowers or a rainwashed meadow in full blossom like all the best fragrances i had ever known the scent roused me and i opened my eyes to see avallach kneeling beside me his hands cupped around an object that appeared to be a bowl arthur licked his lips as he must have licked them at the time and i opened my mouth to receive the drink and tasted the sweetest flavour the finest mead is as muddy water compared to it and this was merely the sweetness of the air i tasted but he had not brought me a drink as i supposed it was the grail itself infusing the very air with its exquisite savour arthur drew the air deep into his lungs now as he had then his tormented features smoothed as in memory he relived the marvel which had saved him i breathed the redolent air and the vapours of death which had clouded my mind parted and rolled away i came to myself again and knew myself in the presence of an eminent and powerful spirit not avallach only for though he is of great stature in the world of the spirit this other was more immense more profound more potent by far my own spirit hovering between life and death seemed a feeble fragile thing a bird caught in a bush weakly fluttering wings for release i was nothing beside them nothing my life had been wasted here i interrupted arthur it is not so you have ever held true to that which has been given you but the king would not hear it he shook his head in denial my life has been wasted in the pursuit of things mean and ordinary insignificant matters meaningless and swiftly forgotten peace and justice are not insignificant i countered alarmed to hear him talk so winning freedom for our people and our land is not meaningless nor will it be quickly forgotten this brought a wan pitying smile to the kings face dust he said nothing but dust carried away by the first wind that blows lost forever and forever unknown who but a fool regards the dust beneath his feet i made to protest again but he raised his hand saying let it be gwalchavad it matters not returning to his recounting he closed his eyes and lowered his head shame he said i have never known such shame it burned how it burned as if to consume me from within my guilt overwhelmed me guilt for the misuse of my life and the lives of so many many others i stood adjudged and knew myself condemned a thousand times over neither avallach nor the other with him so much as raised a finger in accusation they had no need my own spirit damned me to die before making atonement filled me with such remorse the tears flowed from my eyes in a flood as if to wash away the mountain of my guilt but oh the grail the grail was there and even as the world dimmed before my eyes avallach held the sacred bowl before me dipped in his finger and touched his fingertip to my forehead he sained me with the cross of christ it was as i thought the last rite for a dying man soon my soul would stand before the high king of heaven and i would face my judge yet even as avallach touched me with his fingertip i felt life surge within me i was alive what is more i was forgiven at avallachs touch i was at once healed and released from the guilt and shame of my squandered existence my former ways dropped from me like a sodden cloak and like an eagle borne up on the winds of a gale my soul rose from the pit and soared the joy the rapture the delight overwhelmed me and kindled within me a fire which blazed with the love of goodness and right and it was as if i stood on a high mountain looking down at the world far below i looked and saw a green and peaceful land spread out on the breast of the bluegreen sea i looked to see whence came this light and lo it was the grail i saw a shrine of stone set on a hill and established within this shrine the blessed cup of christ even as i beheld the cup a voice from heaven said feed the people heal the land the voice spoke these words three times and i saw britain shining like gold in the radiance of a light brighter than the sun what could this mean but that i should build the shrine and set the grail within it to shine as a beacon of truth and right throughout the land from britain would flow every good and perfect thing for the succour of the world all men would look to the island of the mighty and hope would be renewed ynys prydain would become that vessel through which great blessing would flow to all mankind i vowed that this would be my work hereafter to build the grail shrine that the blessed cup might begin transforming the world thus i stood up from my bed of death fully healed and possessed of an ardour to bring the vision granted me into living reality i went out and greeted my wife myrddin and llenlleawg were there too and all the fair folk the next day i took the work in hand and began laying plans for the grail shrine from that day i have held but one thought uppermost to honour my vow for the glory of god and the good of britain and her people this i have done he paused raising his eyes briefly only to turn them away again and for this i am brought down arthur lowered his chin to his chest once more and lifted a hand to his forehead leave me he said the glorious vision vanishing in the hollowness of his resignation i am tired gwalchavad leave me i stood for a moment longing to speak a word of solace to ease his hurt i am sorry arthur i said at last then crept away leaving the king to the cold misery of his woe twentyfive how many realms had morgian ruined how many men had she killed in her relentless pursuit of power how many lives had she destroyed myrddin said she had returned and i did not doubt it indeed it was not difficult to believe the relentless evervindictive morgian had somehow preserved a portion of her power when she fled to her stronghold safe in the distant fastness of her dark dominion she has been tirelessly assembling the remnants of her broken art from the wreckage even if morgian was not as strong as before she was still far more powerful than any other adversary mortal man could face dread morgian was yet a force to be reckoned with an implacable enemy as sly and deadly as any serpent and more wicked more hateful more vicious and rapacious than a whole host of demons these things i thought and my thoughts were true but no matter how hard i tried i could find no good explanation for morgaws who was she what was her part in the cruel treacheries breaking upon us myrddin i thought might hold the answers so to myrddin i went after a search that took most of the day i found him not with the king but in the old wooden shrine beside the abbey one of the monks had seen him enter the shrine at break of day i never saw him leave lord the monk said perhaps he is still there even now entering the shrine quietly i found him flat on his face before the tiny altar arms outstretched in the priestly attitude of prayer practised by the brown clerics lord emrys i said loath to speak at all but he was so still i feared him dead at the sound of his name he shifted gwalchavad he said raising his head he made to rise and i helped him to his feet how did you know to find me here i knew you had to be here i replied he lifted an eyebrow inquiringly and i added i have searched everywhere else this was the only place left he smiled at this and i saw the light in his eyes sharp and clear the fire restored and burning bright once more i have been praying he said all day he shrugged i did not mark the time i wish arthur had been with you instead of gnawing out his heart in his chamber i told him of my conversation with the king the night before is he there now asked myrddin as we stepped outside i think so he has shut the door against us and will see no one myrddin turned his farseeing eyes to the sky the sun was going down and a chill twilight was swiftly drawing a veil of mist over a dismal day will you go to him now i asked he needs you myrddin i will go to him promised the wise emrys starting down the path towards the lake but not yet he needs you now i insisted darting after him let him imbibe his despair myrddin said truly until he has drained that cup to the dregs he will not hear a word i say how long must we wait god alone knows i frowned at this answer and he saw it concern for the king is not what sent you looking for me lr think no i confessed though that is reason enough it is morgaws yes he stopped abruptly and turned to me have you remembered something the question caught me unawares remembered what do you mean the emrys made a sound of mild disgust in his throat and started walking again and i chased after him i was thinking who she might be i said quickly i know she is not morgian why do you say that no matter what guise morgian took i would always know her i answered confidently so would i myrddin declared besides i continued she appeared to me myrddin stopped walking again and i almost collided with him morgian appeared to you his eyes were daggers keen and bright and levelled at me when not long ago i said more hesitant now myrddin seized my arm and squeezed it hard why have you waited until now he demanded angrily releasing my arm and pushing it away she came to me in a dream i explained quickly at least i thought it was only a dream fool cried myrddin only a dream he says you should have told me i am sorry emrys believe me i never meant to keep anything from you myrddin stared at me hard then looked away and began walking again we had almost reached the lake we continued on in silence for a time before he spoke again when he did he said morgaws is morgians creature whether daughter or foundling i cannot say but she serves her mistress well though i did not doubt him i asked then why did we never suspect her before it is the simplest of all enchantments he replied and i waited for him to explain but he merely said we see what we think to see and llenlleawg again it is not difficult to bewitch the weak and willing he replied something in me bristled at the suggestion that the irish champion joined in the betrayal voluntarily what of gwenhwyvar it seems to me the queen was certainly neither weak nor willing who knows what they told her myrddin answered simply morgian is duplicity itself her powers of deception are astonishing then you are certain morgian is involved if there was any doubt finding pelleas brooch removed it you are convinced the brooch belonged to pelleas how not he said i gave it to him upon our return to the tor myrddin went his way alone i took myself off to the parapet where i held vigil deep into the night thinking about llenlleawgs betrayal and why everyone seemed so eager to hold him at fault for all that had happened when clearly if morgian was involved he was no doubt bewitched and bent to morgians evil purpose i was still struggling with this when towards dawn myrddin summoned the dragon flight to the kings chamber i hurried to join my swordbrothers many of whom myself included appeared to have spent another sleepless night wrestling with the guilt and shame of their failure no one spoke as we made our way along the corridor and to the door of arthurs chamber there waiting in the dimly lit passageway was myrddin carrying his staff his golden tore gleaming in the torchlight good he said and pushing open the heavy door strode boldly in to confront the pendragon he advanced to the foot of the throne raised the oaken staff and struck it smartly on the stone floor crack rise up arthur he cried in a loud voice and struck the floor again the time has come to rouse yourself from your sleep of despair wake and rise he raised the staff and struck the floor again the crack resounded like a peal of thunder as the wise emrys said the foe is at the gate and your queen is taken away she cries where is my deliverer i cry out in my cruel captivity where is my salvation when will my king arise arthur started the shock of the bards words struck him to the core and jolted him from his selfpitying misery gwenhwyvar lofting his staff myrddin advanced to stand before the throne the bard of britain lifted his voice and kindled the hearts of all who stood mute and dejected in that room why do you languish here when the treasure of britain is despoiled by the enemy why do you cover yourself in gloom while your noble wife is ravaged by her captors why do you yet delay while wickedness lays waste your realm arthurs shoulders slumped and his head fell but myrddin did not allow despair to reclaim him he stood before the king lifting the stricken monarch from the pit with the strength of his words stiffen your spine o king take up your spear and shield he cried gird yourself for battle and take your place at the head of the dragon flight the name of the enemy is known morgian has returned the queen of air and darkness is moving against you and her aim is destruction a murmur like a tingle of fear flitted through the gathered ranks of cymbrogi morgian crack myrddin struck the floor with his staff rise up o mighty pendragon save your kingdom and your queen for i tell you the truth if you sit by and do nothing you will lose all you hold most dear and when that is gone dread morgian will take your life as well your enemy will not be content until she has destroyed you body and soul i looked to the king and saw the colour flooding back into his ashen features the heart of britain was stirring again arise arthur bind steel to your hip and courage to your soul the time has come to choose fight or die there is no middle ground i felt within me the familiar rising to the call as arthur gripped the arms of his chair and heaved himself to his feet he yet appeared haggard and illdisposed but there was a glimmer of purpose in his eyes behold cried myrddin emrys with a flourish of his oaken staff the chief dragon arises in his strength tremble all who would oppose virtue and right flee to your dens in hell you citizens of corruption let all who practise evil beware your days are no more the high king of britain has set his face against you and the day of your doom is at hand arthur drew himself up and gazed upon his cymbrogi with a small movement of his hand he gestured the emrys to his place beside him cai he said quietly call the dragon flight to arms stalwart cai turned on his heel and shouted aloud to one and all brothers you have heard your king take up your swords and prepare for battle with one voice the cymbrogi gave out a mighty shout and the chamber rang with the sound of their battle cry everyone fled the chamber in a chaos of haste to be the first one ready and waiting for the command to ride out bedwyr the king said find me a sword bedwyrs hand fell instantly to the hilt of his own sword he drew the blade and laid it across his palms stepped to the throne and offered it to arthur take mine bear it will serve until we recover caledvwlch the king hesitated but bedwyr extended his hands insistently so arthur took up the sword stepped from the throne and walked out of the chamber we fell into step behind him resuming our longaccustomed places battlechiefs to the pendragon once more horses were saddled and wagons loaded with provisions we raced through our preparations as if to banish the days of misery and gloom when all was ready we assembled in the palace yard to await arthurs command it was not long in coming the king appeared before us bathed and shaved his hair scraped back and bound at his neck calm resolute he wore his red cloak and good mail shirt and carried bedwyrs sword at his side two daggers were tucked in his belt and his shield was on his shoulder it was a sight i had seen a hundred times if once and it ever lifted my spirits brave cymbrogi he said when the cries of acclamation were quieted the battle we join will not be won by strength of arms alone therefore heed the head of wisdom and take his words to heart with this myrddin emrys came to stand beside his king hear me sons of prydain he said raising his hands in the ancient way of the bard morgian is as deadly as she is evil wherever we are weakest she will find that place and that is where she will bring her powers to bear therefore let each man beware look to your souls my brothers for it is a spiritual battle that we undertake though we search for the grail cup and seek the release of the queen know you this it is nothing less than a quest for the restoration of holiness and the blessing of gods good favour i tell you the truth he continued solemnly morgians powers are great and many of us may die but though we lose life to her our souls remain in christ and forever beyond reach of the evil one we will do well to remember that when the day of travail is upon us therefore if any man is unshriven let him confess now and receive holy absolution for his sins indicating a row of brownrobed clerics across the yard he said the bishop and his priests even now stand ready to hear our confessions and offer forgiveness at this the good bishop stepped forward my friends brave ones i would have you ride into battle secure in your salvation remember the incorruptible cannot abide corruption and in the quest before you none but the pure of heart can succeed come then and purify your hearts of all unrighteousness any awkwardness in coming forward for shrift was quickly dispelled when arthur wholly without thought for his sovereign dignity stepped before the bishop knelt at the churchmans feet crossed his arms over his chest and bowed his head reverently if the high king of britain could humble himself in this way no man of lesser rank need feel belittled in the sight of his friends indeed more than one warrior who held himself begrudged made peace with his swordbrother so as to enter gods presence reconciled it is no disgrace to tell you that i myself concerned for my soul and the tribulations ahead knelt on the cold stones of the dusty yard and made my confession knowing full well it might be my last after the confessions we received assurances of our forgiveness and the bishop invited us to share the bread and wine of christs table in a last meal of holy communion we did eat the bread of the blessed jesus body and drink the wine of his blood and then fifty warriors rose as one man to face a relentless subtle vicious and implacable foe thus we rode out from the tor a fighting force equipped for battle against a foe unlike any other we had faced upon reaching the trail beyond the abbey we turned not east but south myrddin emrys held it a gesture of futility to attempt raising the daysold trail i believe the only traces we would see are those morgian desired us to see he declared we have been her playthings from the beginning mark me arthur llyonesse is where battle will take place llyonesse i shuddered inwardly at the word dread stole over me and it took a very great effort of will to hold fear at bay courage heavens bright warriors stand ready to aid us gods own servants go before us to prepare a way in the wasteland twentysix with every step closer to llyonesse apprehension mounted within me as the short winter day faded to the chill of a damp twilight i found opportunity to speak to myrddin while the cymbrogi set about making camp i saw the emrys laying a fire outside the kings halfraised tent and went to him allow me emrys i said there is no need he replied once of a time if there was to be warmth at all it was my chore to provide the fire i do little enough providing these days he glanced up at me quickly then continued arranging the twigs and breaking up the larger branches sit down summerhawk he said no one else save my father called me that and tell me what is on your mind folding my legs under me i settled on the ground before the firering i watched as he deftly snapped the branches and placed them onto the carefully stacked pile after a few moments i saw a thin tendril of smoke rising from the tinder although i never saw him strike steel to flint you seem certain morgaws has fled to llyonesse i said watching the smoke waft slowly upward in the still evening air how do you know i little doubted the emrys would have sound reason for his judgment i merely wished to hear it i know because morgian is guiding her and llyonesse is the one place in all this worldsrealm where morgian can move at will he replied she seems to have no difficulty moving anywhere she pleases i observed morosely no myrddin countered that is why she needs morgaws i believe morgian no longer commands all the power she once possessed and now she must use others to further her dark purposes morgaws leads us to llyonesse where morgian waits like a spider spinning her webs surrounding herself with lies and deceit and yet llyonesse is where her power was broken i pointed out referring to the time he had last faced the queen of air and darkness yes he agreed sitting back on his heels as a yellow flame fluttered to life among the dry twigs in llyonesse morgians power was broken and i think she has returned to that heavenforsaken land in order to reclaim it through our defeat considering the theft of the grail and the easy abduction of the queen i said perhaps she has reclaimed her power already perhaps myrddin allowed showing neither fear nor surprise at the thought either way llyonesse is where we will stand or fall where will we find her i believe she will find us answered the wise emrys but i suspect she will draw us to the place where she met her defeat i know the place a hill not far from the western coast there was a fair folk settlement on that hill long ago if she does not attack us on the way that is where we shall go do you fear her myrddin he watched the fire for a moment before answering i fear her greatly gwalchavad he said quietly abandon any hopes you harbour that we shall escape the full impact of her malice we will not morgian has determined the fight and chosen the battleground that suits her best the queen of air and darkness will not spare us the least torment or travail our journey will be an ordeal of suffering yet we go to meet her we go to meet her he replied because we have no other choice arthur did not join us at the fire that night his usual custom when we were encamped but took food in his tent admitted no one save rhys who served him and emerged only at dawn the next morning when we moved on we continued as before riding in a long double rank south and west slowly leaving behind the friendly hills of the summer realm and passing into the arid droughtblasted barrens of llyonesse the pendragon with myrddin at his right hand led the way and i who had already traversed this perilous path rode with rhys just behind them so as to be close to hand if needed bors rode behind me followed by long ranks of warriors stretching back and back fifty strong bedwyr cai and cador were given command of the rearward forces and took their places far down the line the sun never bright passed low over the southern hills before sinking once more the dreary day dwindled away to a long lingering dusk mist gathered thick on the trail and dull clouds lowered above the voices of the men grew quieter by degrees until we moved in a netherworld between two skies a world devoid of colour light and any sound save the steady clop clop clop of the horses hooves hollow and slow on the bare hard ground as the last fleeting glimmer of light faded in the west we glimpsed a rise of fog on the trail ahead the closer we came the more dense it grew billowing higher and higher until it resembled nothing so much as a massive wall towering over us unwilling to enter the fog blindly arthur halted the columns a few hundred paces away so that he might observe for a time strange that it does not move myrddin said to arthur though he spoke low his voice carried on the unnaturally still air i advise caution the day is going and we are losing the light the king pointed out we might make camp here and hope the weather clears tomorrow there is no wood for a fire bedwyr put in then we will do without arthur said making up his mind it makes a cold night for us but that is better than risking our necks on a trail we cannot see at a nod from the king rhys raised the hunting horn and signalled the cymbrogi to dismount we made camp and spent a chill damp night on the trail dawnlight the next morning revealed that the bank of fog had not shifted or dissipated indeed it now appeared more solid and imposing than before a vast gently seething eminence beyond which neither eye nor ear could penetrate the wall of mist lay across our path as if marking out the line of battle as if an enemy had thrown up a defensive rampart and carved upon it the words cross over if you dare we crossed of course having no better choice there was no riding around it and waiting was pointless we formed tight columns and marched forward breasted the wall and passed into the mist i could make out rhys beside me but arthur and myrddin ahead and those behind were hazy halfformed figures floating at the perimeter of sight and beyond that i could see nothing as the fog closed like a tight woollen glove around us i spared a fleeting thought for the phantom legion was this how legio xxii augustus met its uncanny fate had they like us marched into the mist and into the realm of the undead never to return the mist so close and thick stole away every sound even the hollow plod of the horses hooves and the dull jingle of the tack the world seemed still and cold and silent as if offering us a foretaste of death i ignored the damp chill and gazed staunchly into the quiet unchanging void and was surprised when after a time i began to hear an odd rhythmic drumming looking around i could not locate the source of the disturbing sound until i realized it was the very blood pulsing in my ears with every beat of my heart in addition to banishing sight and sound the fog was heavy and wet within moments of entering the mist i felt the chill weight settle on my shoulders and the cold trickle of water along my spine water beaded on my face and moustache and ran down my head and neck i gathered my sodden cloak around me lowered my head and rode on thinking i have been cold before and i have ridden in mist many times and will again it is winter after all and mist and fog are to be expected this is just poor weather nothing more we journeyed an eternity or so it seemed with neither light nor shadow to mark the passing day time dwindled and stretched and then stood still once my horse stumbled over a rock and i came awake with a cry glancing quickly around i found everything as it was before dense cloying fog pressing in on every side nothing had changed nevertheless i felt vexed at having slept for try as i might i could not remember falling asleep gwalchavad said rhys his voice close i could make out my companion as a disembodied head peering anxiously back at me as if through a depth of clouded water the face of a drowned man bloodless and cold and pale as a fish all at once it came into my mind to warn arthur the river i shouted surprising even myself with the sudden outcry arthur stop there is a river ahead arthurs reply was quick and decisive rhys the horn he said sound the halt an instant later came the blast of the horn signalling the column to stop arthur passed word back through the ranks to dismount and rest the horses i slid from the saddle and walked a few paces ahead to where myrddin and arthur waited the river is treacherous with quicksand i told them i lost my horse to it last time arthur regarded me with a bemused expression on his face we can see nothing of the trail ahead how can you be certain we are anywhere near the river his question brought me up short before he asked i had been sure we were ready to topple over the brink but now as i observed their expressions of perplexity and concern the certainty so solid and secure just a moment before crumbled away to nothing i looked to the track before us and saw only the dull blankness of the allobscuring fog i was saved from having to explain when myrddin calmly concerned said come it will not hurt to walk ahead a little he and arthur dismounted and we proceeded up the trail we had moved only a few paces however when my feet began sinking into soft mud arthur beside me took another step and his foot splashed into shallow water he stopped at once turned towards me and opened his mouth to speak but before he could say a word his feet were sucked down into the quagmire he threw out a hand which i seized and pulled towards me we stumbled backward together onto solid ground well done gwalchavad he commended the first rider in would have been lost myrddin observed that first rider would have been me arthur declared shaking cold mud from his feet and others would have followed me in stay near said the king gripping my shoulder i have need of your discernment that was all he said but i sensed urgency in his touch what little i have is yours lord i said lightly how do we get across wondered cador coming up behind us there is a fording place some way up the valley i told him lead on gwalchavad the king commanded we will follow you as before by the time we reached the fording the day was spent rather than attempt the crossing in the dark we made camp and waited to cross the river until morning hoping against hope that the mist might lift during the night there were thickets of bramble and furze abounding along the riverside and the cymbrogi set about hacking at the roots with their swords quickly gathering whole bushes into a great heap which myrddin promptly set alight the resulting flame burned with a foul black smoke but the heat and light were welcome nonetheless we hung our wet clothes over the prickly branches of lowgrowing gorse and stood basking in the warmth trying to drive the cold and damp from our bones some put their boots on sticks and held them near the flames to dry them when the fire died down to a comfortable blaze we prepared our supper glad for a hot meal at last we ate in small huddles of men hunched over our bowls as if afraid the cold and darkness might try to steal away the little warmth and light we held still it was good to get something hot inside us and our spirits improved immeasurably so much so in fact that cai having finished his meal set aside his bowl stood up and called for a song are we to allow the dolour of the day to gnaw at our souls until there is nothing left but a sour rind he raised his voice as if to challenge a foe are we to sit shivering before the fire muttering like old women taking fear at every shadow several of the older warriors knowing cai answered him in kind never they shouted rattling their knives against their bowls never are we not the dragon flight of arthur pendragon cried cai his arm raised high in the air are we not true men of ynys prydain we are called the cymbrogi more joining in with every shout we are well then cai declared his broad face glowing with pleasure in the firelight let us defy this illfavoured night with a song a song the cymbrogi cried every man was with him now shouting for a song to roll aside the gloom and woe with that cai flung out his arm towards myrddin sitting a few paces away well myrddin emrys you hear the men we would have a song to bind vigour to our souls and courage to our hearts a song myrddin a song to the hearty acclaim of all the emrys rose slowly motioning to rhys to fetch his harp he took his place before the fire and the cymbrogi crowded in around him if you would hear a tale myrddin began then listen well to what i say the enemy encircles us and dogs our every step therefore let us take up whatever weapon comes to hand tonight we raise a song tomorrow a prayer and one day soon a sword in the darksome days to come let each man resolve within himself to hold to the light that he has been given so saying myrddin reached for the harp rhys had brought him and began to pluck the strings he bent his head and put his cheek against the smooth polished wood of the instrument and closed his eyes in a moment the seemingly idle strumming became purposeful everyone arthur included leaned forward as the bard of britain opened his mouth and began to sing twentyseven when the dew of creation was still on the ground myrddin sang his voice rising like a graceful bird taking flight a great king arose in the westerlands and manawyddan was his name so mighty was this king and of such renown that all nations held him lord over them and sent their best warriors to his court to pledge their loyalty and serve him at arms and this is the way of it manawyddan fair and true received the warriors and bade them wait upon him in his hall when all were gathered there and ready the noble lord arrayed himself in his fine cloak took up his rod of kingship and mounted his throne he gazed out upon the assembly and thought to himself a thousand times blessed am i no man ever wanted better companions in truth each man among them could have been king in his own realm had he not chosen to pledge faith with manawyddan the great kings heart was touched by the glory of his warhost and so he bade them stay a while with him that they all might enjoy a feast he would give in their honour when the feast was prepared the warriors noblemen all came and filled the benches at table where they were provided with the best food that was ever placed before men of valour from that faroff time to this what is more whatever food any warrior preferred whether the flesh of deer or pigs or beef or the delicate meat of roast fowls or succulent salmon he had but to dip his knife into the bowl before him and that food was provided the warriors were delighted with this wonder and acclaimed their host with loud approval so clamorous were they in their praise that manawyddan was moved to decree another wonder he ordered golden ale tubs to be set up in all four corners of the hall and one beside his throne he then summoned his serving boys to bring drinking bowls of silver and gold to his noble guests and invited them to plunge their cups into the foaming brew this they did and when each man raised bowl to lips he found the drink he liked best whether ale or mead or wine or good dark beer when they had drunk the health of their sovereign host the noble guests accorded such vaunted praise that manawyddans great heart swelled to hear it he pulled his golden tore from around his throat put aside his fine cloak and stepped down from his throne to join in the feast moving from table to table and bench to bench eating and drinking with his guests sharing the feast as one of them when hungers keen edge had been dulled against the bounty of the groaning boards king manawyddan called for his bards to regale the company with tales of mighty deeds songs of love and death of courage and compassion of faith and treachery one after another the bards appeared providing a feast for the soul each one finer and more accomplished than the last the last bard to sing was kynwyl truthsayer chief bard of manawyddan who had just begun the tale of the three prodigious quaffings when there came a shout from outside the hall the shout became a cry and then a keening beginning loud and growing louder and louder still until it shook the entire stronghold to its deep foundations and every mortal creature within the stout walls covered his ears and trembled inwardly then when the bold company thought they must be undone by the terrible sound it stopped the warrior host looked at one another and saw that they were covered in the sweat of fear for none of them had ever heard a cry like this tortured beyond endurance beyond hope before they could wonder who might have made a cry of such wounding torment the hightopped doors of the hall burst open and a tremendous wind swept through the hall a fierce gale like those which rage in the wintry northern seas the warrior band braved the icy blast and when it had abated at last they looked and saw a lady standing in their midst the stranger had the look of a queen and she was dressed all in grey from crown to heel her face was hidden beneath a hood of grey and she had three grey hounds beside her manawyddan was first to recover his wits he approached the woman his hands open and inviting i give you good greeting he said speaking in a kindly voice you are welcome here though you may find the companionship of women more to your liking if so i will summon the maidens of my court that you may be made comfortable in their presence think you i have come seeking comfort and pleasure the grey lady snapped haughtily i was merely offering you the hospitality of my court replied manawyddan unless you tell us we will never know why you have burst in among us was it to put an end to our enjoyment you may keep your hospitality remarked the woman tartly i have done with all kindliness and generosity the gentle pursuits i once enjoyed are more bitter to me now than death and ashes indeed i am sorry to hear it manawyddan replied sadly tell me what i may do to restore warmth and tenderness to your heart and rest assured that before the sun has set on another day i will have done all anyone can do what is more the men who even now fill this hall are no less ready to aid me in this endeavour this handsome offer was thrown back in the kings face for the lady offered only a grim mocking laugh in reply lady said manawyddan why do you persist in this uncouth behaviour i have made a kings vow to do all that can be done to aid you in any way you desire i am certain that my men and i can meet and overcome any difficulty end any oppression right any wrong and thus redress whatever hurt or harm has befallen you this heartstirring speech received the acclaim of all who heard it the noblemen lauded their monarch and pledged themselves to the grey ladys service but the strange woman scorned their pledges can you raise the dead o great king she laughed and her laughter was bitterness itself can you restore life to a corpse on which the carrion crows have feasted can you make the blood flow once more in the veins when that blood has soaked the earth and the living heart is but a lump of cold meat in the breast can you o wondrous manawyddan return the warm gaze of love to an eye which has been cut out and thrown to the dogs hearing this manawyddans great heart surged with grief for the ladys plight lady your sorrow has become my sorrow and your woe my own but know this the full weight of the sadness you feel now seven times that much will be visited upon the one who has caused your lament at this the mysterious lady bowed her head and professed herself well pleased knowing manawyddan would honour his vow to the last breath in his body she then began to tell the king what had transpired to bring about her ruin the warriors pressed close around to hear and between the telling and the hearing it was difficult to say which was the more distressing i was not always the grey hag you see before you now the lady said once i was beautiful but mourning has made me old and dry before my time listen then if you would learn the reason for my travail i am the daughter of a mountain king called rhongomynyad a ruler both wise and good who fell ill of a night and died not long after i was left alone to rule in his place until i should marry and my husband relieve me of that tedious duty as one might expect from the moment my fathers demise was made known in the world the path to my stronghold was crowded with suitors seeking to win my approval truth to tell though i never found any of these hopeful young men remotely to my liking still i did not grow weary of the chase one day as the customarily disappointing flock of suitors ambled through the fortress gates my eye chanced upon a tall young man fair in face and form slender but not too thin handsome but not vain proud but not arrogant kind but not simpering generous but not profligate canny but not conceited friendly but not flighty trustworthy but not dour in short my heart kindled with love for him the moment his eye met mine we spent the day and all the days to follow in close companionship and my love grew greater each time we met before the summer was over we were betrothed our wedding was to be held in the spring and i could turn aside from the duties of sovereignty which weighed so heavily upon me like all betrothed couples we made our plans and dreamed our dreams and my love for my beloved was as allconsuming as the flame of an everburning fire then one day while my beloved was tending to affairs in his fathers realm a darkclothed man came striding into my court without so much as a tender glance in my direction he declared himself king by virtue of his skill at arms and challenged any who would dispute him to draw sword or heft spear and have at it to my shame and outrage no one would defend me all the young men who stood in my court shrank away shaking with fear for like a man in most respects in stature this dark foe was nothing less than a giant standing two men high he was broad of shoulder and long of arm his weapons were black iron and his shield iron too it took two men just to heft his axe and three to raise that weighty shield nevertheless my beloved soon heard what had happened and up he jumped calling for his sword belt and spear he called for his horse to be saddled and his shield to be burnished he mounted his horse and rode straightaway to take up the challenge the two met on the path leading to my fortress and the narrow valley between two mountains became the battleground alas they fought the combat was fierce and alas my best beloved was killed the black oppressor fell upon the body of my beloved plucked the eyes from his head and threw them to the hounds then he hewed the eyeless head from those fair shoulders and stuck it upon his iron spear he set the spear over the gate of my fortress as a reminder to all who passed beneath the bloodless head that he now ruled the realm that same day he claimed me for his wife and had me bound and borne to my chamber which he had taken for his own he then demanded a meal to be prepared and served him in the hall he said it was to be our marriage feast the glutton devoured seven pigs three oxen nine lambs and drank four vats of ale while i touched not a morsel while the black giant feasted in my hall i bound courage to my heart and determined that when he came for me i would either be dead or gone i struggled free of my bonds and then sought my escape alas the door was securely barred and there was no other way out i bade farewell to life taking up the ropes that had bound me i knotted the lengths together to make a noose which with trembling hands i placed around my neck i was even then tightening the noose when one of my serving maids entered the chamber she had come to light the fire in the hearth so that the chamber would be warm for my hideous bridegroom and me when she saw the killing ropes around her ladys neck she threw herself upon me and vowed to help me escape if i would only take her with me i agreed at once and we stole that instant from the chamber pausing only to set fire to the bed from that dire day to this the grey lady concluded i i have wandered where i would seeking justice and retribution most miserable of women am i never has any creature shown himself man enough to meet the black giant in combat and rescue my realm and my people even so to show you i am in earnest and virtue is with me wherever i go i offer this promise any man who slays the black oppressor shall that day have me for his bride and my kingdom and all i possess fortunate is the man who takes me to wife she added for i know well what i am worth great manawyddan cast his gaze upon the gathered warriors each one more accomplished and stalwart than the last you have heard the ladys tale of woe he said who among you will take up the challenge who will slay this vile being and restore the ladys kingdom who among you will cover himself in glory and bring honour to this court at once there arose a tremendous outcry as the doughty warriors strove to make themselves heard each above the other but the man who carried the day was the kings own champion a warrior of vast renown and llencellyn was his name my king and lord said llencellyn when he had gained his sovereigns ear may i be bound in chains and hurled into the sea if i do not avenge this lady and restore her realm before three days have passed the great king smiled for he expected no less of his champion manawyddan extolled the warriors resolve saying go then llencellyn with my blessing i charge you to remember that though all the fiends of hell stand against you yet with the help of the swift sure hand you must surely prevail up leapt llencellyn and called for his weapons and his horse when he had armed himself he then mounted his fine steed and called to the lady to lead him to her realm that he might kill the giant without delay and win himself a wife and kingdom the grey lady mounted her yellow mare and led the kings champion away the men of manawyddans court were not content to stand idly by and await the combats outcome how can we stay here while our swordbrother faces this peril they cried o king of might let us follow them to the place of combat so that we might see how llencellyn fares this they did following the champions trail to the battleground arriving just in time to see llencellyn strike the first of many stout blows any one of which would have been enough to fell the strongest enemy curiously the more llencellyn fought the stronger grew the giant with every wellplaced stroke of the champions sword the black giants strength increased and llencellyns grew the less the king and all his warhost looked on in horror as their renowned champions strength waned until no longer able to lift the blade llencellyns arm faltered the black oppressor keen for the kill drove in the instant the sword blade fell up went the cruel iron axe and down without mercy striking the champion squarely in the centre of his helm the giants blade sliced the warhelm and passed through skin and flesh and bone and brain as if through empty air cleaving the dauntless champions head in two all the host stood bereft and watched in agony and grief as the black oppressor leapt upon the corpse and hacked poor llencellyns body into small pieces and then trampled those pieces into the ground those that is which the hounds did not devour he then turned to the stricken company and jeered who will be next to chance with death when no one made bold to answer the evil lord manawyddan cried out if my men have lost their courage so be it far better for me to die fighting than to go to my grave a coward and the king of cowards bring me my sword and shield this speech shamed the assembled warriors though not enough for any to overcome their terror of the giant they all looked at one another and shrugged as if to say if that is the way the king wants it who are we to disagree meanwhile the kings weapons were brought and the king began to gird himself for the battle which would certainly be his last yet while the king was strapping on his sword belt a slender young man approached knelt before him and said please lord i am your servant the king had never seen the youth before and said forgive me lad but i have no time for tact too soon i shall be feeding hungry ravens and quenching the parched soil with my blood who are you and what do you want my name replied the stripling youth is of little importance i am new to your court and have not yet distinguished myself in arms and thus i have doubtless escaped your notice yes yes snapped manawyddan irritably if you have something to say say it quickly i beg the boon of trying my hand against the black oppressor the youth said simply well your courage is sound but i misdoubt your intelligence fine and mighty warriors who have tried to slay this black oppressor now sleep in turf houses what makes you think you little more than a boy and a skinny boy at that can succeed where battlechiefs the like of llencellyn have failed so miserably to this the lad replied young i may be but i have never yet met an enemy who can stand against me clearly you cannot have faced many foemen the king declared sadly that i suspect is the secret of your success regard me not too lightly the youth warned his assurance undimmed for i have succeeded by reason of a strange endowment with which i have been favoured manawyddan leaned on his spear and sighed am i ever to learn the end of this perhaps it was pointless conversation that laid all your adversaries low not at all the youth assured the king solemnly i owe my triumph to the fact that having no strength of my own whenever i take the field the might of my opponents is granted me in double measure son manawyddan replied shaking his head sadly i have lived a very long time in this worldsrealm and have heard many strange things but i never heard of anything like that he paused regarding the slender youth with great suspicion if i believed even the smallest part of what you said to be true i might allow you to try your hand as it is i fear i would merely be delaying my own death with the purchase of yours as a king of renown and a leader of warriors i consider it far beneath me to even contemplate such a thing well answered the youth happily there is something in what you say of course but from where i stand it appears your vaunted warhost has made the selfsame bargain with your life as you fear making with mine indeed your warriors fearless to a man no doubt have given you up for dead before you have even lofted spear or lifted blade tread lightly here the king growled in warning for you are talking about men tested in the straits of battle nevertheless i find myself sorely tempted to grant your entreaty though it be your last i could always fight the giant tomorrow i suppose the shaveling youth smiled and bowed to the great king truly you are a sovereign worthy of the name the lad replied you have but to grant my plea and reap the reward manawyddan sighed would that it were so rest assured you will never hear a word of reproach from me said the youth give me a sword only then stand aside and watch what i will do lord manawyddan chief dragon of the island of the mighty gave the youth the sword from his hand and called for his shieldbearers to arm the lad with spear and dagger helm and belt as well but the young man shook his head firmly saying either this blade will suffice or it will not if it will then nothing else is needed if it will not then nothing else will help summon the giant and let us set to the day stretches long and i am growing hungry the black oppressor who had long since retired to his hall to gloat over his loathsome triumph was duly summoned by a blast of the kings horn what is this the giant grumbled in a voice like low thunder who disturbs my rest can it be the mighty manawyddan has finally gathered his courage into a heap and wishes now to weigh its worth against the standard of my blade say nothing you wish not to regret the valiant lord advised it is not myself who is judge over you but whatever god made you and that soon before you stands the youth who will do for you as you have done for so many others the black giant laughed long and hard at this then he looked upon the youth standing white and naked before him armed with nothing but a sword that was so overlarge he had to clutch it tight in both hands just to raise it lad rumbled the giant wiping tears of mirth from his eyes of all the warriors i have slaughtered i cannot remember killing any as foolish as you the slender youth stepped smartly forward dragging the sword with him only sow what you wish to reap the lad replied evenly if there was the slightest quiver of fear in his voice no one heard it in his eagerness to kill again the giant licked his thick foul lips and grinned down at the fair youth hefting his war axe and testing the keenness of its blade with his thumb the black oppressor said come then it will be a joy to send you hence beware i am not so easily killed as you might think angered by the youths indifference the black giant gave a roar that curdled the marrow of all who heard it for twelve hides around he raised the iron axe high above his head and brought it down with such a vicious chop that everyone looked away lest they see something they devoutly wished later to forget when the axe made no sound they opened their eyes and turned once more to where the youth stood expecting no doubt to see his body halved like a carcass for the spit but no the young man was still standing what is more he appeared more hale than before indeed he seemed to have grown a handspan taller and his slender limbs were thicker the giant gaped in amazement and looked at the axe in his fist as if he expected it to offer an explanation rage bubbled up like molten lead within him and he roared again shaking the ground with the blast up swept the axe blade and down the youth effortless as a willow in spring stepped lightly aside as the wicked blade shaved the empty air my father always taught me that war is a bane and the chief of mans afflictions the youth intoned mildly his voice had deepened and his arms well muscled now raised the blade and held it steadily before him perhaps it is a lesson you should have learned glowering murderously his black face growing blacker in its fury the giant screamed how dare you condemn me just you stand still and we will see who is the master here the giant lunged wildly at the youth who met his charge with a swift kick which stopped the black enemy in his tracks the giant stunned by the blow doubled over in pain the youth stood leaning on his sword a few paces away as his adversary heaved his dinner onto the ground it is a shame to waste a good meal taunted the youth but then you were always a wastrel and a destroyer tell me how does your victory taste now is it still as sweet in your mouth or has it all gone sour with a cry to crack the sky the black oppressor heaved up the iron axe the cruel weapon seemed much heavier now and it took all his strength just to raise it and balance it above his head the blade hung in the air its honed edge glinting sharp in the sunlight the youth head and shoulders rising level with those of the black oppressors raised the kings sword and flicked the axe blade away as if it had been a feather the ease with which he had been disarmed inflamed the giant beyond all restraint or reason lowering his head he threw wide his arms and ran at the young man intent on crushing the youth in his allencircling grasp the giant made but three paces before his legs gave out and he toppled facefirst onto the ground the collision drove the breath from the wicked foemans lungs and caused the earth to tremble and shake as if to draw the mountains down but the young man towering over the giant now stepped to the vile enemy and lopped off his head with an easy stroke of manawyddans sword saying never more will you trouble the good people of this realm the king and all his tribe stood blinking in astonishment at what they had seen for the space of six heartbeats not a sound was to be heard in all the world and then with a great shout of relief they all rushed forward to acclaim the wonderful youth and his astounding triumph over the black oppressor manawyddan was first to laud the youth and led his people in a song of praise in the young mans honour the grey lady threw off her hood ran to the youth and put her arms around his neck for as soon as the giant was dead the lad had assumed his former shape and size the lady kissed him and declared loudly for all to hear truly you are a champion among men this day you have won your kingdom and your queen abashed by the tumult the young man blushed crimson from top to toe taking the ladys arms from around his neck he said though your offer is kindness itself i must ask your pardon and decline my course is set before me for i am directed by another hand lord manawyddan was saddened to hear these words what he cried will you not stay with us my champion is slain and i have need of another you i think more than deserve that place the youth only smiled and begged to be excused the honour alas i cannot stay even a moment longer he said and explained how it was his geas to roam the width and breadth of the world and offer his aid wherever it was needed leave if you must said manawyddan but please do not go away emptyhanded you have but to name your reward and to the half of my kingdom it is yours smiling still the young man declined once more i have what is needful and more would avail me nothing looking at the warriors gathered close around the young man said good king honour me instead in these who have been given you do not hold their fright against them men are only dust after all the king marvelled the more at these words go then said manawyddan and with my blessing yet i would not have you leave us before i learned your name the young man smiled at this do you not know me yet he asked the king answered son i never laid eyes on you before this day who are you lad to which the stranger replied i am the youth of a thousand summers he then bade everyone farewell and passing among them disappeared in much the same way as he had arrived unseen and unguessed when he had gone the grey lady threw open the gates of her stronghold and invited manawyddan and his warrior host to feast with her and her people in celebration of their deliverance the king though still less than elated with the fainthearted behaviour of his warband accepted they all went into the queens hall and feasted for three days and three nights in the most pleasant fellowship they had ever known men and women sat down together and soon found themselves sharing the feast with the one they loved best one by one each couple came before their ruler to beg the boon of marriage all were duly married and the celebration continued as a wedding feast and their joy was made complete gazing out upon all the feasting couples the queen observed it is right and good that our people should unite our kingdoms in this way i only wish that i could share their happiness and increase it with my own to this lord manawyddan replied god knows i am setting a poor example for my people if all of them are married and i myself have no queen turning to the lady beside him he said i may not be a giantslayer but i know i would be a better king than i have ever been if you would be my wife lady he said taking her hand in his will you marry me the grey lady smiled easily and said and here was i thinking you would never ask yes my king i will marry you this pleased the king greatly here we are to be married he declared and i do not even know your name my name is rhiannon the grey lady answered so saying the queen threw off her grey hood and cloak to reveal a dress all of gold with jewels each more costly than the last and tiny pearls sewn with thread of braided silver her hair was redgold and braided fine her skin white as milk her flesh supple and her smoothcheeked face lovely to look upon the sight of her pleased manawyddan well and he married her at once lest she somehow slip from his grasp the king then presented his new queen to the people and the noble couple made their way through the hall giving gifts to one and all the celebration was renewed to the delight of every creature high or low living in the realm behold when they rose from the table three hundred years had passed them unawares nor had they suffered the predations of age for every man and woman was as hale as the moment he or she had first sat down indeed not so much as a single silver hair was to be seen on any head and even those whose brows had been creased by care were seen to be as smooth and cheerful as the day each was born from that moment the combined kingdoms of rhiannon and manawyddan became known as the isle of the everliving the realm flourished as never before producing a bounty of all good things and becoming the envy of all the world many tales are told of this enchanted island but this tale is finished let him hear it who will twentyeight the grail is mine the single most potent talisman in all the world and it is mine oh morgaws my lovely one you have done better than you know better even than that simple sot of a nephew of mine will ever know and to think avallach had it all this time all these years avallach kept it hidden away never sharing the secret with anyone of course if i had so much as imagined avallach possessed such a relic i would have taken it long ago he would never have given it to me when did avallach ever give me anything truly if he had ever favoured me with even the crumb of consideration he shows the hound sniffing around his stables things might be far different now but did the mighty fisher king ever lift a finger for me never it was all for charis always for charis she had everything and i had nothing taliesin should have been mine together we would have ruled britain forever charis goddess of the stinking masses will yet curse the day of her birth i might have killed her any of a thousand times it would have been so easy but death would merely end her suffering and i want her torment to linger long no it will not be charis who dies it will be the wretched merlin and his clumsy creature arthur swiftly followed by his simpering slut of a queen and her oxbrained champion they will all go weeping and wailing to their graves but not before they have seen their ridiculous dream destroyed by the one real power in this world they had the grail the fools they had it in their hands and failed to discern what it was they held well before i am finished they will rue their ignorance they will gnaw out their own bowels with regret they will claw out their own eyes as they watch their absurd kingdom of summer all sweetness and light shrivel away like dung on a hot rock this will cause avallach no end of pain literally for now that i have the grail the pain will truly last forever rising the next morning we formed the columns and journeyed deeper into the wasteland the wind was cold out of the northwest but the sky stayed clear and bright and i took heart for the pendragon was in better spirits than i had seen him since the grail disappeared this i surmise was to myrddins credit his song had put everyone in fine mettle though far far ahead on the horizon i could see the dark greyblue cloud line of a winter storm rising in the south i considered we were more than a match for whatever came our way by midday the storm had made little progress and i began to think it might pass us by or hold off altogether when we stopped to make camp for the night i walked with myrddin to a nearby hill to see what we might learn of the region the sun was setting in a violent blaze of red and grey pointing to the heavy band of blueedged darkness clearly visible on the horizon i said i have been watching it all day but the storm has not advanced a whit yes he murmured absently squinting his golden eyes against the glowing sky myrddin surveyed the long blueblack line i observed that the wind which had been at our backs through the day had died down now and the land was quiet save for a small distant rhythmic rumbling like that of ocean waves pounding against cliffs at last the wise emrys said when we discussed your sojourn in llyonesse you said nothing about a forest why was that gwalchavad lord emrys i said turning my face towards him i mentioned no forest for the simple reason that there was no forest lifting a hand to the squat stripe sitting thick and dusky on the far horizon myrddin replied there is a forest now how can this be i wondered aloud doubting him never occurred to me i did not think we had come so far out of our way we must have wandered further astray in the fog than i imagined no gwalchavad myrddin said we have not wandered out of our way he turned and began walking back to camp leaving me to ponder the more subtle implications of his words did he mean i wondered that the forest had grown up since i had last passed this way or that the forest was always there but i had not seen it could i have ridden through a forest and never noticed a single tree either alternative was as unlikely as the other possibly some bedevilment had blinded me to it or caused me to forget i decided to ask peredur about this and discover what he remembered i found the young warrior helping raise the picket line for the night as when in war arthur had commanded the horses to be picketed rather than tethered so they might be readied more quickly should need arise i called him from his work follow me i have something to show you i said leading him away he fell into step beside me and i asked do you remember when we were here last time i have been trying my best to forget well i would ask if you recall passing through a forest during our sojourn in llyonesse forest he exclaimed why the place is barren as a desert as you very well know if we had realizing that i was in earnest peredur stopped and regarded me strangely lord forgive me but i thought you in jest why would you ask such a thing we gained the hilltop where myrddin and i had just stood there i pointed to the bruisecoloured line hugging the gently undulating southern horizon and said see now a forest where none was seen before peredur gaped at the sight glanced at me and then returned his gaze to the tree line visible now as a blueblack band below a swiftly fading twilight sky it might be clouds only the emrys is in no doubt i replied trees not clouds the young mans face squirmed into a frown myrddin cannot be faulted i suppose he allowed reluctantly it must be that we strayed far from the trail when we rode in the fog his tone did nothing to quell my suspicions but i agreed and we returned to camp and helped finish the picket by tying horses to the central line before hurrying to one of the four large fires that had been lit to keep us warm through the night there was a stew of salt pork black beans and bread for our supper blandtasting mush but hot and substantial after a cold day in the saddle when the meal was finished some of the warriors tried to get myrddin to sing again but he would not he said a sword is made dull by dragging it out all the time and he wanted a keen blade when next he reached for it so we huddled near the fire and talked and dozed instead and night tightened its grip on us one by one the cymbrogi succumbed to the allpervasive silence of the blighted land we wrapped ourselves in our cloaks closed our eyes and tried to sleep sometime during the night the wind rose again this time gusting from the south colder i tasted snow on the icy air and edged closer to the fire we awoke to a hard frost and wind like a knife cutting through our cloaks there was no snow but a low grey sky spat dry sleet on us making for a miserable slog as we began the day we broke fast and started out only to halt again as we crested the first hill myrddin flung out his hand and arthur pulled hard on the reins his mount reared the company stopped behind us alert to danger i heard the dull ring of weapons being readied the emrys glanced over his shoulder and motioned me to draw alongside i was beside the king and myrddin in an instant and saw what had brought them up short the forest last seen as a thick line on the far southern horizon now rose directly before us a dense growth of hornbeam elm and oak standing just across the valley astonished beyond words i stared at the wood as if never having seen a tree before there was so far as i could determine nothing at all to suggest that the trees i saw before me were not what they appeared solid and thick and like all trees everywhere deeply rooted to their places through years of slow inexorable growth gazing in disbelief at the dense woodland i slowly became aware of a strange unsettling sound i think the sound had been there from the first but i noticed it only after the first shock of seeing the trees had passed nor was i the only one to hear it what is that asked arthur his voice low he half turned his head but his eyes did not leave the dark wood for a moment it sounds like teeth clicking truly it did it was the sound of many teeth large and small gnashing against one another not fiercely but softly almost gently in a low gabbled muttering arthurs eyes swept left and right along the stout line of trees for any break in the wood the line met us as a timber wall and there was no breach to be seen anywhere along its thickgrown length save one only directly ahead a gap opened between the closegrown trees the trail we pursued led straight into the heart of that dark wood what is more the mist was rising again it was already filling the valley between us and the woods edge bedwyr and cador reined up beside us then having observed the forest from their rearward places they now joined us to learn what the king and his wise counsellor made of it unless it was hidden by mist bedwyr declared i cannot think how it has come to be here otherwise perhaps cador suggested like the warriors in your story myrddin we have slept a thousand years and the wood has grown up around us bedwyr frowned at cadors frivolity and reproached him with an indignant grunt but myrddin said in this place that is as sound an explanation as any other if that is what passes for reason bedwyr said darkly then folly is king and madness reigns a wall before us a wall behind there is but one way through arthur said and there is no turning back so saying he raised his hand and signalled the column to move on i returned to my place behind myrddin well i said to rhys as we urged our horses forward once more we are going in was there ever any question no i answered aliajacta est what does that mean he asked the die is cast i told him it is something old caesar once said who told you that my father used to say it i never knew why but lately i begin to think i know what he meant we crossed the valley and entered the wood in silence no one spoke and all kept a keen eye for any sign of attack though many i noticed cast a last glance at the sky before the intertwining branches closed overhead it was like entering a tomb so close and dark and silent was the unchancy wood the trail narrowed as it passed among the broad boles of the trees but rather than ride single file the men urged their horses together and rode shoulder to shoulder and flank to flank like all the others i cast a longing glance behind me as we entered the wood and saw the same look of sick apprehension on one face after another but there was nothing for it we clutched our weapons more tightly and hunched lower in the saddle as if to escape notice of the tightcrowded trees keeping my eyes on myrddin and arthur ahead of me i remained alert to the sounds around me but there was little to hear a thick mat of pine needles cushioned the horses hooves and the men made no sound at all neither was any birdsong heard nothing in fact but the incessant clicking and the hush of muffled breath passing into the dank dark air as to the ceaseless clicking and clicking and clicking after a time i discovered what created that unsettling sound the wind twitching the bare upper branches fitful and gusty the wind did not penetrate the forest at all but continually mumbled and fretted overhead stirring uneasily in the high treetops and making the thin branches quiver so close were these limbs and so entangled they chattered against one another in endless motion even this however did not strike the ear with any vigour but reached us as a faint muttering falling from high above sinking down and down into the soft forest floor below the forest swallowed everything that came into it sunlight and wind and now the pendragon and his warband everyone who conies into a woodland wild feels something of this oppressive enclosing it is what causes a traveller to skirt the shadows and stay to the trail proceeding with wary caution what is more this uncanny sensation seemed to increase with every step deeper into the wood until it took on an almost suffocating aspect becoming a thing of towering proximity and ponderous weight we came upon a stream little more than a muddy rivulet dividing the trail and stopped to water the horses taking it in turn by twos and then moving on to allow those behind to get at the water we rode a fair way farther whereupon arthur halted the columns turned his horse and sat looking down the long double line of warriors without a word myrddin rode down the centre passing between the warriors what do you see lord i asked turning in the saddle to learn what held his attention it is what i am not seeing that causes me concern the king replied still gazing back along the trail the trees along each side and the branches thickly interwoven above made of our trail a shadowy tunnel like the entry shaft of a cave or mine the cymbrogi riding close to one another sat their horses awaiting the call to move on owing to the dimness of the light and the narrowness of the trail i could not see past more than twelve or fifteen riders as i looked down the line yet i could discern nothing amiss i was about to say as much when myrddin shouted something and came pounding back along the trail to join us well said the king i cannot see them myrddin replied they should have rejoined us by now only then did i realize what they were talking about the fifteen or so pairs that i saw behind us were indeed all that remained of the long double column the others were not lost to the shadows they were gone completely obviously we had become separated from the rest of the warhost the warband led by bedwyr and cador had vanished lord allow me to ride back and find out what has happened i volunteered no doubt meet them before i have gone a hundred paces very well arthur agreed but take rhys with you let him signal us when you have reached them we will wait for you here i returned to my horse and informed rhys of the kings command as i swung into the saddle we passed down the line of warriors and back along the trail i counted thirteen pair twentysix warriors out of fifty i thought and wondered what had become of the rest could twentyfour mounted warriors simply disappear once past the last of the cymbrogi we urged our mounts to speed and raced along the closegrown track when after a fair ride we still caught no sight of the stragglers i halted we should have seen them by now rhys said as he reined up beside me what could have happened to them until we find them we only waste our breath asking such questions i pointed out in llyonesse anything might happen i thought but kept the thought to myself well what do you suggest o head of wisdom rhys gave me a sour frown either we keep riding until we find them or we go back i suggested and rhys rolled his eyes to show how impressed he was with my reckoning which is it to be before he could answer there arose on the path behind us the strangest sound i have ever heard if you were to imagine the sound of a bull stag belling out his rage as a pack of baying hounds raced in for the kill imagine that and then increase it tenfold and add to it the roar of a stream in full spate and you will have some small idea of the sound that broke upon us as a single blast like that loosed from a horn a seething restless silence reclaimed the trail the horses shied and tried to bolt but we held them tight in a few moments the sound came again closer the barelimbed trees quivered and i felt the dull tremble of the earth in the pit of my stomach whatever made that sound was coming our way and swiftly twentynine the next sound i heard was the sharp slap of leather against the withers of rhys mount as he wheeled the frightened animal and gave it leave to fly nor was i slow to follow pausing only long enough to cast a fleeting backward glance i saw nothing but the shadowcrowded path and darkness beyond even so the shudder of the trees told me that the thing was charging towards us with speed i gave my mount its head and a heartbeat later i was racing along the forest trail trying to catch rhys it took us longer to reach our waiting companions than i expected and i feared we had somehow lost king and cymbrogi along with all the rest but then rhys slowed and i saw just beyond him two horses in the track ahead the cymbrogi had dismounted to rest the horses while awaiting our return they called out to us asking what we had discovered but we did not stop until we had rejoined myrddin and arthur rhys slid from the saddle before his horse had come to a halt arthur and myrddin had risen to their feet the question already on their faces we did not find them lord rhys was saying as i dismounted then what began the king before he could say more the creature behind us loosed its bonerattling cry the forest trembled around us and the horses began rearing and neighing the waiting warriors leapt to their mounts stretched for their dangling reins and retrieved spears from beneath their saddles arthur sword in hand ordered the battle line and an instant later we were armed and ready to face whatever came our way the trail was too narrow for horses to manoeuvre so arthur ordered the fight on foot it will come at us on the trail the king cried his voice taking on the vigour of command let it come open a way before it make a path two men on each side let it come in then close on it from either side it was a desperate tactic borrowed from the hunt most often used when a man finds himself unhorsed during the chase arthur established himself at the forefront of the line myrddin stood to his right with rhys and me to his left the cymbrogi led the horses to safety well up the trail and then quickly filled in behind us in ranks four across we stared into the gloom tree limbs quivering on either side and overhead i could feel the trembling of the ground as the shudders passed up through the earth and into my feet and legs a hundred horses pounding hard down the path could not drum the earth so what could it be the unnerving cry thundered again closer the entire forest seemed to ripple like a wave the unnatural sound sent a cold flash of fear snaking through the ranks the drumming thud in the ground grew louder the cymbrogi stood gripping their spears in silence staring hard into the gloom ahead the roar sounded again closer still an unearthly howl that pierced to the heart cold sick dread spread through me and the wood seemed to undulate a black mist gathered before my eyes as the ground shook with the pounding of unseen hooves i tightened my grip on my spear and shook my head to clear it thinking the thing must be nearly on top of us now but where is it and then i saw looming out of the murk of shadows the form of a beast a great dark mass racing with impossible speed directly towards us god help us it was enormous out of the shadows it came i heard several stifled cries behind me and others gasped and muttered hasty prayers curiously the creature had no substance no solidity even as it swept swiftly nearer i could get no clear notion of its appearance the thing seemed nothing but shadow and motion indeed i could see the dimly quivering shapes of trees and branches through it the ground heaved beneath our feet and i smelled the rank scent of animal filth but though we stood steadfast with our spears at the ready there was nothing substantial to fight i received the distinct impression of a massive beast with the sharp spine and highhumped shoulder of a boar its foul hair long and flowing in matted shreds like the tatters of a rotten cloak i imagined two huge yellow eyes glaring balefully out from a flattened piglike face beneath which bulged a massive jaw from which two great curved brown tusks jutted in upwardsweeping arcs like a pair of barley scythes short powerful stumplike legs pummelled the earth driving the creature forward on the cloven hooves of a stag this as i say was merely an impression an image that burned itself into my mind there was no actual creature nothing corporeal at all just a darkgathered mist of churning shadow and motion some of the warriors let slip their weapons and one or two dropped to their knees courage shouted arthur his voice a steady rock amidst the rising flood of fear stand firm the vile thing drove down on us with the speed of a falling mountain shaking the ground with every flying step i gripped my spear and hunkered down ready to let fly should anything tangible present itself the beast came on the monster loosed its earsplitting scream the chill air shivered to the sound of a thousand slavering hounds and the belling of a hundred stags at bay the cry carried the shadowshape into our midst hold called arthur hold men stand your ground beneath my feet the ground rumbled hollow like a drum stand firm arthur called straining to be heard above the sound of the onrushing beast stand my stomach tightened in anticipation of the terrible impact the air shuddered and i had the explicit sensation of a great hairy flank heaving past me like a rippling black wall of muscle spear poised i drew back my arm and prepared to strike the warrior opposite me let fly too soon the spear sailed over my head i ducked under it and in the same instant heard a short sharp cry as the creature whirled in midflight and struck i saw merely a sudden surge a quickening of the darkness and the monster thundered past i leapt to the stricken warriors aid and a stink like that of rotting meat struck me like the blow of a fist the gorge rose in my throat and i gagged on the stench i put a hand over my nose and mouth to keep from vomiting the cymbrogi round about groaned coughed and spat and the wounded man writhed on the ground his side had been laid open from chest to hip and blood gushed dark and hot from the wound help me he screamed help me tallaght i said in the dim light his features twisted with pain i did not recognize him at first lie still brother help is coming myrddin i shouted over here hurry tallaght clutched my hand his grip was slippery with blood but he clung to me as if to life itself i am sorry lord he said his voice already growing weaker i did not mean to disgrace shh i said gently it does not matter just rest easy tell arthur i am sorry he whispered and fell to coughing and could not catch his breath he died choking on his blood before myrddin could reach him go with god my friend i said and lay his hand upon his chest just as swiftly as it had come the apparition vanished the ground continued to drum and tremble for a time but the creature was gone myrddin appeared at my side and bent over the fallen warrior it is tallaght i said as the emrys stretched his hand towards the young mans face he is dead some of the warriors nearby repeated this pronouncement and it was passed along the ranks a moment later there came a cry from farther up the trail stop him one of the warriors shouted someone stop him glancing up i saw a mounted warrior burst forth from among the horses rhys shouted for the man to stop at once and several others tried to head off the hqrse but the rider was too quick and the horse had already reached its stride he gained the trail at a gallop and disappeared into the shadows arthur quickly ordered men to go after him but myrddin counselled against it it is too late now he said let him go we can catch him still the king protested we have just lost one warrior to the beast the emrys informed arthur how many more will you risk arthur frowned but accepted his counsellors advice did you see who it was no myrddin shook his head slowly i saw him i told them it was peredur no doubt he has gone to avenge his kinsmans death the young fool arthur muttered he is gods concern now myrddin said put him from your thoughts and instead think how to find your missing warriors night was hard upon us and rather than risk losing the rest of the warband in the dark arthur decided to make camp and wait until morning we buried tallaghts body where he had fallen and myrddin spoke a prayer over the grave i would have liked to do more for the boy but that is the way of it sometimes the pendragon ordered the remaining cymbrogi to gather fuel for a fire what with the dense wood all around us the men had a great heap of dead timber piled up and in less time than it takes to tell the first snakes of flame were slithering up the tangle of old branches once the horses were settled we gathered to warm ourselves and in crowding close to console one another the fellowship of loyal men is not to be slighted it is a thing of great solace and is therefore sacred accordingly the pendragon in ordering the fire meant not only to warm us but to help us to restore our confidence which had been badly shaken no one could have imagined that it would turn out as it did comforted by the fire the men began to talk and some wondered aloud what manner of creature it was that they had driven off others voiced surprise that they should have chased it away at all speculation proved futile and as one suggestion after another foundered everyone turned to myrddin who was squatting on his haunches at the edge of the fire arms crossed over knees staring bleakly into the flames here now myrddin called arthur genially have you ever heard tell of such a beast at first it seemed myrddin had not heard the kings question he made no move but continued staring into the red heart of the fire what say you bard the king said his voice loud in the sudden quiet of the wood the cymbrogi watched in silent expectation as the emrys without taking his eyes from the flames slowly drew the hood of his cloak over his head and rose he stood for a moment as if entranced by the flames then stooped and reached into the fire several of the cymbrogi cried out instinctively at the act but myrddin calmly withdrew a fistful of hot ashes despite the heat he held the embers in his hand blew on them and then gazed upon the coals we watched in astonished silence as he held the burning embers in his hand his face illumined in the ruddy glow suddenly he cast the coals back into the flames he stood for a moment clutching his hand whether from pain or the shock of what he had seen i cannot say then as if in a trance he raised his hand and licked the palm with his tongue no one moved or said a word as the bard of britain took up his staff and raised it over his head slowly he turned to face us my heart clenched in my chest for his face was as rigid and pale as death the eyes gazing out from beneath the hood were no longer those of a man but of a preying hawk farseeing keen and golden stretching forth his hand he held his palm level to the ground and opening his mouth began to speak or perhaps it was some other speaking through him for the voice seemed to come from the otherworld hear men of britain valiant ones he said in the strange hollow voice the head of wisdom speaks heed and take warning the black beast sent among you this day was but a foretaste of the power arrayed against you the battle is joined and every man who would achieve the quest must face many ordeals be not dismayed neither be afraid but face the trials to follow with all forbearance for the swift sure hand upholds you and the holy grail awaits those who endure to the end having delivered himself of this decree he lowered his staff and sat down again almost at once he began to shake and tremble all over thinking to aid him the warrior nearest reached out and took hold of the emrys to steady him instantly the man yelped and fell back as if he had been struck by a thunderbolt others reached to help the man let him be advised arthur sternly it will pass the stricken warrior quickly recovered and the cymbrogi set themselves the task of settling the horses for the night before lying down to rest though i tried to sleep the weird events of this fraught day conspired to overthrow my best resolve and i found myself thinking about morgian instead and wondering when the next attack would come and what form it would take thirty it was still dark when i awoke judging by the deep darkness of the forest dawn was still very far away at first i closed my eyes and tried to go back to sleep but then i heard again what must have roused me the horses were awake and whickering restively to one another so i roused myself thinking to see what might be done to calm them the fire had burned itself to a heap of ashes and i had to stumble over the sleeping bodies of my swordbrothers waking a few of them who joined me at the picket with the horses i feel as if i have slept an age remarked one of the warriors but it looks as though dawn is still far off he gazed around warily indeed if i did not know better i would say the darkness has only increased as he spoke a thin trickle of fear snaked along my ribs i raised my eyes to the darkness above dense and heavy as iron others joined us and began offering their observations some held that the night had passed and we would soon see the sunrise more maintained that the time for sunrise had passed without bringing the light before the disputation could become contentious however arthur brought an end to the speculation by putting the question to myrddin directly is this the enemys doing myrddin hesitated then glanced quickly at the warriors who stood awaiting his answer yes he said simply the king nodded it makes no difference turning to the cymbrogi he said our swordbrothers should have reached us by now we are going back for them he ordered the horses to be saddled and all idle talk to cease he commanded torches to be prepared and once we were saddled and ready to depart the torches were lit thus we took up the search for the lost cymbrogi returning along the trail by which we had come the day before whether the sun shone beyond the cover of the forest i cannot say all i know is that the light of day did not reach us and we rode in darkness as complete as that which covers the earth on the stormiest of nights without the sun however feeble to mark times slow passing it seemed we journeyed an eternity stopping only to rest and water the horses and to renew the torches continually alert to the wood around us all the while we travelled what must have passed for a day in the wider world slept a little and continued on never knowing where one night left off and another began moving from one march to the next without speaking more than a dozen words to anyone and all the time the darkness wore on us a grindstone it was covered in darkest silk perhaps but a stone nonetheless grinding and grinding us down to dust see now fear stalked the bold dragon flight fear like the immense shadow beast loosed to rampage through our anxious ranks stouthearted men started at the smallest sound and sained themselves with the cross whenever they thought no one else was looking arthur alas even arthur who feared no earthly foe found reason to be afraid not for himself mind but for his queen her name was never far from his lips from time to time he roused himself from his bleak meditations and made an effort to lift the spirits of his warband he called encouragement to those who appeared to be struggling and offered conversation to those who seemed most in need of distraction but his labours went unrewarded at times the forest trail seemed to twist around upon itself and occasionally another path might be seen to diverge from the main although there was never any question about which way we should go the pendragon led without wavering even so it grew increasingly apparent that we would not gain our destination no matter how long or far we rode only a little farther arthur argued we must be nearing the end arthur myrddin replied gently we should have reached it long since we go on arthur insisted and so we did so unvarying was the trail and the darkness so unrelenting and complete and our fortitude stretched so thin and fine that the clearing came as a shock to our benighted senses without warning or sign we simply rode out from the rooflike cover of the trees and onto a wide river mead even in the darkness we could tell that it was a clearing of considerable extent the sound of rushing water could be heard from the other side of the mead and the damp chill closeness of the wood gave way to the sudden gusts of a cold winter wind as we had ridden some way since our last resting place the king thought best to make camp water the horses and refresh our own water supply accordingly we found a place beside the encircling stream to picket the horses and began dragging dead limbs from the surrounding wood glad for this change such as it was we fell to with a will and soon had a large campfire burning with the brightness of a beacon on the edge of the clearing far better for us if we had endured the darkness and cold our accustomed misery far better indeed if we had never set foot in the wasteland at all for as the campfire reached its height and we gathered to warm ourselves around it the flamelight revealed a great oak tree a short distance away at first we knew nothing of it but that it was a true monarch of the wood ancient and lordly supreme ruler in its domain and that it stood alone in the centre of the clearing which bounded by the encircling stream formed an almost perfect ring around it but then as we drew closer and looked up into those huge gnarled boughs we glimpsed strange elongated shapes twisting in the wind we looked and courage already rattled from the long grinding darkness took flight with nothing to halt the rout our beleaguered imaginations fled instantly to the worst ah but the truth awaiting us in those misshapen boughs was far far worse than anything we could have imagined we looked to where arthur stood myrddin at his side gazing towards the great oak the king stooped and took a brand from the fire drew himself up and then started for the tree taking up brands we hastened after him crowding in close to one another so as not to be the hindmost closer i could see the strange shapes dangling in clusters from the lower limbs like enormous bats it was not until we stepped almost directly underneath the foremost bough that i realized what it was we were seeing terrible silence crushed hard upon us i could not breathe i could not speak my strength flowed away like water a fearful drumming filled my ears and boomed in my head i staggered back and god help me i vomited bile over my feet then forcing myself to a courage i did not possess i wiped my mouth on my arm and stood taking my place once more beside my king myrddin stood beside him his hand on the kings shoulder and the other to his eyes as if to shield them from the sight of that trees terrible fruit only arthur firebrand in his hand yet stared up into the tree at the naked corpses of his brave cymbrogi come away bear i heard myrddin mutter there is nothing to be done here arthur made no reply but shrugged off myrddins hand and gazed full on the grisly display before us each of the lower boughs bore the corpses of at least four warriors bound singly or in groups of two or three and there were more hung high in the upper branches and yet still more beyond these from what i could see in the shifting light most of them had died in battle many had lost limbs and several had been disembowelled every corpse had been shorn of both hands and feet and these we discovered placed in a ghastly ring around the roots of the tree some few must have been alive when they were hung for i saw bloated blue faces of men i had once known as swordbrothers among the dead cai and cador and bedwyr brave cai his tongue protruding swollen in his mouth his scalp hanging loose on his skull cador friend and stalwart companion his arms bloody stumps and his legs broken and limp his mouth gaping in a last silent scream and bedwyr hero and champion his smashed jaw dangling on his chest one eye gouged out the remains of a spear jutting broken from his stomach tears rose in my eyes then and i had to look away my god my spirit cried out in grief and anguish god why why these myrddin tried again to get the king to leave and again the pendragon refused my men are here he said his voice grating in the deathly silence my place is with my men you can do nothing for them myrddin said almost harshly i can bury them arthur snapped no bear myrddin counselled it is the living you must think of now i wondered at this answer but trusted the emrys would have a sound reason thrusting a helpless hand towards the tree arthur said i cannot leave them like this and still call myself king go if you must and take the men with you i will stay the emrys frowned glancing at the dread oak well arthur demanded forcing the emrys choice myrddin hesitated and a light came up in his eyes there may yet be a way to preserve some small scrap of dignity and courage his voice quickened as he spoke hear me proud king we will not abandon our loyal swordbrothers in death we will send them on their journey hence with all honour in sharp defiance of the wickedness that has so cruelly slain them are you willing you know that i am then listen to me so saying the wise emrys put his hand to the back of arthurs neck and drew him near they spoke together like this for a time and then the king drew himself up turned squared his shoulders and said very great evil has been practised here and we who strive towards the light bear witness to this vile deed and condemn it before the throne of god yet though life has abandoned our brothers we will not forsake them in ignoble defeat here in the camp of the evil one we will kindle a light and send this light like a spear into the very heart of the darkness that oppresses us as light shining in the midst of darkness overcomes that darkness and banishes it utterly so we shall drive it from the hand of the enemy who would employ it as a weapon against us and the dread tree on which hang the bodies of our friends will become a funeral pyre and the flames that light our brothers homeward way will become a beacon of our defiance when arthur finished speaking i added my own voice to the acclaim that welcomed the kings pronouncement oh we made that blighted wood ring with righteous adulation and then we hastened to the edge of the wood round about to gather a bounty of dead wood for fuel and when we had heaped the tinder manhigh around the ancient oak myrddin caused the remnant of the dragon flight to make a wide circle around the tree he then commanded us to walk slowly in a sunwise direction led by arthur we began meanwhile the emrys stepped to the tinder heap and raised his staff high calling in a loud voice he cried out great light whose life is light and power to his creatures hear your servant taking the staff with both hands now he held the oaken rod above his head and cried we who journey in darkness have need of your light we who are bereft of hope and beset by evil on every side have need of your power lord in our day of travail hear our cry great light our kinsmen have been wickedly murdered and their bodies given over to death his voice resounded across the meadow you alone lord hold authority over the grave even as your voice quickens the spirit in the womb so you summon the spirits of the departed to your throne therefore we ask you to call our brothers home to your otherworldly realm and give them places of honour in your banquet hall this night great evil gathers close seeking to destroy us yet we will trust in you lord to deliver us if this cannot be then we trust you to meet us on the way and guide us to your halls in token of our trust we light this pyre to hold the darkness at bay let it burn as a beacon to light the homegoing of our swordbrothers and put evil to flight holding the oaken rod above his head he stood for a long moment and then slowly lowered the staff and extended it towards the firewood there was a flash of blue and a sound like the tearing of a cloak between giant hands the fire simply appeared arcing through the air flowing like shimmering liquid leaping from branch to branch and scattering in bright blue tracery through the dry wood within moments the flames were cracking hot and bright licking up through the tinder heap leaping up and up into the great spreading branches turning to the cymbrogi myrddin said sing make a noise to rouse the heavenly host with that he led us in a psalm such as the brown clerics chant in the holy mass the lord is my rock the lord is my fortress and my deliverer god is my refuge he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my stronghold the flames mounted higher stretching into the branches caressing the lowermost corpses ringed by fire the massive black trunk began to smoulder as the yellow flames stretched higher and ever higher into the tree still walking maintaining the circle we began to sing with the emrys chanting the words as he led us i call to the lord who is worthy to be praised and i am saved from my enemies the cords of death entangled me the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me the cords of the grave coiled around me the snares of death confronted me in my distress i cried to my god for help from his temple he heard my voice the heat from the flames forced us back making our circle larger still the corpses now alight began swinging and twisting in the quickening wind created by the flames the boughs creaked and cracked as the flames tripped from branch to branch higher and still higher into the sky the earth trembled and quaked and the foundations of the mountains shook they trembled because he was angry there came a long sighing crack all at once the mighty tree slumped inwardly upon itself riven by fire the trunk of the oak split sending sparks spiralling upward on the rising air like thousands of tumbling stars it seemed to me that these were the spirits of our friends taking flight towards heaven and he looked down in his anger and said because their love is set on me i will deliver them i will deliver them from danger for they know my name i will be with them in times of trouble i will rescue them from the grave and bring them honour in my courts i will satisfy them with eternal life to enjoy their rich salvation i said the words as myrddin spoke them and watched the glimmering sparks rising up and up and i thought farewell cai stalwart companion faithful through all things farewell bedwyr loyal brother steadfast in the fight farewell cador brave and true farewell my friends enter into the peace of christ farewell my heart rose to my throat and my eyes filled with tears and the burning oak blurred into a blazing mass of shimmering shifting light and i heard a roar like thunder as the gathering wind rushed to feed the towering flames whipping them to white heat the light that blazed from the pyre filled the wide meadow now forcing back the darkness on every side i heard the wail of the wind and the cold air gusted swirling around us my back was cold my face and hands searing hot from the blaze before me the scream grew louder and i realized it was not the cry of the wind but the wild scream of a creature tortured beyond endurance what is more the creature was coming swiftly towards us drawn by the fire myrddin heard the sound too and cried out fear nothing greater is he who has heard our prayer than that which assaults heaven with its cry as it rose above the wind shivering the wood all around us i felt the wild keening sound in my belly and then in the quiver of the earth beneath my feet i thought at first that it must be the shadow beast returning to attack us again but the trembling mounted steadily and i knew it must be something far far larger and more deadly listen to me cried myrddin and he began instructing us on how to survive the onslaught we would soon face we were to link arms he said and form an outwardfacing ring an enclosed wall with our bodies where men might be too far apart they should hold a spear between them but under no condition were we to break the chain though hell itself break over you do not let go the emrys said whatever you may see whatever you may hear do not break the circle keep the ringwall intact and though the devil himself leads the attack we will not be harmed i reached out to the man next to me it was rhys his face grim in the lurid light we linked arms then clasped hands with the warriors on either side and braced ourselves for the assault the ground began to shake and i heard a sound like that of giants crashing through the wood uprooting trees and casting them aside the very earth trembled beneath our feet and the forest all around cracked and groaned with the snapping of branches and the twisting of limbs what i wondered could cause such destruction suddenly the sound stopped and the ground ceased shaking the roar of the flames behind us seemed to still for a moment and even the wind grew calm i have seen this before and know it to be but the false tranquillity of an enemy gathering itself for the onslaught stand your ground shouted arthur here they come thirtyone we stood gazing into the darkness the fire at our backs throwing our shadows before us like an allencircling army of shapeshifting phantoms breathless we waited across the meadow the trees began thrashing back and forth as if in the grip of a violent storm but the air remained still i heard a low grinding sound and the trees parted lying down on either side as if divided by a giant hand in the same instant the burning oak behind us gave another tremendous crack sending sparks and chunks of flaming wood showering all around the fire at our backs leapt high and higher still into the night our shadows flickered and danced out across the darkened meadow in the newly opened gap where the forest met the river a figure appeared a lone warrior on a horse there someone shouted and from the corner of my eye i saw a movement as the speaker thrust a hand to point out the horseman advancing towards us do not break the circle myrddin emrys cried his voice terrible in the silence as god is life and evil death hold tight and do not let go the rider came on slowly he carried a dark shield with a burnished iron rim both the shields rim and the honed tip of an upright spear glimmered in the firelight and the blade on his thigh gleamed dull red the warrior was dressed all in black from head to foot and wore a hooded cloak so i could not see his face from the withers and flanks of the horse long black strips of fine cloth rippled and fluttered as the animal moved making it seem as if the beast were floating towards us the dark rider advanced to within a spears cast of us whereupon the emrys challenged him halt he shouted in his voice of command the swift sure hand is over us you can do no evil here go back the rider made no reply but sat regarding us while his mount chafed the ground impatiently go back to the hell from whence you came myrddin shouted again you cannot harm us by way of reply the warrior shifted the shield to cover his chest and with the slightest lifting of the reins turned the horse and began riding around the ring he made one circuit then another and another slowly gathering pace with each pass by the sixth or seventh circuit the horse had reached an easy canter around and around he rode in a long slow circle the hooves of his mount beating the ground in a rhythmic thump like the rising beat of a drum around and around the canter became a trot the trot became a gallop the gallop became faster the beat of the hooves coming quicker the strange black strips of cloth hanging from the horses sides rustled like wings i could hear the beasts breath coming in snorts and gasps now as the pace began to tell the warriors cloak billowed out behind him and the hood slipped from his head revealing a face i knew well llenlleawg it was arthur crying out in surprise and dismay he shouted again hoping i think to gain his former champions attention others quickly joined in and soon everyone was calling llenlleawgs name i shouted too thinking that we might yet sway him from his course but looking neither right nor left the irish champion urged his mount to charging speed and lowered the spear stand your ground men shouted arthur do not break the circle even before he finished speaking i saw the quick flick of the reins and the horse swerved towards the ring of cymbrogi driving in towards the ring at a shallow angle to my right the spear swung over the horses neck and came level the cymbrogi arms linked shouted to distract the horse and braced themselves for the killing blow but the attack was merely a feint and he slanted away well before committing himself to the charge the swift sure hand upholds us shouted myrddin the next charge came while the emrys words yet hung in the air another slanting drive the angle sharper this time again the cymbrogi shouted to distract the horse and again llenlleawg broke off the attack but carrying it closer before turning away llenlleawg the king cried here i am come to me the champion galloped on his face set expressionless his eyes staring and empty as the dead the third attack carried him almost headlong into the line in the leaping firelight i saw the head of the spear swing towards me as llenlleawg began his charge this time he came on a straight course and i knew he meant to break us god help us i breathed tightening my grip on rhys next to me the blacks hooves tore the turf as it gathered speed legs churning closing swiftly i could already feel the spearhead slicing into my flesh and my bones breaking as i fell beneath those crushing hooves i braced myself for the impact llenlleawg charged to within a hairbreadth of the line i could hear the spear blade sing in the air but at the moment when the spear should have pierced my chest and carried me off my feet the blade shifted and the horse blew past me so close i could feel the heat of the animal as it surged by the line held and the cymbrogi cheered in their relief but when llenlleawg did not so much as break stride i knew that the testing was over the next charge would be in earnest the man chosen to meet it would die and the circle would be breached around and around rode llenlleawg straightbacked in the saddle shoulders square oblivious to the jeers and taunts of his former friends on the final pass he began his charge the horse strained forward hooves pounding the earth the spear came level as the horse turned onto its course and i saw who had been chosen the spear was aimed at arthur hold men he cried as the deadly blade swept swiftly nearer hold the line the cymbrogi desperate to help their king writhed in an agony of helplessness obedient unto death each man willing longing to take the pendragons place in the line yet unable to so much as lift a hand or move a step for the sake of that selfsame obedience the brave dragon flight screamed their defiance at the onrushing traitor i could not bear to see the cruel spearhead pierce my lord and friend neither could i look away so like all the others i watched helplessly as the deathstroke hurtled swift to the mark and like all the others i screamed in a futile attempt to draw the spear away from that mark hooves flying the black and its silent rider swept in the line tensed as if to meet the blow for the king stand firm shouted arthur for the last time as arthur cried out the hardcharging horse stumbled its forelegs buckling beneath it the animals speed and weight carried it forward pitching the rider over its neck and onto the ground as the beasts hindquarters sailed up back legs still kicking llenlleawg fell headfirst to land sprawling on the ground the spear struck the earth not two paces from arthurs feet and buried itself deep the shaft quivering with the force the line held and we cheered our kings deliverance doubtless we would have swooped upon llenlleawg if myrddin had not prevented us peace he cried in his voice of command break not the circle for the great king upholds us still llenlleawg was on his feet again almost instantly up he leapt hand on sword as he drew the blade i recognized it at once how not i have seen it every day for the past seven years it was caledvwlch the pendragons own blade the last evidence if any were needed of llenlleawgs vile treachery the traitor grasped the sword in both hands and raised it over his head as he came perhaps the fall had hurt llenlleawg for even as he raised his arms his steps faltered and his legs gave way he crashed onto his knees and then sank onto his side as if he had been struck on the head before anyone could think or move thunder sounded over the meadow i saw three more riders racing towards us out of the night like llenlleawg they were all in black from head to heel cloaked and hooded the strangers rode to where llenlleawg lay the foremost sat with spear at the ready while his two companions dismounted pulled the stricken llenlleawg upright and in one swift motion lifted him onto the nearest horse one of them took the saddle behind the stricken warrior and the other gathered the dangling reins of llenlleawgs mount and vaulted into the empty saddle without a word they turned as one and rode away fleeing back into the darkness to the taunts and cries of derision of the watching warriors the dragon flight wanted nothing more than to pursue our attackers and we would have too but myrddin exhorting us with a bards power of persuasion held us in line stand firm in the circle of gods protection he told us breaking the sacred ring now could only bring about the destruction we had so far eluded oh but it chafed me sore to see our enemies getting away and not so much as a spear cast at their retreat the black riders reached the river melting again into the deep shadows beyond the light of the burning oak they gained the water i heard the splash of hooves and all at once the wood before them burst into flame perhaps sparks from the burning oak drifting across the clearing had ignited the dry winter wood perhaps it had been smouldering for a time and we preoccupied with llenlleawgs attack had failed to notice it then again perhaps some other had set the wood to blaze i cannot say all i know is that even as the fleeing riders gained the water marge and splashed into the stream a great shimmering curtain of flame arose before them with a roar like a mighty wind the flames struck skyward in a moment the fire was spreading outward on either side the enemy warriors rode through the curtain of fire without hesitation and disappeared on the other side only then did myrddin give us leave to break the ring the pendragon called us to his side and even while praising our valour began ordering the pursuit while the horses were being brought from the picket he turned to the emrys and said myrddin he had it caledvwlch the treacherous dog raised it against me my own sword god in heaven mark me that selfsame blade will yet claim that traitors head the droughtdry wood leapt eagerly to the flame the trail by which the enemy riders had escaped was now impassable by the time we were mounted the flames all but encircled the meadow leaving only a narrow gap by which we might escape the pendragon raised a final salute to the dead he left behind lofting his spear he cried in the name of the lord who made me king i will not rest until the blood debt is paid in full death shall be answered with death arthur pendragon makes this vow myrddin grim beside him frowned at this but said nothing many of the cymbrogi supported the kings vow with their own then turning his horse arthur led us away we rode for the river and the swiftly narrowing gap of unburned wood not in orderly columns there was no time even so before we were halfway to the water the encircling flames closed the gap a quick glance behind confirmed what i already knew to be true the forest was ablaze on every side and we were completely enclosed in a ring of fire smoke rolled across the meadow in billows like earthbound clouds gusts of heat swept over us in waves like warm currents in a freezing ocean a sound like continuous thunder filled the night and we urged our horses to all speed arthur never hesitated but rode straightaway into the river where he dismounted knelt in the water and drenched himself all over shouting for us to follow his example the horses smoke stinging their nostrils jittered and shied agitated at coming so near the flames removing his wet cloak the king flung it over the head of his horse to shut out sight of the flames follow me he called pulling the terrified animal after him there was nothing for it but to stay close and follow flinging my sopping cloak over the head of my mount and mouthing words of encouragement to the frightened animal i waded through the river splashing more water over myself as i went arthur having already reached the other side paused to exhort the men to keep together then turned and led us into the fire thirtytwo morgaws has her captives well in hand arthur has joined his slattern queen rhys royal bastard shares his chains and merlin vainglorious bard now feels how tightly a true sorcerers charms can bind alone among them gwenhwyvar might have made a useful friend she had grit enough and guile but charts ruined her turned her against me just as she has always turned everyone against me so gwenhwyvar will go down like all the rest the slut queen professes a great love for her arthur yet she went willingly from his bed never once imagining that she is the one who leads him to his ruin she thinks to save the grail and save her hulking husband in truth she only hastens his end they are so trusting they actually believed they would be saved that their god would rescue them perhaps they imagined the sky would open up and their miserable jesu would float down on a cloud to bear them away to high holy heaven where they would be safe forevermore their disappointment when the awful truth struck them full in the teeth was too too wonderful for words their expressions of despair will continue to delight me for ages to come indeed i have so enjoyed the pursuit it is almost a shame to see it end so soon but the end swiftly approaches all that remains is to wring the last tincture of torment fear and pain from these my woeful and wretched adversaries this is soon accomplished morgaws has asked to use the grail to help bring about their destruction a fine idea that we could allow them all a last supper a final communion wherein the cup is passed and its contents shared among them oh there are some exquisitely painful poisons where death is delayed and the victim lingers in agony sometimes for days watching them twitch and heave in the final extremity while cursing their ineffectual god could prove highly entertaining i can already hear the voices of the dying as they scream out the last of their lives in utter despair true desolation is a thing of rare beauty the stark horror of the grave when every hope is shattered and swept away what can match it what can compare but no i do not want them dead just yet they have not even begun to suffer the agonies i intend for them i mean to bring them to despair i mean to make them curse heaven for giving them life and leaving them to their torment i mean to harry them removing their hopes one by one until there is nothing left but the appalling certainty of oblivion the unendurable silence of the pit endless endless endless chaos reigned all was thick smoke and fireshattered darkness men shouted as they ran stoking courage to dare the flames around them horses the sting of smoke in their nostrils screamed and thrashed desperate to escape we clung to the reins and pulled the terrified animals through the thicktangled brush the wood cracked and rang with the sound of the fire and the shouts of men urging their mounts through the wall of fire dodging burning branches running running headlong and heedless we fled into the wood beyond the fires greedy reach thus we came through the flames and found ourselves deep in the forest once more dazed by the devilish assault and the dangers just braved like the others i called out so that we might locate one another by the sounds of our voices and reform the warband but the forest began to exert its malign power over us for what should have been a simple matter of drawing our scattered forces together soon descended into a nightmare of futility once beyond the curtain of fire all sense of direction vanished for the life of me i could not tell where i was or where i was going i heard men calling and hastened towards the sound only to hear them again somewhat further off and often in another direction once i heard two men shouting they could not have been more than fifty paces away and they answered when i called i told them to wait and i would come to them only to discover that they were not there when i reached the place i heard them twice again calling for me but farther away each time i did not hear anyone after the last strange to hear men all around me some near some farther off and not be able to reach them it was as if the forest itself were drawing us apart dividing us keeping us from reaching one another either that or some other more powerful force for which the wood was merely a single expression be that as it may i kept my head and when i heard the jingle of a horses tack just ahead i rushed for the place crashing through the wood and shouting tor gods sake wait for me who is it called the nearest of the two as i stumbled through the entangling brush and branches i recognized the voice at once bors gwalchavad he wondered however did you get there we heard you ahead of us but a moment ago stay where you are i insisted struggling forward and tugging my reluctant mount behind me a ghostly shifting light from the fire some little distance behind shimmered in the low clouds above and reflected on the surprised faces of bors and the young warrior called gereint finally i said wiping sweat from my face i have found someone we have been hearing cymbrogi all around us gereint said but never can find them you are the first let us hope i am not also the last i answered have you seen arthur how are we to see anything in this murk and tangle bors growled three of us came through the fire together and held on to one another i see but two before me now i ventured i know bors cried i could not keep even the three of us together much less find anyone else he puffed out his cheeks in exasperation no one will stay in one place listen said gereint they are getting further away even as we listened the sounds around us dwindled we all shouted and shouted again but there came no answer and in a few moments we could hear nothing at all well i concluded breaking the silence after a time it seems we are on our own so it appears agreed bors we can either stay here until morning and see if we can raise a trail then or we can go on and try to find some others morning i wondered you amaze me bors do you even now believe that this foul night will end i am thinking it never will stalwart bors regarded me placidly then let us rest a little at least for i grow weary of stumbling through this godforsaken wood in the dark bashing my shins at every turn seeing no harm in the suggestion i agreed and we settled the horses and sat down to rest before continuing the search i did not mind the fire bors said after a time at least it was warm my clothes are still wet he yawned and added i am starving we best not dwell on that i said and suggested that we should try to sleep instead i will take the first watch volunteered gereint very well i agreed rouse me when you get tired and i will take the second watch wake us if you hear anything bors instructed through a yawn in a few moments i heard the gentle burr of a soft snore as bors drifted off though weary to the bone i could not sleep so i merely closed my eyes and let my mind wander where it would i thought again about my dead swordbrothers and a pang of grief cut me like a spear thrust in the heart great light i thought using myrddins term gather my fallen comrades in your loving hands and bear them safely to your strong fortress give them the welcome cup in your halls of splendour and make a place for them in the forerank of your heavenly host may they know peace and joy and feasting forever in your company lord of all and grant me the strength to abide my trials until i too lay down my sword and take my place among them this i prayed not as the brownhooded priests pray but as a cry from my own bruised heart i felt better for having unburdened myself in this way and though i still rued the deaths of my swordbrothers was in some small way comforted by the thought that they would be welcomed and received in heavens bright hall so i lay back listening to bors soft snoring here was a wonder a man who could sleep in the midst of the enemys camp untroubled by fear or the frets of an uneasy heart here was a man so secure and peaceful within himself that he could forget his troubles the instant he lay down his head like a child with a childs trust in the moment here surely was a true soul gwalchavad came a quiet voice in the darkness are you asleep no lad i answered i have been thinking so have i gereint i replied i heard him shift in the darkness as he moved closer have you thought of a way we might find our lost companions no he said i have been thinking that it must have been difficult for the pendragon seeing all his men killed like that and then being attacked by his own champion i should think that would be difficult yes i agreed but arthur has been in many a difficult place and he has never been defeated think of that he is the greatest lord i have ever known gereint confessed there was nothing in his voice but awe and praise as if the distress of our present adversity and all that went before it were nothing at all to him when did you join the cymbrogi i asked the young warrior cador came to us and said the pendragon needed help to defeat the vandali tallaght peredur and i answered the summons and joined the warband then you are cadors kinsmen that we are gereint confirmed he was a good man and a splendid battlechief i was proud to call him my friend he will be sadly missed indeed the young warrior replied and we will lament his death when we have leisure to do so he paused and added sadly tallaght and peredur also my forgetfulness shamed me in truth the deaths of my own friends and swordbrothers had driven poor tallaghts demise completely from my thoughts we fell silent each to his own bitter memories and i recalled the time peredur tallaght and i had gone to inform the people of rheged of their lords rebellion and the resulting forfeiture of their lands it was on that errand that we had found morgaws would that i had never laid eyes on morgaws and now tallaght was dead along with so many other good men and probably peredur too silent was the wood and dark as i say dark as the night when the moon has gone to rest and the sun not yet risen the air did not move and there was no sound the darkness and unnatural quiet put me in a mournful mood and i began to think about my dead swordbrothers bedwyr and cai and cador and all the rest dead and gone i ached for the loss of them the darkness seemed to gather me into itself and cover me over i would have given myself to my black grief but something in me resisted a hard knot of stubborn wariness that refused to yield itself to either sadness or acceptance so long as we remained in the realm of the enemy i would not indulge my grief in duty to my king i must strive through all things for the enemys defeat thus i determined to remain alert to any danger lest i too fall victim to the evil which had stolen the lives of my friends when battle is done i told myself i will deliver myself to grief one day soon i would mourn soon but not now not yet the thought gave me some consolation and i took what solace i could arriving on the heels of my determination however came that sound which once heard can never be forgotten the strange tortured bellow of the loathly shadow beast the eerie baying cry seemed to come from ahead of us though still some distance away bors came awake with a start did you hear the creature gereint said in a raw whisper it must be the same one that attacked us before same or different i will kill the vile thing if it comes near me again blustered bors god is my witness that monster will not escape this time the bellow sounded again farther off this time and in a slightly different direction it was moving swiftly away you may not get the chance brother i told bors the creature is going away from us bors grunted his disdain and we roused ourselves and resumed the search of our lost companions we set off on foot leading the horses lest we become separated from one another we held tight to all our bridle straps bors led the way and gereint followed and i came last wandering a hostile wood in the dark of a neverending night less a search i considered than an exercise in forlorn hope in the silence that pressed in around us once more i heard myrddins words in the quest before us none but the pure of heart can succeed the thought had scarcely formed when i felt a thin quivery shudder pass up through the soles of my feet and into my legs i froze in midstep the reins in my hand pulled taut as gereint just ahead continued walking i drew breath to speak but even as i called for the others to halt the sound of my voice was lost in the weird screeching bellow of the baleful beast the monstrous creature was closing swiftly i could feel the drumming of the earth in my very bowels bors and gereint stopped on the path ahead in the gloom i saw bors turn his mouth opened fly in the same instant there came a crashing sound as the trees directly before us snapped like twigs and burst asunder the monster was upon us thirtythree my terrified mount reared snapping the bridal strap that bound it to the others and all three animals plunged into the wood branches and tree limbs scattered and fell around me i glimpsed a massive black shape like a molten hillside charging towards me and knew the monster had found us again i threw myself into the dense brush and scrambled for my life branches tore at my face and hands i heard bors shouting but could not make out the words crawling like a frenzied snake i dragged myself through the tangled undergrowth i glimpsed a hole in the brush no wider than a badger set and dove headlong for it but even as i squirmed to pull myself inside i felt a heavy weight seize upon my legs and i was yanked off the ground in the same moment the most foul stink assaulted me a putrid stench of decaying flesh together with vomitus and excrement choking retching i gasped for breath tears filled my eyes and streamed down my face the beast secured its hold on me and began jerking its hideous head back and forth shaking me hard to break my bones one against the other before swallowing me whole kicking and clawing i twisted my body this way and that trying to scratch out one of the creatures eyes in my frenzy my hand struck against a slickfurred neck below the massive jaw i clenched the odious fur in my hand and hung on screaming and screaming for help the pain grew unbearable i screamed and screamed again beating at the heavy flesh with my fists pain rolled over me in waves as darkness terrible mindnumbing darkness gathered around me i could feel the life slowly being crushed from me and i knew i was breathing my last god in heaven i cried in agony help me no prayer was ever more heartfelt than that one and the words were no sooner out of my mouth than gereint appeared he seemed to hang in the air above me as if floating or hovering i realized then that he had somehow contrived to scale the beasts back plunging his knife to the hilt to secure his handhold he began hacking at the creature with his sword the young fool will get himself killed i thought trying desperately to free my legs up swung the sword and down striking at the back of the great beasts skull the vile creatures neck jerked up and its mouth gaped wide the monster roared in agony and i was sent sprawling to the ground i fell heavily on my side and fought to get free lest i be trampled to death my left leg would not move i heaved myself forward and on arms and elbows pulled myself into the brush once clear of the beast i glanced back over my shoulder to see gereint he was gone now but his sword was still stuck in the brutes bulging neck just behind the skull the monster was belling its agonized shriek with a sound to rip the earth asunder i threw my hands over my ears and hunkered down trying to hold out that hateful sound what happened after i cannot say for the next thing i knew i was waking up in the dark silent wood the black beast was gone and i was alone my side felt as if it had been raked with a spearhead and then pounded with an iron rod my leg burned though it hurt to breathe i drew great draughts to keep from passing out again a swirling mass of fear churned within me but i have been afraid before and in equally trying circumstances forcing myself to remain calm i lay back and listened for a moment when i did not hear anything i made to rise instantly pain burst upon me anew and i fell back bors and gereint are pursuing the horses and will return any moment i told myself they know i am here and will not abandon me i clung to this hope repeating it over and over the pain in my leg throbbed with a sharp deeprooted urgent ache it took my mind off the raw pulse of pain in my side with an effort i pushed myself upright and leaned back against a fallen log i reached down to touch the place where the pain seemed the worse and my hand came away sticky and wet with blood i tried to move my leg the exertion sent a searing bolt of fire into my head and i almost swooned but at least the leg could bend somewhat and no bones seemed broken my knife was still tucked in my belt but my sword was missing my spear had disappeared with my horse using the knife i contrived to cut a strip from my siarc and bind my leg to stanch the flow of blood the effort exhausted me i tied the knot and lay back panting and gasping a fragment of myrddins psalm came into my mind and i spoke it out there in the darksome forest lying on my back warm blood oozing from my wounds i said the lord is my rock the lord is my fortress and my deliverer god is my refuge he is my shield and the horn of my salvation my stronghold there was solace in the words just saying them aloud in that dolorous place comforted me so i continued i call to the lord who is worthy to be praised and i am saved from my enemies the cords of death entangled me the torrents of destruction overwhelmed me it was an act of defiance i believe to invoke the great light in that place for i felt my heart stir as courage returned in truth i surprised myself at how much of these songs i could remember feeling a very bard myself i sent those heavenbreathed words into the darksome wood the cords of the grave coiled around me the snares of death confronted me in my distress i cried to my god for help from his temple he heard my voice wonder of wonders even as i spoke those last words i saw a light shining in the wood so pale and dim i first thought i must have imagined it i looked and the faint glimmer disappeared but when i glanced away again i saw it once more i raised myself up and stared at the place as if to hold it there so that it would not vanish again leaving me alone in the dark i could not see the light directly for all the trees and brush desperate to hold the fragile luminescence i tried to remember the rest of myrddins prayer how did it go and he gazed with no no that was not right the pain in my leg drove out everything else i could not think i took a deep breath and forced myself to concentrate in clumps and snatches the words came to me and i spoke them out and he looked down in his anger and said because their love is set on me i will deliver them i will deliver them from danger for they know my name i will be with them in times of trouble i will rescue them from the grave and bring them honour in my courts i will satisfy them with eternal life to enjoy their rich salvation as i spoke the faint radiance seemed to strengthen gathering itself into a steady gleam like that of the moon on a mistshrouded winter night i thought that the light might yet break forth but though i continued repeating the psalm over and over again the fragile light remained a mere pearly glimmering and beyond that did not increase after a time i felt the winter chill seeping into my bones my clothes were damp with sweat and the air was cold and i began to shiver each tremble sent a jolt of pain through me as it meant moving my leg i clenched my teeth and willed the gently gleaming light to stay i do not know how long i lay there shivering with pain and cold grinding my teeth and praying for that small thin glow to remain it seemed a long time however long enough for me to begin harbouring the suspicion that i had indeed lost both gereint and bors and was now completely alone once this suspicion hardened into certainty i decided to try to get up and move in the direction of the light searching around me for a sturdy branch to use for a staff i put my hand to a crooked tree limb it was old and the rotten bark came off in my hand but the wood was strong enough to support me and so i used it to pull myself up onto my feet once more my injured leg still throbbed with the slightest movement but i clenched my teeth steadied myself and started off i found i could hobble only a few paces before the pain grew too great to bear and i must stop and rest then after a few moments respite i staggered on i saw that i was following the trail which the black beast had forced as it crashed through the wood this made my passage somewhat less difficult for i was able to steady myself against the fallen trees and broken branches thus by halts and starts i proceeded along the narrow path despite the cold i was soon sweating once more with the pain and exertion my breath hanging in phantom clouds around my head i listened all the while alert to any sound in the forest i strained to hear gereint returning at any moment or bors or the black beast but no i was alone again fear boiled up but i swallowed it down and moved on berating my companions for running off as i supposed after the horses how i had come by this notion i cannot say consumed by my own troubles i had not spared a single kindly thought for them indeed they could have been lying wounded or dead in the wood nearby and i would not have been any the wiser blessed jesu forgive a foolish man i sighed aloud and then breathed a silent prayer for the safety of my friends these thoughts and prayers occupied me as i staggered my slow way along the trail towards the faint moonshimmer of radiance at long last the trail turned slightly and i came to a huge bramble thicket an infernally dense tangle of spiked vines and thorny branches had it been a rampart of stone it could not have been more formidable yet the monstrous creature appeared to have crashed into this wall and in its blind rage driven a ragged gap into the closegrown tangles although i could not discern the source the light seemed to be coming from somewhere beyond the hedge wall i leaned on my crooked staff gazing at the thicket the throb in my leg had become a steady pulse of pain and my side felt as if live coals were smouldering under the skin i was shivering with cold and pain and sweating at the same time i closed my eyes and leaned harder on my staff jesu nave mercy i groaned i am hurt and i am alone and i am lost if you do not help me now i was still trying to marshal my waning strength to attempt the hedge when i heard quick rustling footsteps behind me my first thought was that the monster had returned this fear swiftly vanished at the sound of my name gwalchavad here i called here i am i turned to stare back down the narrow path that had led me to this place a moment later i saw gereint loping towards me his face gleaming ghostly in the pale light he carried a sword mine it was and wore an expression of mingled relief and wonder lord gwalchavad you are alive he said as he joined me out of breath he stuck the sword in the ground and bent over with his hands on his knees i feared you were he paused gulping air then said i feared i had lost you but then i saw the light and followed it observing my leg he asked is it bad i can endure it i replied what of bors have you seen him not since the attack he answered god help him i replied then leaving bors welfare in the good lords hands i turned once more to the thicket the light drew me here too it seems to be coming from the other side of this hedge wall we will go through together said gereint taking up the sword he stepped to the gap and began slashing at the briers he cleared the path before us and reached a hand back for me go before me i told him i will follow he peered at me doubtfully then turned and resumed his chopping at the knotted branches he hewed like a champion slashing with tireless strokes the vapour from his breath hung in a cloud above him and his hair grew damp and slick but he stood to his work arms swinging shoulders rolling as he hacked at the dangling vines i followed hobbling a step at a time as the hedge parted before gereints blade in this way we proceeded until we are through gereint declared triumphantly glancing up i saw the light shining through and gereint standing in the breach sword in hand whatever lay beyond the hedge wall occupied his complete attention thirtyfour i staggered behind gereint into a wide clearing beyond the allenclosing thicket the ground was rocky and uneven and the hedge wall stood back in a circle all around in the centre of the clearing rested a squat stone hut with a steep highpitched roof also of stone the walls were squared solid and without openings of any kind and the roof was covered with moss in all a most curious dwelling beside the house stood a stone plinth of the kind the romans used to erect for their statues and memorials there was no memorial or statue now but a heap of broken rubble at the foot of the plinth suggested that once there might have been these things i took in first and only when gereint spoke did i feel the calming silence of the place it is very peaceful here the young warrior said and even at a whisper his voice seemed to boom like a beaten drum placing a finger to my lips i warned him against speaking aloud until we could discover whether we were the only visitors gereint nodded and took my arm upon his shoulder and we proceeded cautiously towards the dwelling we had been drawn to the clearing by the light now that we were here however there was no light to be found and none to be seen that is there appeared no source of illumination no campfire no torches no subtle sunlight shining down from above yet the stone hut did stand suflused in a softly gleaming radiance very like that of moonlight and what is more this gentle gloaming bathed the entire clearing with a fine luminescence that shimmered gently at the edges of my vision whenever i looked directly at an object this ghostly glimmering faded though the soft glow remained wary with every step we approached the stone hut moving slowly along the near side to what we took to be the front there we found a door both low and narrow its threshold overgrown with weeds and grass so small was this entrance that only one could pass at a time and that one must bow almost to his knees to enter gereint cleared away the growth with a few quick swipes of his blade then sword in hand stooped and entered a moment later his face appeared in the doorway and he said it is empty lord there is no one here with some difficulty and no little pain for i could no longer bend my injured leg at all and had to lie down and drag myself through the opening i joined him within gereint raised me to my feet again and we stood together in a holy place it is some kind of chapel gereint said his voice filling the stonewalled room the same weird light that played in the clearing outside also filled the interior of the single vaulted room allowing us to see each detail of the rich ornamentation for every surface was carved with wonderful designs intricate knotwork panels and borders countless triscs and spirals and hundreds of the elongated muchentwined shapes of animals and men i recognized this adornment it was that which the celts of old made with such zeal and delight there were also innumerable crosses carved on the walls and floors many with odd runelike symbols which i could not read the room unforgiving in its square spare simplicity seemed to dance to the rhythm and movement of those wonderful carvings to stand and gaze upon floor and walls and roof was to inhabit a psalm or a glad song of praise i filled my eyes with the graceful dance of the room and felt my spirit rise up within me truly this is a sacred place i said an ancient place gereint replied look how listen i held up my hand to quiet him there came the sound of a soft footfall someone was moving along the wall outside gereint made a flattening motion with his hand and silently stepped to the doorway sword ready i stood stockstill straining into the silence there came no shouts no cries of help or alarm i held my breath and heard only the rapid beating of my own heart and then a quick movement at the door and a dark shape burst into the room straightened and became the familiar figure i knew bors gereint lowered the blade and fell back he had been that close to striking here you are bors cried lowering the sword in his own hand and here was i thinking i had lost you for good his relief was instantly swallowed in amazement as he beheld the walls and floor he turned his wondering gaze upon the beautiful carvings and we joined him in silent admiration explanations could wait a greater mystery commanded our attention when he spoke again it was in a voice humbled with awe it is wonderful that it is i agreed i have never seen the like it reminds me of those cells the monks make in armorica look here he said moving towards the rear of the chapel the altar still stands and he broke off so suddenly i glanced quickly at his face which now wore an expression of revulsion lips twisted in a grimace of distaste eyes narrowed in disgust with my crooked staff i struggled across the room to join him damn them to hell he muttered turning his face away then i saw what he had seen and turned my face away too the sight and smell brought bile to my mouth and i coughed feeling the burn in my throat as i swallowed it back desecrated on the altar before us lay the severed genitals of a bull the members placed atop a pile of human excrement the bulls bloody horns with bits of the skull and tail with part of the anus attached flanked the stinking mound on either side and the poor animals tongue torn out by the root completed the repugnant arrangement have you found something gereint hastened to where we stood i tried to warn him off but was too late and he pushed in beside bors the young warrior looked at the altar clapping a hand to his mouth he choked and turned swiftly away that is the worst of it i said holy jesu he whispered in a small wounded voice this is not right bors declared solemnly i will not allow it so saying he stripped off his cloak and flung it over the obscene display i thought that he meant merely to cover the desecration but he had another plan for he spread the cloak and then gathered up the defiling mass folding it into the cloth holding the bundle at arms length he bore it from the chapel returning a moment later with a double handful of grass in each fist striding to the altar bors took to scrubbing the flat stone with the grass i need some water he said through clenched teeth maybe there is a well outside said gereint darting away i leaned exhausted against the wall while bors put the full strength of his arms into the cleansing of the venerable stone as he worked a faint green sheen began to gleam where the grass crushed by its abrasion left some of its substance see here gwalchavad bors called motioning me nearer what is this i hobbled closer and only then did bors notice i was wounded but you are hurt brother forgive me i should have i will live never fear i said waving his apology aside indicating the altar i said what do you make of it it is a circle and words i think he pointed to a broken arc of spidery lines which seemed to be etched in the stone but i cannot read the letters nor can i i told him perhaps if we could see more of it bors fell to scrubbing again as if by brute effort he could make the words appear but for all his muscle the thin cracked lines did not mend or improve it is no use bors whatever is written on that stone is worn away and there is no reading it now bors ceased rubbing and stood with knots of grass clenched in his fists i should go see what has become of gereint he said but his eyes never left the etched surface of the stone yes and then we should decide what to do next curiously we were both reluctant to leave the altar we stood staring at the fragmented lines neither making a move until gereint returned a few moments later he burst into the chapel in a rush of excitement there is a well he exclaimed bustling towards us and i found this bowl on a chain i had some difficulty getting the bowl free without spilling the water but he stopped when he saw what we were looking at it looks like writing aye lad it is bors affirmed but we can make nothing of it maybe this will help replied gereint stepping quickly to the altar he raised the vessel and dashed the contents over the stone the water struck the stone with a hiss and a splutter casting up great vaporous clouds of steam while droplets of water sizzled and cracked as if the altar had been ironheated in the forge bors and gereint drew back a step and i threw an arm over my face and twisted away lest i be scalded by the heat blast jesu be praised breathed gereint look lowering my arm i gazed once more upon the altar through the steam i could see the incised lines glowing with a golden sheen even as i watched the thin broken lines joined deepened became robust and bold the flat altar stone had changed too glittering and smooth as a new polished gem it gleamed with the milky radiance of crystal shot through with veins of silver and flecks of crimson and gold the image on the stone resolved clearly into that of a broad circular band of gold with a cross inside bent around the band was a finely drawn ring of words flanking the circle and cross on either side were two figures creatures whose bodies appeared to be made of fire with wings outspread as if in supplication or worship it is beautiful murmured gereint the words said bors his voice soft with awe what do they say i have never seen writing like this i said is it latin he wondered perhaps i allowed doubtfully but it is not like any latin the monks use see how the letters curve and twist back upon one another i think it must be some other script gereint his face illumined by the soft golden light gazed upon the altar figures with a beatific expression on his face oblivious to all else he sank to his knees before the altar his lips moving in an unspoken prayer the purity of this simple spontaneous act shamed me and i averted my eyes then i heard a movement beside me and when i looked back bors had joined the young warrior on his knees the two knelt together shoulder to shoulder hands upraised in the posture of monks had i been able to bend my leg i would have joined them instead i clung to my crude crutch and raised my voice to heaven blessed jesu i prayed my voice sounding loud and clear in the sacred place i come to you a beggar in need great evil stalks this forest and we are not strong enough to overcome it help us lord do not forsake us nor yet leave us prey to the powers of the evil one then remembering the ruined chapel and its desecration i added holy one of god accept our poor offering of water poured out upon the stone sain this chapel with your presence and restore the glory of your name in this place so be it into the silence of the chapel came the echo of a song like one of those myrddin sometimes plays in which the harp seems to spin the melody of itself gift songs the emrys calls them so quiet it took me a moment to realize that it was not of my imagining bors and gereint ceased their prayers and raised their eyes above i too gazed around for it seemed as if the music derived from the heights i saw nothing but the shadowed recesses of the highpitched roof the music exquisite in its simple elegance grew louder and i saw the shadows fade as the carvings on the roof and walls of the chapel began to glimmer and glow we gazed in wonder at the old old markings as the delicate interwoven lines filled with the same shimmering radiance that transformed the altar soon we three were bathed in soft golden light suddenly the chapel was filled with a sound like that of the wind swirling through longleafed willows or the rush of feathered wings beating the air when birds take flight with this sound came music very faint but distinct and unmistakable the celestial music of the heavenly realms a joy like that which i had experienced when i knelt alone in the presence of the grail once more filled my heart and it swelled to bursting for me to hear the strains of that glorious song swirling like a graceful wind sweeping the crannies and corners of the chapel i closed my eyes and turned my face heavenward and felt the warmth of the golden light on my skin and knew a fine and holy rapture then more wonderful than anything that had gone before there came to me a fragrance far surpassing that of all the flowers that ever grew i drew the marvellous scent deep into my lungs and breathed the air of heaven itself and on my tongue i tasted the honeyed sweetness of that rarest of atmospheres i tasted and knew even before i opened my eyes that we were no longer alone thirtyfive gereint saw her first still kneeling before the altar he raised his head and his eyes widened slightly in surprise but there was neither fear nor alarm in the expression only delight the light reflected on his face made him appear wise and good bors kneeling beside gereint his still head bowed had yet to apprehend the visitor in our midst she took the appearance of an earthly woman her features dark and dusky her skin smooth and clear as amber honey she stood before us as calmly and naturally as any mortal being but with the dignity and grace only the heavenborn possess her eyes were blue as the sunwashed sky pale against the tawny hue of her supple flesh hair the colour of autumn chestnuts hung in long loose curls around her shoulders and spilled over the fine gentle curves of her breasts clothed in a robe of deepest crimson with a woven girdle of blue fretted with plaited gold she seemed to me the very image and essence of beauty wisdom and dignity conjoined in the elegant winsome form of a woman i could have lingered a lifetime in her presence and reckoned it only joy i could gladly have stood entranced forever and counted it nothing but pleasure as fairest of the great kings servants she bent over the altar gazing devoutly upon the object in her hands her devotion drew my own i looked and saw what it was that the maiden had placed upon the altar the grail my first thought was that the blessed cup had been found that she had somehow got it away from those who had stolen it and was now returning it to us this notion was instantly dashed however as if in answer to my thought the grail maiden turned her head and looked directly at me and the fire that burned in those clear blue eyes was terrible to see turn away sons of dust the angel said in a voice unyielding as the altar stone the cup before you is holy you defile it with your presence speechless with shame and amazement i could only stare at her and feel the full depth of my worthlessness in her eyes glancing at gereint i saw that he had bent his head under the weight of futility and held his clasped hands tight against his chest bors had collapsed inwardly upon himself his hands lying palm upward on the floor his head touching his knees did you think me incapable of defending that which i have been ordained to uphold blind guides how is it that you can see so much yet understand so little her words were like fire scorching my ears with the vehemence of her anger i do not know which is worse your ignorance or your arrogance think you the great king requires the aid of any mortal to accomplish his will is the lord of creation powerless to protect his treasures her righteous scorn leapt like a flame withering my selfrespect and misplaced honour with its indignant heat o mighty guardians she demanded where were you when the enemy laid hand to your treasure did you imagine the cup of christ would be protected by frail flesh i stared in dismay and could not answer hear me sons of dust you held the kingdom of summer in your grasp and you threw it away you have destroyed the one opportunity you were granted to bring peace to the peoples of the earth i could not endure her anger any longer please i cried i am an ignorant man it is true if i have failed to silence the angel cried and the walls of the chapel quaked at the word the grail cup is returning to the hand that gave it look upon it son of dust look upon it and weep at your loss for this is the last it will be seen in this worldsrealm bending over the cup she reached out to take it up once more and i knew no mortal being would ever again know its healing presence no wait i said and the grail keeper hesitated the light of righteous anger flaring in her eyes again i had braved it once and would a thousand times over if i could but stay her hand a little longer forgive me lady my words and ways are crude i know but i mean no disrespect it is only that i do not know how to speak as i ought truly i could not endure the knowledge that this holy cup has passed from the world of men because of my failure if there is any way the glorious vessel can be redeemed only tell me and i pledge my life and all i possess to its redemption the maiden regarded me with a look both piercing and pitying her reply was bladesharp why weary heaven with your contemptible pleading think you to sway what has been commanded from before the earth was framed and the stars set in their courses please i said summoning every grain of courage i owned to one last entreaty it is not for myself that i ask less yet for those whose duty it was to defend the grail but for those who struggle in darkness for the light they have so little and their needs are so great the merest glimpse of the holy cup is enough to give them courage to abide the misfortunes of their lot with hope and faith in the life to come it is for them that i plead i beg you do not take the grail away the lady listened to my plea but her face remained like flint and her fierce gaze unaltered words cannot atone for your sin and failure then take me instead i pray i will endure the fires of perdition and that gladly if my suffering could be accounted for the reclamation of the summer realm and the cup that upholds it you are a man indeed she conceded softening somewhat but it is not to be so saying she reached for the cup and took it between her hands i knew i looked my last upon the most holy grail she straightened and made to turn away paused and raised her head her gaze lifted as if heeding a voice i could not hear i saw this and hope leapt in my heart nodding once she turned to me again most fortunate of men are you she said for the lord of hosts has heard the plea of your heart and has been moved to give you a second chance to prove yourselves worthy the grail will stay joy flowed up and over me in a warm giddy rush but for my injured leg i would have thrown myself to my knees before her and kissed the hem of her robe in gratitude thank you i breathed thank you your petition has been granted she told me for the sake of the king you serve and those who stand in need of the blessing of this holy cup before i could think what to say she continued her voice assuming a commanding tone once more hear me sons of dust it has been decided that you are to be shown what you have pledged your lives to protect and who it is that sustains you in your duty placing the cup upon the altar once more her fingers described a graceful figure in the air and the grail gathered radiance drawing light to itself shining with a rosy brilliance as if reflecting the sunrays of creations dawn when she removed her hands i saw that a faint circle of light had formed in the air above the rim behold she said and spread her hands wide at once i heard a sound like that of a struck harp and a bright light leapt up and the altar began to glow with a fine and holy light i do not know how to say it otherwise but that this radiance expanded outward to embrace the whole of the chapel the stone walls began to shine and the incised designs seemed to move and grow in the light entwining with one another and spreading to form patterns of gleaming light the next i knew those selfsame walls were not stone anymore but gold still the alteration did not end there for the patterns continued to grow and change and the gold paled to white marble and that gave way to crystal so pure i could see through the very walls to the world beyond all green and lush beneath a sky of gold look upon me son of dust and know me as i am the lady said i do not think she spoke aloud this time but i heard her clearly and emboldened by the tenderness of her invitation i looked and saw that she like the chapel had changed indeed the woman who stood before me now was taller and far more noble in face and figure her long hair was silverwhite and so too the robe which clothed her slender form her skin was pale as milk or moonlight and she seemed despite her aspect and the obvious maturity of her body to manifest the spirited youth of a child the visible manifestation of her sustaining power rose behind her in two radiant arcs subtle yet perceptible as a rippling rainbow in the sunlight shimmering with vital potency overarching and sweeping out like enfolding wings to sustain and protect her face once fair to look upon was no less beautiful now yet it was a piercing beauty almost frightening in its symmetry and the compelling elegance of its proportions piercing too the radiance that streamed from her almost too bright to look upon and of a quality that penetrated the heart as well as the eye and illumined both for to see her was to know one looked upon a glory that partook of the heavenly and was the birthright of those who served in the high king of heavens celestial courts behold she said again and i saw that the cup had changed no longer a vessel of jewelled metal indeed there was neither ornament nor design no gold gems or pearls no inscribed scrollwork nor any other such embellishment yet it glittered and shone with a dancing brilliance as if it were made of golden starfire for it was garbed in its heavenly form now and was as high above the earthly cup as the grail maiden was above her mortal sisters this i thought this is the true cup of christ these words formed in my mind before i knew what they meant even so i heard in them truths clear and undisputed ring the grail maiden raised the holy cup from the nowtranslucent altar stone turned and holy saviour offered it to me i hesitated glancing towards gereint and bors for help but their heads were bowed and their eyes were closed as if in raptured sleep it was to me alone that she extended the wondrous bowl still i hesitated lest i defile the holy cup with my touch take it noble gwakhavad the angel urged gently her tone melting honey and sunlight with trembling hands i reached out and received the sacred bowl the blood of christ shed for you gwakhavad she intoned drink deep of it and be renewed in body mind and spirit my heart beating within me like a captive creature sensing its release i raised the sacred bowl and saw the liquid glint of deep crimson as i brought it to my lips i put my mouth to the rim closed my eyes and emptied the cup the wine danced on my tongue like cool fire it was sweet to the taste but with a tart almost bitter edge that revealed subtle depths of flavour although i am no master of the vine i would have said that it must far surpass the finest wine ever poured into an emperors cup as i swallowed i felt the renewing warmth spread out from my throat and stomach passing through my limbs and out to the tips of my fingers and toes the sensation after innumerable privations of the trail was so pleasurable i could not help smiling my injured leg tingled and i realized the pain was swiftly ebbing away to a distant memory i flexed the limb and discovered it whole and hale once more the grail maiden extended her hands and i released the wonderful bowl inclining her head as she received the cup she smiled at my delighted surprise and then holding her palm above the cups rim turned to gereint though i heard nothing the instant she turned from me the young warrior raised his head and opened his eyes as if summoned the angel offered him the cup in the same way she had offered it to me and gereint took it in both hands lifted it and drank draining the cup in great gulping swallows as if he could not get the liquid inside him fast enough then embarrassed by his immoderate quaffing he bent his head and returned the holy cup to the maiden who accepted it nicely she must have spoken a word of encouragement to him for gereint raised his head and smiled then it was bors turn to drink from the cup which he did with his customary exuberance seizing the proffered vessel in both hands he elevated it once twice three times over the altar then brought it to his mouth and drained it down much as i had seen him do on countless occasions in arthurs hall tilting back his head he swallowed and then paused savouring the draught before returning the empty bowl to the angel noble lady he said the only one among us to speak aloud the grail maiden bent her head in acknowledgment and replaced the sacred cup on the altar stone whereupon she raised her hands to shoulder height palms outward and said rise friends and stand this time she spoke aloud and oh to hear that voice was to know the intimate ecstasy of a lover when beckoned by his best beloved she called us friends and i vowed within myself to be worthy of the word to the end of my earthly life this day you have by grace been granted a foretaste of heavens feast she told us those to whom much is given much is required draw near by faith and stand at the altar where mens hearts are tried and known raising her face heavenward she appeared to listen for a moment and then began reciting aloud the words as she was given them she said receive the word of the lord the kingdom of summer is close at hand but the evil one is closer still he roars and raves and roams the earthly crust ever seeking those he might destroy hold fast to the truth my friends and know in your hearts that where the king of kings is honoured evil cannot prevail remember greater is he who is in you than he who is in the world fear nothing but gird yourself for the battle to come and cling to the sword of your salvation i tell you the truth the greatest among you fell from grace through the sin of pride trusting in strength was his weakness trusting in wisdom was his folly lusting after honour he was bewitched by one who honours only lust and lies thus are the mighty undone therefore trust not in the strength of your arms nor the wisdom of your minds rather trust in him who made them and who with his swift sure hand upholds all things heed well the warning i give you the battle is perilous and it is deadly earnest yet in the twistings of the fight as in the darkness of the night you are not alone the champion of heaven rides before you seize the victory in his name the grail maiden bade us farewell saying the grail abides for the sake of all who stand in need of its blessing i charge you to guard it well raising her right hand she made the sign of the cross and said all grace and power and righteousness be upon you now and forevermore so be it she seemed to grow both larger and taller as she spoke and her form lost its solidity becoming crystalline and sharp before fading from sight in a muted flare of dazzling starlight the gleam lingered for a while where she had stood and then that too disappeared when i looked the sacred grail had vanished and in its place was the same vessel i had seen in arthurs hands at the consecration of the shrine the altar stone was merely a stone once more and the chapel only a bare room with walls of figured stone we three came slowly to ourselves like men waking from a dream we all had shared i looked at bors and gereint and my heart moved within me to see them good and faithful men noblehearted loyal through all things to death and beyond how was it possible that i should have gained a portion of such friendship gereint saw my look and said if that was a dream never wake me it was no dream bors replied stirring himself and looking around did you not drink from the holy cup what did it taste like to you asked gereint it was the wine of course i told him and fine wine too wine roared bors i wonder at you gwalchavad it was never wine have i lived so long not to know mead when i taste it he looked to gereint to support this assertion what say you brother mead or wine it was the sweetest most pure water i have ever tasted replied gereint blissfully ignoring bors lead like water from a living spring wine and water scoffed bors shaking his head in mystified disbelief it was mead i tell you mead sweet elixir of life and libation of kings how can anyone say otherwise i gazed longingly at the altar the cup remained but not a glimmer of that wild exultant light persisted how strange i murmured to myself we held eternity in our hands had we but known eh said bors glancing at me over his shoulder what was that we have been given another chance i said let us vow here and now to prove ourselves worthy of our charge this time aye bors agreed solemnly she called us guardians and i will die before i leave this place undefended gereint agreed and we all pledged ourselves to stand guard over the grail until arthur returned or death overtook us we had best look outside i said starting for the door lord gwalchavad your leg gereint began there was healing in the cup i declared i tell you bors i feel more refreshed and alive than i have in years his smile was ready and wide i believe you brother for my part i do not believe i ever felt this good he gazed around him in expectant wonder as if hoping to see something of the splendour that we had witnessed only moments before truly i begin to understand what arthur must have felt when he was dragged from deaths door with the greatest reluctance we left the altar and crossed the chapel to the door where one by one we bowed low and passed through the narrow way in recognition of my healing i placed my rude staff just inside the door and stepped through once outside the darkness struck us like the blow of a fist though the clearing still glimmered as if with pale moonlight we reeled on our feet for a moment before finding our balance again all is quiet mused bors gazing around at the forest dark and forbidding as it loomed over the small circle of the clearing as much as i wish it i doubt it will remain so i was about to suggest that one of us should make a circuit of the chapel to ensure that the clearing remained secure when bors said shh he stiffened his eyes narrowing as he stared into the darkness gereint and i froze and waited for bors to speak someone is watching us bors said after a moment his voice low and tight i heard gereint ease his sword from the strap at his belt and wished i had something better than a knife where whispered gereint stepping closer i see no one there bors replied indicating the place with the blade in his hand you there waiting in the shadows come out careful brother i warned taking my place behind his right shoulder i motioned for gereint to guard bors left side there may be more lurking in the trees beyond we advanced halfway across the clearing and stopped you there called bors sternly come out and declare yourself from the deepshadowed darkness a voice called out bors gwalchavad it is peredur said gereint starting forward bors caught him by the arm and pulled him back with a warning look as a solitary figure stepped from the surrounding wood into the clearing we waited the young warrior stepped nearer and i recognized the familiar shape and stance at last it is peredur gereint insisted and hastened to welcome his friend i feared you had been killed by the beast long since have you seen the others is there no one else here peredur asked looking past gereint to bors and myself arthur and myrddin are they here it is only the three of us gereint told him we have seen no one else since coming to this part of the wood raising a hand to the chapel behind us he said we have seen the grail it was here truly wondered peredur i would give much to have seen that the remark was innocence itself but the way he said it made our holy experience seem a petty thing if we had said we had seen a green dog or a calf with two heads it might have drawn the same remark bors scrutinized the young man closely where is your horse he asked oh nearby answered peredur indifferently i have ridden hard and the animal is tired i found a trail think the others used it not long ago come we can find them and did you come by way of the burning oak asked bors abruptly i noticed he had yet to put up his weapon no answered peredur i came a different way the young warrior seemed disinclined to say more but bors pursued the matter which way would that be then he said more in the way of a demand than a question peredur turned and looked bors full in the face i came by another way the young man said speaking plain and low there was an edge to his voice i had never heard before who can find their way in this wood said gereint how long have you been waiting out there demanded bors peredurs eyes narrowed as he gazed at bors but he made no reply bors did not allow the query to go unanswered it is perfectly simple he said bristling with animosity how long were you standing out there waiting for us gereint who had been eager to interpose himself between the two looked to me for help i warned him off with a motion of my hand and he stepped back peredur put out his empty hands in a show of goodwill your suspicions are illplaced my friends he said with an awkward laugh yet i bear no grudge indeed i forgive you right readily come now let us put aside this contention and think what we must do to unite ourselves with our swordbrothers once again peredur turned away and made to step around bors he had taken but one step when bors seized him by the shoulder and yanked him back around stay where you are he shouted gwalchavad relieve him of his sword knife in hand i stepped slowly towards the young warrior saying stand easy brother there is nothing to fear we are your friends you behave like enemies he snarled backing away the hate in his voice struck me like a balled fist stand said bors repeating his command with a jerk of his sword the man before us opened his mouth to protest then hesitated only for an instant but when he spoke his demeanour had altered completely the hate and suspicion fell away from him and he became so mild and contrite i felt ashamed of myself for doubting him cymbrogi he said it is me peredur why are you treating me so poorly raising an inoffensive hand he made to step by us i am so glad to see you truly i thought i would never see any of you again how long have you been here forgive us brother gereint said with a sigh of relief we did not mean to offend you he put up his sword and glanced at bors expectantly bors too lowered his blade we should try to find arthur and myrddin peredur said they cannot be far away i will show you the trail come with me it is not far instantly my senses pricked i felt a thin thrill of fear ripple across my shoulders without a second thought i stepped swiftly to peredur my knife flicked up in the same quick motion and i pressed the keen edge hard against his throat step away from us gereint i commanded bors take his weapon peredur gaped in disbelief have you gone mad perhaps i replied as bors sword upraised quickly snatched the blade from the young mans hand from the corner of my eye i glimpsed the chapel and it came into my mind how we might discern the truth but you will forgive us our madness i think we will not be deceived again i grasped him by the upper arm and my knife still hard against his throat i pulled him forward where are you taking me he asked growing frightened to the altar i answered where mens hearts are tried and known thirtysix the grail is gone morgaws telk me that it disappeared the lying bitch insists she had it secured and that from the moment llenlleawg delivered it to her the casket never left her sight the casket she possesses still but the cup is gone what is more she claims it vanished at the moment the kings champion attacked his king morgaws will pay for this blunder oh yes she will pay dearly i taught her better than this could she not see how much they valued the grail that alone should have warned her to be on her guard how could she be so blind the insolent cow insinuates that it is my fault for not warning her of the cups true power i remind her that whatever else it may be the cup is just bait in a trap so far as she is concerned and that whatever powers it might possess the gaudy trinket certainly did not divert the doom which even now crushes our enemies in its cold embrace the disappearance of the cup makes not the slightest difference it will not change anything all is ordered as i have planned and even now the end swiftly approaches already events are hurtling towards the consummation of my plan my crowntaking and the reign of terror to follow my triumph will be devastating some monarch upon accession to the throne declare the pardon of their opponents and the forgiveness of sins practised against them i shall do the opposite however the blood will flow from one end of britain to the other i think i shall begin with bishops and then well all in good time first i must have that cup morgaws will devote her full attention to its recovery before the fools somehow discover what it was they let slip away the thought that they might get hold of it again does not sit well with me it may be time for me to intervene brother said peredur dragging his feet there is no need for this you are anxious over nothing i drew the young warrior forward a few paces whereupon he stopped gereint he said pleading you are my kinsman tell them tell them bors stepped behind us and prodded the reluctant warrior from behind with the sword point in the small of his back move along friend peredur outmanned and unarmed seemed to accept his lot he nodded and proceeded docilely you are wise to be suspicious he said after a few steps but you know me what can you possibly hope to achieve it is meaningless at this i began to doubt what did i hope to prove by making him swear his faith and loyalty before the altar it was as he had said a meaningless exercise and would prove nothing i felt hard bone and muscle under my hand and doubt stole over me fool what are you doing has the enemy so confused and deceived you that you can no longer tell the difference between friend and foe let him go as if echoing my thoughts peredur said let me go will not think the worse of you trust me we can still find the others but we must hurry if i had been alone i believe i would have released him then and there the urge to do so was stronger than my conviction to see the thing through but bors when roused is not easily put off save your breath he told the young warrior flatly it is soon over and no harm will come to you with that we marched to the chapel door whereupon i removed the knife from his throat and shifting my free hand to the back of his head pushed peredur down so he could navigate the low entrance he stooped and bent his back as he entered the narrow opening but as his foot touched the threshold he suddenly froze no he shouted and made to squirm away i renewed my grip on his arm and held him tight it proves nothing i will not do it bors close behind put out a hand and pushed him further into the narrow opening the young man arched his back and dug in his heels get on with it man bors urged roughly there is nothing to fear no he cried again almost frantic this time his fingers raking at the pillar stones of the entrance no bors larger and stronger pushed him further through the doorway twisting and turning peredur fought resisting with all his strength he shouted to be released his distress turning quickly to rage bors however was growing ever more determined and would not be moved he stooped and with a mighty heave shoved the struggling warrior through the low entrance and into the chapel bors followed him through and i pushed quickly in behind them peredur had landed on hands and knees on the stoneflagged floor and bors stood over him reaching down a hand to raise him up i joined bors and taking hold of the young mans arm said here now come stand before the altar as i took his arm i felt a tremor pass through his body his head whipped around mouth open to bite my hand with but a fleeting glimpse of his face i released my hold and leapt aside bors i cried get back in the same instant peredur gave out a tremendous guttural growl and rose up flinging bors aside as if he were no more than a toddling child bors fell on his side his head striking the stone floor he made to rise and collapsed i dove to his aid as peredur shaking in every limb began howling like an animal bors i cried trying to shake him awake can you hear me get up a ragged snarl of rage filled the chapel i glanced over my shoulder to where peredur stood i no longer recognized him at all his neck was bent forcing his head down low onto his chest his lower jaw jutted out and his mouth gaped revealing teeth both sharp and oddly curved his shoulders and arms were thicker his back more broad with humps of powerful muscle but it was his eyes that startled me most redrimmed and wild they bulged out of their sockets as if they would burst from within still howling he turned and slowly stepped towards me long hands with fingers like claws twitching and reaching bors was still unconscious and i could not leave him i looked for his sword but could not see it gereint i shouted he entered the chapel at a run without a quiver of hesitation gereint interposed himself between the monstrous peredur and me his blade drawn taking no heed the thing lurched nearer growling and slavering like a wolf for the kill gereint held his ground the blade in his hand never wavered heedless of the sword the brute lunged and made a raking swipe which the young warrior deftly deflected the howling thing received a quick slash on the arm in gods name stay back warned gereint at this the creature threw back its head and shrieked gnashing its teeth and clawing at the air then still shrieking it started forth once more bors came awake at the sound he pushed himself up from the floor and struggled to rise only to slump back once more i am with you brother i said holding to him so as to protect him on a sudden inspiration gereint grasped the naked blade and turned it in his hand presenting the hilt upward in imitation of the holy cross as arthur had done at the consecration of the grail shrine taking the blade in both hands he held the sword hilt before him thrusting it at arms length into the brutes face the creature roared and staggered backward gereint advanced holding the swordcross and calling in jesus holy name be gone the brute loosed a mindfreezing scream and began clawing at itself as if to tear the ears from its own hideous head it sank to its knees wailing keening gnashing its teeth dauntless gereint bore down upon it calling upon christ to drive the thing away the wicked thing shrieked and shrieked again to drown out all sound but that of its own torment then even as we watched the thing began to change again its body stretched growing thinner and taller until its narrow head almost touched the rooftrees of the chapel whereupon it could no longer support its height and fell doubling over itself to writhe and thrash beating itself upon the floor gereint unyielding his face hard as flint clutched his improvised cross and stood implacable wailing pitifully the creature continued its hideous transformation its thin body becoming small and scaly and its terrible voice waning away to a high hissing scream it rolled in its writhing coils and then slithered for the chapel door where with the speed of a fleeing serpent it slipped over the threshold and disappeared into the night beyond the young warrior still clutching the swordcross hastened to where i knelt with bors it has gone he said his voice hollow his face drained well done gereint i told him and noticed the blood dripping from his hands he had gripped the sword blade so tightly he had cut his palms and fingers i reached for the hilt you can let go now son the fight is over gereint released the sword which i returned to its place at his side then helped him cut strips from his cloak to bind his hands i tied the strips in place and we turned our attention to bors between us we rolled the big man onto his back bunched up his cloak and put it beneath his head to make him as comfortable as possible then gereint and i sat down together leaning against the stout wall we rested and talked about what had happened what do you think it was gereint wondered a shapeshifter a demon maybe i replied i have heard bishop elfodd tell about such things is that why you thought to bring it into the church truly i do not know what i thought i confessed i only knew that peredur was a devout man and it would be no hardship for him to take an oath before the altar but how did you know it was not peredur something about his manner made me suspicious i cannot say what it was but then shrugged it seemed silly to hold such a small thing against him i doubted myself and almost let him go but how did you know gereint asked then added ruefully i was taken in completely there is no shame in it i assured him as to what warned me i can but say i did not like his manner when i spoke of the grail he behaved as if it were a thing of no importance yes agreed gereint the true peredur would have wanted to see it so i thought to test him at the altar it seemed to me no one given to evil could abide the presence of the grail gereint nodded with sage admiration you are a very druid yourself lord gwalchavad i would never have thought of that i only wish it had been peredur i replied and thought again how very close we had come to believing the lie it could easily have gone the other way and now we would certainly be dead and the chapel undefended as if to draw me out of my unhappy reverie bors awoke just then with a groan and sat up holding his head be easy brother i said bending over him quickly all is well the wicked thing is gone rest a little mmm he said craning his neck around it feels like a wall has fallen on my head here help me stand i took him by the arm and he made to get up but fell back again at once his eyes squeezed shut against the pain ahh no no on second thought i think i will sit here a little longer there is no hurry i told him let us fetch you a drink here gereint take the bowl and bring bors some water the young warrior retrieved the bowl from beside the altar and started for the door you should go with him bors said rubbing his neck it is only outside gereint protested go bors insisted i am well enough to sit here by myself go i could do with a drink too i said and told gereint come then show me the well gereint led me out and around to the rear of the chapel the ground was lumpy with mossy stones and rose to a small tidy outcropping a short distance away here called gereint springing up the rocks the well is just here the well as gereint called it was actually a small pool sometime in the past it had been edged with unshaped stones to form a low wall around its oval perimeter from a metal peg driven into one of the stones dangled the bronze chain which had secured the bowl gereint had used to fetch water to help clean the desecration from the altar we dipped water and as we drank began speculating about how the chapel and the well had come to be here this must have been a joyous place once gereint mused gazing over the clearing i would like to have seen it in happier times was there ever such a time he wondered the grail was offered here i replied whoever built this church must have known it as a holy place oh yes i thought but this is llyonesse the blighted land desolate barren and beset with strange airs and weird creatures perhaps it was not always so this little chapel still survives to tell a different tale after all perhaps there is yet some better hope for llyonesse we should go back before bors wonders what has happened to us i said and leaning low over the water refilled the bowl and we hurried back to the chapel bors had moved himself to the near wall and sat against it accepting the bowl he drank his fill set the vessel aside and professed himself refreshed and ready to resume his duty as grail guardian as if in answer to this declaration gereint cocked his head to one side half turned towards the door and said did you hear that i heard nothing i confessed nor i said bors listen gereint whispered drawing his sword he stepped lightly to the door and out i followed close behind and we scanned the chapel yard i saw nothing and was about to say as much when gereint raised the point of his sword and said there they are until he spoke i had seen nothing but the dark shapes of the trees rising above the thick gloom of the encircling thorn wall but even as he raised his sword i saw the heads and shoulders of three warriors emerge from the darkness of the hedge and step into the clearing i saw the long spears rising above the large round yellow shields they carried and knew we were in for a fight thirtyseven bring bors i commanded tell him to prepare for battle bors is ready the big warrior said taking his place beside me as three more enemy warriors joined the first three already advancing towards us across the clearing more were coming from the thorn hedge within the space of six heartbeats we were surrounded there must have been twenty or more foemen each armed with a spear and a shield some wore pointed helms and others the metal shirts of saecsen men but most were naked to the waist and i could see the pallor of their flesh as they advanced into the halflight of the clearing if it was not bad enough that we were woefully outnumbered we had but two swords between us bors and gereints and i had only a knife two blades and a dagger are not much against twenty i observed wishing i had not lost my spear this blade is yours lord replied gereint delivering it into my hand keep it lad i told him but he would not hear that darting forth he ran a few paces into the clearing stooped snatched something from the ground and returned bearing the sword we had taken from the false peredur it is a good weapon said gereint swinging the blade to get the feel of its heft and balance it will serve good man commended bors approvingly turning his attention to the advancing warband he said shoulder to shoulder brothers keep your backs to the chapel and do not allow any of them to get behind us silently silently they advanced shield to shield forming a bristling wall around us then without so much as a whispered command the spears swung level and they prepared to attack now i cried and we three sprang forward as one slashing with our swords and shouting i was able to cut the spearheads off two shafts with as many chops bors and gereint fared just as well when we broke off our foray six of the enemy had lost the use of their weapons if i expected the loss of their spears would daunt them however i was sadly mistaken for they came on regardless holding their headless spear shafts as if the lack of a killing blade were of no account we waded into them three cymbrogi undaunted united in heart and mind shoulder to shoulder we stood to our work and the bodies toppled like corded wood beneath the woodcutters axe time and time again we struck the steel in our hands pealing like the ringing of bells the enemy now clambered over the corpses of their kinsmen to reach us and still we cut them down and still they came it is no use complained bors as the enemy regrouped for another assault they will not break ranks perhaps we can change their minds i suggested scanning the enemy ranged before us i saw where several advancing foemen carried the shafts of spears from which the blades had been lopped there i shouted pointing with my sword follow me with that we all three ran for the spot i had marked the foemen stood their ground apparently unconcerned that their spears had no heads they held their ground but since their weapons were blunt it was an easy matter to cut them down three fell without so much as a murmur and we were rewarded with a momentary confusion as the enemy jostled one another to repair the gap in their shield wall hacking hard to my right i was able to kill another enemy warrior and gereint yet another we then turned to help bors who was struggling to fend off two more these went down under a frenzied attack by gereint who rolled beneath their shields and stabbed them as they tried to loft their spears to strike thus we suddenly found ourselves standing alone as the enemy fell back to reform the wall once more this is the calmest battle i have ever fought bors observed i have never been in a fight where i was not deaf from the clatter it was true even in a small skirmish the sound is a very din and in most battles it is a deafening roar the shouting of combatants the clash of weapons the screams of the wounded and dying it all melds together to produce a distinctive clamour which can be heard from far away and which once heard is never forgotten but these foemen stood to their grim work in utter silence no shouted commands not even a curse or cry of pain when a blow landed whether they were attacking or dying the only sounds to be heard were the swishing rustle of their feet through the long grass and the dull clanking of their shields where our swords struck moreover the enemy was curiously lethargic their actions were the lumpen clumsy gestures of bodies with no force behind their movements their faces when i glimpsed them from behind their shields were grim and grey but expressionless betraying neither rage nor hate tightlipped and dulleyed they seemed to be performing a laborious and tiresome chore and nothing so dangerous or desperate as battle indeed they lurched and lumbered like men asleep heavy on their feet and slow to react even as i turned to offer this observation to my companions bors muttered i do not believe it he was looking at the place where the first combatants had fallen i turned too and saw the slain warriors rising from the ground like men throwing off sleep they simply arose with a start climbed to their feet and joined their mute companions the weird silent foe shuffled forth once more despair black and bleak yawned before me like an open grave as the realization broke over me we could cut them down but we could not kill them god help us was bors terse reply he had no time to say more for the foemen renewed the attack and we were quickly engaged in trying to regain the small space we had carved for ourselves in the confusion of the next attack gereint succeeded in getting hold of one of the enemy shields this he used to guard his left affording both of us better protection on that side for he made it a virtue to stay close to me we fought side by side and it put me in mind of the times my brother gwalcmai and i had laboured together in all those battles against the saecsen host the attack as poorly conceived as the others soon foundered and the battle settled into a sluggish lumpen rhythm thrust and chop thrust thrust and chop i found it absurdly easy to strike them down for the slowness of the foe and their dull reactions quickly told against them they fell as they fought without a sound readily collapsing and expiring without a murmur only to rise again after a small space and join in the fight as if nothing had happened this made bors frustrated and angry he railed at the enemy filling the dull dreadful silence with taunts and challenges which went unanswered he hewed at them mightily slashing with powerful strokes once he lopped the arm off one hapless foeman the limb spun from the wretchs shoulder in a bloodless arc still gripping the spear shaft in its dead hand the enemy fell and bors let out a whoop of triumph but the unfeeling creature merely picked itself off the ground and came on again even though it could not longer wield a weapon this provoked the big warrior so much that he beheaded the creature next shake that off hellspawn shouted bors thinking he had at last succeeded in removing at least one combatant from the fight alas he was wrong the headless torso lay still for a time only to rise and resume the attack a gaping wound on its shoulders where its head had been as before no blood spewed from the wound and it brought no diminution of persistence the corpse stumbled forth reaching with empty clutching hands unfortunately we had not the stamina of the undead for though they could fall and rise and fall only to rise again though we hacked the weapons from their hands or severed the hands themselves or heads we could not our hands and arms were growing weary and our wounds bled they do not mind dying bors observed deftly striking the fingers from a hand stretching too close because they are dead already but when i lie down i will not get up again so easily i think what are we to do brother there was no stopping them despite the practised efficiency with which we dispatched the foe we received only the smallest respite before they awakened and rose to fight again i could feel the strain in my shoulder and arm my fingers were cramped from gripping the hilt and the blade seemed to have doubled its weight bors too was labouring i could hear his breath coming in grunting gasps as he lunged and thrust time after time after time gereints blade struck again and again from under the near edge of the shield but even his youthful strength could not last forever no doubt that was their sole tactic to wear us down until we could no longer lift a blade to defend ourselves whereupon they would simply overwhelm us and tear us limb from limb we had no other choice however but to stand our ground and fight thus i raised the sword again and again and again slashing and slashing while the undead warriors stumbled ever and again into our blades sweat ran freely down my neck and chest and back mingling with the tears of exhaustion welling from my eyes and spilling down my face jesu help us i prayed as i cut the arm from the wretch before me the warrior shambled ahead pushing his shield into my face sidestepping the clumsy lunge i brought the sword blade down sharply on the back of his neck and he sank like an anvil falling against my legs and throwing me offbalance i tried to kick the body aside but could not shift the dead weight and fell two enemy warriors bore down upon me squirming on my back i kept my sword in their faces and tried to regain my feet as they woodenly jabbed at me with their spears i shouted to bors for help but could not see him i shouted again and dodged a spear thrust the stroke missed my chest but i got a nasty gash in the side seizing the spear shaft with my free hand i flailed with my sword and succeeded in getting to my knees clutching the hilt in both hands i whipped the blade back and forth desperate to gain a space in which i might climb to my feet but the blade struck the iron rim of a foemans shield my fingers long since numb from the relentless toil could no longer hold the hilt and the sword spun from my grasp the long spears drove down upon me i threw myself to one side rolling in a desperate effort to escape one spear jabbed at my head and grazed my cheek seizing the spear shaft i tried to wrest the weapon from my foe but his grasp was like stone as i struggled another spear thrust at my side and i felt my siarc rip as the blade sliced through the fabric narrowly missing my ribs lashing out with both feet i kicked the nearest in the leg and he staggered back i jumped up quickly and was just as quickly surrounded once more three more warriors had joined the first two and all pressed in on me spears level aiming to take me in the chest and stomach just as they prepared to make their final lunge i glimpsed what i thought to be a flash of light out of the corner of my eye and heard gereint cry out in a loud voice taking the shield by the rim he spun around and flung it into the foremost of my attackers the iron rim caught the luckless wretch as he turned his face crumpled and he collapsed taking two others down with him before i could struggle to my feet gereint was over me half lifting half dragging me from danger bors cleaved the skull of another in two and the enemy beaten back for the moment retreated to regroup and attack again you are hurt lord gwalchavad gereint said seeing the blood flowing freely down my side i lost my sword i told him my breath coming in ragged gasps as the pain in my side began to bloom like a flame taking hold of dry tinder ignoring my protests bors examined the wound and said i do not like the look of that one does it hurt not so much i told him it will just help me bind it up before they come at us again i said let us wash it at least bors suggested doubtfully here lad help me get him to the well i could do with a drink myself they bore me to the well between them and sat me down on a rock at the pools edge gereint dropped his blade to the ground and fell facefirst to the water and began drinking noisily i think we must abandon the field bors said raising the edge of my siarc to splash water on the wound we are pledged to the fight i insisted squeezing my eyes shut against the shock of the cold water on my hot wound i will die before i run from a battle gereint maintained staunchly he lowered his face to the pool again and cupped water into his mouth in great gulps did i say we should give up the fight growled bors tearing a strip from my siarc to bind around my waist i only meant that we should retreat into the chapel the entrance is low and narrow they will not find it easy to get at us in there i recognized this as the last desperate tactic of a warband forced to the extreme once we were inside there would be no coming out again but at least we would die on holy ground protecting the blessed cup we were sworn to defend bors tied off the binding regarded his crude handiwork and said there that is the best i can do for now i am certain it will serve i told him with difficulty i turned and leaned painfully down to drink i cupped water in my hand and raised it to my mouth spilling most of it before wetting my tongue gereint having drunk his fill was looking across the clearing to where the enemy much mutilated and ravaged was yet again reforming the battle line we must fly he informed us if we are to reach the chapel i took a last gulp then leaned low over the well to splash water on my face bors stepped beside me and reached down a hand as i made to stand the dull gleam of a submerged object caught my eye in truth i do not know how i saw it at all the pale gloaming of a moonlit night lay upon the chapel clearing and all around us bristled the deeper darkness of the forest but i saw what i saw the faintest glimmer of gold in the shape of a cross my first thought was that i had found the altarpiece of course it must be the cross which had adorned the chapels altar in the desecration of the altar the cross had been taken and thrown into the well and now i had found it and could restore it to its rightful place see here i said my heart leaping at the thrill of my find i give you the missing altarpiece to my companions amazement i reached down into the pool my fingers closed on cold metal and grasping the topmost arm of the cross i drew it slowly out the expressions of astonishment on their faces were wonderful to see and caused me to forget for a moment the fiery pain burning in my side indeed i was so enjoying their amazement i did not myself see the object until i had pulled it from the water a curious altarpiece that observed bors gereint wideeyed with the strangeness of it nodded only then did i look down to see that i held not a cross but a sword a mass of vines and weed wrack dangled from the long tapering blade the weapon had been wrapped in the stuff to disguise it i reckoned still i would have known the weapon anywhere how not i have seen it nearly every day for the past seven years that was well done enthused gereint you have got yourself another sword not just a sword son i told him clutching the hilt tightly in both hands this is arthurs sword thirtyeight caledvwlch gereint knelt quickly beside me and stretched out his hands to receive the sword which i delivered into his eager grasp taking up the weapon the young warrior proceeded to tear away the slimy tangle and then plunged the sword into the well and washed it clean there he said drawing the weapon from the water it is ready to serve the king once more then before bors or i knew what he was about the young warrior lofted the pendragons battle sword threw back his head and shouted for god and arthur with that he darted away his cry echoing through the wood bors leapt after him to pull him back but the youth was already beyond reach gereint shouted bors the young warrior flying headlong to meet the undead enemy did not even break stride go with him i urged help him for god and arthur came the cry again pressing gereints sword into my hand bors said i will return as soon as i can he hastened away in a tired rolling lope to engage the enemy one last time i sat on the edge of the well clutching my sword and praying for protection for my friends great of might i said aloud we are weary and we are overcome we have no other help but you and if you do not deliver us now we will surely die having spoken my mind i made the sign of the cross over my heart and then using the sword as a staff pulled myself up onto my feet and stumbled painfully to join my swordbrothers in the fight the undead warriors had regrouped and were advancing once more bors had almost reached the battle line but gereint was yet a dozen paces ahead of him loosing a loud battle cry the impetuous young warrior leapt forward the great sword a blur of gleaming steel around him as he flung himself headlong into the centre of their ranks oh it was bold it was brave it was foolhardy beyond belief but my heart soared to see him as he charged alone into the fray brandishing the sword and bellowing his wild war chant behold even before gereint could strike a blow the enemys relentless advance staggered to a halt heedless gereint raced ahead and the ranks of the undead collapsed before him he swung caledvwlch around his head and leapt to the right and left everywhere he turned the enemy fell away back and back they fled stumbling over one another in their haste to escape wonder of wonders it was as if they could not abide the sight of the sword much less stand against it the mere sight of the sovereign sword of britain made them cry out in alarm and dismay for whenever gereint came near they opened their silent mouths and filled the air with piteous wails the thin bloodless sound tore up from their hollow throats in long biting shrieks that ended in raking sobs and clashing teeth their faces once impassive now convulsed in the hideous rictus of abject mindless terror though rarely seen elsewhere it is an expression common enough on the battlefield and i had seen it more times than i like to remember on the faces of men who knew themselves bereft of every hope and doomed to swift destruction that the sight of caledvwlch should inspire such horror amazed me so i stood flatfooted and stared as all around me the enemy abandoned their weapons and fled the field in a mad futile effort to escape they trampled one another and falling clawed their way over their comrades in a blind panic but gereint was not daunted leaping and spinning striking with clean efficient strokes he cut them down as they fled before him with each stroke and every thrust another enemy fell and this time they did not rise again but expired screaming as they died god help me their shrieking was more appalling than their loathsome silence it cut me to the quick to hear it even as i rejoiced in the victory the young warrior became a very reaper cutting a wide swath of destruction and havoc through the crumbling ranks of the undead as the last of them fell before caledvwlchs fury i saw bors standing a little distance away his shoulders bent his sword dangling at his side brother i said it looks as though we live to fight again gereint exultant in his triumph came running to where we stood his face glowing with exertion and pride did you see he cried almost shaking with jubilation did you see that we did lad bors assured him you swinging that sword and cutting them down as they fled it is a sight i will never forget a glorious sight i agreed gereint my friend you are a very bard of battle it was never me gereint replied it was the sword he raised the blade and regarded it with awe caledvwlch spoke and i obeyed if you had not obeyed when you did bors declared i am certain we would all be drawing breath in the otherworld right now we fell silent then each to his own thoughts i closed my eyes and breathed a prayer of thanks that we had survived our ordeal while i was yet praying a gurgling sound reached my ears like that of a cauldron left too long on the hearth it seemed to be coming from the corpses on the ground i turned in the direction of the sound and saw that the dead were decomposing and this with such rapidity that their bodies seemed to crumple inwardly melting into one another congealing into a lumpen ooze that bubbled and spurted with escaping fumes as we stared at the horrific sight a stench like that of rotting entrails rose from this swiftly liquefying coagulation all around the clearing the corpse heaps were dissolving into a stinking mass as oncefirm flesh turned into a sighing quivering mass amidst the muck i could see long pale bones protruding here a slender leg bone there the twinned lengths of an arm or the swept curves of a rib cage and all of them sinking into miry dissolution the vapours gurgling from the vile quagmire hung in the air giving off a faint noxious glow the air was so rank with the stink and belch of the putrid slurry i gagged and wretched vomiting bile onto the ground dragging my sleeve across my lips i tried to wipe the bad taste from my mouth to no avail i think i preferred them when they were trying to kill us bors said through clenched teeth retreating into the chapel we sank down upon the cool stones i lay there drawing clean air deep into my lungs grateful for the peaceful sanctuary of this holy place exhausted from our ordeal we rested then content to simply await whatever should befall us i slept and awakened some while later much refreshed the pain in my side had eased a great deal and i found i could move without difficulty leaving the others to their sleep i got up and went to the chapel door and looked out to find that the vile heaps of putrefaction had vanished i roused the others and we went out not a scrap of bone or a shred of clothing was anywhere to be seen gone too was any sign of the battle we had fought no splintered shafts or broken blades no dented helms or discarded shields nothing the ground was as smooth and untrammelled as we had first found it it is a wonder bors declared not so much as a footprint remains the holy ground has done its work i replied and was reminded of the grail maidens challenge think you the great king requires the aid of any mortal to accomplish his will is the lord of creation powerless to protect his treasures no the high king of heaven required nothing from us but obedience it was for us that his gifts were given his commands likewise what we did we did for our own welfare not his we had been commanded to guard the grail and it was to secure the boon of blessing that we obeyed thus we stood before the chapel weapons drawn and ready waiting listening but no sound greater than the wind whispering in the bare treetops met the ear i felt the first faint breath of a breeze on my face and bors said the wind is rising even as he spoke i felt a gust of cold air and the thorny hedge wall began to quiver as the sighing in the treetops became a moan of regret for the storm to come we stood before the chapel listening to the wind gather strength gusting in the treetops making the high boughs creak and groan far off i heard the keening howl of a storm wind sweeping towards us and i could feel the air growing steadily colder something was coming that despised all warmth and light and it advanced on the wings of a storm thirtynine morgaws is showing signs of weakness when i have established my reign i will teach her the true uses of power she must learn as i did how to harden her heart and bend all things to her will sympathy compassion mercy what are they but weakness by other names the queen of air and darkness is beyond weakness beyond frailty beyond all human imperfection morgaws will learn this or morgaws will die she denies she has made any mistakes and in the same breath informs me that llenlleawg has failed the grail has not been recovered and three of arthurs warriors have mounted a pitiful resistance it is of no consequence i tell her but she insists they have succeeded in finding the chapel and suspects they may have regained the grail all the better i say it saves us the trouble of finding it again the irish oaf will join his churlish master in the pit and the opposition will be crushed but morgaws complains that the resistance is very strong powerful enough at least to defeat the warriors i conjured for her forget swords and spears childrens playthings i taught you better than that morgaws i suckled you on venom and bile girl use it there are other ways i tell her other ways the end is decreed it will be i grow tired of waiting lam ready to ascend to my rightful throne finish it we should make a fire bors said trying to fend off the sensation of menace flowing out of the forest on the cold wind no one replied however and we slipped back into an anxious dreadfilled vigil the wind fretful and restless whined in the treetops and tore at the hedge wall foreboding swirled in the dead leaves at our feet and the long grass hissed and rippled like snakes across the clearing long frosty fingers of despair sought me i could feel them reaching reaching stretching out from the bleak heart of the forest to poison my spirit with their malignant touch how long must we endure i wondered will this torment never end i would die right gladly if only to be free of this ceaseless travail yes death death would be a welcome release the barrenness of the thought brought me to myself once more it was not my wish but that of the enemy seeking to unnerve me i glanced at gereint beside me and saw that his eyes were closed take heart brother i told him there is no solace in death we can endure this and we will he opened his eyes and looked at me how did you know what i was thinking because i have been thinking the same thing myself i replied but listen we are warriors of the summer realm and guardians of the grail i drank from the cup of christ i tasted the wine of his blood on my tongue and i was healed we all were and though the devil himself and all the demons of hell assail us i say we shall stand but whether we stand or fall our souls rest in the hollow of the swift sure hand and no power on earth can snatch us from his grasp bors grimfaced said nothing but tightened his grip on the weapon in his hand and gazed steadfastly into the onrushing night the darkness surged and roiled around us like a tempesttorn sea clouds blacker than that of the surrounding wood streamed around the chapel clearing rivers of darkness flowing rising on a flood tide of foreboding bleak and dire soon it seemed as if the entire forest was in motion the thorny hedge tossed this way and that as if gripped by monstrous hands intent on tearing it out gaps began appearing in the surrounding wall as the thicket gave way before the enemys approach meanwhile the cold wind clawed at us shivering freezing huddled against one another we stood our ground awaiting the enemys appearance they arrived all at once the wood seemed to convulse and the enemy warhost simply stepped out from the forest to the edge of the clearing line on line and rank upon rank of dark warriors encircled the chapel i tried to see the end of them but their numbers stretched back into the forest and were lost to the darkness whence they came at the foes abrupt appearance the fretful wind stilled lapsing suddenly into an eerie menacefraught calm a sickly yellow radiance like that of a foul false sunrise dawned over the chapel clearing the bruised light gave off a putrid glow which made everything seem filthy and lurid in this ghastly dawn the thronging multitude gathered moving among the trees like a noiseless flood the warhelms rising above the rims of their round shields looked like a great swath of rocky shore or a beach of rounded stones stretching as far as the eye could see the upright spear shafts in tight clusters of ten and twenty were like narrow plumes of sea grass rising ridge upon ridge there were so many god save us breathed bors gereint made the sign of the cross over himself and swallowed hard but said nothing why do they wait i wondered aloud they stood in silence but for the slight rustle of their clothing where they brushed against one another or the hollow clink of shield rims gently touching line on line and rank on rank they stood silent as the fog on the nightdark sea i studied the nearest faces more the dread for they were cold countenances each and every one longfeatured with flat noses and mouths which were little more than bloodless slits in their pale waxyfleshed faces the eyes staring back at me were large and black indeed the black filled the eye so that no white showed at all like the eyes of beasts and though the expressions remained impassive the eyes gazing at us across the grassy clearing were baleful and malevolent i could almost feel the coldhearted hatred burning across the short span between us like flames of a frozen fire one look in those unblinking eyes and i knew beyond all doubt that they wished us dead yes and more than dead they willed our annihilation we were to be completely and utterly destroyed and our souls obliterated yet they waited a malign and brooding mass beneath a gruesome yellow sky why do they just stand there gereint said his voice quivering with cold i think not fear perhaps their battlechief has not arrived bors suggested or maybe they await the command to attack come on muttered gereint let us finish it patience lad said bors life is short and death is long use what time you have left to make your peace god knows i am more than ready replied gereint evenly let it begin i say look there i said directing their attention to a disturbance in the rearward ranks in a moment it emerged that the warhost was dividing along a line back to front they are preparing to attack said bors flinging his cloak away from his arms in preparation i think their war leader has arrived i said he is taking his place at the forefront of his warhost the ranks continued parting until a wide way stood clear i could see several figures moving towards us along the opened course one of them taller than the others appeared to be advancing at the head of the others i watched him stride nearer and recognized the familiar gait i had seen it so often i would have known it far more readily than my own it is arthur said bors he is alive the pendragon came to the edge of the clearing and stood regarding us silently his clothes were ripped and torn as if he had been dragged through the wood by horses his face was lined with fatigue he looked haggard and old his right cheek was discoloured with an ugly bruise but he held himself erect head high arthur i shouted here join us the king made no reply but turned and stepped aside only then did i notice that his hands were bound with chains llenlleawg spear in hand advanced directly behind arthur with morgaws at his side i could also see myrddin and gwenhwyvar with rhys and peredur coming up behind llenlleawg their hands were chained also and they stood with their heads down their clothes too were ragged and bloodstained and they wore the look of warriors who knew the battle was lost and their lives were swiftly approaching a bloody wretched end at a nod from llenlleawg arthur turned once more to address us he called us by name and said you have fought well my friends but the battle is lost it is time to surrender is it really the pendragon whispered gereint uncertainly never declared bors the true arthur has never so much as breathed a word of surrender and never will raising a hand to his mouth bors shouted take your words of surrender to hell with you we are pendragons men sworn before god to guard the grail we will not stand down for anyone the pendragon humble and sorrowful appealed to him saying bors old friend do as i say you have pledged loyalty to me whether in victory or defeat it is time to end this battle in gods name arthur bors cried what have they done to you join us lord and fight them we will go down together ignoring this outburst the king continued calmly they have come for caledvwlch and the grail the fighting can stop but you must do as i say and bring the sword and cup bitterness and bleak desperation welled up inside me i had known defeat before but never like this never this this ignoble submission was not worthy of the pendragon i knew myrddin would have moved heaven and earth before giving in and even the least of the cymbrogi would have fought to the last dying breath rather than be party to such a shameful capitulation i stared across the clearing as across a great divide my king stood on one side and i on the other could i defy my king and continue the fight or must i obey him even to my shame and degradation see now one who has never served a true lord nor vowed loyalty through all things to the end of life cannot know what it is to behold that lord defeated by wicked enemies humiliated and disgraced those who know nothing of honour cannot comprehend the pain of dishonour i tell you the truth it is a pain worse than death and it does not end thus i stood staring at arthur his head bowed in defeat and the tears came to my eyes i could not stand the sight and i had to turn away the fighting can end the pendragon repeated his voice broken and weary bring the grail give it up bors face clenched like a fist and his refusal was anvil hard never he cried shaking with rage taking caledvwlch from gereint he flourished it shouting to get the grail you will have to pry this blade from my dead hands it might have been a trick of the light but i thought i saw the merest shadow of a smile flicker across arthurs face as he received bors reply turning towards morgaws he made a gesture with his hands as much as to say well i tried and llenlleawg prodded him aside into line with the butt of his spear the irish champion took hold of myrddin and dragged him forth but morgaws impatient with arthurs feeble efforts at persuasion stepped out from among the enemy warriors flamehaired features ablaze like a torch with hate and triumph and spite all mingled together in her wild expression she was both terrible and magnificent the flames of her passion had given her a fearful feral beauty like that of a ravening shewolf leaping to the kill or lightning striking from a stormfraught sky her smooth white brow fierce fiery hair streaming from her temples lips drawn back in a malevolent smile of rage and dominion she appeared a goddess of destruction the fearsome morrighan of the old tales could not have been more appalling in aspect and allure the cup give me the cup morgaws cried in a voice swollen with exultation long gone was the maid i had found wandering lost in the wood that day like everything else about her the mute innocent was a lie too i watched morgaws now and remembered our first meeting i had stepped from among the trees and there she was sitting on the ground her carefully gathered mushrooms scattered around her she had tripped and fallen spilling her harvest i helped her retrieve them as i recall peredur and tallaght were with me and we had simply stumbled upon her alone and lost ah no no it was not that way at all it was the song the song led us to her she had been singing and we heard it and followed and that was how it began had i not been so beguiled i might have stopped long enough to wonder how it was that a maid who could sing yet lacked the power of speech alas i was deceived like all the rest i hung my head and asked jesu to forgive my blindness as if in answer to my reproachful thoughts i heard again the song that i had heard that summer day in the wood glancing up i saw morgaws standing before me the song still fresh on her lips she smiled and i knew at once that i had judged her far too harshly do not think ill of me brave gwalchavad she said in a voice both soft and low she stepped closer i am just like you i too have suffered at morgians hands it was true i thought like all the rest of us she was caught in wicked morgians designs and like everyone else she had suffered for it a pang of genuine regret speared my heart and i opened my mouth to express my sorrow at her distress but morgaws prevented me say nothing she whispered placing her fingertips against my mouth it is over my love we can forget the pain and hardship and begin again we must make a new start and we can you do believe me gwalchavad we can show the others the doubters we can show them you and i she smiled again and the last particle of doubt melted away in the bright sun of her smile she looked at me and i saw nothing but love in her eyes come with me gwalchavad come away with me my love we can be together you and i together always oh i did believe her and i so wanted the travail to end in that moment i think i would have done anything she asked come bring me the grail my love you do not need to guard it anymore bring it to me and we can begin anew when i hesitated she urged me on saying i want you my love is the cup inside she glanced at the chapel expectantly go get it gwalchavad bring the cup to me hurry then we can leave this place forever i heard bors raise a protest behind me but i could not hear what he said it did not matter morgaws beautiful and yielding stood before me and desire was in her eyes come to me my love she said extending her hands to embrace me i looked at those long lovely arms so fine and shapely and inviting and lust leapt like a flame within me i looked at her rounded hips and breasts and i wanted her i ached to hold her in my arms and to take her in that instant the watching world disappeared the enemy host with its rank on rank of balefuleyed warriors my friends and comrades the chapel and surrounding forest everything vanished in the white heat of my ardour and was instantly forgotten it was as if a dull thick fog descended over the world blotting out everything but morgaws and my aching need nothing else existed nothing else mattered only morgaws and i remained only we two a man and a woman one look at the hunger burning in her eyes and i knew she wanted me as much as i wanted her come to me my love take me lie with me make love to me i want you gwalchavad come to me i stepped nearer my breath coming in raking gasps desire making me weak i could feel the last restraining cords of will dissolving morgaws smiled knowingly her lips parted as she put her head back to allow me to kiss her throat at the same time she opened her robe so that i could admire her body i saw the white white skin and her gently rounded thighs and rosetipped breasts i saw the welcome in her eyes and the temptation of those halfparted lips and wanted so much to taste the sweetness there gwalchavad she said closing the distance between us with a swaying step take me her voice was husky with longing and she moaned with pleasure as she pressed her body against mine i felt her hands on mine pulling me nearer the grail my love she whispered her breath hot in my ear give me the grail and i am yours jesu save me i turned and started towards the chapel intent on fetching the grail and yielding it up to her but as i turned the gleam of gold caught my eye caledvwlch clutched tight in bors fist and i heard again the grail maidens admonition to cling to the sword of salvation i heard her solemn warning lusting after honour he was bewitched by one who honours only lust and lies thus are the mighty undone bring me the cup morgaws said subtle insistence rising in her voice she stepped nearer give it me and i will be yours my love forever no i said and the sound of my voice was harsh in my ears i am sworn to guard the cup the grail morgaws moaned rubbing her body against mine i am yours gwalchavad take me now i felt her touch hot on my skin as she raised my hand to her mouth i want you she whispered bending her head towards my hand i saw her lips draw away from her fine white teeth as she prepared to bite i jerked my hand away as if from a serpent this angered her gwalchavad she said sternly you will give me the cup confusion assaulted me morgaws voice boomed inside my head urgent and insistent the grail give me the grail no i said shaken confused maggot morgaws advanced her presence overpowering i killed all the rest and i will kill you too for the last time bring me the cup no i said forcing strength into my voice i will not she turned on her heel and moved to where llenlleawg stood spear in hand watching the proceedings with a hostile eye they have the grail my darling she said her voice softly cozening once more kill them and it is ours we can rule forever you and i llenlleawgs gaze shifted from me to morgaws i saw him glance down the length of her body and an expression of loathing appeared on his face you said you loved me he rasped in a voice so tight he could hardly force out the words the grail she whispered moving closer they have the cup my love kill them and it will be ours llenlleawgs jaw tensed and he turned his face once more towards me morgaws lifted her hand to his cheek and put her face close to his she whispered something to him and pressed herself against him i saw llenlleawgs free hand come around behind her to gather her into his embrace as her lips parted in a kiss llenlleawgs hand moved up from her waist to her shoulders and was lost in the snaking tresses of her hair morgaws kissed llenlleawg again and still clinging to him turned her face towards me her expression haughty exulting in triumph kill them my lo she began but never finished for suddenly her head snapped back sharply she made to cry out but llenlleawg tightened his grip on her hair and pulled her head back still further the scream stuck in her throat her eyes bulged in terror as llenlleawg put his lips to her pale cheek farewell my love he growled then jerked her head sharply back and to the side the bones of her slender neck snapped with a meaty crack and morgaws fell dead to the ground the next thing i heard was a queer hushed clatter in the same instant the entrancing fog vanished from my head and i raised my gaze from morgaws corpse to see a thousand spears swinging level then dread morgians dark minions attacked forty cut me free cried arthur struggling to his feet i staggered towards him amazed that i could move again hurry gwalchavad behind him i glimpsed morgians massed battlehost surging to the attack there was no shout of command no battle cry one moment they were standing at the ready and the next they were in motion swarming down upon us gwalchavad cried the pendragon holding out his chained hands for the love of god man cut me free i was beside him in an instant raising the sword i took careful aim and brought the blade down sharply the blow made not the slightest mark on the chain i tried again and yet once more with no greater success than before and then the enemy was upon us turning to meet the attack i put myself between the king and the onrushing foe and shouted for the others to join me bors gereint out of the corner of my eye i glimpsed bors as he raced to take his place at my right hand expecting gereint on my left i turned and when i did not see him i shouted for him he did not answer gereint i cried again here i am i heard his voice behind me as he dashed for his place on my left he came up with me but did not stop instead he raced on ahead i saw a flash of gold in his hands as he blew past he has the grail bors shouted gereint holding the blessed cup between his hands ran to meet the foe alone lofting the sacred bowl he cried in the name of christ jesu he shouted be gone confusion descended upon the onrushing host the foremost ranks halted ia midstep and fell back those behind kept coming trampling the leaders underfoot before they could halt themselves the young warrior defiant and unafraid stood in the midst of the chaos in the name of the father god the blessed son and the holy spirit gereint shouted again i command you to leave this place return to hell all at once there arose the sound of a thousand wings taking flight and the enemy host flew they appeared to shrivel and diminish wrinkling and shrinking like the flesh of rotten fruit in the sun even as we stood looking on they became no more than husks of grain brittle and dry and though there was no wind they appeared to rise up into the air as if scattering and dispersing before a mighty gale the power that had called them and sustained them was broken and now they fled away from the realm of light and life and back to the nameless pit from which they had been summoned spinning and tumbling into the void the last of them disappeared and they were no more a great peal of thunder broke over us and i looked up to see the leaden vault of the sky crack open and a single shaft of light stabbed down into the gloom of the forest like a spear thrown from on high the beam struck the chapel transforming the stone to silver dazzling our lightstarved eyes in the same moment a scream pierced the air high above us a wounded cry dying away even as it was born myrddin lifted his head at the sound and said morgian is defeated his voice sounded tired and old but the light in his eye was undimmed we have driven her back to her darksome lair and god willing she will not trouble us again for a very long time the thunder cracked once more and i felt something wet on my face it is raining someone shouted and as the word was uttered the heavens opened and down poured the precious water the blessed rain fell from the sky striking down through the empty air to bathe the longparched earth we raised our faces to the glorious water and drank it down the chains called gwenhwyvar holding up her hands i am free myrddin and arthur held out their hands and rhys and peredur as with gwenhwyvar wherever the rain touched the links the chains parted and the pieces fell to the ground the shattered links melting like ice standing in the rain beneath that low leaden sky i looked around and understood that we alone had survived of all the multitude only we were left arthur and gwenhwyvar bors gereint peredur rhys myrddin and me and alas llenlleawg dazed and bewildered we all gazed at one another trying to comprehend our miraculous survival arthur moved to where bors and gereint and i stood falling to one knee he put caledvwlch point downward on the ground and held the bare blade in both hands then as if swearing a solemn oath upon the holy cross he said most noble friends i owe you my kingdom and my life no king was ever served by more loyal and honourable men and no king was ever more aware of his failing i beg your forgiveness and offer my pledge as i would offer it to jesu himself that i will never forget the debt of gratitude and honour that i and all britain owe you bors touched by the kings words rushed forward and embraced him saying rise arthur rise you owe me nothing and there is nothing to forgive i did only what i have ever done in your service gereint shamed at the sight of his king kneeling to him bent his head nervously and looked away i stepped forward and prostrated myself before arthur lord pendragon i said it is i who must beg your forgiveness it is through my weakness that this evil has befallen us arthur stood reached down and raised me to my feet where is the fault you have remained steadfast through all things what lord could ask more so we stood together my king and i the rain falling over us gwenhwyvar rhys and peredur joined us and in delight and eagerness everyone began talking at once god love you bear but it is earth and sky to be with you again bors said his grin wide and handsome i thought i would never see any of you again it was exactly what bedwyr would have said and grief awakened at the words lord i said turning to arthur i fear the answer but i must know what happened to the rest of the cymbrogi i never saw any of them after the fire replied arthur sadly we all became separated in the forest i fear they are dead rhys myrddin and i somehow stayed together i thought we were the only ones left until we saw you he then told us how they were ambushed in the darkness while they slept llenlleawg leading a host of the foe delivered them to morgaws with whom they found gwenhwyvar and peredur bound and waiting there was nothing we could do arthur said you saw how many warriors she commanded we fought but were overwhelmed from the start we then told arthur how it was with us how we had come upon the chapel and had cleaned away the defiling filth we told how the grail maiden had appeared and returned the holy cup how we had found caledvwlch in the well and fended off each attack made on the chapel you have done well myrddin declared heaven has blessed your efforts your reward is assured lifting a hand to the chapel he said come let us thank god for the victory he has given us you are right to remind us of the source of our salvation replied arthur but say not that we have won a victory this day rather say that god in his mercy has cut short the tribulation and spared our lives the wise emrys motioned to gereint who bearing the most holy grail entered the chapel we followed silently each wrapped in his separate thoughts to join the young warrior at the altar he had replaced the cup and it sat on the stone glimmering softly in the light of its own gentle radiance the king gazed long upon the cup then bowed his head and wept for his lost cymbrogi in this he was not alone i too gave myself over to my grief for the dead as did we all after a time myrddin stirred and in his clear strong voice began singing a lament for the dead he sang the last returning a fine and fitting song for a warrior who has fallen in the fight and will not be going home with his king then the wise emrys led us in prayers of thanksgiving for our deliverance our voices filled the chapel and our hearts lifted under the benison of myrddins comforting words holding fear at bay for so long is a wearisome labour and i felt my spirit ease as the prayers did their work i cannot say how long we stayed in the chapel but when i rose at last a massive weight had fallen from my shoulders myrddin was attracted to the carvings on the walls while the others talked in low voices at the altar i joined him to ask what he made of the strange markings do they speak to you i asked they do the bard of britain ran his strong hands across the etched designs as a mother might trace her fingers over the sleeping face of her muchloved child entranced he walked the walls and embraced the messages in silent wonder make no mistake gwalchavad he said turning to me at last llyonesse was not always the wasteland it is now and it will be redeemed one day llyonesse will prove a boon of great blessing to all britain the others joined us then and the king awed by the chapel remarked on the mystery of the place to think he mused this chapel has been here here in this blighted realm from the beginning the beginning said myrddin know you the beginning was long long ago and yet the chapel remains bors pointed out it was not destroyed yes the chapel remains agreed the wise emrys let all who love the truth think on that and engrave it on their hearts turning abruptly he stepped before the altar and while we all stood watching took the edge of his cloak between his hands and tore off a portion then bowing in reverence to the cup he carefully covered the grail with the cloth this done he took up the cup and addressed us the holy cup of christ has been reclaimed it is time to make our way back to ynys avallach cradling the cup myrddin stepped from the altar we emerged from the chapel into a cold grey dawn the vile yellow had washed from the clouds and the rain pattered steadily around us we stood for a moment looking into the sky as the healing rain streamed down our faces water dripped from the branches of the trees all around filling the air with the woodland scent of wet bark and leaf mould even in the pale dawnlight i could see further into the wood than before darkness had loosed its hold on the land and shadows no longer reigned in this place morgaws body lay where she had fallen eyes wide in the shock of her undoing llenlleawg sat a little apart his back to her his head low rain beating down on him arthur calm and resolute strode to where llenlleawg sat and stood for a moment looking down at his fallen champion get up he commanded after a moment llenlleawg did not so much as raise his head summoning peredur and gereint the king indicated that they should raise the irishman between them the two pulled llenlleawg to his feet and remained beside him more to support him than to prevent him from escaping llenlleawg stood before the king as if he no longer possessed the use of his limbs or perhaps lacked the will to stand and did so only by happenchance head bowed shoulders slumped abject in every line and ligament he swayed slightly on his feet remorse dripped from him like the rain which spattered upon his head and trickled from his sodden hair in rivulets dribbling off his downcast face guilt pressed full on him and he bent under the terrible weight arthur gazed upon his former champion and friend i could see the conflict warring in the kings features his mouth frowned with repugnance and distaste even while his eyes soft with sorrow searched for some redeeming sign do you know what your betrayal has wrought asked the king at last his voice tight almost breaking llenlleawg gave not the slightest indication that he had heard so arthur repeated the question still llenlleawg made no answer i take your silence to mean that you own the consequence of your deeds said the king do you have anything to say in your defense unable to bring himself to look upon the lord he had betrayed llenlleawg did not raise his eyes but muttered something in a voice so low i could not hear it gwenhwyvar stepping close said something to him and the irishman glancing quickly from under his brow breathed a quiet reply before lowering his head once more gwenhwyvar grave and sorrowful relayed his words to the king her eyes never left her kinsman as she said he offers no defense but begs his lord for the judgment due his crimes he wishes to be killed now and his body left to the birds and beasts so be it arthur concluded by reason of your treachery i condemn you to the death you ordained for your swordbrothers with that he took caledvwlch in both hands and raised the blade arthur no called gwenhwyvar she stepped boldly between her kinsman and the kings upraised sword do not kill him step aside woman the king said justice will be served gwenhwyvar flared at this drawing herself up full height green eyes ablaze with righteous anger she glared at her husband turning to myrddin she demanded am i not a queen am i not both daughter to and wife of a king you are myrddin replied facing arthur once more she said as queen of britain i claim my right to intercede for this mans life he has betrayed his lord slain men who were under his command and aided an enemy who schemed to destroy us all arthur replied firmly do you deny that he has done these things i do not replied gwenhwyvar smoothly neither do i deny that any one of these crimes is worthy of death then step aside said arthur i will not my lord i speak on behalf of my champion your champion he saved our lives when awakened to the knowledge of his error and morgaws wickedness he roused himself to our defense and killed the true traitor if not for him the pendragon countered returning his queens defiant stare such defense would not have been necessary he knows his crime and accepts his punishment then punish him by all means gwenhwyvar replied scornfully but know you this hear me all of you she turned and included the rest of us in her appeal llenlleawg was bewitched and he was beguiled his will was weak and he chose to follow that temptress yes but we were all of us deceived by morgaws and we all took part in her schemes arthur lowered his arms and rested the sword all men are responsible for their actions he maintained stolidly some gave in to evil and allowed it to overtake them others did not i do not make him answerable for the evil but only for his failure to resist it for this failure i do condemn him queen gwenhwyvar folded her arms upon her breast and gazed imperiously at the men around her it seems to me you condemn him not for his failure but for his weakness what is more it is a weakness all men share tell me now she demanded exquisite in her wrath who among you has never experienced a moments weakness at the sight of a beautiful woman when no one answered she searched the circle of faces and called us by name gwalchavad bors peredur if morgaws had fastened on you could you have resisted rhys myrddin how long before you would have given in look into your hearts all of you and tell me that you would not have weakened if you were in llenlleawgs place if you had been the prey the huntress stalked would you have escaped unscathed i cannot speak for the others but i was only too painfully aware how very close i had come to giving in to morgaws seduction i knew full well how weak i was and i had not experienced even the smallest part of what she had directed at llenlleawg he succumbed and others did not arthur maintained do you think i take pleasure in this judgment lady i do not but justice must be done is there no place for mercy in your justice great king gwenhwyvar stepped close and put her hands over the kings hands as they rested on the sword please arthur she said softly pleading for her kinsmans life we have all been bewitched in one way or another let us not presume to judge llenlleawg more harshly than we judge ourselves the pendragon looked to his wise counsellor for advice and we all turned to see what myrddin would say the emrys joined gwenhwyvar taking his place between arthur and llenlleawg god knows death is justified nine times over for his crimes he said punishment is your right and justice demands it but there is much we do not yet know of morgians insidious designs therefore i beg you to withhold judgment until we have penetrated the dark heart of this lamentable affair the pendragon regarded his wife and his counsellor for a long time contemplating what he should do we all waited on his decision at last he said very well let it be as you say i will make no judgment until our understanding is complete he made a motion with his hand now step aside gwenhwyvar and myrddin moved aside and took their places with the rest of us looking on the king gazed upon his friend sadly and said hear me llenlleawg from this day you are no longer my champion and your name will never again be spoken in my presence further you will go with us to caer melyn where you will be put on a ship and exiled to lerna where your crime will be known to your people there you will stay until i make my final judgment having delivered his decree arthur considered the abject warrior do you understand a warrior myself i understood only too well it occurred to me that llenlleawg might rather have parted with his head than with his lord and swordbrothers in ireland he would be an outcast among his own people a disgrace to them and to himself llenlleawgs honour whatever might be left of it could not long endure and then what would become of him the irish champion nodded slowly how long must i wait your decision he asked and oh the defeat in his voice cut me to the heart but arthur was not moved god alone knows he replied then added seek him perhaps he will show you the way to your salvation so saying the king turned on his heel leaving his former champion standing lonely and forlorn bereft of dignity and friendship yes but not i think without hope of redemption however remote we followed the king from the chapel yard gwenhwyvar waited until arthur had reached the perimeter of the clearing then offered a hasty word of farewell to her kinsman she pressed his hand and after a last sorrowful look hurried after the king peredur at arthurs nod resumed the duty of guarding the prisoner and led him away with few weapons and no provisions to carry we could travel lightly if hungrily until we reached the nearest habitation where we could get food and as we did not know when we might get good water again we all took a long drink from the holy well before setting off i was the last to drink and after a final lingering look at the grail chapel i turned away and hurried to join my friends fortyone thus we began our journey walking in silent file behind myrddin along the rainwet trail we had not travelled far however when the sun burst through the clouds and sent dazzling bright spears of light striking through the trees it had been so long since i had seen the sun i stopped in my tracks and turned my face to the glorious light as if to drink it deep into my soul a winter sun but no less welcome for that i felt its warmth bathe my features and thanked the lord who made me that i yet roamed the world of the living we continued on and it was not long before i noticed a very strange thing all around me the woodland was steaming as the sunlight penetrated the wet trees and ground now that in itself is not remarkable but as the misty vapours rose and curled in the sunstruck air the forest itself seemed to be dissipating fading away with the mist as if the very trees themselves were nothing more than a night fog which vanishes when touched by the light of day the forest was thinning and receding before my eyes we all stopped and gaped at this wondrous sight and when we turned once more to the path the woodland had grown thin and the way stretched wide before us we moved on and quickly paired with one another arthur and gwenhwyvar walked together heads bent near in close discussion bors began questioning rhys about what had happened after the cymbrogi became separated in the forest peredur dutifully followed a half step behind his prisoner who lumbered forward with head and shoulders bent i found myself walking beside gereint amiable enough in his silence but i had questions that needed answers he could not supply i saw that myrddin walked alone at the head of the party and decided to join him here now i told gereint let us hear what myrddin has to say about all that has taken place adjusting our pace we soon fell into step beside the wise emrys how long must llenlleawg remain in exile i said asking the first question that came to mind until the penance for his crimes has been fulfilled the wise emrys declared then added in a gentler tone god alone knows how long that may be but i believe that either he will die there or arthur will one day welcome his champion back into his service to think it could happen to the likes of llenlleawg i mused i wonder why morgaws chose him to aid her treachery myrddin gave me a sideways glance she deceived us all gwenhwyvar spoke the truth morgaws bewitched and beguiled every last one of us we were all deceived of course but only llenlleawg sided with her and carried out her purposes why wonder at that great light only by gods good grace do any of us stand or fall i think it praiseworthy so many resisted he was silent for a moment meditating on this when he spoke again he said but you see how it is even though she could deceive us she could not overwhelm us her powers were not of that kind she could seduce but she could not subdue and that is the way of it again i confessed i did not understand so myrddin explained the enemys powers are far less than we imagine the evil one cannot overwhelm us by force indeed he can use against us only the weapons we give him i allowed that this might be so but it did seem that morgaws had no trouble getting whatever she wanted did she not demanded myrddin see here morgaws wanted the grail and she wanted arthurs sword for all her vaunted powers she could not get these simple things for herself no she required someone else and even then she could not keep them despite her skills and schemes she could not meet us facetoface but required one of our own who could be turned to her purposes myrddin sighed alas it was llenlleawg who succumbed i still do not understand why he did it gereint put in betraying the king he subsided shaking his head as if it were a thing that would remain forever beyond his comprehension evil ever chooses the weak and willing myrddin replied but i think it was really gwalchavad she wanted me he startled me with this unexpected announcement you were the first to find morgaws he stated simply you are lots son after all and morgian knows you it would have served her purposes well to bend you to her will the thought made me uneasy then morgian was behind it after all i asked myrddin pondered this before he answered i believe morgaws was morgians creature from the beginning and acted on morgians command he said then in a voice heavy with regret added would that discernment had come to me sooner how much suffering might have been saved the waste the sad sad waste what will she do now we have removed yet another weapon from the fight he answered i have no idea what she will do now but i think it prudent to assume we have not seen the last of dread morgian the threat implicit in this statement hung over me for a long time i fell silent thinking about the things myrddin had said and was roused some while later when gereint suddenly cried out riders approaching the shout startled me like a slap in the face deeply immersed in my reverie i had not been attending to what was happening around me i looked up to see that the forest had completely disappeared every tree root branch and twig had vanished with the mist there was nothing of the forest to be seen anywhere and we were once more in the lowhilled barrens of the blighted land i had no time to marvel at this for myrddin and gereint stood a few paces ahead of me and beyond them some small distance away a mounted warhost was advancing swiftly arthur with gwenhwyvar beside him joined us quickly and bors and rhys pushed in as well we stood there in a tight knot as nearer and nearer they came soon i heard the dull rumble of the horses hooves on the ground and i scanned the onrushing ranks quickly and determined that there must be close to fifty riders too many to fight if it came to that maybe they are some of cadors kinsmen speculated rhys shading his eyes with his hand before anyone could reply to this arthur loosed a wild whoop and started running to meet the riders arthur shouted gwenhwyvar she darted forward a few paces halted and called back to us over her shoulder they are not cadors men it is cador himself and cai and bedwyr and all the rest proclaimed myrddin a great exuberant grin spreading across his face they are alive it was true by some miracle known only to god himself they lived within moments we were surrounded by the very kinsmen and swordbrothers we had committed to a fiery grave in the forest alive again they were all alive words alone cannot tell how startling and rapturous was that miraculous reunion my heart soared like an eagle as i ran to greet them cai bedwyr i cried rushing to embrace them as they slid from their saddles cador you are alive praise god you are that was all i managed to get out before the tears came i am not ashamed to say that i stood before my friends and wept i cried the happy tears of one who has had his fondest wish answered before he could even articulate the longing for their part the lost cymbrogi regarded us with bewildered amusement they stood shifting awkwardly from one foot to the other while we tried to express our immense relief at their unanticipated resurrection we all talked at once and tangled over one another and succeeded only in making the thing more obscure for all our explanation what do you imagine happened to us asked bedwyr eyeing us with bemused curiosity brother announced bors we thought you dead why should you think that wondered cai squinting in amazement we saw your bodies rhys exclaimed exasperation making him blunt back there in the forest he gestured vaguely behind him to the low barren hills truly said arthur his handsome face alight with the allsurpassing pleasure of seeing his friends once more we saw your corpses hung up in a tree like the carcasses of deer after a hunt indeed we burned the tree so that you should not be dishonoured in death bedwyr shook his head and looked to his companions who merely shrugged and allowed that some dark mystery had clouded events which was only to be expected after all after you entered the forest bedwyr told us we lost sight of you the fog came down and the fog echoed arthur softly i had forgotten about the fog when we could no longer find the path we made camp and waited until the daylight to resume the search you have been searching all this time asked rhys aye affirmed cai since first light this morning how can that be bors blurted it is at least seven days since we last saw you seven if one agreed gereint then added uncertainly though we had no sun to go by still it seemed a long time you make it more than it is replied arthur confidently indeed it could be no more than three days by my reckoning though it is true the sun did not show itself the while three days and nights together at least gwenhwyvar confirmed cador shaking his head solemnly said however that may be i assure you all only one night has passed and that quickly we rode out to find you as soon as we had light enough to see the trail it is but one night since we left you cai maintained doggedly but can you imagine our surprise when we could not find the wood we left just the night before well it could not be denied that the wood had disappeared cai suggested that perhaps the same enchantment which had shown us the corpses of our friends had somehow stretched one night to seven for those who had entered that bewitched domain we then speculated on how this could be accomplished myrddin growing impatient with our ignorant babble put a stop to it drawing himself up he said you speak where you should be silent heaven is not the only eternity hell is eternal too if more explanation is required let us simply say all that passed in the forest was like the forest itself wrought of sorcery yet by the great lights grace we have endured the worst the enemy could devise and we have prevailed the summer realm is saved and the most holy grail is restored he straightened himself and turned his face once more towards the trail saying look your last on the wasteland my friends llyonesse is no more he paused and as if gazing beyond the veil of years added ah but what was once will be again hear me when the thamesis reverses its flow and the sea gives up that which has been given to its keeping the world will marvel at the glory that is llyonesse so saying he put his feet once more to the path and without a backward glance began striding towards ynys avallach arthur and gwenhwyvar walked beside him refusing the mounts offered them by bedwyr and the others however i did as i was bade and stood for a moment to look upon the wasteland one last time then i turned and followed the pendragon and his wise emrys back to the land of the living where the summer realm was waiting for its king see now more seasons have passed than i care to count i see the land blossoming with peace and plenty under arthur pendragons reign as under the warmth of a bright summer sun to be sure the drought and plague persisted into the following year giving way only slowly and grudgingly they continue to bring painful memories to all who survived them and we will be a long time restoring the damage as always there is so much to do and in the doing there is blessed forgetting most of those who followed arthur into llyonesse do not willingly talk about what happened and very few outside the dragon flight have heard what took place during that long snowless winter britain will never know how close she came to destruction yet it seems that not a day passes but i find some reminder of the terrors we endured it is often that i have sat alone at days end gazing into the dying light and contemplating all that took place during those strange confusing days it still seems a dream to me in many ways i see her face before me and i feel her breath hot on my neck my passion stirs within me and i wonder would i have given in if it happened again would i be able to hold out i would like to say that it could never happen that i would remain steadfast and strong in truth i cannot say i would not fall therefore i pray god i will never be tested beyond my endurance the queen of air and darkness was the power behind morgaws actions of that i am certain some have said and some believe that morgaws was simply morgian in a different guise the wise emrys never believed this however and after long contemplation i fear he is right morgaws was not morgian much as i might wish otherwise who then was she the power of evil is another mystery to me how was it we believed those endless deceptions why did it assume such mastery over us bishop elfodd whose advice i have sought on this matter more than once believes that the power of any evil great or small it makes no difference derives not from its own strength much as some profess and many believe no in order for it to succeed the bishop explained one day in the spring following our return evil must first remove the preserving goodness of the thing it would destroy for the truth is that even the smallest good is more powerful than the greatest evil all appearances to the contrary i added wryly oh yes he exclaimed growing excited appearances are always to the contrary always much of morgaws power lay in her ability to make herself appear something very different from what she was it is the evil ones oldest deception and we are no less vulnerable to it than we ever were he shook his head sadly yes and it is also the one deception that must be preserved at all costs for once mortals truly understand what a weak and contemptible thing evil really is the ancient enemys destruction is assured i did not fully believe elfodd when he said that but as i have puzzled over the thing i am persuaded he may be right it would explain why morgaws stole the grail and desecrated the chapel that is to say she made llenlleawg do it because i think she could neither possess nor command the objects she so desired llenlleawg also threw caledvwlch into the well perhaps because even at his most depraved and hopeless he could not bring himself to wield that weapon against his king so it was that by cleansing the altar bors gereint and i however unwittingly prepared the way for the grail maiden to reconsecrate them though we did not know it at the time we helped return a mighty weapon to the battle what to say of llenlleawg myrddin and arthur remain adamant that all men must answer for their actions bishop elfodd too is of the opinion that the former champion must be punished for his sins remember the good bishop has said we are not required to defeat evil but only to stand against it that is enough the outcome remains with god it is his battle after all however we are required to refrain from actively helping the enemy and llenlleawg helped the enemy greatly that he did no one denies it llenlleawg exiled and outcast is paying the price for his treason now but i know how easy it is to slip to fall to be overtaken by a will greater than your own perhaps alone of all the rest i understand llenlleawg best because i too stood near the flame and was very nearly singed we were all deceived as gwenhwyvar said and it is true moreover i believe that deception began long before we knew it i long considered i was the first to set eyes on morgaws however now i am persuaded that rhys met her before i did that day he went out to look for water he has no recollection of it at all he remembers neither leaving nor returning to camp nor the bite on his arm but i remember and i think he met morgaws by that pool surprised her perhaps or maybe she tried her seductions on him and failed she tried me next but found an easier victim in llenlleawg who can say so much of morgaws like the deaths of the cymbrogi was illusion after all be that as it may the pendragon is quick to point out when asked the fact that their deaths were an illusion does not lessen llenlleawgs treachery let us never forget eight brave warriors died defending the grail shrine that night and fifteen pilgrims were slain he is right to remember of course those deaths are lamentable still the fact that the cymbrogi were not slaughtered has gone a long way towards softening arthurs heart where his former champion is concerned at least the king no longer speaks of taking llenlleawgs life in expiation of his crimes therefore i will continue to hold out the hope that one day soon a way will be found to redeem the irishman and allow him to take his place in the kings service once more who knows after that night in the forest i never again expected to see bedwyr cai and cador drawing breath in this world but here i drink ale with them every night as if nothing had ever happened so who is to say what miracles may occur in the meantime life goes on there is caer lial to rebuild and that work takes up most of our time the old city of the legions in the north is home once again to britains defenders upon our return to ynys avallach arthur understood that the grail shrine was a mistake and that the grail most precious and holy treasure must be guarded with more subtlety and greater vigilance therefore the high king returned it to its first and foremost guardian avallach now keeps it and that is only right but the grail is known now and will continue to draw the attention of anyone who hears about it thus the pendragon has determined that the grail should be removed to a place of greater safety together arthur and avallach are making plans for a new stronghold somewhere in the north far away from llyonesse arthur never held a great love for the south in any event a northerner myself i know he finds the southern hills too close and the wooded valleys too cramped it makes him uneasy when he cannot look out across the wide and empty hilltops and see the distant horizon and caer lial though long abandoned yet possesses strong walls and enough rubble stone for restoring many of the buildings thus we have come north where my tale began and where it now ends i have set the thing down in the best way i know make of it what you will see now i lay down my sharpened reed and i will not take it up again tomorrow when i arise i will be a scribe no more i mean to take my place beside the pendragon and god willing there shall i remain until the end of my days
